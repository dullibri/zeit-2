HEADLINE: Manila Gets Tough on U.S. Bases

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, May 15

 BODY:
The Philippine Government formally told the United States today that the 1947 agreement allowing American military bases here would not be extended when it expires in September 1991. The step was largely symbolic, and both Philippine and American officials said a new treaty could still be negotiated.
But in serving the notice, the Philippine Government indicated that it is assuming a tough negotiating stance in an effort both to bolster its bargaining power and to respond to heightened nationalist feelings here. Philippine nationalists say the current bases agreement is an extension of the ''colonial relationship'' with the United States; many other Filipinos support the bases because they pump an estimated $1 billion into the economy every year. 
Rafael Alunan, the spokesman for Philippine panel holding talks with American officials on the future of the bases, said ending the accord meant that the Government intended to ''uphold the dignity and sovereignty of the Philippines.''
On Sunday, the day before the exploratory talks opened here, two American servicemen were shot and killed outside Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila. Today Communist guerrillas claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement sent to news agencies.
 
Threat of More Attacks
The New People's Army central Luzon command said that it ''punished'' the two American airmen -John H. Raven, 19 years old, of Delta Junction, Alaska, and James C. Green, 20, of Craig, Colo. - because of United States ''aggression and intervention in the internal affairs of our country.'' It warned of more attacks until ''all U.S. bases and all American occupation soldiers are kicked out of the country.'' [The police in Manila arrested about 50 people after they staged a motorcade to demand that the bases be closed, The Associated Press reported.] On the second day of the talks on the bases, the Philippine Foreign Minister, Raul S. Manglapus, gave the termination notice to the chief United States negotiator, Richard L. Armitage. The Philippines is host to two huge, strategically important American bases, Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station, and four smaller installations.
Reacting to the termination notice, Stanley Schrager, the spokesman for the American negotiating panel, said that ''the sky is not falling down'' and that the serving of the notice ''does not preclude a new agreement.''
Philippine officials say that any new bases accord would have to be under terms substantially different than those in the current agreement. They have suggested ''joint use'' of the bases by Philippine and American forces. The current treaty allows the United States ''unhampered use'' of the bases.

HEADLINE: Is Botswana a Model for Democracies in Africa?

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GABORONE, Botswana

 BODY:
In the African context, an unusual event occurred in Botswana last October: national elections were held among eight competing political parties. When some of the results were disputed, the judiciary, not the politicians, interceded.
Multiparty elections, held every five years since Botswana won its independence from Britain 24 years ago, have earned it applause for being one of a handful of democracies on the African continent.
Now, as the leaders of Africa are pressed to take a cue from Eastern Europe and open up their political systems, Botswana, a Texas-size nation of only 1.3 million people on the northern doorstep of South Africa, is held up as a possible model. 
The enthusiasm for Botswana's political system has been led by the World Bank and the United States. Both cite Botswana's extraordinary economic growth rate during the post-independence period, when most of Africa got poorer, as a product not only of its diamond deposits but its democratic politics and its capitalist economic policies. They said the growth in per capita income averaged 8.8 percent for the 20 years after independence. How Much of a Model? To an outsider arriving at this capital's airport, the contrast with much of sub-Saharan Africa is remarkable. Rifle-carrying soldiers are absent and the usual detailed currency declaration forms, routine in countries with shortages of foreign exchange and flourishing black markets, are nonexistent.
Botswana's democracy appears to be firmly rooted. The first President, Sir Seretse Khama, was a former tribal chief who in 1948 shocked his tribe and scandalized the British colonialists by marrying a British woman. The British, under pressure from South Africa, banished the couple from its protectorate, Bechuanaland, later Botswana.
Sir Seretse - the British made up to him for the banishment with a knighthood - was appalled at the apartheid policies adopted in South Africa in the 1950's. He was determined when he returned from exile to establish an independent nation with democratic institutions that would stand in stark to contrast to South Africa. As it turned out, educated people in Botswana and others now remark on how they stand in contrast to much of black Africa.
But some African scholars, including some in Botswana, are asking how much of a multiparty state Botswana really is and, given its small population and relative tribal unity - 95 percent of its people are of the Tswana ethnic group - how much of a model it can be for larger, more diverse countries. The argument in favor of one-party states in Africa often revolves around the single party being a unifying force for discordant and competitive tribes.
 
Tolerance for Dissent
''We have a weakling but existing multiparty state,'' said Patrick Mulotsi, a lecturer in sociology at the University of Botswana and a co-director of the Democracy Project, a group of academics that analyses the political processes in Botswana. ''If you look at the prerequisites of liberal democracy, the rule of law has been highly respected. A lot of people can say a lot of things with relatively little fear. There has been a lot of response by the ruling party to debates with the opposition.''
That being said, Mr. Mulotsi and others point out that the governing party, the Botswana Democratic Party, has dominated the country's politics since independence. The major opposition party, the left-of-center Botswana National Front, has failed to ever win more than 6 seats in the 34-seat Parliament. In the last election, the party won only 3, although for the first time it contested every seat.
''The fact that the opposition is represented by three seats in Parliament is not a test of the strength of the democracy but the strength of the opposition,'' asserted Johnnie Carson, deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy. Mr. Carson noted, as do others, that in Mexico and Japan, also cited as democracies, one party has had a virtual monopoly on power.
However much the one party's domination may diminish Botswana's status as a democracy, there is a tolerance for dissent that is rare in other African nations. The Government daily newspaper, compared with most strident Government publications on the continent, is rather feeble at pushing a point of view. And the three privately owned weeklies can be barbed and were highly critical of the Government recently over the shooting of an 18-year-old female student by a soldier.
 
A Government Flush With Cash
Indeed, it is the way the 6,200-member army, established only 11 years ago, is growing that worries people here about the strength of their democracy. With foreign reserves of $2.5 billion - on a per capita basis probably the highest in the third world - the Government is flush with cash. Last year, it quietly doubled the capital budget for the military, from $40 million to $80 million.
The money is being spent on a new military air base west of Gaborone. But the Government has not explained why Botswana needs the base and the jets to go with it. The threat from South Africa, which carried out bombing raids in the mid 1980's in pursuit of accused members of the African National Congress, has faded.
Another failing that Mr. Mulotsi and others on his Democracy Project point out is the domination of an elite. That is reflected, they say, in the failure of the Government to distribute the benefits of the country's diamond wealth to the rural poor.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Kohl in a Hurry

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST BERLIN, May 15

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new interest in moving up German unification seems based largely on the perception that his election chances could be hurt if he waits too long.
Politicians in Bonn have also argued that unification should be hurried along because the Soviet position could change and because Western allies favor quick unity.
But the dominant concern, as Interior Minister Wolfgang Schauble said today, is the ''increasing worries and uncertainties in both East and West Germany.''
 
Cashing In on Popularity
This has evidently led Mr. Kohl's governing coalition to conclude that it should cash in on the popularity it has amassed through its championship of unity as soon as possible. A poll by the Forsa organization published today showed that Mr. Kohl's coalition would get 51 percent of an all-German vote, to 32 percent for the Social Democrats. 
Until this weekend, Mr. Kohl had insisted that his Government would hold to the plan for West German elections on Dec. 2, followed by all-German elections sometime in 1992.
But on Monday he broached for the first time the possibility of all-German elections in December or January, and today his Christian Democratic party and its Bavarian ally, the Christian Social party, unanimously declared themselves in favor of the idea.
The third party in the coalition, the Free Democrats, has been pressing for an early election for several weeks.
''It's all domestic politics,'' said one columnist. ''It's all based on the calculation that the coalition might still win in December but would get bashed in all-German elections next year because the Germans will be sour. Kohl's on a roll now, but people are beginning to realize what it's going to cost.''
The shift is not certain yet. For one thing, Mr. Kohl has declared that the East German Government is the one that must initiate an earlier vote. For another, the Soviet Union and other foreign powers may yet put on the brakes.
 
Chancellor to Meet With Bush
Mr. Kohl goes to Washington on Wednesday to consult with President Bush before the Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting later this month. Before that, Mr. Kohl will hold his second meeting in three days with Lothar de Maiziere, the Prime Minister of East Germany. The new push for early all-German elections has marked yet another shift in public feelings about unification. From the early euphoria and patriotism, attitudes have traveled to the point where a sizable number of people in West Germany are increasingly uneasy about the projected cost of absorbing the East, while East Germans are increasingly frightened for their jobs, properties and security.
Polls conducted for the weekly newsmagazine Spiegel showed that 80 percent of the West Germans questioned thought currency union would prove a disadvantage for West Germans.
The immediate catalyst for Mr. Kohl's reappraisal was the setbacks to his Christian Democrats in state elections in Lower Saxony, where the party was ousted from office by the Social Democrats, and in North-Rhine Westphalia, where Mr. Kohl's party failed to dent the Social Democrats' majority.
The results did not show a major shift to the left, but public-opinion polls found that unification was a major issue among voters. Also, the victory in Lower Saxony gave the Social Democrats a majority in the Federal Council, the upper house of the West German Parliament. The council can stall legislation and thus could tie up Mr. Kohl's unification plan.
 
Rise in Eastern Joblessness
In East Germany, the anticipation is that the monetary and economic union scheduled for July 2 will lead to widespread closures of industrial plants and bankruptcy for farmers unable to compete in the West.
The new East German Association of the Unemployed said the number of jobless was already over 100,000, triple what it was in March, in a country that had virtually no unemployment under the Communist Government. The East German Ministry for Labor and Social Affairs has predicted that the figure would exceed a half-million by midyear. East Germans also fear that West Germans will simply buy up or reclaim much of their property.
Such predictions spell trouble for Mr. Kohl, who has identified himself as the champion of rapid unification.
Up to now, the policy has worked well for the Chancellor. His decisive promises of monetary union brought the East German Christian Democrats a rousing victory in East Germany's first free elections, and the Chancellor emerged as the odds-on favorite to win in West Germany in December.
But identification with unity could now make Mr. Kohl the scapegoat for all the problems and anxieties.
The opposition Social Democrats, for their part, have argued loudly for delaying elections. Markus Meckel, the East German Foreign Minister and leader of the East German Social Democratic Party, said today that ''all-German elections should not be held for at least a year.''
 
Opposition Criticizes Kohl
Hans-Jochen Vogel, the leader of the West German Social Democrats, said: ''I think it would be reasonable that elections dates are not fixed just because Mr. Kohl lost two state elections. This is a misuse of the German unification process.''
Mr. Vogel and Mr. Meckel have a strong say in the question. In East Germany, the Social Democrats are in a ''grand coalition'' with the Christian Democrats and could resist early elections. In West Germany, the Social Democrats could use their majority in the upper house to stall the process.
And there are other formidable hurdles. The drafters of the ''state treaty'' on monetary union, which is likely to be approved by Governments in the East and West this week, left aside the most critical problems - those of property, agriculture and industry - in their rush to finish the document.
There is also the sheer problem of preparing for the elections. East Germany must reconstitute the five states it had before the Communist era, and these must elect local governments.
There is also the problem of foreign endorsement. The ''two plus four'' talks begun earlier this month between the two Germanys and the four major victors of World War II in Europe -the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France - have to resolve a host of complex issues, including the future Germany's military alignment, before unification can proceed.
Mr. Kohl, however, evidently believes that his best political path lies in doling out the bitter medicine as quickly as possible. If he succeeds, the Germanys could be one by year's end.

HEADLINE: Fremont Journal;
Tradition Is Outgrown In Baby Food's Capital

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FREMONT, Mich., May 11

 BODY:
For nearly 60 years, visitors have made the journey to this remote town in western Michigan, drawn to the big yellow-brick factory suffused with the warm aromas of mashed peas and steamed squash.
But this month, the Gerber Products Company - Fremont's first and most famous corporate citizen -brought to a close one of its most enduring civic and corporate traditions. On May 4, Gerber gave the last public tour of its giant baby food factory.
For many in this town of 3,600 people, life won't be the same. In the summers, as many as 100 people a day would make their way to the plant, past the signs at the city limits that still describe Fremont as ''the Baby Food Capital of the World.'' 
''We used to get busloads who'd stop for lunch, after touring the plant,'' said Phyllis Heft, the manager of Samuel's Fine Foods, a fixture on Main Street since 1955. ''It's sad to see them end; they brought people to Fremont.''
Like several other manufacturing plants, in other parts of the country, management at Gerber decided that the plant tour, a primitive but highly personal form of corporate public relations, had outlived its usefulness.
Kellogg, the cereal company in nearby Battle Creek, abandoned its tours in 1986. In Chicago, the makers of Cracker Jack no longer take children through the factory.
Nicholas Iammartino, a spokesman for Borden Inc., which makes Cracker Jack, said plant tours are a thing of the past. ''They can cause problems with sanitation and safety, and they disrupt the work,'' he said.
Here in Fremont, said Steven W. Poole, a Gerber spokesman, plant managers were worried about something else: the possibility that competitors were using the tours to spy on Gerber's production.
Espionage at the home of the world's best-known baby? ''Well,'' Mr. Poole said, ''espionage is probably too strong a word when when we're talking about mashed peas. But we do have equipment in the factory that we consider proprietary.''
With its neat ranks of shops along Main Street, and its well-clipped lawns and sturdy frame houses, Fremont evokes the image of an America that for the most part no longer exists. It is the mythical Middle American small town - economically secure and prosperous.
The town and the Gerber company are almost indivisible. The local hospital is Gerber Memorial, and profits earned over the years from company stock have helped build a park and an arboretum and sustain a wide array of community benefits, from a local food bank for the poor and elderly to the new computers at the high school.
Meanwhile, the Gerbers themselves still maintain a presence in town. The son of the company's founder not only has a house here, but his telephone number there is listed in the local phone book.
Gerber is thus especially attuned to local public opinion. So when the company announced that it was ending its tours, it declared that it would also open a new visitor center next fall.
The center will offer the opportunity to taste-test brands of baby food. It will also have 60-seat theater that will show a three-dimensional movie depicting the world as seen from a toddler's point of view.
''You won't get the aromas you get in the plant, but I think the 3-D movie thing will be a big draw,'' said Diane R. Sidor, the director of Fremont's Chamber of Commerce.
The decision to close the plant to tours, announced a few weeks ago, had been the town's worst-kept secret. That's not surprising, considering that most of the plant's 1,200 employees live right in town.
Ray Rathbun, the Mayor of Fremont, works at Gerber. And among those who don't, most can count spouses, siblings, in-laws or neighbors who do.
''My wife works up at the plant, and told me a long time ago that they were stopping the tours,'' said Larry Baragar, who owns a local pizza restaurant and tavern. ''I figure I'll lose some business at first, but in the end it will be O. K.,'' he said. ''I trust the people at Gerber's.''
The Gerbers were German immigrants who settled in the rich timberland of western Michigan in the late 19th century. They ran a tannery, and later opened a cannery, producing tins of sliced peaches and lima beans packaged under labels like Miss Michigan and Climatic Gems.
In 1927, after Daniel Gerber's wife gave birth to a daughter, she asked her husband if he could use the plant's equipment to mash up some vegetables for the baby.
Within a year, Gerber was advertising its new line of baby foods in national magazines, using as its signature the same cherubic baby's face that is now among the world's most recognizable corporate logos.
The portrait was submitted by a Boston artist, who sketched her neighbor's daughter. The model, Ann Turner Cook, is a retired teacher in Tampa, Fla., who turned 63 this year, said Mr. Poole.
The company has about 71 percent of the domestic baby food market. So far, what's good for Gerber has been great for Fremont.
''Thanks to Gerber's, I've met people from all over the place,'' said Henry Breuker, a clerk at Sherman's hardware store. ''Why, over the years, I've met people from Hesperia and Big Rapids, Manistee and Ludington and even Grand Rapids.''

HEADLINE: White House Rules Out Plan To Weaken a Law on Wildlife

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Rejecting complaints by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., the White House says President Bush does not want to weaken the nation's primary law protecting endangered animals and plants. 
''We have no plans to change the act at this time,'' the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Monday.
Mr. Lujan expressed concern last week that the 17-year-old Endangered Species Act was threatening jobs and economic development.
Asked if Mr. Lujan was at odds with the President on the matter, Mr. Fitzwater said, ''He gave his views and they're important, but there's been no decision to make any change.''

HEADLINE: George Bush 101: Vintage Days for Sizing Him Up

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
If you seek to discover what manner of man is running the United States, these are vintage days for watching George Bush.
The President has been giving lessons, to his own colleagues as well as to the country at large, in his own particular style of consensus-building, split-the-difference politics. No doubt he will apply the same techniques, or try hard to, when Mikhail S. Gorbachev comes to town in two weeks.
Taking full, personal, public charge of his own strategy, Mr. Bush has moved toward abandoning the one hard-edged, brook-no-compromise position that he had maintained since the start of his Administration - no new taxes - in a search for a budget deal with the Democrats that began today with a White House meeting. And he has in effect joined with civil rights leaders in a search for a legislative deal that would enable him to sign a bill they want. 
 
Less Emphasis on 'No'
In both cases, the President has softened policy statements by senior colleagues, repudiating John H. Sununu, his chief of staff, on the prospect of a tax increase and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on civil rights.
Mr. Sununu had tried to reassure Republican conservatives by declaring that if Democrats tried to put tax increases on the table in budget talks, that it was ''our prerogative to say 'no,' and I emphasize 'no.' '' Up popped Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, to say on his boss's behalf, ''I disavow every remark that doesn't represent the President.''
Mr. Thornburgh had tried to reassure business leaders and others who fear hiring quotas by publicly advocating a veto of a civil rights bill that he said would introduce quotas by the back door. Black leaders were angry. So Mr. Bush called in leaders of black groups, whom he has been courting for months, made reassuring noises and told White House and Justice Department lawyers to work things out.
Some see an old game being played here, with Mr. Bush as the good cop being set up by aides as the bad cops. A senior Republican on Capitol Hill said, ''It's a good scam, because it lets the President off a lot of hooks.''
Others think that Mr. Sununu and Mr. Thornburgh got out of line, and were reprimanded as a consequence.
In one sense, it does not really matter. Whichever interpretation is correct, Mr. Bush ended up in a position that enables him to present himself as the reasonable man - the Jimmy Stewart figure who offends as few people as possible, listens to everyone, then searches for the middle ground. At the same time, he can do a little useful work in broadening his popularity and steadying the economy in time for his 1992 re-election campaign.
The whole approach sends a strong message to those in crucial positions in Mr. Bush's Washington: it is in our interest to cast our net as widely as possible, not to differentiate ourselves and our views from this group or that unless it becomes absolutely necessary.
 
Being Part of the Team
Perhaps that is why Mr. Thornburgh, an aggressive ''them vs. us'' sort of politician, is reorganizing his much-criticized department by dispatching his two key aides, who have been with him since his days as Governor of Pennsylvania, to less visible jobs and probably ultimately out of government. Getting on the team requires the right style as well as the right policies.
From the start of his Presidency, Mr. Bush has taken a nonconfrontational approach, seeking to reassure as many people as possible without committing himself to any particular course of action. When the crunch comes, his instinct is to split the difference, as he has done on environmental questions like the Clean Air Act. He tends to avoid drawn-out struggles in which he had little chance of prevailing; for example, in the case of the Nicaraguan rebels, where he was unwilling to inflame his relationship with Congressional Democrats.
A number of major issues seem to be ripening, forcing Mr. Bush to cope with several at once. The absence due to illness of Lee Atwater, Mr. Bush's main political strategist, may be responsible for some clumsiness of execution lately. But the President has continued to apply what one friend calls ''his own patented brand of political soft soap.''
Only when cornered, this friend says, does Mr. Bush like to take hard-edged positions and to attack those who challenge him. Thus he developed his no-tax strategy to salvage his campaign when it was in trouble in New Hampshire early in 1988. The ultimate pragmatist, Mr. Bush is now prepared to dump that strategy, his aides say, largely because any other course might bring on a recession and threaten his chances of being re-elected.
 
Compromise and Ideology
All this is very different from the way Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan handled things. One might say, to paraphrase Michael S. Dukakis, that for Mr. Bush, governing is all about compromise, not ideology. He risks being accused of standing for nothing except winning another term.
It is, however, very much in the tradition of other Presidents, like Gerald R. Ford and, in the early part of his tenure, Lyndon B. Johnson. President Johnson used to say, ''come, let us reason together'' as he built a massive consensus behind his Great Society programs, a consensus so broad that he won one of the great electoral victories in American history in 1964.
But as he discovered later, that approach is extraordinarily difficult to sustain over the long haul.

HEADLINE: Racist Theories Compromise Teaching Ability;
A Social Purpose

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leonard Kriegel's analysis (''Academic Freedom and Racial Theories,'' Op-Ed, May 3) is first rate as far as it goes, but it doesn't go far enough in making a crucial distinction. Prof. Michael Levin and Prof. Leonard Jeffries are not ''brothers under the skin.''
Professor Jeffries has standing in any discussion of the competence and status of blacks: he is a black man and his academic field is black studies. Professor Kriegel is right to despise Mr. Jeffries's prejudicial ideas about ''rich Jews,'' but Mr. Jeffries's ''sun people/ice people'' polarity [distinguishing between people of African descent and those of European descent] may be seen as a useful fiction. The history of civilization is filled with these. Where oppressed minorities need powerful phrases to stir the collective identity toward new levels of strength, the word ''people'' is often used, with a suitable adjective preceding it. 
Professor Levin, however, whose field is philosophy, has no standing in addressing these matters: he has neither professional interest nor competence in the fields of genetics, intelligence testing or economics.
The inference that asks to be made, therefore, is that Mr. Levin's racial remarks, though made under the guise of intellectual detachment and a search for truth, are personal and have the motive of making him into a lightning rod for the hatred they have indeed aroused. Under tight control, and never giving vent to his racial inanities in the classroom, Professor Levin is able to draw praise for these classroom performances even from black students who deplore what he says outside. Protected, appropriately, by the canons of academic and First Amendment freedoms, he should nevertheless be seen for what he is.
It is possible and even plausible to deplore Professor Jeffries's ideas, but he at least has a social purpose, however debatable his methods, while Professor Levin is a mere case study.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: How to Shrink the Deficit;
The Budget Summit: Cut Spending, Raise Taxes

BYLINE: By Alice M. Rivlin; Alice M. Rivlin, an economist at the Brookings Institution, was director of the Congressional Budget Office.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The President and leaders of Congress have a splendid opportunity this week to enhance their political popularity. If they can agree on a credible plan for eliminating the Federal deficit over the next several years, they can strengthen the economy, restore faith in the democratic process and prove cynics wrong.
The media's obsession with the painful aspects of deficit reduction, tax increases and spending cuts, has obscured the fact that eliminating the deficit would make us better off. The positive effects of deficit reduction -falling interest rates, rising stock prices, more affordable housing, increased private and public investment, stronger exports - could be dramatic, especially in the long run. 
Massive Federal borrowing has kept interest rates high for a decade, much higher, after allowing for inflation, than in the 70's. If the Government reduces its borrowing, more funds will be available for the rest of us and rates will fall. If, after several years, the Government stops borrowing and begins retiring even a small part of the debt, we can expect a long period of low interest rates, perhaps a return to the era of the 6 percent mortgage. Falling interest rates give relief to families with variable-rate mortgages. Many families realize they can afford better housing. Home builders and renovators respond. Construction employment rises. Sales of cars, furniture and appliances rise in response to more home building and more favorable financing.
Falling interest rates send stock prices up. Borrowing and equity financing are then less costly for business. Expanding or modernizing the plant, fixing up the store, undertaking more advanced research, developing new products - all become more attractive when financing is cheaper. The much criticized shortsightedness of business - caring more about the next quarter's earnings than the company's long-run health - may change when lower interest rates make future orientation more affordable.
With borrowing costs reduced, state and local governments can take a longer view. They can afford to modernize transportation and other public facilities. In the long run, we will all live better because private and public investment will increase the economy's productivity.
Other benefits of eliminating the deficit include lowering dependence on foreign capital and making U.S. exports more attractive. Our trade deficit will shift to a surplus; instead of remaining the world's No. 1 debtor, we will become a net lender again, earning income on U.S. investments abroad and having more say in how the world develops. No benefits come without cost. Americans have not been paying enough taxes to cover the cost of Federal services; that is why the Government has borrowed so much. This situation can be fixed only by raising taxes or reducing spending, which alienates voters.
But the pain of deficit reduction need not be great if spread over several years and distributed broadly over a large number of taxpayers and benefit recipients. Plans like Representative Dan Rostenkowski's are fair and relatively painless: everyone gives up a little and nobody is hurt very much.
Many tax increases and spending cuts have politically attractive aspects. Higher energy taxes, phased in gradually, could provide greater fuel efficiency, less pollution and lower dependence on foreign oil. Reducing farm subsidies could give us cheaper food. Cuts in the military would be applauded by those who consider today's defense spending wasteful and ill-matched to current threats.
America urges fledgling Eastern Europe democracies to adopt painful economic programs involving large-scale unemployment, cuts in real incomes of people who are barely making it - all in the name of instituting a more efficient and productive market economy. Yet our politicians apparently fear that voters are too shortsighted to accept the far less painful measures needed to make our economy more efficient and productive.
The budget ''summit meeting'' offers a chance for our political leaders to show their faith in the public's intelligence and good sense and prove that the governmental system we urge on others can still work for us.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: How to Shrink the Deficit;
The Budget Summit: Don't Raise Taxes

BYLINE: By Martin Anderson; Martin Anderson is a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
The brazen cry to raise taxes in 1990 has to be the most shameless assault on Americans' pocketbooks in this century.
We have just had the largest back-to-back annual tax increases in our history. In 1988, the Government got $751 billion of our money. This year, it will get that and another $165 billion. That whopping increase in tax receipts - a product of economic growth and inflation - is one of the best kept secrets in America. Washington is awash in tax money. During the next three fiscal years, tax revenues are expected - without any change in tax rates - to increase by another $254 billion. That's a grand total of $419 billion of new spending money for the Federal bureaucrats in just five years. It is almost $1 billion of new tax money for every single Congressman. 
Surely, $419 billion is more than enough for those rascals.
Then how can there be a problem? Because politicians want to spend even more than the cash that is flooding in on them. Displaying remarkable ingenuity, they have figured out how to spend much, much more than the paltry $1 trillion and change that they have today.
And that is unconscionable. Here we are rolling along in the 89th month of the greatest economic expansion in our history, with 19 million new jobs, a gross national product of nearly $6 trillion, low inflation, interest rates and unemployment, a stock market that has tripled in the last seven years - and these bozos want to jeopardize it all by raising tax rates.
Moreover, the collapse of socialism and the prospects of bilateral nuclear disarmament will soon produce a financial windfall. The savings over the next decade could easily accumulate to more than $500 billion.
How bad is the Federal deficit? The deficit, as a percentage of gross national product, has fallen steadily since 1985 (when it was 5.4 percent) to an estimated 2.2 percent for 1990. Even with the latest revised ''the sky is falling'' estimates, the deficit would still be only 2.6 percent of G.N.P. in 1990 and 1.5 percent in 1991. We have had deficits in this range many times before. They are serious but not catastrophic, and certainly not justification for raising tax rates and jeopardizing the economy. The same is true of Federal debt. As a percentage of G.N.P. it has been falling in recent years and now stands at about 40 percent. That is lower than at any time from 1945 to 1965. It was not a serious problem then, and it is not a serious problem now.
The real problem with our economy is that politicians want to spend more of our money than they have any right to. But where is it written that government has a right to an ever increasing share of our income?
In fact, as our economy grows ever more huge - into the $6 trillion and $7 trillion dollar range - we should be getting savings in Government operations from economies of scale. As peace breaks out around the world and our economy gets bigger, the Government should take a smaller percentage out of our pockets.
Rather than raising taxes, we should be taking decisive steps to keep the economic expansion rolling, to create more jobs. In addition to refraining from tax hikes, here are three things we should do in 1990:
* Eliminate the capital gains tax (which will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and put us on a more equal footing with foreign competitors), and delay any increase in the Social Security tax for at least one year. Getting rid of the capital gains tax wraise Federal revenues. Delaying the Social Security tax for a year would cost about $12 billion.
* Earmark all of the ''peace dividend'' for further deficit reduction and to pay for the delayed Social Security tax increase.
* Slow, by a measly two or three percentage points a year, the incredible growth of Federal spending. If we could do that, we could balance the budget easily in a few years.
When it comes to spending taxpayers' money, politicians and bureaucrats - of either party - have no sense of restraint. They need to be disciplined.
The only way to deal with them is to just say no - no more new taxes.
Read our lips.

HEADLINE: Albany Legislators Reach Accord On $1.4 Billion in Taxes and Fees

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 15

 BODY:
New York State's legislative leaders today reached a final accord on a $1.4 billion package of taxes and fees that would raise the price of dozens of goods and services, including liquor, soda, car rentals and parking.
The accord means that for the second year in a row, state lawmakers, struggling to close a chronic budget gap, have agreed to increase state taxes by more than $1 billion.
Many of the changes in the tax accord had been tentatively agreed on for weeks. But many others were still being debated until early this morning, when the 275-page tax bill, dubbed ''the Big Ugly,'' was sent to be printed. 
The bill incorporates an earlier agreement to delay the last phase of the state's four-year income tax cut, which was to take effect in October. Also, as expected, it drops a controversial plan to expand the state's sales tax to cover services like management consulting and public relations.
The tax package was the most fiercely contested feature of the state's interminably debated budget, which is now six weeks overdue. Lawmakers, worn down by the delay, said today that they hoped the tax accord would clear the way for the full $50 billion budget to be in place by the end of the week. But this evening, legislative officials said there were still some particulars of the plan that remained in dispute.
In its details, the tax package agreed to by the Legislature bears little resemblance to the package proposed in January by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. The Governor is expected to sign the measure even though during recent negotiations he has tried to distance himself from the package.
 
Shifting the Blame
Today Republican lawmakers tried to shift the blame back to the Governor, saying the best thing that could be said about the tax package was that it was better than the one proposed by Mr. Cuomo.
''No one likes taxes, but we had to be sure we got rid of some of the terrible suggestions that came forth when the Governor first proposed the budget,'' said the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Tarky Lombardi Jr., Republican of Syracuse. ''If there is a victory in this, it was getting rid of the insidious taxes originally in it.''
One of the taxes proposed by the Governor but rejected by the Legislature was a new tax on long-distance telephone calls.
The final agreement on the tax package, reached after more than three months of partisan haggling, represents a hodgepodge of fees and taxes that will directly or indirectly raise the price of a broad array of everyday activities, including buying beer, driving an automobile and filing a court case. The taxes will also raise the cost of doing business in New York for companies ranging from petroleum importers to amusement park operators.
Many experts deplored the patchwork tax package, saying it reflected Albany's peculiar politics rather than sound economic policies.
''A broad-based tax would have been the most intelligent solution,'' said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. ''But that requires the most political courage. What we have here is profiles in weakness.''
 
Major Changes
These are among the major taxes in the package:
* A 15 percent surcharge on corporate tax payments.
* A two-cent-per-container tax on nonrefillable soda bottles and cans.
* An increase in the gross receipts tax paid by processors and importers of petroleum products.
* A doubling of the excise tax on beer, to 12 cents a six-pack, and a 20 percent increase in the excise tax on liquor.
* An expansion of the state's sales tax to cover services that include interior decorating, parking and private detectives.
* A 5 percent surtax on automobile rentals.
The Assembly, which is led by Democrats, was expected to approve the tax measure. It was unclear when the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, would pass the bill.
State lawmakers have been particularly edgy about approving new taxes this year because all 211 of them are up for re-election this fall. Today its importance as a campaign issue was obvious.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Smith Decision on Student Aid: 'Tip of the Iceberg'

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
With Federal aid for student grants and loans down dramatically from levels of a decade ago, college administrators predict that fewer and fewer colleges will be able to guarantee financial aid to all the students they admit.
And at the nation's most selective colleges and universities, ''need-blind'' admissions policies - the practice of admitting students without regard to their ability to pay -are being re-examined.
The stakes are high, because less financial aid could mean that fewer poor, working-class and minority students will be able to attend elite colleges.
Earlier this year, Smith College quietly decided to stop admitting students without regard to their ability to pay. When the decision became public last week, it ricocheted through the world of higher education, touching off debate about how colleges can compensate for financial shortages without rejecting qualified students. 
College administrators across the country said most schools shared Smith's dilemma, even if they have not chosen its solution. And it is difficult to tell whether other colleges are following Smith's course, because no one wants adverse publicity.
''Is Smith the tip of the iceberg? Yes,'' said Karl M. Furstenberg, dean of admissions and financial aid at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. In 1982, Wesleyan announced it would end need-blind admissions, but a successful fund-raising drive meant the policy never took effect.
Smith's decision to deny some students admission if the school cannot give them enough financial aid has also renewed a long-standing debate. Is it fairer to give students no money but the choice to attend and the opportunities provided by a prestigious college's degree, or does that create a group of second-class citizens, overburdened financially and set apart from their peers?
 
'Shared by Us All'
''The financial pressure is indeed shared by all of us, and we're all figuring out how to deal with it,'' said Nan Keohane, president of Wellesley College in Massachusetts, which has begun a five-year drive to raise $150 million. ''So many things are threatened. There's a lot of evidence that the quality of our student body, as well as diversity, depends very heavily on student aid. You stand to sacrifice both, and I just don't think we can afford to do that.''
Colleges that do not practice need-blind admissions say their decision does not necessarily mean less diversity, because only the marginally acceptable students are affected. Beginning with next year's entering class, Smith will distribute a budgeted amount of aid to applicants, starting with the most desirable ones - many of whom will be students Smith wants precisely because they are poor or from minorities. If the money runs out, students who rank lower on the acceptable list and need aid will not be admitted.
Instead, Smith's board of admissions decided yesterday, those students will be sent a letter saying that they met Smith's qualifications but that the college cannot admit them because it has no money for them. If Smith finds extra money later, or if the students can come up with more money on their own, the college will review their cases, said Mary Maples Dunn, Smith's president. She estimated that Smith would not be able to give financial aid to 5 percent to 10 percent of qualified students.
 
A Meeting at Barnard
But Frank Burtnett, executive director of the National Association of College Admission Counselors, remains worried: ''If part of the mission of an institution is to extend its diversity, on the other hand they are saying we won't be able to admit you if your need is too great.''
While few in the small world of higher education would criticize Smith directly, some administrators moved quickly to reaffirm their commitment to not letting financial need influence a student's chance of admission. Barnard College convened a meeting of its trustees on Monday to pass a resolution declaring that the college would continue to admit students without considering whether they could pay.
''There will be no financial toll gates for admission to Barnard College,'' Ellen V. Futter, Barnard's president, said in announcing the trustees' vote at commencement ceremonies yesterday.
The National Association of College Admission Counselors, of which Smith is a member, asks members to practice need-blind admissions. Many administrators said they were scrambling to find more money, either through fund-raising campaigns or better budgeting, to insure that they could continue need-blind admissions.
 
Cherished but Costly
The ideals of need-blind admission, while cherished at many of the country's most selective and prestigious colleges, are unaffordable for most schools. It is not clear exactly how many colleges do practice need-blind admissions, although Mr. Burtnett said he believes the 1,400 colleges in his association have all pledged to do so. Brown University has long had a policy similar to Smith's new one, and shortages at Tufts University briefly threatened to overturn need-blind admissions there.
Dallas Martin, president of the National Association of Student Aid Administrators, said many colleges, particularly those in the economically hard-hit Northeast, South and Southwest, were facing cutbacks in state as well as Federal financial aid and could no longer practice need-blind admissions, if they ever did.
Mr. Furstenberg of Wesleyan and many other administrators said a decade of reduced Federal aid was beginning to take its toll. According to the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, Federal grants to students at independent colleges decreased by 68 percent between the 1975-76 and 1987-88 school years. In 1987-88, colleges provided $2.3 billion in aid to undergraduates, more than double the level of 1970-71, with three-quarters of the increase coming in the 1980's. All figures are adjusted for inflation.
At the beginning, most colleges were able to make up for the Federal cutbacks with their own money, and financial aid budgets at most schools skyrocketed. So did tuition, with financial-aid needs cited as a main reason.
But after more than 10 years, with little prospect that Federal aid will return to former levels, some colleges are running out of resources. Severe criticism about high tuition increases appear to have convinced many colleges that they can no longer raise tuitions to cover that cost.
 
Some Hard Choices
The continuing squeeze leaves administrators with several choices. They can provide every admitted student with all necessary aid. If they cannot afford that course, they can admit students but deny financial aid to some. Or they can rank students and admit them all, but give more financial aid to the students they want most. These strategies would fall under the broad category of need-blind admissions.
Or colleges can, as Smith decided, move away from need-blind admissions. Ms. Dunn said Smith had had unhappy experiences with admitting students but denying them financial aid. ''Those student struggled awfully hard,'' she said. ''They often worked too many hours to try to make ends meet.
''We don't want to establish a have and have-not group on campus.''
But other administrators feel that such a policy deprives students of the opportunity to make their own choice. ''It slams the door rather than leaving it open and allowing for the possiblity that the student will come anyway, which they often do,'' Ms. Futter said.

HEADLINE: Can Good Food Fly At 35,000 Feet?

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
KEVIN GREENE hates jokes about airline food. And as director of catering services for Pan American World Airways at Kennedy International Airport, he's heard them all.
''It's unfortunate we get a bum rap,'' he said, proudly displaying a tray of lobster thermidor for first-class passengers on a flight to Paris. ''We're spending a fortune to buy top quality.''
Indeed, the nation's airlines are spending record amounts on food service in an effort to shed their image as the providers of the airborne equivalent of hospital cuisine. 
They are hiring well-known chefs to help revamp menus, replacing plastic with silverware and ceramic crockery, and offering more healthful fare. The changes are mostly apparent in small ways, and primarily in business and first-class sections, for which airlines spend three or four times more for food than they do for coach.
American Airlines has begun baking fresh cookies on board and offering do-it-yourself ice cream sundaes in first class. United Airlines is serving Japanese food on its flights to Tokyo; Pan Am offers borscht on its New York-to-Moscow route, and today the airline will introduce hot meals on some short domestic flights.
Many airlines have improved their wine selections, particularly on international flights.
But some food experts, not to mention passengers, are skeptical. To them, airline food - particularly what is served in coach class - still deserves its dismal reputation.
''There is a concerted effort being made to improve food, but it may not manifest itself on the tray,'' said George Haupt, president of the In-Flight Food Services Association, a trade group of airline caterers.
Mr. Haupt also maintains that the crowded conditions in coach class make it difficult for any dining experience to be pleasurable.''In coach, you're elbow to elbow with someone, you have a seat back in your face and then you're handed a tray with your whole meal on it,'' he said. Wolfgang Puck, owner of Spago restaurant in Los Angeles, phrased it more succinctly. ''To me, an airplane is still a great place to diet.'' The push for better food reflects a changing airline industry. With only eight American airlines controlling 90 percent of the domestic market, airlines compete less on fares and more on service. The fare wars of the early 1980's, which frustrated airline executives and delighted consumers, have largely been replaced by battles over seat width, frequent-flier programs and, now, food.
In addition, as United States airlines add international routes, they find their food must compete with that of foreign airlines, whose cuisine has long enjoyed a better reputation.
Curiously, the food for many foreign and domestic airlines is prepared by the same catering companies. The difference, food experts say, lies in the attention that the staff gives the food.
''At the foreign airlines, there is an energy, a responsiveness on the part of the staff,'' said Michael Whiteman, a food consultant in New York. ''They're not just plopping the food down.''
The nation's 10 largest airlines spent $2 billion on food last year, an average of $5.05 per passenger - or 13.3 percent more than in 1988 and 21.7 percent more than in 1987, according to Airline Economics, a consulting concern in Washington. Some of the increases are due to higher food prices, but industry analysts attribute the rise mainly to the airlines' effort to improve food quality.
In one of the most ambitious programs, Northwest Airlines plans to spend $100 million over the next five years to improve its food service. The airline is phasing in full meals on 60 flights a day that had offered only snacks. More choices of entrees will be available in coach class, larger portions served in all classes and dozens of new recipes introduced. For instance, the airline now offers fajitas and a three-pasta entree in coach.
''The pendulum has swung back again, and passengers expect restaurant-quality food,'' said Robert Gibbons, a spokesman for Northwest.
Airline executives are quick to point out the obstacles they face in serving meals at 35,000 feet. With little room for preparation on board, airline food must be prepared hours - sometimes days - in advance, trucked to the plane, where it may sit for hours more, reheated and, finally, served in a cramped setting where the air is drier than in the Sahara.
What's more, airline chefs have to serve hundreds of passengers who may have nothing more in common than wanting to get from New York to Chicago. As a result, the carriers select foods with the widest appeal or, more precisely, that are least offensive.
''Nobody is on an airplane for a culinary adventure,'' said Mitch Gross, manager of food services for United Airlines at Kennedy Airport. The airline recently discontinued the boiled eel it was serving on its New York to Tokyo flights. ''It didn't fly all that well,'' he said.
Despite the difficulties, there are examples of airlines that have broken out of the TV-dinner mold. Midwest Express, a medium-size carrier based in Milwaukee that is a subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark, has amassed something of a cult following for its fine cuisine.
The airline, which offers only coach service, serves its meals on china, with crystal glassware and stainless steel utensils. Typical entrees include Maine lobster, braised grouse and fricassee of oyster. Even on short flights, it serves chilled lobster medallions rather than peanuts. ''Anything can be overcome if you use some imagination,'' said John Farrer, the airline's director of dining services.
Midwest spends an average of $9.50 a passenger on food, nearly double the industry average. Its fares, however, are competitive with other airlines' coach prices.
But executives at the nation's major airlines say that the smaller Midwest Express can more easily afford to offer fine cuisine. ''They're not providing the food on the scale that mega-carriers do,'' said Mr. Gibbons of Northwest.
Still, when the smaller carrier began serving fresh-baked cookies on its flights from Milwaukee, Northwest countered by offering Dove bars on its flights.
Many airlines are hiring well-known chefs to help revamp menus. American has organized a conclave of 12 chefs, which meets annually to review the airline's food service.
''We're trying to figure out dishes that can be started on the ground and finished in the air,'' said Larry Forgione, who owns An American Place in New York and is one of the chefs retained by American. He said he was most disturbed by the industry's use of cheap ingredients, particularly in coach class. ''The smell of it alone is enough to make you crazy,'' he said.
As a result of the chefs' recommendations, American has begun cooking scrambled eggs for first and business class on international flights, and baking fresh cookies and breads for all of its first-class sections. Pan Am cooks chateaubriand completely on the plane for its first-class service to Europe.
But airborne cooking is not likely to make its way to the rear of the cabin. ''It's difficult to get all the passengers served before landing, much less cook the food on board,'' said Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for American Airlines.
Clark Wolf, a food consultant who travels 100 days out of the year, said: ''It's great that they're baking cookies for first class, but the smell does travel to coach. People can become rabid.''
Mr. Wolf, who said he brings his own food when traveling in coach, said airlines should stick to the basics. ''They think that by smothering food with globs of sauce they can hide its inferiorities,'' he said.
The carriers respond that they use the heavier sauces to keep the food moist in the dry air of an airplane cabin. ''It's not that we're trying to hide things,'' Ms. O'Neill said.
But some airlines, like American, are trying lighter sauces, and beginning in July Northwest will serve all of its meals with the sauce on the side.
Most airline food is prepared by large catering organizations, like Caterair, Ogden and Sky Chefs. Still, it is the airline that chooses the recipes and specifies how the food is to be prepared.
The Caterair kitchen at Kennedy International Airport turns out as many as 20,000 meals a day. ''It's not like your local restaurant,'' said Joseph Nappi, general manager of the kitchen. ''To me, it's a factory.''
The food is indeed prepared with assembly-line efficiency. Plastic trays circle on a conveyer belt while workers methodically insert pre-packaged salads, pre-cooked chickens and pre-molded cheeses. Of course, first-class and business-class meals receive more personal attention.
The sheer volume of food processed at the kitchen, covering an area larger than a football field, sets the tone. Each week, 12,000 pounds of beef, not counting 1,500 pounds of chateaubriand, 700 one-and-a-quarter-pound Maine lobsters, 1,680 pounds of Norwegian salmon and 250 cans of Russian sevruga caviar are prepared.
After the meals are assembled, they are trucked to the plane, loaded and, once airborne, reheated in a convection oven. Some airlines, most notably U.S. Air, use ''thermal columning,'' where heat is trapped in a stack of trays and therefore the food need not be reheated on board. But this technique is possible only for shorter flights.
Nearly all airlines are offering more healthful meals. For instance, Continental Airlines serves fresh fruit with cereal for breakfast. American added mineral water to its beverage carts. United recently replaced butter with margarine. And even the ubiquitous peanut is now unsalted.
One thing is certain: More people are ordering special meals in advance at no extra cost - everything from low carbohydrate to kosher to Hindu vegetarian. For instance, at the Caterair kitchen in New York, requests for special meals are up 70 percent in the last five years, to between 1,200 and 1,500 a day, Mr. Nappi said. As a result, such meals are also starting to be mass produced.
Edythe Travelstead, a fashion designer from New York who flies about once a week, said she always orders one of the special meals and hopes that it will be tastier than the usual fare. ''I've been through them all,'' she said. ''Kosher, vegetarian dietic, low sodium.''
But Ms. Travelstead said that she finds the special meals only marginally better and that recently she began carrying Tabasco sauce whenever she flies. ''I smother the food with the sauce,'' she said. ''At least it tastes a little better.''

The Worst Years of Our Lives
Irreverent Notes From a Decade of Greed
By Barbara Ehrenreich
275 pages. Pantheon Books. $19.95.
In one of W. H. Auden's brilliant poems, ''September 1, 1939,'' he called the 1930's ''a low dishonest decade.'' In ''The Worst Years of Our Lives,'' a hard-hitting yet lightly handled book of political and social essays, Barbara Ehrenreich labels the 1980's ''a decade of greed.'' 
Although Auden was writing about the rise of dictatorships and the response of the democracies in Europe and Ms. Ehrenreich is taking on the vacuity of Presidential leadership and its consequences for many despairing Americans, there's a palpable link between the two works. For in his poem Auden originally used the phrase ''points of light'' in an ironic sense; long afterward one of President Reagan's speechwriters, without attribution, turned it into an upbeat expression for President Bush. No one ever quite knew exactly what the speechwriter's ''thousand points of light'' meant, but it sounded suitably high-minded and elusive.
One of Ms. Ehrenreich's main themes in ''The Worst Years of Our Lives'' is that the Reagan Administration, which dominated the last decade, cosmeticized the country and painted over its true condition. The author writes that the poor and middle class are now suffering the results of deliberate neglect. In an imaginary letter addressed ''Dear George,'' President Bush comes off somewhat better than his predecessor. She credits him with shrewdness because of his choice for Vice President: the ''really neat thing about Dan Quayle, as you must have realized from the first moment you looked into those lovely blue eyes: impeachment insurance.''
''Sometime in the 80's, Americans had a new set of 'traditional values' installed,'' Ms. Ehrenreich writes. ''It was part of what may someday be known as the 'Reagan renovation,' that finely balanced mix of cosmetic refinement and moral coarseness which brought $200,000 china to the White House dinner table and mayhem to the beleaguered peasantry of Central America. All of the new traditions had venerable sources. In economics, we borrowed from the Bourbons; in foreign policy, we drew on themes fashioned by the nomad warriors of the Eurasian steppes. In spiritual matters, we emulated the braying intolerance of our archenemies and esteemed customers, the Shiite fundamentalists.''
In several of the essays, Ms. Ehrenreich also uses the cosmetic metaphor for Nancy Reagan and what she considers the former First Lady's contribution to the greed decade. She says that ''underneath the Marie Antoinette packaging'' was someone who never succeeded as a mother; that behind ''the dizzying camouflage of borrowed gowns and extorted china,'' Mrs. Reagan carried on brilliantly for her detached husband as ''a substitute President.'' Only half-kidding, the author says that she wasn't offended by the reported $46,000 that Mrs. Reagan spent for her inaugural wardrobe. Then, truer to form, she adds, ''What sets my teeth on edge is not the Administration's extravagance, but its apparent hostility to the female poor, who form a majority of the population known colloquially as 'welfare cheats.' ''
Ms. Ehrenreich has a more humorous touch in her essays on feminism, television, corporate women and the Mommie track, fast cars, dumb young men seduced by smart older women, the worship of stars famous for 15 minutes, gossip-column personalities and the decline of the work ethic: ''I realize how important the work ethic is. I understand that it occupies the position, in the American constellation of values, once held by motherhood and Girl Scout cookies.''
Most of these essays first appeared in Mother Jones; others were published in Ms., The Atlantic, The New Republic, The Nation, New York Woman and The New York Times. As with any collection, some of the pieces sound vaguely familiar. Ms. Ehrenreich says that magazine writing nowadays requires wearing a happy face. Or, as the novelist Herbert Gold put it, ''happy stories about happy people with happy problems.'' She says that popular magazine writers encounter ''capitalist censorship,'' meaning that they can write about any social problem ''so long as it is a problem experienced primarily by the rich.'' As a result, the major women's magazines now have ''the intellectual texture of bread pudding.'' That comment (and the strongest ones in the book) is from Mother Jones.
Although some of the essays have a dated feeling, many of the characters of the last decade still flourish in the new decade. Of former Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, Ms. Ehrenreich writes that the real message of his ''Iranscam'' testimony was not in his words but in his uniform. ''This prince of Reagan's secret Government had chosen to confront the public in a costume that proclaimed his license to kill,'' she says. ''A civilian official in a civilian Government, he had chosen to come as a warrior.''
The polemical views in ''The Worst Years of Our Lives'' have a saving grace: the author's words do not offend as much as they arouse. At her best, Ms. Ehrenreich reminds this reader of the James Thurber cartoon in which a triumphant fencer, having just sliced off his opponent's head, says, ''Touche!''

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Tie Aid to Exports In Bid to Curb the Practice

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Moving to promote United States exports more aggressively, the Bush Administration today announced an initiative aimed at inducing other developed countries, principally Japan and France, to curb their export-aid programs.
Adopting the strategy of its rivals, the Administration said it was preparing its own offensive, a $500 million export credit program that will tap into foreign aid funds for the first time to help American exporters. The Administration has singled out four countries, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand, to receive aid that would be linked to buying American products.
The program - offering a combination of aid money and subsidized export credits to customers who buy American power plants, telecommunications gear, construction equipment and other products - thus puts the United States into the ''tied aid'' competition. 
Under the practice, which has become an increasingly important factor in winning a foreign sale, industrial countries give an export credit of a low-interest loan or grant to a developing country for a major development project, like a power plant, but with a string attached: the equipment must come exclusively from the donor country.
Many industrial competitors consider the practice a legitimate way of allocating foreign aid. But Washington regards it as unfair export competition and has been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to curb it through international negotiations within the framework of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a forum for the industrial countries.
''We think it's a lousy and costly way to do business,'' said Eugene K. Lawson, vice chairman of the Export-Import Bank, who announced the initiative at a news conference with Reginald J. Brown, assistant administrator for the Agency for International Development, the aid-giving arm of the State Department.
The Ex-Im Bank helps to finance exports of American goods and services by direct lending or the issuing of guarantees and insurance so that exporters and private banks can finance exports without taking undue risks.
But Mr. Lawson went on to say that the initiative, which was approved at a recent Cabinet-level Economic Policy Council headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, was intended to ''attract the attention of our allies.''
 
Serving Notice on Rivals
In effect, the Administration was serving notice that it will fight for markets in the same way as its allies until they agree to curb the practice.
''You have to have a few arrows in your quiver,'' Mr. Lawson said.
The program does not require additional budget allocations. Its importance, as the officials of the Ex-Im Bank and international development agency explained, is that for the first time the funds of the two agencies have been combined in a structured, leveraged effort to win markets.
''We are mindful'' that the international development agency ''is not an export-promotion agency,'' Mr. Brown said. But he added that ''we are confident that we can achieve our development objectives with United States suppliers, United States technology and United States materials.''
The international development agency will be contributing $100 million from its resources in the four countries. The Ex-Im Bank will be providing $100 million from funds that Congress has already authorized to fight foreign tied-aid programs and an additional $300 million from its loan guarantee authority.
The four countries chosen are among the most advanced developing nations and are believed to offer significant market opportunities for American products.
The two agencies said that among the early projects expected to be supported will be those involving the power industry in the Philippines, which has been hit by electricity shortages in recent months. Many of the specific programs for the four countries are expected to be in place by Sept. 30, they said.
Initial reaction was favorable, although both business and Congressional analysts said they were disappointed that the effort was not larger.
''It's something we all have wanted for years,'' said Bruce B. Talley, executive director of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, a lobbying group of export-oriented companies. ''It should have a favorable impact on exports and should also have a maximum visibility and demonstration effect.''
Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Connecticut Democrat who is the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade, said that ''it's an increase over what we have, but it's basically peanuts.'' He added that the United States would still not be providing anywhere near the amount of money for tied-aid programs of competitors such as Japan and France.
Japan's spending involving Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand is estimated at about $2 billion, four times what the United States plans to spend.
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, called the program ''a great step forward'' but said he doubted the money would be enough to get foreign governments to change their ways.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Down 0.4%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Industrial production fell in April for the first time since January, with a sharp drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts, the Federal Reserve Board reported today.
The Fed also said that the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities - which measures not only output but also changes in productivity levels - declined last month from its March level.
''We are accumulating a dossier that the economy lost some momentum during the last month,'' said William Sullivan, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
The new signs of economic sluggishness followed reports last week that retail sales weakened in April while producer prices dropped from March levels, which economists said might encourage Fed policy makers to consider lowering interest rates. 
 
Steep Drop in January
The Fed said industrial production fell in April by four-tenths of 1 percent, marking the first decline since January, when it dropped by a steep 1 percent. The rate rose five-tenths in March and nine-tenths in February, revised from the seven-tenths originally reported for March and the eight-tenths for February.
The Fed said production of autos and light trucks fell by nearly 14 percent in April from March. But excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial output was unchanged in April and has shown little movement since January, the Fed added.
Joseph Carson, an economist at the Chemical Bank, said that when all of the recent figures were analyzed collectively, the greater risk for the economy would be slow growth, not rising inflation. ''What today's data tell us is that the manufacturing sector has yet to hit bottom and that talk of an inventory-led rebound in the economy is mistaken,'' he added.
 
Easier Interest Rates Seen
Mr. Carson said he believed the Fed would not change its credit policy in a hurry, but when it did it would be toward reviving the economy with easier interest rates.
Many economists expect that the Government will announce on Wednesday an April rise in the Consumer Price Index of three-tenths of 1 percent compared with a five-tenths increase in March. The index measures the change in retail prices for housing, food, transportation and electricity.
Today's Fed report said that the production of consumer goods was down by 1 percent in April after rises of nine-tenths of 1 percent in March and 1.1 percent in February. Business equipment, a category also affected by the auto industry, dropped nine-tenths last month after gains of 1.5 percent in March and 1.6 percent in February.
 
Building Supplies Weaker
The Fed said output of construction supplies also weakened in both April and March, erasing gains from last fall and early this year when unseasonably warm weather made it possible for builders to continue projects.
As a result, industrial operations ran at only 83 percent of capacity in April compared with 83.5 percent in March and 83.2 percent in February.
The last time the operating rate for the nation's mines, factories and utilities was lower was in January, when capacity use fell to 82.7 percent because auto producers cut output and laid off workers temporarily while dealers reduced stocks of unsold cars left over from late 1989.
Manufacturing output dropped to 82.2 percent of capacity in April from 82.9 percent in both March and February, the Fed said. Operating rates for auto plants dropped to 65.1 percent in April from 75.6 percent in March.
In contrast, mining output increased to 88.3 percent from 87.4 percent because of gains in the oil and gas sector and continued strength in coal mining, the Fed said.
The operating rates of utility companies were up to 87.1 percent in April from 86.6 percent in March.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Penny-Wise On Ozone?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT was time to ante up last week on the latest global deal to save the ozone layer, and the Bush Administration decided not to play: The White House announced it would not share the cost of weaning poor countries from the use of ozone-depleting chemicals before they became truly addicted. Subsidies to encourage the substitution of nonpolluting gases in air-conditioners, refrigerators and plastic insulation, the Administration suggested, would have to come from the existing resources of the World Bank.
This decision may not have surprised hard-line ''greens'' who have always interpreted President Bush's efforts to find a middle road to environmental virtue as a rationale for pollution as usual. But it bewildered political operatives who viewed American leadership on ozone as an easy way for the President to win points with folks who reach for their checkbooks whenever they see a picture of a baby seal. Perhaps most important, it confounded policy analysts within the Administration who are eager to apply economic principles to pollution control and thought they had an ally in the White House. 
Chlorofluorocarbons - CFC's for short - are cheap, nontoxic gases that are almost perfect as refrigerants and aerosols. Once released, however, they wreak havoc on the layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere that absorbs much of the ultraviolet radiation from sunlight. Most experts believe that a failure to control the production of CFC's and a few related chemicals would lead to dramatic increases in skin cancer and eye cataracts, as well as disrupting plant life at the base of the aquatic food chain. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the projected loss of ozone would lead to an extra 170 million cases of cancer by the year 2075 within the United States alone. The estimated cost in medical bills and premature mortality: $3.5 trillion. That is no misprint: $3.5 trillion.
Happily, though, an ozone fix would be relatively cheap. The E.P.A. estimates that a 50 percent cut in CFC production would eliminate about 95 percent of the damage. And the cost of the switch to less damaging chemicals would run to less than $40 billion. Or perhaps much less: Stephen DeCanio, an economist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, believes that cheaper, more efficient substitutes for CFC's now in the technological pipeline would reduce the cost to about $3 billion.
That is why the Reagan Administration signed onto the Montreal Protocol in 1987, agreeing to cut CFC use in half by the year 2000. Congress later put teeth into the decision, imposing a tax on CFC's that will encourage recycling and substitution, as well as collecting some $5 billion over the next five years. And this year President Bush went a step further, responding to new evidence of accelerating deterioration of the ozone layer by agreeing in principle to a complete phaseout of CFC's.
While the industrialized countries all seem prepared to bear the domestic costs of a rapid phaseout of CFC's, two large potential users, China and India, do not. And their failure to go along would undercut the logic of a global agreement. China alone, Mr. DeCanio notes, plans to produce some 300 million refrigerators over the next few decades.
Consequently, northern Europe has been lobbying hard for a fund to subsidize the transfer of benign refrigeration technologies to the have-nots. And since Washington was asking Americans to spend billions of dollars to rid the country of CFC's, analysts widely assumed the Bush Administration would view its 20 percent slice of a $100 million-a-year carrot as a minuscule price to pay for broad compliance. But something happened to the Administration's position on the way to the latest global forum.
The least implausible explanation for Mr. Bush's tough line is that he fears the precedent. The $20 million token may be enough to convince the poorest third of the world to forgo CFC's. But delivery might lead to demands for a hundred times that much to reduce the use of fossil fuels that are implicated in global warming. Better, then, to rely on the stick rather than the carrot: The Administration wants to make CFC treaty compliance a condition for receiving loans from the World Bank.
But even many of the Administration's friends believe the President's advisers are worrying about the wrong precedent. Since Mr. Bush took office, his economists have been urging caution before committing big bucks to solving poorly understood environmental problems. By failing to act decisively when action plainly does make economic sense, the President is in danger of losing the initiative to those who care not a whit about costs.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Off 8.7% In First 10 Days of May

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 15

 BODY:
A seasonal sales increase expected by automobile makers and dealers has still not materialized, with sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks falling by 8.7 percent in early May.
The eight auto manufacturers operating plants in the United States said today that they sold 185,825 cars in the first 10 days of the month, a decline of 10.4 percent from a year earlier. Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4 million, compared with 7.3 million in the period a year ago, and with 6.8 million in April. There were nine selling days in each May period. 
The spring sales season, usually from April to mid-June, is historically the most important selling period for American auto makers.
The biggest loser early this month was the Chrysler Corporation, whose car sales plunged by 23 percent, to 22,796. The sales of its light trucks and mini-vans, which together account for more than half of Chrysler's total sales, fell by 15.1 percent, to 23,869.
The Ford Motor Company's car sales fell by 19.8 percent, to 48,333, while those of the company's light trucks were down by 9 percent, to 37,394. The only bright spots in Ford's lineup were the sport-utility vehicles, including the Bronco II and Explorer models, and Ford's Aerostar mini-vans.
The General Motors Corporation posted the smallest decline of the large domestic auto makers. The sales of G.M. cars fell by 13.6 percent, to 89,873, but light-truck sales for the period were up by 1.4 percent, to 50,654.
Charles Brady, an automobile analyst with Oppenheimer & Company in New York, noted that G.M. continued to gain market share, mainly at Chrysler's expense.
''A slew of new G.M. products is the primary reason'' for the company's improving sales, he said, ''along with a growing perception that the quality of G.M. vehicles is improving.''
Although analysts said the overall demand for new vehicles is weak, car sales have outpaced production in recent weeks, resulting in lower inventories at most dealerships. The stocks of domestically built cars fell to a 59-day supply by April 30, the lowest level since September, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter. A 60-to-65-day supply is considered normal for dealers.
 
Replenishing Supplies
The lower inventories are a sign that auto makers may need to replenish dealers' supplies of vehicles. But manufacturers' production schedules will also depend on the strength of new-car orders from dealers in the next several weeks.
Some dealers and analysts have suggested that car companies will be forced to idle their factories longer than they have planned during the model change-over in late summer if dealer orders do not increase soon.
Honda of America Inc. reported a 32.3 percent gain in sales of its cars, to 11,238. The Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA Corporation's car sales increased by 81.1 percent, to 1,157.
The Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA Corporation's car sales more than tripled in early May, to 9,118. The gain reflects new production capacity at Toyota's plant in Georgetown, Ky.
Similarly, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation registered an increase of nearly twofold in sales of its cars, as it added production at its venture with Chrysler in Normal, Ill.
The Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corporation's car sales rose by 47.2 percent, to 1,543. The sales of Nissan's light trucks built in the company's plant in Smyrna, Tenn., rose by 39.6 percent, to 2,232.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Issues Dip in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped in quiet trading yesterday, as dealers took profits after the recent strong rally.
The price slide began during overnight trading in Tokyo, where a rise in the value of the yen against the dollar led to a mild selloff. Later, announcements that industrial production fell by four-tenths of a percent in April and that car sales for the first 10 days of May were weak failed to stir any enthusiasm, even though they would be a disincentive for the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates.
''The market feels a little tired, even though it continues to trade very well,'' one Government securities trader said. ''With the Fed on hold for another month at least, it looks to me like prices are at the high end of a very wide trading range that has been established over the last couple of weeks.'' 
The Federal Reserve Board's policy-making Open Market Committee gathered yesterday in Washington, and as the trader suggested, analysts and market participants are virtually unanimous that the Fed will vote to leave monetary policy unchanged.
 
Pessimism Vanishes
''It is premature to think that the Fed is going to ease policy soon,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. ''But the deep pessimism that was so prevalent in the market a couple of weeks ago has been washed out.''
The current positive tone could be shaken if a report today on consumer prices is well above expectations.
Most economists suggest that consumer prices rose by a relatively benign two-tenths of a percent in April, and they expect the Government to announce a three-tenths of a percent increase in the index when food and energy prices are excluded.
The bulk of yesterday's price decline occurred in longer-term notes and bonds, which have rallied strongly over the last two weeks.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 101 15/32, down 13/ 32, to yield 8.61 percent, up four basis points from late Monday, when the new benchmark bond was offered at a price to yield 8.57 percent.
''Given the shift in expectations, it looks like we could be back in the trading range of 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent that we saw a little more than a month ago,'' said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''But if the economy does show more signs of slowing down, we could see further declines. And the chances of that happening are greater now than they were six months ago.''
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 17/32, down 7/32, to yield 8.64 percent. And the 8 5/8 percent three-year notes that were auctioned on May 8 were offered at 100 5/32, down 3/32, to yield 8.56 percent.
 
Bills Are Mixed
Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.63 percent, down two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.65 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.62 percent.
The recent steep drop in interest rates encouraged a number of issuers to price new deals in both the investment-grade corporate bond and in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
Among the competitive deals priced in the municipal bond market yesterday was a $250 million offering of serial and term bonds from the State of Texas.
A bid from a group led by Chase Municipal Securities Inc. won the issue, and the serial bonds were reoffered to investors with coupons ranging from 6.30 percent on securities maturing in 1993 to 7.15 percent on bonds maturing in 2008.
The issue included two term bonds maturing in 2011 and 2020, with coupons of 7.19 percent and 7.24 percent, respectively.
The issue is rated double-A by both Moody's Investors Services and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
A group led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets won a $100 million competitive issue offered by the Los Angeles Water and Power Authority.
Serial bonds maturing from 1996 to 2010 were reoffered to investors with coupons from 6.50 percent to 7.05 percent.
A 7 1/8 percent term bond maturing in 2030 was priced at $99.50 to yield 7.16 percent.
The issue is rated double-A by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
 
Corporate Bonds
In the corporate bond market, Delta Air Lines priced a two-part, $300 million offering through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The first part consisted of $175 million worth of 9 7/8 percent 10-year notes.
The notes, which mature May 15, 2000, were priced at $99.48 to yield 9.958 percent, 1.30 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 8 7/8 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $125 million was offered in the form of 10 1/8 percent 20-year bonds maturing May 15, 2010.
The bonds were priced at $100, and yielded 1.50 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds of 2020 at the time of pricing.
Both parts of the issue were rated A-2 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Traders in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities said the prices of most actively quoted bonds fell by 1/4 point to 1/2 point.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, market participants said the prices of most longer dated issues fell by 3/8 point. Meanwhile, prices of intermediate-term securities were essentially unchanged.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Against Yen; Mark and Pound Weaken

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against the Japanese yen while firming against most other major currencies.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar declined in New York trading to close at 150.83 yen, down from 152.50 on Monday.
The dollar has now fallen almost 6 yen since last Wednesday. The decline has followed economic reports in the United States that showed the economy slowing down, which has led to the expectation that interest rates would not rise and might even decline. Lower interest rates tend to discourage dollar investments. 
The strengthening of the yen, analysts say, also follows the strengthening of European currencies against the dollar in the last two weeks.
In the latest economic report, the Federal Reserve said yesterday that industrial production fell four-tenths of a percent in April, its first decline since January.
Dealers said the market is now focusing on the release of April consumer prices today and March trade data tomorrow for further indications of the direction of the United States economy and interest rates.
Earl Johnson, a currency dealer with the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said the market was predicting higher inflation and a further worsening of the nation's trade deficit.
''We're in a bearish climate right now,'' he said.
The dollar's gains against some of the European currencies reflected continued problems across the Atlantic.
The mark remained under pressure, they said, after the surprisingly weak showing in recent West German state elections by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative party. Those results brought some uncertainty about the pending reunification with East Germany, dealers said.
The dollar rose to 1.6465 West German marks from 1.6428.
The British pound fell against the dollar after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she supported efforts by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, to lower the current official interest rate of 15 percent by the end of the year.
Sterling cost $1.6775 in London, less than the $1.6817 Monday, and $1.6725 in New York, down from $1.6825.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's quotes, included: 1.3980 Swiss francs, up from 1.3915; 5.5540 French francs, up from 5.5360; 1,211.25 Italian lire, up from 1,208.00, and 1.17695 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17715.
Gold prices, meanwhile, rebounded yesterday after falling overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $370.90 an ounce, up $2.50 from late Monday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $370.25 an ounce, up $2.15.
Gold fell in London to $367.75 an ounce, from $369.75, and in Zurich to $367.50 an ounce, from $368.75.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $368.05 an ounce, down from $368.35.
Silver prices declined. Silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.012 an ounce, down from $5.066 Monday. Silver fell in London to $5.07 an ounce from $5.09.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Soybeans Fall for Third Day; Rise in Brazil Exports Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of soybean futures declined sharply yesterday for the third straight day amid profit taking and speculative sales prompted in part by rising Brazilian exports. There are signs that those exports are closing the gap between world supply and demand. 
On other commodity markets, grain futures fell, cocoa futures retreated, oil futures were mixed, precious metals were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
Soybean futures settled 8 cents to 11 1/2 cents lower on the Chicago Board of Trade, with the contract for delivery in May down by 10 1/4 cents at $6.13 1/4 a bushel. The decline extended to about 35 cents the drop in the May soybean contract's price since Thursday, when the Agriculture Department released a report projecting rising American soybean stocks.
Some analysts attributed the weakness to increased soybean exports, especially from Brazil, the world's second-largest producer after the United States. Brazilian shipments have risen in the last 10 days after a monthlong period in which exports of newly harvested soybeans were stalled by confusion over Brazil's harsh economic changes.
Corn futures posted their steepest one-day decline this year after recently advancing on concerns about rain-delayed planting activity.
Wheat futures settled 1 1/4 cents to 2 cents lower in Chicago, with the contract for delivery in May at $3.83 a bushel, corn was 4 1/2 cents to 6 cents lower, with May at $2.84 3/4 a bushel, and oats were half-a-cent lower to a quarter-cent higher, with May at $1.56 a bushel.
Cocoa futures settled mostly lower on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange amid profit taking after Monday's gains. Cocoa settled $14 lower to $6 higher, with May at $1,375 a ton.

Japanese Help Fill Trade Center

BYLINE: By Alan S. Oser

 BODY:
''THANK heavens for the Japanese!'' George Rossi exclaimed. They are making the office leasing numbers look respectable at the World Trade Center.
Mr. Rossi has been the trade center's general manager for sales and leasing for the last 13 months. He has 10 million square feet of office space to think about, and it is no secret that these are not happy days for the downtown Manhattan office market. 
People talk about a vacancy rate there hovering around 14 percent. When secondary, or non-prime, space is considered separately, the rate may be 20 to 25 percent.
But at the World Trade Center, Mr. Rossi is happy to say, the vacancy rate is only 7 percent, or 700,000 square feet, of which 500,000 square feet are available currently. Tenants who now occupy the other 200,000 square feet intend to leave when their leases expire.
Many people have worried that a heightened presence of Japanese interests in the New York City economy symbolizes a setback to American enterprise. But for a landlord who has seen occupancy fall from 98 percent to 93 percent, the increased Japanese presence, particularly the banks, is a blessing.
The trade center's experience helps put in focus the importance of Asian financial institutions to the New York City office market.
By the end of this year, close to 10 percent of the office tenants of the World Trade Center will be Japanese concerns. The figure is 750,000 square feet already.
The leading Japanese banks -among them Fuji Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Yasuda Trust and Banking and Sumitomo Bank Ltd. - occupy 350,000 square feet. That figure will soon go up to 440,000 square feet, Mr. Rossi says.
The trade center's special affinity with the Asian financial world extends beyond its relationship with the Japanese. The total space occupied by all Asian banks, bank-service firms, investment banks and currency traders amounts to 826,000 square feet, compared with 800,000 square feet by similar American institutions and 236,000 square feet by European financial institutions.
The even better news, he says, is the rapid expansion of Japanese regional banks in the United States. They often make the World Trade Center their first location for the away-from-home headquarters.
On a square-foot basis, none of this has compensated for the trade center's occupancy losses. These are mainly a result of the decline in tenants in the shipping business. Many have either closed or moved to less expensive secondary space, Mr. Rossi said.
The center's biggest tenant, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., has left about 300,000 square feet of space since its peak occupancy of 1.3 million square feet in the 1980's. Dean Witter Reynolds has its world headquarters at the World Trade Center.
The biggest loss of all in the 1980's has been the steady departure of New York State agencies. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo set that in motion when he took office for his first term in January 1983.
The state was occupying two million square feet of space at the time. Its agencies had moved in during the dark days of the early 1970's, one of the most dismal real estate markets of New York City's post-Depression history. The trade center was developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and opened in December 1970.
Governor Cuomo thought that state offices ought to be dispersed in less prestigious locations of the city, where rents were lower and office occupancy might give the subcenters an economic lift. The state has been moving out of the World Trade Center ever since. Its occupancy is down to two floors occupied by the Governor's office itself, plus two floors that will be vacated this summer. By the end of this year, the state will occupy less than 100,000 square feet.
Most of the space that the state yielded was re-rented in the mid-1980's in the middle-$30-a-square-foot range, Mr. Rossi said. But in the last two years rents have fallen about $2 a square foot a year; annual rents are now $28 to $40 a square foot.
In recent months the market and the center sustained the additional blow of the shrinkage in the space needs of Shearson American Express, and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Together, those events have put about 750,000 square feet of space that had been committed back on the market.
The silver lining, for the present, is therefore the Japanese expansion. It has a positive effect on downtown employment as well. Although the Trade Center management lacks precise figures, it notices that space leased by Japanese banks is often filled with workers, some occupying cubicles as small as 60 square feet.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
LITHUANIA AGREES TO SUSPEND LAWS ON INDEPENDENCE

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 16

 BODY:
The Lithuanian government formally agreed today to suspend all laws it has passed since its declaration of independence on March 11 and to discuss a transition period to full separation from the Soviet Union, officials of the republic said tonight.
The offer, prepared in a closed-door session of the Parliament and Cabinet, was the Lithuanians' most concerted attempt so far to persuade President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to lift his partial economic embargo and begin negotiations.
The Lithuanian Prime Minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, was to fly to Moscow on Thursday bearing the government declaration and a letter to Mr. Gorbachev. It was not clear whether she would be met by Kremlin officials or whether Moscow would accept the gesture as an opportunity to end the standoff. Respite for Gorbachev, Too? Mr. Gorbachev would presumably welcome a chance to end the economic sanctions against Lithuania, which could cast a pall over his meeting with President Bush in Washington. That meeting is to begin May 30, about the time that Lithuania expects to exhaust the last of its oil reserves. 
As the Lithuanians met, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union started talks in Moscow on obstacles blocking a series of arms control agreements in advance of the summit. But the increasingly unstable situation in the Soviet Baltic republics threatened to derail their efforts. [Page A10.] The proposal by the Lithuanians essentially embraced a compromise proposed last month by France and West Germany, which called for Lithuania to suspend the enforcement of its independence proclamation without actually repealing it.
 
Graceful Retreat for All
When the proposal was made by President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania and a Kremlin spokesman both praised it as a possible escape from the deadlock.
But since then, Mr. Gorbachev has insisted that Lithuania return to its status of March 10, the day before it broke with Moscow, and follow secession procedures spelled out in a new Soviet law. This would require approval of independence by referendum, a transition period of up to five years, and final approval by the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies.
Lithuania and its neighboring Baltic republics, Latvia and Estonia, were annexed by Stalin in 1940 under a secret protocol to a pact with Hitler. The three republics say they were illegally incorporated and therefore will not submit to Soviet sovereignty.
An estimated 30,000 people in Lithuania have been laid off or sent on unscheduled vacations since Mr. Gorbachev cut off oil, most natural gas, and various other supplies to the republic.
The Lithuanians declined to disclose the text of their offer, but as explained by officials, it called for the suspension of the secession laws after Moscow agreed to begin negotiations and provided assurances that it would make no moves to supplant the current leadership of the republic.
Among the measures that would be suspended are several that Moscow has cited as particularly offensive, including those abolishing the Soviet military draft and laying claim to national property.
''Basically, it's the offer Mitterrand and Kohl suggested,'' said Rita Dapkus, a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian Parliament. ''We would be prepared to temporarily suspend the unilateral realization of those resolutions, which arise from the act of restoring state independence.''
The proposal also offers to discuss an unspecified transition period to full sovereignty, to guarantee the rights of Soviet citizens in Lithuania, and to negotiate on Moscow's security concerns, which include the fate of military bases and Baltic ports.
After Lithuania declared a clean break with Moscow on March 11, Estonia announced on March 30 that it would make a step-by-step withdrawal from Soviet law. On May 4, Latvia made its declaration, apparently intended to minimize confrontation with Moscow. It established an open-ended transition period to independence, during which most Soviet laws would apply.
Lithuania's offer today would put it more into line with the gradual approach adopted by Latvia and Estonia. Mr. Gorbachev this week rebuffed the more conciliatory approach of those two republics, issuing decrees declaring their actions invalid. But he has so far not imposed sanctions on them.
Anti-independence groups stormed the Parliament buildings in Latvia and Estonia on Tuesday.
Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar of Estonia, in a telegram to Mr. Baker at the outset of his visit to Moscow, described the incident in the republic as an ''attempted coup,'' and urged the Secretary of State to take up the issue in his talks with the Soviet leadership.
In Riga, The Associated Press quoted Deputy Prime Minister Ilmars Bisers of Latvia as saying that a delegation from the republic expected to have mid-level meetings in Moscow on the situation. Mr. Bisers, speaking today after returning to the Latvian capital from his own Moscow discussions, said talks with Soviet officials would focus on ''the gaining of independence on the basis of a treaty with the Soviet Union.''

HEADLINE: PSYCHIATRISTS UNDER PRESSURE: A SPECIAL REPORT:
HEALTH;
New Paths to Mental Health Put Strains on Some Healers

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
Many psychiatrists say they are seeing fewer patients and drawing less satisfaction from their work than ever before. Some are leaving the profession or moving to areas where the competition for patients is less fierce. And the number of newcomers to the profession is dwindling.
The signs are of a slump rather than a terminal condition, and the causes of the problem are clear:
* There are more non-psychiatrist therapists than ever, and they are willing to offer many of the same services to patients for a fraction of what a psychiatrist would charge. Indeed, many observers of the mental-health field believe that the increased competition is good for patients, although some psychiatrists dispute that.
* Bastions of psychiatric privilege are under siege: psychiatrists can no longer exclude other therapists from training in the most prestigious psychoanalytic institutes, and psychologists are battling for the rights to prescribe medication and to admit patients to psychiatric hospitals on their own, rather than under the supervision of psychiatrists. 
* Aggressive companies that manage mental health payments for insurers are slicing reimbursements for psychiatric care, often by half or more. Sessions on such companies were among the best attended - and saw some of the hottest debate - at the 143d annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in New York, which is ending today.
* Insurance companies are now giving priority to short-term therapy focused on a single problem, rather than to long-term treatment, often lasting years, that was the bread-and-butter of many psychiatrists' practices.
* Compensation for psychiatrists remains relatively low. Their median salary in 1988, the last year for which figures are available, was $97,000. Although most Americans would feel amply paid at that salary, it was below all other medical specialties except family practice and pediatrics.
The median income for all physicians was $120,000, with half earning more and half earning less. From 1981 to 1988, psychiatrists' salaries lost ground to all other medical specialties except family practice and radiology.
''For the first time, psychiatrists have to justify their very existence to those who pay their patients' bills, to government, to other physicians,'' said Dr. Boris Rifkin, a psychiatrist at Yale who is on the American Psychiatric Association's committee on private practice. ''It's demoralizing.''
Herbert Klein, publisher of Psychotherapy Finances, a newsletter in Ridgewood, N.J., that tracks the mental health field. said, ''It's a dogfight out there.''
 
The Battle Lines
The main battle is between psychiatrists, who have medical degrees, and psychologists, social workers and other counselors with other kinds of professional degrees. All these disciplines practice psychotherapy, or ''talking cures'' for emotional problems, although only pyschiatrists can prescribe drugs. Psychoanalysis, the method of treatment developed by Freud and stressing the role of childhood conflicts, is one psychotherapy that is having particular difficulty in the new economic climate, largely because effective psychoanalysis requires frequent visits for many years.
Because of the pressure psychiatrists feel, ''you have to see more patients for less time, rather than having deeper, longer relationships with fewer patients,'' said Seymour Gers, a psychiatrist in Manhattan. ''The turnover means you just don't get the emotional satisfaction you once did for the amount of work you have to put in these days. Since psychiatry is not a big money-maker, the question is why go into it these days?''
In fact, psychiatry is attracting far fewer medical residents than it did in years past. ''Our peak year was 1969,'' said Dr. Melvin Sabshin, medical director of the the American Psychiatric Association. Numbers ''dropped steadily until a few years ago,'' when they began to rise again, he said, but ''it's down a bit this year, which worries us.''
In the long term, the prognosis for psychiatry is good, Dr. Sabshin said. There is increasingly strong evidence that maladies like schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and many forms of depression are largely biological, and that psychiatric medications are more effective than ever before in treating them, he said. ''The budgets for psychiatric research have increased considerably over the last few years, to their highest levels ever,'' he said. ''That should pay off in the years to come with new medications and other treatments.''
But while there are optimistic signs, he added, ''there's no question that the new economics creates a problem.'' Temptations Questionable Ways To Generate Money In extreme cases, psychiatrists are resorting to questionable or unethical practices to generate income in hard times.
''There was a woman in her 11th year of psychotherapy whose main problem was loneliness,'' said Nicholas Cummings, a psychologist and chairman of American Biodyne in South San Francisco, a company that manages mental health costs for insurers. The doctor charged $175 a session, Dr. Cummings said, but the patient said ''that for the last seven or eight years she and her psychiatrist had not talked about anything serious - just what each of them had done that week.''
''She was in love with him,'' Dr. Cummings said. ''Seeing him was the one exciting contact in her life.''
Another psychiatrist, Dr. Cummings said, charged $125 for a full therapy session with a woman who came for just 10 minutes, instead of the usual 50, to maintain a relationship with a therapist.
''She said she stayed with the psychiatrist because she was convinced she was mentally ill, and he was kind to her,'' said Dr. Cummings. ''She felt that when she had the nervous breakdown she feared one day, he at least would not give her electroshock therapy. The psychiatrist sensed the woman would never blow the whistle. It was a cozy arrangement for him.''
 
Preferred the Hospital
In another case, reviewed by a prominent Los Angeles psychiatrist for an insurance company, a psychiatrist admitted a young woman with symptoms of ''borderline'' personality to a psychiatric hospital, where he kept her in treatment for two years. As long as she remained in the hospital, the psychiatrist could get $1,000 a week from her insurance company by seeing her every day in the hospital. If he treated her in his office, though, he could collect for just one visit a week, at $125.
Whenever she started to get better, the psychiatrist treated her with a drug that induces a trance-like state. ''She would fall apart, become suicidal and would have to stay in the hospital,'' said the psychiatrist who reviewed the case for an insurance company. ''There's no doubt in my mind he had a vested interest in keeping her in the hospital, where he wouldn't have if his own practice had been thriving.'' The case is still under review.
To be sure, a vast majority of psychiatrists do not take advantage of their patients. And such ethical violations are not unique to psychiatrists.
But in the past, ethical violations were more often about abuses of power, like having sex with patients. Many psychiatrists see these new cases as evidence of a trend among colleagues driven to questionable practices purely because of the new financial squeeze.
''The attitude out there is that if you find a patient with good coverage, you go after him,'' said Dr. Spencer Eth, a psychiatrist at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''There's no question some patients are being exploited.'' Turf Battles Fighting Off Psychologists Psychiatrists are fighting off psychologists, who want to be granted the right to prescribe medications for their patients. In a crucial experiment, the Department of Defense plans to train a group of psychologists to prescribe medication. The pilot program is under medical supervision, but if it is successful, psychologists would seek changes in regulations that would allow them to prescribe on their own.
That idea draws immediate fire from most psychiatrists. ''Would you want your medications managed by someone who had a 30-day summer school course in psychiatric prescribing?'' said Dr. Jonathan L. Schwartz, editor-in-chief of Psychiatric Times. ''It makes me very nervous.'' Another key battle is being waged between psychiatrists and psychologists in California over the right to admit patients to hospitals. A court ruling in July by the California Supreme Court will determine whether to give hospital privileges to psychologists.
Still another erosion of psychiatric earning power looms on July 1, when psychologists and social workers will become eligible for reimbursement by Medicare for therapy with the elderly. ''Until now, you had to be under the supervision of a psychiatrist or physician in a hospital, but now psychologists and social workers can get paid directly for therapy in their private practice,'' said Mr. Klein of Psychotherapy Finances newsletter. The Resources Who Pays for What With Money Tight?
Those taking a hard look at mental health costs argue that the challenges to psychiatry are a good development. Dr. Bernard Rapaport, a psychiatrist and medical director of American Biodyne, agreed.
''We don't think psychologists can prescribe or supervise hospitalization as well as psychiatrists,'' said Dr. Rapaport. But, he said, ''given the limited resources available, we have to apportion mental health money more reasonably, in a way that benefits patients and those who pay their bills.''
''There are a broad range of skills and abilities among mental health professionals,'' he said, ''and you don't need medical school training to do psychotherapy when there's no biological disorder. Social workers or psychologists can do it at lower cost.
''Insurers and others who foot the bill are now saying, Wait a minute, why pay a psychiatrist $120 an hour when I can pay a social worker $50 or less for the same service?''
Other pressure is coming from medical plans, like health maintenance organizations, which contract with psychiatrists to take referrals. ''A big H.M.O. here in Berkeley has 100,000 patients, including all the faculty at the University,'' said Dr. Rapaport. ''If I agree to become a preferred provider and get referrals from them, I have to agree to accept $64 for a therapy hour. That's about half my normal fee.'' Changes in Insurance Psychoanalysts and other psychiatrists whose practice was based on a small number of patients who came several times a week over several years are among those struggling the most.
''Fewer and fewer patients are looking for that kind of treatment, and insurance companies are refusing to pay for it,'' said Dr. Larry Rockland, a psychiatrist at Cornell University Medical School in Westchester County.
In 1982, a key insurance program for Federal employees cut back its coverage of psychotherapy from 80 percent for all visits to no more than half the cost up to a maximum of 50 visits. Since then other insurance companies, like Blue Cross, have followed suit, with some cutting back even more.
Until about 10 years ago, it was not unusual for an insurance plan to cover 80 percent of psychotherapy's costs, even for patients who visited a psychiatrist several times a week. Today, such plans are very rare. A common ''high option,'' or more expensive, plan at Blue Cross offers to pay for 75 percent of a maximum of 50 therapy sessions in a year, with a lifetime maximum of $75,000. A typical ''low option'' plan covers 50 percent of the cost of 25 sessions a year, with a lifetime cap of $25,000. The specifics vary from employer to employer and state to state.
''The changes have been devastating for psychoanalysts,'' said Dr. Rockland. ''In Maryland, Blue Cross is moving to eliminate coverage of psychoanalysis altogether,'' said Dr. Harold Eist, president of the American Association of Private Practicing Psychiatrists, based in Washington. ''They claim it's not a medical expense at all.''
Dr. Eist and other psychiatrists contend that the cutbacks are Draconian, cheating patients who need long-term care as well as the psychiatrists who would treat them. The Response Hard Choices In Hard Times Largely because of such cutbacks, many psychiatrists in private practice are having to seek part-time work because they can no longer fill their schedule with patients. While some are having to move away from the most desirable areas - San Francisco, West Los Angeles, Boston and Manhattan - others are leaving the field altogether.
''We have a training and supervising analyst - at the pinnacle of the psychoanalytic community - doing part-time emergency work at a local hospital because he can't fill his hours with analytic patients,'' said Dr. Eth.
Part of the competition for patients comes from a sharp increase in the numbers of other therapists, particularly in more affluent areas. ''Here in Marin County, everybody and his brother seems to be a therapist,'' said Dr. Seymour Boorstein, a psychiatrist in Kentfield, Calif. ''They charge less and promise more than psychiatrists.''
 
Some Go to Small Towns
The story is the same across the country. Dr. Rockland said, ''In Westchester County it's not only crowded with other psychiatrists, but there are increasing numbers of non-medical therapists who charge lower fees.''
There are no precise figures on the numbers of psychiatrists who are moving away from the more crowded areas, or out of the field altogether, but some psychiatrists report signs of migration.
''In Washington, D.C., I know of 10 psychiatrists we've lost; they just couldn't make it any longer in private practice,'' Dr. Eist said. ''Some moved into hospital or clinic practice, some moved away, and some left psychiatry entirely.''
''This year two psychiatrists in West Los Angeles packed up and moved away to less competitive areas,'' said Dr. Eth. ''One went to Delaware, another to a small town in Arizona. There's more competition here than ever.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Jobless to Soar in a Free-Market East, C.I.A. Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency said today that it foresaw soaring unemployment in Eastern Europe as countries there broke up state monopolies and adopted free-market economic principles.
In its first comprehensive report on the region's economic problems, the agency said that ''unemployment could easily exceed 1.5 million in Poland - 9 percent of the work force'' - by the end of this year.
Moreover, the agency said that unemployment might be in the range of 15 percent to 20 percent in Yugoslavia and East Germany and would be ''5 percent or more'' in Bulgaria and Hungary.
The total output of goods and services for Eastern Europe declined last year for the region as a whole and for every country in the region except Czechoslovakia and East Germany, the C.I.A. said in a report to Congress. 
 
Drop in Living Standards Seen
The report was prepared at the request of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Senator Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the panel's Subcommittee on Technology and National Security, first suggested the study. The C.I.A. has done similar reports on economic developments in the Soviet Union and China every year since 1974.
The new report is an antidote to any romantic notions about East Europe's economic future. ''Overall economic growth in the region is likely to deteriorate further in the short term,'' it said, and economic ''performance may be poorest in those countries pushing reform the hardest: Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia.''
Indeed, it said, ''Economic performance and living standards - particularly in Poland, Romania and Bulgaria - are likely to decline in the near term.''
The agency said that the economic problems of Eastern Europe resulted, in part, from decades of Communist mismanagement. But in a curious way, it said, the Soviet Union had helped prop up the economies of Eastern Europe, and that crutch is now being taken away.
 
Loss of Raw Materials
As East European countries declare economic independence from Moscow, they lose the benefit of oil, coal and other raw materials sold on exceedingly favorable terms, with sizable long-term credits, the C.I.A. said.
Eastern Europe still conducts about 40 percent of its trade with the Soviet Union, and energy imports from the Soviet Union account for 25 percent of the region's total energy consumption, the report said. Looking to the future, the C.I.A. said that East European officials expect that a united Germany will replace the Soviet Union as ''the area's dominant economic partner.''
The agency warned, ''Unemployment is likely to soar if the new governments vigorously pursue plans to break up large single-enterprise state monopolies, restructure their economies away from noncompetitive heavy industries to light manufacturing and consumer-goods industries, eliminate state subisidies and let the market determine winners and losers.''
 
'Romania at the Back'
Among the seven countries covered in its report, the C.I.A. said that standards of living were highest in East Germany and Czechoslovakia and lowest in Romania, which still suffers from the ''disastrous economic legacy'' of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
The report said that economic ''reform programs and actions have advanced the furthest in Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia.'' Changes have occurred much more slowly in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, with ''Romania at the back of the reform pack,'' it said.
To estimate the standard of living in a country, economists use various statistics including per capita gross national product, which measures the total output of goods and services in relation to the country's population. For the United States, per capita G.N.P. was $21,036 last year.
For Eastern Europe as a whole, per capita G.N.P. was 27 percent of the American figure. By this measure, East Germany had the highest standard of living in Eastern Europe, with 46 percent of that of the United States.
It was followed, in order, by Czechoslovakia (with 37 percent), Hungary (29 percent), Bulgaria (27 percent), Yugoslavia (26 percent), Poland (22 percent) and Romania (16 percent).
The gap between Eastern Europe and the West has widened since 1975, when its per capita output was 32 percent of that in the United States.
Senator Bingaman, a Democrat from New Mexico, said the countries of Eastern Europe faced a ''long and arduous'' struggle to achieve economic well-being. ''While nothing could be more welcome than the liberation of Eastern Europe from Communism and Soviet domination, there is simply no time to be euphoric,'' he said. ''Many countries of the region are in for a period of recession and economic crises. Things will likely get worse before they improve.''
The report, ''Eastern Europe: Long Road Ahead to Economic Well-Being,'' said that most countries in the region would get a ''peace dividend'' as they reduce their armed forces and the production of tanks and other weapons.
But the C.I.A. said the countries of Eastern Europe had only begun to grapple with an ''explosive'' issue: how to distribute the wealth accumulated by the state over the last 40 years.
Already, it said, many people in Eastern Europe complain that government-owned factories, real estate and farms are being sold swiftly, at low prices, to corrupt Communists who held senior positions in the party or the state bureaucracy.

HEADLINE: BUSH PRESSES CASE FOR MANAGUA AID

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Trying to force Congress's hand on aid to Panama and Nicaragua, President Bush said today that delayed action on a relief package compelled him to reject an emergency loan to Nicaragua. He demanded that lawmakers approve the aid before taking a Memorial Day holiday next week.
Mr. Bush, speaking at a broadcast news conference, used dire language to press his case, calling Nicaragua's situation ''critical,'' with the Government ''absolutely bankrupt and strikes and demonstrations in the streets.'' He suggested that failure to pass the pending $720 million relief package for Panama and Nicaragua would risk destroying ''the hopes for freedom in these two fledgling democracies.'' 
The bill provides $320 million in economic aid to Panama and another $400 million in economic aid to Nicaragua.
The President said he had turned down a request by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua for a $40 million emergency loan. But, turning the blame on Congress, he insisted that his ''hands are tied.'' The Treasury Department said today that the Federal Gold and Reserve Act of 1934 requires payment guarantees for such loans and all Nicaragua had to offer was the unapproved aid program.
 
Threat to Veto Bill
Mr. Bush said that if lawmakers did not enact the aid bill by their Memorial Day recess, he would ''call on the Congress to remain in session until it completes action on a bill that I can sign.''
But he stopped short of a real threat to use his constitutional powers to call Congress to a special session. And despite his urgent tones about the situation in Central America, he repeated his threat to veto the bill if it is not stripped of an amendment on financing for abortion in the District of Columbia.
The Central American aid package has been pending in Congress since March 13 and has been slowed by legislative maneuvering. In the Senate, lawmakers attached to the bill amendments on abortion financing and the use of the death penalty in Washington, along with hundreds of millions of dollars for domestic spending programs unrelated to Panama or Nicaragua. The aid is tied to a second bill in the House that includes a provision cutting military aid to the Government of El Salvador in half.
The President's remarks came as Democratic and Republican lawmakers worked in conference committees to remove some of those obstacles and the remarks immediately drew fire from Democrats on Capitol Hill.
 
Baltics and Summit Meeting
Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who chairs the House Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, called Mr. Bush's comments a ''cheap shot.''
Mr. Obey said: ''I find it quaint that the President was willing to use the bully pulpit to ask us for money for foreign aid when he was not willing to spell out the reasons that caused him to change his position on taxes. I also think it is peculiar for the President to attack the Congress when he knew full well that we were going into conference this very afternoon to resolve the foreign aid issues.''
At the news conference, Mr. Bush also said:
* The standoff between Moscow and the Baltic republics over their demand for independence ''certainly puts some tension'' on his coming meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But he tempered that by saying he was determined to press ahead with the summit meeting. ''We have negotiated with the Soviets when all of Eastern Europe was in captivity,'' Mr. Bush said.
* He had not decided whether to continue most-favored-nation trade benefits for China, which are renewed annually. He said he did ''not want to send a signal that we're happy with the human-rights record'' of the Beijing Government, but sounded generally positive about extending the trade benefits by the June 3 deadline.
* He saw no sign that the recent release of two hostages in Lebanon signaled the start of a process that would free the others. He said that he was continuing efforts to encourage Iran to help free the remaining hostages, but that he saw ''no reason to be encouraged that the process is under way.''
* The United States could live without its military base rights in the Philippines if that country extracts too high a price in the current negotiations on a new basing agreement. Mr. Bush said he was exploring alternative basing arrangements in the Pacific.
 
'That Mischievous Language'
Although Mr. Bush's primary aim in raising the Nicaragua-Panama aid bill at the news conference was swift passage, he was equally anxious to avoid vetoing it over amendments and riders attached to the legislation.
Congress tried last year to force Mr. Bush to approve an expansion of financing for abortions for impoverished women in Washington, using the city Government's money, by attaching the provision to aid for Poland, which Mr. Bush wanted badly.
After Mr. Bush vetoed the amendment, Democrats attached it to the Central American aid package. ''I will not accept the Nicaragua-Panama bill with that mischievous language placed on it,'' Mr. Bush said today.
He did not mention another amendment, that one Republican-sponsored, that would expand the use of the death penalty in Washington.
Since the aid package was the first spending bill to reach Congress this year, it has become a magnet for domestic spending programs, including food stamps, disaster relief and veterans' benefits.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Bush News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Issues

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference yesterday in Washington, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
Well, today I'm making an urgent appeal to Congress to come to the assistance of the peoples of Nicaragua and Panama. I announced my original request for $500 - $500 million in assistance to Panama on Jan. 25, and on March 13 I submitted my modified request for $800 million for both Nicaragua and Panama. At the time of submission I asked the Congress for passage of the legislation by April 5. When that date passed, I asked for passage in time for Violeta Chamorro's inauguration on April 25. I also asked members of Congress, in public and in private, that the bill not be loaded up with extraneous items. And members of our Administration have met with the Congress to explain the content and the urgency of this request. 
But the Easter recess came and went with no passage. And moreover, the bill has tripled in size as extraneous items have been piled onto it. Even worse, the additional amendments include provisions that I vetoed as recently as last fall -provisions that have absolutely nothing to do with Nicaragua and Panama. And I've met repeatedly with the leadership of both Houses of the Congress to urge rapid passage. In the last several days I've shared with them the contents of this letter that I received from President Chamorro of Nicaragua, pleading for prompt passage.
The situation in Nicaragua is critical. Mrs. Chamorro's Government is absolutely bankrupt, and there are strikes and demonstrations in the streets. She's asked me for an emergency bridge loan, but I can't provide that because the Nicaraguans have no assured means of repayment. And our hands are tied and I can't provide a loan anchored on legislation which is not assured.
Panama is also in dire need of the jump-start that our assistance will give to enable it to recover from the economic devastation of the Noriega dictatorship.
We're now facing the Memorial Day recess without the assurance that this legislation will be passed. I'd like the legislation this week, certainly early next week. But I will call on the Congress to remain in session until it completes action on a bill that I can sign. We must not let this procedural gridlock in the Congress destroy the hopes for freedom in these two fledgling democracies.
I feel very strongly about it and I will again appeal to Congress to get moving on this bill.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Strategic Arms Talks
 
Q. Mr. President, officials accompanying Secretary of State Baker to Moscow say the Soviets have backtracked on earlier agreements on arms control. Does it appear unlikely that you'll have the outlines of a Start treaty to sign at the summit, and how much of a setback would that be?
 
A. Terry, I don't - I wouldn't say that it appears unlikely. I have not heard from Jim Baker since the talks have started in Moscow. I expect we'll be hearing pretty soon, but I would not predict that this, these matters cannot be resolved in time for the summit. But if they're not, we're going to keep on because we want a Start agreement and I'm convinced the Soviets want a Start agreement.
 
Baltic Tensions
 
Q. How much of a cloud has been put over the summit by the tension, the Soviet pressure on the Baltic states?
 
A. Well, I'll be able to answer that a little more after, after Jim comes back from Moscow, but I'd say that it, it has certainly put some tension on the summit. We, we want to see negotiations or dialogue or whatever you call it, discussions, between Gorbachev and the Lithuanians get going. And then I'd like to see the release of that economic pressure on Lithuania. And that would clear the air fast. But until something like that happens, there will be tension.
But we have a broad agenda of, of items that we must go forward on. And we've negotiated with the Soviets when, when all of Eastern Europe was in captivity, and when we had cold war times. And I, I'm unhappy about the state of play in the Baltics because I'd like, like to see them attain their, their desire of, of freedom as soon as possible. But I feel it's important from our standpoint, the important standpoint of Eastern European countries and Western European allies and indeed, the whole world, that we have these discussions with Mr. Gorbachev. And I look forward to them very much, and I particularly look forward to the private ones where, where I can, I can get a better feel for the problems facing him and I can tell him of our priorities in a, in a very frank setting. Helen.
 
Talks on the Budget
 
Q. Mr. President, the Democratic leaders who came out of yesterday's first round of the budget talks indicated that before they're going to advance any proposals at all for dealing with the problem, they want to hear first the Administration's discussion of how grave the problem is and then an Administration proposal or set of proposals for dealing with it. Does the Administration have ready a set of budget proposals that would address the deficit fully?
 
A. Not fully, but Dick Darman has already begun discussions after yesterday's meeting with Congressman Gephardt. And I think that the negotiation can go forward so that both sides come to the table, say what they think and we get an agreement. I'm confident we can get one, but this mandating who does what first, that's not going to get the job done. . . .
In terms of the magnitude of the problem, I do feel that we have an obligation to be sure the Congressmen understand it. But in, Brit, in this sense of going out right now to the American people, I want to go out when we have a bipartisan answer to the problem, say here's what the problem is, and here's what the answer. And if I go out there today, we don't have a bipartisan answer and that's the only way this problem's going to be solved. It's not going to be done one party or another. And it is urgent enough and when the Congress sees the data and the estimates and then C.B.O. and O.M.B. work with the estimates, I'm convinced that we'll have a, enough of a sense of urgency that we'll go forward and get a deal.
 
Q. Well, Mr. President, surely you must recognize that part of the reason why they're so wary is that they heard what they thought were conflicting signals from the Administration last week, you saying no preconditions, Governor Sununu suggesting something quite otherwise. First of all, what happened there and second, what did you say to him about that?
 
A. I haven't said anything to him about it but I've heard conflicting signals out of Congress from the first day I said no condition; people trying to interpret what that meant, and a wide array of blasts out of Congress on both sides of the aisle. But it doesn't help for me to do anything other than to cool it down and say, look, we've got a big problem. Here's the problem, let me explain it to you all as best O.M.B. can. You tell us how C.B.O. sees it. Then let's, as Lyndon said, reason together and try to get a deal. And then make sure the American people understand how serious it is.
But, Brit, I'm not going to go out there and try to do something that might inadvertently suggest crisis and frighten markets. What I think we ought to do is come up, get agreement on the size of the problem and then have a bipartisan answer. And this is very sensitive stuff. Right now the markets are reasonably - reasonably optimistic and there are reasons to be optimistic about the economy. I've seen - earlier on there were some predictions of recession, but right now it appears that most economists don't think there'll be a recession.
So we're blessed by dealing with this problem at a time of some growth - not the robust growth that some of us would like to see, but with some growth. And yet there are still some concerns on the part of the Fed and others on inflation, so I don't want to - to inadvertently send the wrong signals to the markets. Yes, Charles.
 
Dim Outlook on Cuts
 
Q. Mr. President, Mr. Darman has already indicated that there is little probability of getting all the cuts that are necessary in a problem that's estimated at $100 billion. What is your predisposition toward stretching out or amending Gramm-Rudman so that you can do this at a more measured pace?
 
A. Charles, I hate to - it's a very good question, very direct, and I'm not going to answer it. Because I am not going to go out there with a lot of suggestions to part of the problem. And I've said that. I've agreed wtih the Congress, I think they're not supposed to do that either. So we will discuss our discussions in private and then we will have recommendations that might be part of it, because the problem is pretty big. But I don't have a position on that because I've said there are no preconditions.
 
Q. Well, sir, actually your spokesman, Mr. Fitzwater, has listed some conditions. He says you wouldn't --
 
A. Down with him, down! He's --
 
Q. -- the budget deficit and he wouldn't advocate any solutions that would be a drag on the economy. My question to you is: Can you be persuaded that a tax exists that would not be a drag on the economy? Do you know of any such taxes?
 
A. John, you're trying to get me to do that which just one second ago I said I wouldn't do. And I'm trying to negotiate and to keep the negotiating process in good faith, but I just can't - if I start going into answering questions like that, no matter how much merit they have, then I start having conditions, or preconditions. And I can't do that and deal in good faith with Congress.
 
Q. May I ask you your concept of leadership on this? You will not advocate any solutions, you will not go on prime-time television and spell out the nature of the budget defi-cit --
 
A. At the appropriate time, I will.
 
Q. When will that be?
 
A. I don't know, we've got to get on with what I told you the process is. And the process is not setting preconditions. And the process is to go forward in good faith with the Congress. And I think they're dealing in good faith, I believe that the two leaders I've been dealing with want this process to go forward in this way.
 
Urgency on Budget
 
Q. Mr. President, if I could return to the budget negotiations for a second, there's a lot of speculation without getting into details about the negotiations about why you personally decided the matter was urgent enough now to resort to this process. Is it because you're afraid interest rates might stop the economic growth that you want so much? Is it because the automatic spending cuts would be too painful for the country to absorb? Or are you just frustrated that the deficit continues to restrict your ability to maneuver on a lot of issues?
 
A. Well, I think - I want to say almost all of the above, but it's really that when you take a look at the most recent estimates - and one of the ingredients in the shortfall has been interest rates - is that the problem is of such a magnitude that we need to address it. It's more that than it is a fear of any specific category. It's just big enough that we have to do something about it, and that's why I've taken the approach I've taken.
And I think - but in here, you see, it is a place where we need to get understanding from the American people. But I want to go there saying, Look, here's the problem. Everybody's agreed on it now, we're not going to have some new organization come in and argue with the estimates - and that means getting C.B.O. and the O.M.B. together as much as possible. Here's the bipartisan answer. They can compromise here, give and take there, and this is what we must do as a nation on the deficit. 
 
Good Faith in Talks
 
Q. Mr. President, many of the participants from yesterday's budget meeting came out shaking their heads and scratching their heads in frustration at the size of the problem that you just talked about, the magnitude of this deficit problem, and the lack of trust that appeared to be in the room. In fact, one of the participants said they all turned back their papers that they had written notes on so that no one would be able to quote from them. And they all said that it's going to take a lot of leadership --
 
A. That was a heartening development, Jessica.
 
Q. -- a lot of leadership. I'm wondering what is it that you think that you can do that can move the atmosphere forward, the atmosphere of trust first of all, so that people will believe in the good faith that you are expressing?
 
A. . . . I don't think people think I'm trying to blindside them in the Congress. That might have been early on when I first said let's go, no preconditions. But I didn't get the feeling of, of distrust and when people headed, handed the papers back it was so the process could work in an orderly fashion. And it wasn't the Republicans that suggested it as I recall. It was a Democratic leader said, let's leave these and let our, our group that's going to meet on Thursday discuss these matters and discuss it in a, in a, you know, as quiet a surrounding as possible without having a big flurry out there surrounding the discussions. . . . I interpreted that as a determination to work together. . . .
 
Stalemate on Taxes
 
Q. But they all say that there's a stalemate about how to address the one side of the equation, the tax side of the equation. It's going to take leadership to move things. Someone's going to have to move first. . . .
 
A. That's what the process will do. No tricks in the bag, but when you start a negotiation, a labor management negotiation they get behind closed doors and they say, now look, here's our view and what is yours and reasonable people go forward and try to, try to negotiate. So I think the Democrats did come down, some of them, saying well, you should go first. And I said to them, wait a minute, who appropriates all the money, where's the revenue, who's got the obligation under the, under the Constitution to raise the revenue. So let's not talk about who's going first, we got a problem. We have a national problem. And I want to be a part of having the American people understand the problem and I want to have an answer to the American people that I know can, can, can work. And it's not going to work with just Republicans or just the White House or just the Democrats. . . . I'm going to try to keep my share of the bargain by not discussing what we might do or might not do, what my bottom line is, what my opening wedge is. Because once I do that, you'll have 435 people in the House doing it and 100 in the Senate. And that isn't the way we're going to solve this national problem.

HEADLINE: Cautious Bush Says Urgency of Deficit Impelled Him to Seek Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
In his first public explanation of why he initiated budget negotiations with Congress, President Bush said today that the deficit problem had become ''urgent enough'' that it needed to be addressed now, while the economy was reasonably strong.
But Mr. Bush, speaking at a news conference, declined to describe the nature of the problem or to say what he wanted to do about it.
''I don't want to inadvertently send the wrong signals to the markets,'' the President declared, repeating what he said in private to Congressional leaders on Tuesday in the first session of the negotiations.
Mr. Bush's refusal to make his case in detail and in prime time on television was challenged today by Democratic legislators. They maintain that Mr. Bush, and Ronald Reagan before him, sold a bill of goods to the public about the strength of the economy and the virtue of low taxes and say Mr. Bush is unwilling to take the political heat necessary to rectify past mistakes. Smoke and Mirrors? ''What we're seeing is a recognition of what has been a continuing crisis,'' said Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, chairman of the House Budget Committee. ''What we feel needs to be done is for the President to make a presentation to the American public. The problem is serious, and you can't use smoke and mirrors to get around it any longer.'' 
Democratic lawmakers told Mr. Bush on Tuesday that they would have trouble selling unpopular measures to their constituents if he did not make his own case in a televised address. Asked at his news conference why he did not do so, Mr. Bush said, ''I'm not going to go out there and do something that might inadvertently suggest crisis and frighten the markets.''
Mr. Bush also refused to say whether he had changed his mind about opposing all new taxes. But he said his Administration and Congress had to be careful not to cut spending or raise taxes so much that the economy would be damaged.
In his first 15 months in the White House, Mr. Bush never hinted that the economy was anything but rosy, that the budget deficit might require painful belt-tightening or that higher taxes might be acceptable.
Then, 10 days ago, he summoned Congressional leaders to a Sunday evening meeting in the living quarters of the White House and said he wanted to begin talks to bring down the deficit. The first session was held Tuesday, and the next is scheduled for Thursday afternoon. Bush's Biggest Test? Today he said striking a deal to cut the deficit would be the biggest test of his leadership on a domestic policy issue.
The President was asked whether his stance had changed because high interest rates threatened economic growth, because automatic spending cuts called for by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law if the deficit was not brought down enough might be too deep for the country to absorb, or because he was frustrated by the lack of money available for programs he favored. He responded:
''I want to say almost all of the above, but it's really that when you take a look at the most recent estimates, the problem is of such a magnitude that we have to address it. It's more that than it is a fear of any specific category. It's just big enough that we have to do something about it, and that's why I've taken the approach I have taken.''
Mr. Bush said the time is ripe now because ''the markets are reasonably optimistic, and there are reasons to be optimistic about the economy.''
The Dow Jones industrial average reached a new high on Tuesday and then dropped slightly today.
Mr. Bush continued: ''There were some predictions of recession, but right now it appears that most economists don't think there will be a recession. So we are blessed by dealing with this problem at a time of some growth, not the robust growth that some of us would like to see, but with some growth.''
 
TV at 'Appropriate Time'
Mr. Bush said he hoped to impress on Congress ''enough of a sense of urgency that we'll go forward and get a deal.'' He said he would address the country at an ''appropriate time.''
Late this afternoon, Richard G. Darman, Mr. Bush's budget director, met privately with the House Budget Committee to describe the dimensions of the deficit problem.
Legislators who were there reported that Mr. Darman described the impact of automatic spending cuts of more than 20 percent in many Government programs if the problem was not resolved.
 
A Theory on Motive
Cuts of that size would be ''devastating'' and ''send shock waves through the economy,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat.
Mr. Schumer said Mr. Darman seemed to be trying to persuade Democrats that after a decade of masking fiscal problems, the Republican Administration was now trying sincerely to deal with them.
Mr. Bush used figures today that suggested he might favor changing the deficit target of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. The law requires a deficit no higher than $64 billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Otherwise automatic cuts in most Government programs would go into effect.
Mr. Darman has told lawmakers that spending reductions or tax increases of more than $60 billion may be needed to meet the $64 billion goal. If spending for the bailout of failed savings and loan associations is counted, the required deficit reduction could exceed $100 billion, Mr. Darman says.
Mr. Bush said deficit reduction measures that exceeded half the annual growth in the economy would risk an economic slowdown, ''exacerbating the problem rather than making it better.''
Economists say the country's gross national product of about $5.5 trillion is growing at an annual rate of about 2 percent, or about $110 billion. So Mr. Bush seemed to be supporting a maximum deficit reduction of $55 billion, which, by Mr. Darman's calculations, might not be enough to meet the law's target.

HEADLINE: Panel Is Told of Race Pattern in Lending

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Blacks who apply for home mortgages are turned down more than twice as often as whites, a Federal regulator told a Senate subcommittee today.
The information presented today supports a trend that the Government has tracked through most of the 1980's showing that blacks and other minorities have problems getting mortgages. Another witness, a consumer advocate, said that the numbers may not reflect the magnitude of the hurdles facing minorities seeking mortgages, suggesting that many lending institutions succeed in discouraging blacks from even submitting applications.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, Jerauld C. Kluckman, the director of compliance programs for the Office of Thrift Supervision, said that in the first six months of 1989 blacks were rejected 29 percent of the time when they applied for loans at the nation's 2,500 savings and loan associations, as against a rejection rate of 13 percent for whites. 
That was an increase over the second half of 1988, Mr. Kluckman said, when the rejection rate was 23 percent for blacks and 11 percent rate for whites.
 
Other Factors Are Cited
Mr. Kluckman's office, which is part of the Treasury Department, is the primary regulator of the nation's savings and loan industry.
Mr. Kluckman said in an interview that the change in 1989 does not necessarily represent a sudden increase in possible discrimination, but was more likely a result of rising interest rates and the problems of the savings and loan industry, the dominant originators of home mortgages in the United States. The numbers do not include data from the nation's commercial banks and other mortgage lenders, This issue of lending discrimination has been a long-standing problem for policy makers and banking regulators, with consumer advocacy groups complaining that discrimination exists, while regulators say they do not have sufficiently sophisticated statistical tools to prove discrimination.
''The financial regulatory agencies may see, hear and speak no evil, but I believe that the evidence demonstrates that discrimination in mortgage lending still exists in the country,'' said Senator Alan J. Dixon, an Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee.
 
Lax Enforcement Charged
Contending that the Federal bank regulators are not enforcing the antidiscrimination laws, he said that after making thousands of examinations of banks and other lending institutions, the regulators had found ''only six or seven substantive violations of fair-lending laws prohibiting mortgage discrimination over the past three years.''
Mr. Kluckman cautioned against reading too much into the statistics. He said the numbers did not indicate anything about the economic standing of the applicants. Thus, a lending instiution might have a predominantly large number of high-income whites applying for mortgages and a large segment of low-income blacks, which would skew the numbers.
''We have no information in our study about credit worthiness, and that is often the thing that makes the call about whether a loan application is approved or not,'' Mr. Kluckman said.
He said he did not have any statistics on whether the actual number of mortgage applicants by blacks had increased from the second half of 1988 to the first half of 1989, nor whether the number of rejections had increased. Nor does the study break down the information by such categories as the size of the mortgage being sought or the part of the country involved.
 
Special Assistant Quits
While the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation came in for praise by the Senate panel for setting up a separate consumer compliance examination force to police its banks, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency was accused of making little progress in discouraging and detecting lending discrimination.
Indeed, shortly before the hearing Ronald E. Wienk, special assistant for fair lending, resigned, complaining that the comptroller's office had suppressed information on racial discrimination at its national banks. He asserted that the office's ''failure to adequately perform its responsibilities prompts my resignation.''
Leonora Cross, a spokesman for the comptroller's office, said Mr. Wienk was referring to a study conducted in 1987 and 1988 of its banks that the agency considered flawed and decided not to release.
Another witness before the Senate panel said government regulators did little to detect how banks and other lending institutions discourage minorities from even applying for mortgages.
 
'Testers' Pose as Applicants
Allen Fischbein, general counsel for the Center for Community Change, a consumer advocacy group, said his organization conducted a study in 1988 in which it sent ''testers'' posing as applicants to a number of banks and lending institutions, with almost identical financial profiles except that one tester was black and the other white.
''Frequently there was a different treatment,'' Mr. Fishbein said, adding that when the black tester went in, he was told that to get a mortgage with 10 percent down the bank required a deposit equal to six months of mortgage payments. When the white tester went in, he was given the additional information that with an 11 percent downpayment the bank required only two months' advance mortgage payment.
''There may be substantial discrimination problems at the preapplication stage,'' Mr. Fishbein said, ''and right now the agency does not have a system that can detect that kind of problem.''
Mr. Kluckman agreed that such tactics could hide discrimination.
''If an institution only takes a few black applications and approves them all, the statistic would look good,'' he said. ''On the other hand, you might have an institution that has a bad rejection record but a good outreach program, and is trying to get as many applications in as possible.''
Mr. Kluckman also said the agency had found instances where banks set such high standards they automatically disqualify minorities.
Some banks, for example, have set a minimum mortgage loan levels at $30,000 or $40,000. That means that buyers of low-cost homes under that amount could not get a mortgage from those institutions except by paying a higher rate of interest or higher fees.

HEADLINE: Minnesota Lands Gorbachev: Public Relations Man's Coup

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Three months ago, Albert Eisele, a Minnesota public relations consultant, learned that Mikhail S. Gorbachev wanted to travel across the United States after his summit meeting with President Bush.
''A light went off,'' Mr. Eisele said. ''What better place to bring him than Minnesota?''
So began an effort that reached its successful conclusion on Monday with the announcement that the Soviet leader would spend six hours in Minnesota on June 3. 
Mr. Eisele's relationship with the Russians actually began in February 1987, when he went to the Soviet Union with William C. Norris, founder and chairman emeritus of the Control Data Corporation. The company, based in Minneapolis, had sold the first large American computers to the Soviet Union in 1968, and Mr. Eisele says its long relationship with the Soviets was crucial to his success. ''Control Data has been regarded as a friend even in the 1980's, when few American companies were allowed to do business there because of export restrictions on technology,'' he said.
 
From Blue Earth to Washington
Mr. Eisele (pronounced EYES-lee), 53 years old, was born and raised on a 160-acre farm between Blue Earth and Elmore, the home of Walter F. Mondale. Mr. Eisele worked for The Dispatch and The Pioneer Press of St. Paul, and then served as Mr. Mondale's Vice-Presidential press secretary. After that he worked for Control Data until last September, when he founded Cornerstone Associates, a small public relations and lobbying firm here. Its clients include Control Data.
At the 1987 meeting, V. L. Malkevich, the Soviet First Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, spoke warmly of Control Data and added, as Mr. Eisele recalls, ''We are not Ivans who do not remember our relatives.''
Mr. Eisele and Mr. Norris made two more visits to the Soviet Union, and this February, Control Data offered to install computers in six Soviet nuclear research sites. The proposal awaits Administration approval and an export license required for such technology.
 
From Minnesota, With Love
It was also in February that Jim O'Connell, a foreign trade specialist with Control Data, learned that Mr. Gorbachev had expressed an interest in traveling around the United States. Mr. O'Connell told Mr. Eisele, who drafted a letter for Gov. Rudy Perpich, inviting Mr. Gorbachev to visit Minnesota. The letter was hand-delivered to Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet Ambassador, on Feb. 26.
The letter said the state had everything the Soviets might need: ''The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are home to a large number of major corporations that are world leaders in computers and microelectronics, medical technology and health-care services, agriculture and food processing, transportation, financial services and insurance, and forestry and mining.''
The Governor's letter went on to note that many Minnesota companies, large and small, were ''very interested in developing business ties with the U.S.S.R. and could provide management expertise to Soviet enterprises as well.'' He proposed that Mr. Gorbachev give a major speech on bilateral cooperation to protect the environment. ''This could serve as a model for U.S.-Soviet cooperation in other areas,'' the letter said.
Finally, the letter noted the similarities between Minnesota and the Soviet Union. ''Minnesota, which is famous for its natural resources and shares many of the climatic and geographical characteristics of the Soviet Union, would be an ideal setting for such a speech,'' it said, and added that many Minnesotans were descendants of Russian immigrants.
 
Setback, Then Success
Hopes for the visit were set back on April 3, when Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister, told Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that Mr. Gorbachev's mounting problems at home precluded an extended visit. ''At that point I told everyone, 'It was a good try, but it's off,' '' Mr. Eisele said.
But on Monday afternoon, Mr. Eisele learned from a reporter that Mr. Gorbachev was indeed going to visit Minnesota. Ambassador Dubinin telephoned Mr. Perpich that evening to confirm that the visit was on.
Minnesotans are euphoric, Mr. Eisele said, and added, ''There are 4 million people in Minnesota, and 3.9 million want Gorbachev to visit their homes.''

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
No Summit Can Match Boisterous '59 Circus

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be emulating two of his predecessors, Nikita S. Khrushchev and Leonid I. Brezhnev, when he heads west after his summit meeting with President Bush on May 31 and June 1-2.
But even the ebullient and unpredictable Mr. Gorbachev may find it hard to match the carnival atmosphere generated by Mr. Khrushchev in September 1959 as he swept through Los Angeles, San Francisco, Des Moines, Coon Rapids, Iowa, and Pittsburgh. Six jets were required to carry the entourage. It was one of the first great events of the media age, then just dawning. 
Mr. Khrushchev boasted about Soviet prowess in space and blustered when he saw hostile signs. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had to issue orders to his aides not to argue with the guest.
Heckled during a speech at the Economic Club of New York, welcomed to Los Angeles with glacial disdain by Mayor Norris Poulson, the Soviet leader sparred testily about capitalism and Communism with Spyros P. Skouras, the president of the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation, and blew his top when security officials refused to let him visit Disneyland, then only four years old.
''What is it?'' he demanded, in one of the least scripted public moments in the long annals of Soviet-American relations. ''Is there an epidemic of cholera there or something? Or have gangsters taken hold of the place?''
When Mrs. Khrushchev complained at a bash for 400 Hollywood stars about having missed the Magic Kingdom, Frank Sinatra leaned over to David Niven and said, ''Tell the old broad you and I will take 'em down there this afternoon.''
Marilyn Monroe, as instructed, wore her tightest dress. ''I could tell Khrushchev liked me,'' she said later, but she found him ''fat and ugly.''
Things went little better at a meeting in San Francisco with Walter P. Reuther of the United Automobile Workers and other labor leaders; Mr. Khrushchev described the trade unionists, to their faces, as ''agents for capitalism,'' and Mr. Reuther described their differences as ''irreconcilable.''
But by the time the Soviet leader reached Iowa on Sept. 22 he was fairly beaming. Eating his first hot dog (with mustard) in a Des Moines factory, he allowed that ''we have beaten you to the moon, but you have beaten us in sausage making.''
The next day, a visit to the farm of Roswell Garst, a wealthy hybrid-corn grower, near Coon Rapids, produced chaos of a kind that the Secret Service would never let happen now. Mr. Garst, furious that reporters and camera crews were disrupting his carefully staged barbecue, threw silage at them, put some of his employees on horseback and had them stage mock cavalry charges at the photographers, and finally kicked one correspondent, Harrison E. Salisbury of The New York Times, smartly in the shins.
''You ought to have a bull to let loose on photographers,'' the Soviet leader told Mr. Garst.
In his memoirs, Mr. Khrushchev concluded that many Americans had come to see him ''more out of curiosity than friendship.'' He added: ''They had paid their 50 kopecks to see this Russian bear. What does he look like? Does he know how to sit at a table in polite society?''
For all its comic aspects, the trip convinced many Americans that Mr. Khrushchev was a shrewd, tough adversary. And he himself learned, as the historian Michael S. Beschloss put it, ''that the United States was not on the verge of falling to Communism,'' no matter what the Soviet Embassy in Washington persisted in saying.
Three decades have passed, with no similar jaunt in the interim except Mr. Brezhnev's rather tame trip to visit Richard M. Nixon at San Clemente in 1973. And it is the Soviet Union and its erstwhile satellites that are flirting with capitalism as Mr. Gorbachev heads west.

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico Chief Says Bush Exerts Pressure for Statehood

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon of Puerto Rico accused President Bush today of applying ''heavy-handed political pressure'' to persuade Puerto Ricans to support statehood.
The Governor, who supports continuing the island's status as a United States commonwealth, said the President was handling the proposed plebiscite on Puerto Rico's political future ''the same way as President Gorbachev is handling the Baltic crisis.''
''Both Presidents claim they want the people to make a free choice, and then go out and tell the people what choice to make,'' Mr. Hernandez Colon said in a statement issued in San Juan. The Governor also commented on the issue in a letter today to President Bush. 
Legislation now pending before Congress would authorize a binding plebescite in which Puerto Rican voters could choose among statehood, independence or continued commonwealth status. Statehood supporters emphasize the representation in Congress and the rights and privileges of United States citizenship that would go with that choice. Proponents of independence contend that Puerto Rico should be self-governing. Commonwealth supporters say Puerto Ricans derive benefits from both their relationship with the United States and from their own culture.
 
Bush a Longtime Supporter
President Bush has been a longtime supporter of statehood.
Mr. Hernandez Colon supports the commonwealth option and with it a proposal, under discussion by some in Congress, that would include modifications of Federal laws and regulations aimed at encouraging the island's economic growth.
Mr. Hernandez Colon also criticized two White House aides, Andrew H. Card Jr., the deputy Chief of Staff, and Chase Untermeyer, the White House personnel director who is also the Puerto Rico liaison, saying they spent most of their time on the island this week lobbying for statehood.
The Governor asked Mr. Bush to ''pull back; call off your troops,'' and added, ''The people of Puerto Rico have the intelligence, the capability, the desire and the good common sense to make our own decision.''
The White House press office had no comment on the Governor's attack. Mr. Card and Mr. Untermeyer were in Puerto Rico and unavailable for comment, their secretaries said.
 
'Discharging His Commitment'
Benny F. Cerezo, a spokesman for statehood supporters, said, ''Mr. Bush made a commitment to statehood when he ran in the 1980 Puerto Rican primary. Ever since, he has been a staunch statehooder. His party has statehood as part of its platform. All the President is doing is discharging his commitment.''
A recent study by the Congressional Budget Office found that statehood for Puerto Rico could undermine the island's economy and could cost as many as 100,000 of its 900,000 jobs by the end of the decade. The study, which many people saw as a setback for statehood supporters, estimated that the island would lose 73 percent of the investment it receives from United States companies through elimination of tax benefits intended to stimulate development.

HEADLINE: HOUSE TO DEBATE BILL ON DISABLED

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The House of Representatives is expected to start debate Thursday on legislation to bar discrimination against the disabled in the workplace and in transportation, public accommodations and telephone services.
Supporters consider the measure the most far-reaching civil rights bill in more than a quarter-century. Its opponents fear its economic impact.
But critics of the bill, the Americans With Disabilities Act, agree with advocates that its passage is virtually assured. A companion bill in the Senate was approved by a vote of 76 to 8 in September. President Bush, who promised in the 1988 Presidential campaign to help the estimated 43 million Americans who have physical or mental disabilities, says he will sign it. 
''We are on the threshold of passing the most signficant civil rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who has guided the bill through the House.
 
Wide Impact on Business
The 1964 civil rights law hastened the end of legal segregation by outlawing discrimination based on race, sex, religion, color or national origin in public accommodations, private employment and government services. The disability rights statute could require many businesses to change their offices, factories or stores to accommodate people with disabilities.
Concerned about the cost of compliance and the prospect of lawsuits from disabled people who are not hired or served as customers, business groups have lobbied against the measure.
''We don't want a lot of innocent small-business people who are trying to do the right thing to be hauled into court,'' said David Rahr, chief House lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade association of mainly small companies.
The measure would apply to employers with 25 or more workers, and would go into effect two years after passage. Two years after it went into effect, it would apply to businesses with 15 or more workers.
 
A Definition of Disability
The bill defines a person with a disability as someone with a physical or mental impairment that ''substantially limits a major life activity'' like walking, talking or working. It covers people with AIDS and drug abusers or alcoholics who have undergone treatment. It excludes people with emotional disorders like kleptomania, gambling compulsions and pedophilia.
Under the bill, new buses, trains and subway cars, and renovated or new hotels, retail stores and restaurants would have to be accessible to people in wheelchairs. Existing barriers should be removed if ''readily achievable,'' the bill says.
Three years after passage of the bill, telephone companies would be required to establish ''relay services'' between special telephones for people who have speech or hearing disabilities and people using ordinary telephones. The handicapped people would use the special phones to type out their messages, and an operator would act as an intermediary between them and the users of ordinary phones.
Proponents contend that changes in the bill since it was introduced two years ago have made it more sensitive to business concerns. Companies could not refuse to hire a qualified worker because of a disability, and would have to make a ''reasonable accommodation'' to allow the worker to do the job. But proponents note that employers would be exempt if they could show that the required changes would pose an ''undue hardship'': be too costly or too disruptive, or substantially alter the way they do business.
 
Factors for Exemptions
Whether an employer could be excused from making a reasonable accommodation would depend on the company's size and resources. For example, a small day care center would not be expected to spend more than a nominal sum to modify a telephone so that a speech- or hearing-impaired employee could use it. But a large school might be required to hire an aide to help a blind teacher in a classroom.
Last summer, supporters of the disabled rights bill agreed to limit sanctions to those embodied in the 1964 civil rights law: injunctions to halt biased actions by employers and back pay for victims of discrimination who were dismissed or passed over for promotion. But another pending measure, the Civil Rights Act of 1990, is aimed at expanding the 1964 civil rights law to allow for punitive damages and jury trials in the case of intentional discrimination. The Bush Administration opposes allowing increased damage awards.
After a day and a half of arguing, the House Rules Committee this afternoon approved eight amendments for consideration when the disabled rights bill comes to the floor. Among them is an amendment sponsored by Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican, intended to head off an automatic increase in damages if the 1990 civil rights bill is approved. The amendment would permit damages to be increased only if the disabled rights act is specifically revised to increase them or if the civil rights bill is revised to apply to the disabled rights act.
Many of the bill's requirements are already embodied in the the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibited companies and government agencies receiving Federal aid from discriminating against people with disabilities. The Americans With Disabilities Act would extend this concept to businesses and industries that are under private control.

HEADLINE: The Budget: Late and Ugly

 BODY:
Gov. Mario Cuomo tries to disown it. So do Senate Republicans, led by the majority leader, Ralph Marino. In truth, neither side can escape blame for the $1.4 billion package of new taxes and fees agreed to this week by New York State legislative leaders - a 235-page monstrosity accurately dubbed ''the Big Ugly'' by Albany insiders. 
The description also fits the abdication of political leadership that the tax plan exposes.
There's no denying the need for new revenues. The state faces a deficit that could reach $4 billion, and spending cuts alone aren't a realistic remedy. But even after more than three months of partisan haggling, Governor Cuomo and legislative leaders couldn't muster the statesmanship to meet the crisis straightforwardly, with a prudent broad-based tax program.
On the plus side, the package isn't nearly as damaging as it might have been. Responding to strong business pressure, budget negotiators abandoned an ill-conceived scheme to extend the state's 4 percent sales tax to the healthiest segment of the state's sagging economy - services like public relations, advertising and management consulting. Mr. Cuomo's attempt to reach out and put the arm on business with a tax on long-distance telephone calls was also rejected.
Still, the patchwork that finally emerged isn't nearly as equitable as broad-based taxes would have been - like the surcharge on the personal income tax proposed by Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, or an increase in the gasoline tax, proposed but never pressed by Mr. Cuomo. Instead the public will pay more for dozens of goods and services, including soda, liquor, car rentals and parking. Also thrown in is a 15 percent surcharge on corporate taxes and an increase in taxes paid by importers or processers of petroleum products - really a small backdoor gasoline tax.
The budget is now a record 46 days overdue. Localities have had to borrow to cover delayed state aid, incurring millions in needless interest costs. The struggle has also taken a toll on civility. As Mr. Miller attempted to restore order to an Assembly session Tuesday night, Glenn Warren, a Republican, blurted out ''Heil Hitler.'' Rightly outraged, Mr. Miller responded with profanity and later said, ''People like that shouldn't be serving in the New York State Assembly.''
The long weeks of chaos - not to mention a drop in the state's credit rating - might have been avoided had Mr. Cuomo exercised more forceful leadership once the full dimensions of the state's fiscal woes became apparent. But it's a wonder any agreement was reached, given Mr. Marino's shameful reluctance to acknowledge the state's ballooning deficit, and his insistence on inequitable increases in school aid.
It's too late to undo the embarrassment caused by this year's budget spectacle. But the state's political leaders have at least the duty to consider reforms of the budget process to avoid more senseless waste next year.

HEADLINE: Bolivia Is Trying to Dismantle Its Coca Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I quite agree with your April 30 editorial ''Military Aid vs. Drugs? Yes, but . . .'' Nevertheless (yes, but), I would like to point out that the Bolivian Government's program is much more far-reaching than you suggest.
We are not just focusing on a ''crop substitution program,'' attempting to replace coca with other crops. Such a task is very difficult unless it is part of a comprehensive effort aimed at the entire problem. 
We started by admitting that the Bolivian economy is currently dominated by the coca economy, which has created 300,000 jobs, guarantees $5,000 annual in-comes from coca/cocaine industry exports and generates annual economic activity calculated to be $1.5 billion.
We are trying to replace that entire coca economy with a legitimate economy, but we cannot succeed without the cooperation of not just the countries involved in the cocaine business but the whole of the international community.
We are not asking for subsidies of any kind for our products. That would be a weak solution, if only because it would violate market laws. What we are asking is that the international community help us create a healthy economy, capable of not only surviving but of succeeding in the world market.
To do so, we need foreign investment, foreign support and the confidence of foreign governments. With-out any of these, we are sure to fail.
Efforts already undertaken in this direction have allowed us to sign investment guarantee agreements with industrialized countries such as the United States, Great Britain, West Germany, Spain, Belgium and Italy.
Our laws are in the process of modernization to adjust to what we hope will be a bright economic future: A new foreign investments bill has been submitted to the Parliament, and for the first time in the history of our country we will have a law on joint ventures by state or private Bolivian enterprises on the one hand and foreign companies on the other.
The task is very difficult, but we are working very hard to achieve our goal, which is to terminate the coca economy that now dominates our country.

Moving Beyond The Melting Pot, 25 Years Later

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The 25th anniversary of the publication of ''Beyond the Melting Pot'' was officially marked this week, 30 years after the seminal study of race and ethnicity in New York City was completed, 27 years after it was published and 20 years since it was revised. The timing could not have been better. For whichever the anniversary, the book's underlying theme seems even more evident today: That, particularly where race is concerned, the melting pot metaphor didn't hold water.
The co-authors, Nathan Glazer, a professor of education and sociology at Harvard, and Daniel P. Moynihan, now a United States Senator from New York, reflected with other members of a panel at the New York Public Library Monday night on whether their premise had withstood the test of time, however many years have elapsed since they advanced it. Mr. Glazer and Mr. Moynihan maintained that their goal had not been to celebrate ethnic and racial identities, but rather to come to grips with the resulting divisions. 
Their book, Mr. Glazer acknowledged, had not anticipated two phenomena: the subsequent surge in immigration to New York from the Caribbean, Latin America, Korea, China, Vietnam and the Soviet Union; and the general failure of American-born blacks, in particular, to be swept before the floodtide of new immigrants into the city's economic and social mainstream.
''You've got the Mayor and the police chief and you've got the city,'' Mr. Moynihan said, suggesting that blacks had, even if belatedly, demonstrated the endurance of ethnic succession in New York City politics, at least.
Mr. Glazer, because he is not a politician, was less circumspect. A measure of hope might be detected, he said, in the recent political success of blacks, most notably the election last year of David N. Dinkins.
But, Mr. Glazer said, the pattern of new immigrants propelling their immediate predecessors forward had not been duplicated among the two groups that had dominated immigration to New York during the two decades before ''Beyond the Melting Pot'' was written: blacks from the South and Puerto Ricans. Instead, he said, many have become part of a ''great dependent class.''
Mr. Glazer, who wrote the section on American blacks, began this week's retrospective not in the 1960's, but three decades earlier. He quoted from a report that called the Harlem riots of 1935 that community's ''inarticulate response'' to job discrimination, lack of affordable housing and health care, prejudice and insensitivity by municipal government.
Not only do most of those complaints persist today, but Ruth W. Messinger, who succeeded Mr. Dinkins as Manhattan Borough President and who participated in the retrospective, said that improving those very same conditions was her recipe for racial harmony.
That is not to say conditions for many blacks have not gotten better since 1935, Mr. Glazer said. But what has not changed looms larger. His assumption that blacks would be as politically and economically mobile as earlier newcomers to New York, he said, now seems naive. One consequence of their immobility has been a lingering resentment in predominantly black neighborhoods that so many local businesses are owned by outsiders.
''Blacks were boycotting the Jews in Harlem in the 1930's,'' Mr. Glazer said, ''and blacks are boycotting the Koreans 55 years later.''
As evidence of New York's enduring ethnic divisions, Mr. Moynihan recalled touring the city with Jimmy Carter during the 1976 presidential campaign. At the perennial garment center rally in Manhattan, a traditional Jewish and later Hispanic stronghold, most of the campaign placards were in Chinese. As his motorcade proceeded along Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn toward a longshoremen's gathering, Mr. Carter asked whether he was in the borough's Italian district.
''No,'' Mr. Moynihan replied. ''The Arab section.''
On a more cosmic scale, Mr. Moynihan said, the potency of ethnicity has disproved the Marxian premise that industrialization would produce a uniform proletariat. ''What Karl Marx proposed in the British Museum, Nat Glazer disproved in the New York Public Library,'' Mr. Moynihan said.
What Mr. Glazer wrote about race in 1960 proved prescient, if understated. Introducing their revised edition 10 years later, the authors concluded: ''Race has exploded to swallow up all other distinctions, or so it would appear at the moment.''
Twenty years later, as a divided city awaits the verdict on two white teen-agers accused in the racially-motivated killing of a 16-year-old black, it still does.

Budget Hurry-Up-and-Wait Helps Forehands, Harms Civility

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 16

 BODY:
When a Republican Assemblyman shouted ''Heil Hitler!'' at the Democratic Assembly Speaker during an unusual filibuster Tuesday night, the anger and frustration underlying this year's prolonged budget debate erupted into public view.
As Assembly Speaker Mel Miller was trying to restore order to an unruly session, Assemblyman Glenn E. Warren of Hopewell Junction stunned the chamber by blurting out the Nazi salute. Mr. Miller, who is Jewish, responded with profanity and later told reporters, ''People like that shouldn't be serving in the New York State Assembly.''
The scene was the most anarchic moment in a budget process that has known little order since Gov. Mario M. Cuomo convened the Legislature on Jan. 3. The state budget is now 46 days overdue, shattering the record for budget lateness. 
Until Tuesday night, the budget debacle had been best symbolized by the lowering of the state's credit rating. But this legislative session now may be best remembered for Mr. Warren's indiscretion, the bizarre filibuster that generated it and today's furor over both.
The Republicans announced the filibuster after they were handed a 275-page, $1.4 billion tax bill Tuesday morning and told the Democrats had scheduled a vote on it for Tuesday night. Although the Republicans who control the Senate were crucial in negotiating the tax legislation, members of the Assembly's Republican minority had little role in it.
To delay the vote and register their irritation, the Republicans filled three hours with angry speeches on procedure, including Mr. Warren's, until Mr. Miller called for a recess shortly after 11 P.M.
By this morning, any hope of debating the budget was buried beneath the anguish generated by Mr. Warren's comment. The Assemblyman from the Upper Hudson Valley apologized, saying he had been angry at the budget process.
The apology did not mollify the Democrats, who were angrier when Mr. Warren later told reporters that his remarks were comparable to yelling ''Kill the Ref!'' at a basketball game.
The Democrats vented their emotions in a four-hour private meeting that many compared to group therapy, and then reconvened in the chamber tonight for a cathartic 85-minute session. Seven Democrats, some of whom had lost family members in the Holocaust, publicly chastised Mr. Warren. Republicans responded that he had been thoughtless but was not an anti-Semite.
Mr. Warren choked back tears long enough to say: ''I'd like to say I'm sorry and I ask for your forgiveness. Thank you.''
 
The Wages of Sloth
Bad government, it seems, is not bad for everyone.
By breaking the record for overdue budgets, state leaders have produced a windfall for the capital district's hoteliers and restaurateurs, and its barkeeps and tennis pros.
The 211 state legislators, accustomed to staying in Albany only two nights a week, have been held hostage here for most of the last six weeks just on the off chance that they might finally be asked to vote.
Packs of idle legislators might not be something most people would wish on their hometowns. But to people in Albany, where government has long been the staple of a steady economy, there is nothing more refreshing than legislative inefficiency.
''It's great,'' said Gary J. Tenczar, manager of the Plaza Grill, a favorite watering hole of politicians, lobbyists and journalists. ''Anytime stuff like the budget is overdue, they stay in town longer, and they still have to eat and drink.''
The managers of hotels and restaurants, and of golf and tennis clubs where some legislators spend their mornings, echoed his enthusiasm.
''I was looking down the line this morning and all our courts were taken by legislators,'' said Mike Friedman, the director of the Southwood Indoor Tennis and Golf Center. ''They seem to play tennis more when they're frustrated.''
 
Intestinal Fortitude Lags
The nurses who run the Legislative Health Service, which is between the Senate and Assembly chambers, can attest that the budget ordeal has inflicted a heavy toll. They have noticed a marked increase in stress-related ailments and headaches during the last few weeks, and have referred several patients to therapists.
''There's a run on Tylenol,'' said Liz Anthony, one of the nurses. ''I guess you can call it budgetitis.''
Ms. Anthony said she also has treated legislators and aides for intestinal disorders, which are often caused by an overdose of fast food. The Governor's budget staff dines almost nightly on take-out Chinese food while calculating the cost of each day's political bargaining.
''I'm not going to eat another egg roll until next March,'' said Patrick J. Bulgaro, the division's first deputy director. ''I think it's the gastroenterologists who really make out here.''
 
Tackling Bigger Issues
With the Governor and legislative leaders conducting most of the budget negotiations in private, many legislators feel disconnected from the process. But New Yorkers should not think their legislators have not been conducting serious business.
In late April, for instance, the Senate passed legislation to outlaw dwarf-tossing contests, and the related practice of dwarf bowling, in places where alcohol is served.
There has also been consideration of bills that would prohibit the use of chemical deodorizers in boat toilets and reduce the amount of lead in coffee urns. The Assembly, which, for the record, plays no role in setting foreign policy, held an emotional debate on the correctness of the United States' invasion of Panama. The Senate, meanwhile, passed legislation allowing the National Ski Patrol to have its own license plate.

HEADLINE: New York City Is Seeking to Use M.A.C. Surplus

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
New York City and New York State are negotiating with the Municipal Assistance Corporation to free $1.5 billion in surplus corporation funds to help balance the city's operating budget over the next seven years.
In exchange, the corporation would be granted power to issue new bonds for schools and mass transit.
But the proposal, discussed quietly in recent weeks and in a closed-door M.A.C. board meeting yesterday, has irked some politicians and fiscal experts. They say that it amounts to meddling with the city's spending priorities and that it could create a false impression of fiscal disarray. 
Felix G. Rohatyn, the corporation's chairman, said yesterday that he had agreed to review the proposal at the request of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins to help the city close a budget gap of about $2 billion in the fiscal year that starts July 1 and possible gaps in future years. Legislative aides, however, said the proposal originated with M.A.C.
 
No Restrictions on Use
Under the plan, the corporation would distribute $1.5 billion to the city for unrestricted use over the next seven years. City officials have sought unfettered access to this money for years, but Mr. Rohatyn has retained control, insisting that certain conditions be met before the funds are made available for particular projects.
In recent years, in agreement with Mr. Cuomo and former Mayor Edward I. Koch, Mr. Rohatyn committed $600 million for school construction and $900 million for transit.
Now, in exchange for making that money available to the city for operating expenses, Mr. Rohatyn wants a state law that would grant M.A.C. the power to issue new bonds to keep its commitments on schools and transit in case the city did not issue enough bonds of its own to finance those projects.
''It's just an insurance policy to make sure we can carry out existing commitments,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. He added that in no case would any new bonds mature after 2008, when the last M.A.C. bonds are to expire.
 
Born in Adversity
Some officials contend that the city should have had control of the surpluses all along. The M.A.C. was established by the state in 1975 to issue bonds for the city when it was barred from the credit markets because of its precarious condition.
Its bonds are backed by city sales tax revenues, which are diverted each year to pay them off. The corporation accumulated surpluses through refinancing and favorable interest rates.
The city's budget director, Philip R. Michael, said one advantage of the plan is that the M.A.C. has a slightly higher credit rating than the city, and so could borrow at a slightly lower interest cost.
But some fiscal experts said that giving the M.A.C. new bonding power could create a false impression that the city was in fiscal disarray and hurt both its own hard-won credit rating and the M.A.C.'s.
''The sooner any talk of M.A.C. issuing any debt for capital purposes is put to rest, the better off the city will be,'' said Paul Dickstein, the city's former budget director.
But First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, who was a partner with Mr. Rohatyn at the Lazard Freres investment banking concern before joining the Dinkins administration, said the plan should not ''send the wrong signal that the city is in crisis and can't manage its own affairs.''
Peg Breen, a spokeswoman for the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said Mr. Vallone had deep philosophical concerns about the proposal.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Expands Housing Plan to Assist the Poor

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
Moving to put his own stamp on New York City's $5.1 billion 12-year housing plan, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that the program would be revised and expanded to provide more housing for lower-income tenants and the homeless.
Despite what he called the ''tough fiscal times,'' the city will commit $2.1 billion in capital funds over the next four years, an increase of $101 million, the Mayor said.
Other construction projects will be reduced to help pay for the expanded housing program, Mr. Dinkins said, but he declined to identify the reductions until today, when he is to announce his preliminary capital plan for the next four years. 
''It is essential,'' Mr. Dinkins said, ''that we continue the housing program.''
 
An Ambitious Program
The plan, devised in 1986 by the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, is by far the most ambitious municipal housing program in the country. But it has long been criticized by some housing advocates for not providing enough housing for the poor.
Although Mayor Dinkins praised the program for ''enormous achievements in housing over the past four years,'' he said his plans would add ''a human face - one that's more affordable, more inclusionary and more economically integrated.''
He said 63,000 apartments would be made available under the plan in the next four years, with 26,000 consisting of either new construction or the complete rehabilitation of vacant buildings. The remaining 37,000 are to be moderately rehabilitated units.
The city, however, is rapidly exhausting its stock of vacant buildings and must increasingly rely on new construction to create ''desperately needed housing,'' the Mayor said.
 
Focus on 'Affordability'
The plan also calls for increased construction subsidies to private developers to reduce rents in apartments now in the planning stage, said Felice L. Michetti, the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development. The subsidies now average $42,000 an apartment and are to increase to about $48,000.
''The plan is focused on affordability,'' Commissioner Michetti said.
Mr. Dinkins said $212 million would be allocated to develop 3,200 apartments for homeless individuals in city-owned buildings and single-room-occupancy hotels. Under the Koch administration, the housing program provided no rehabilitated apartments for single homeless people.
Mr. Dinkins said $50 million would go to build 500 units of mixed-income rental housing, with about 30 percent of the apartments reserved for homeless families. This is the first time that the city plans to build new housing for mixed-income families.
The Mayor said about 89 percent of the $2.1 billion in spending in the next four years would be devoted to low- and moderate-income households.
 
'This City Is the Leader'
''This city houses more people than any other and is home to more housing challenges than any other metropolis,'' he said. ''For generations, we've also been home to more innovative housing solutions. In housing, this city is the leader, and that's where we will stay.''
Bonnie Brower, executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, said that the original housing plan had failed to provide enough low-income housing but that ''now Mayor Dinkins is moving to correct those flaws.''
''These are absolutely essential, beneficial changes,'' she said. ''They should have been done four years ago.''

HEADLINE: An Invitation to Tea Sets

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
TEAPOTS that resemble trumpets, Gothic spires or guards at Buckingham Palace are in ''Spirit of Europe,'' an exhibition of tea sets designed by students at Parsons School of Design. The exhibition, the result of a design competition sponsored by Villeroy & Boch, a German manufacturer of ceramics, is at the company's store at 974 Madison Avenue (76th Street).
In 1989 the company invited the 15 students who were majoring in ceramics at Parsons to submit drawings for tea sets. Ten of the students were chosen by Villeroy & Boch's design staff to spend three months last summer at its factory in Mettlach, West Germany, where the students learned to make their designs functional and then to manufacture 50 copies of each. 
''The students were judged according to the possibility of making and marketing the sets,'' said Marek Cecula, coordinator of the ceramic design department at Parsons. ''At the factory the students actually made the objects themselves from vitrified stoneware. They produced the decals, made the models, made the molds and fired the sets.''
The idea for the competition originated three years ago with Wendelin von Boch, managing director of the company. In 1988 he invited students at the Vienna Academy of Applied Arts to design tea sets on the theme ''Spirit of the U.S.A.''
''We had to encourage students to get interested in our industry in terms of design and artistic expression,'' said Dale Ritter, president of Villeroy & Boch in the United States. ''We're trying to excite them that it is an innovative industry, but that there are technical and commercial limitations to translating designs to production.''
At the factory Jessica Rust, a junior at Parsons, discovered one limitation after another, she said. Her design, ''Wines of Europe,'' included a raised grapevine motif. The pale green cup was shaped like a goblet. ''I wanted my cups to have thinner stems, but if I were to do that the cups fell down in the kilns, or they melted,'' Ms. Rust said. ''At Parsons, if the stem was too thin the cup would still fall over, but we'd stick a metal rod in it. We didn't have to make it functional.''
The designs in the exhibition range from the literal to the abstract. One of the most successful designs is ''Arms and Armor'' by Soojin Choi. The white pot is in the shape of a metal helmet, and it is decorated with a delicate filigree design in black. The creamer is designed like a gauntlet.
In ''Gothic Cathedrals'' Marta Schlitzer's teapot is a Gothic spire, the colored plate resembles a stained glass rosette, and the creamer is a fragment of a fluted column.
''Unity,'' a design by Alejandra Mark, features old and new imagery of Europe. An antique map of Europe decorates the globe-shaped teapot, while its handle has the blue background and gold stars of the flag of the European Economic Community. For the cup and saucer, the imagery is reversed: the cup is banded in blue and gold, while the handle and saucer depict the map.
Aaron Lown's ''Changing of the Guard'' is an abstract design based on the red jackets and tall black bearskin hats of the guards at Buckingham Palace. On the teapot the black hat is the lid and the handle is the guard's arm, held rigidly at the waist. For the cup the handle, also an abstracton of the guard's arm, looks as if it is in a salute.
Each set costs $2,000. The exhibition runs through June 2.

HEADLINE: Executive Director Resigns From Joffrey

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
The executive director of the Joffrey Ballet, Penelope Curry, said yesterday that she had submitted her resignation at a Joffrey board meeting on Tuesday.
Ms. Curry, who has supervised the ballet company's season this month at the Music Center of Los Angeles County, where the Joffrey is the resident dance company, said that her resignation was effective immediately but that she would stay on through the company's Los Angeles season, which ends on May 27.
''I have been asked by the board if I would stay on as consultant for the next two weeks,'' Ms. Curry said yesterday. ''I have agreed to do that. I will be happy to do anything that is necessary during the transition. I love this company very much. I have spent the last 22 years of my life with it. I will do anything I can to insure the company goes forward.'' 
 
Latest of Several Departures
Ms. Curry declined to comment on her reasons for resigning. Her resignation follows those of the Joffrey board's co-chairmen, Anthony A. Bliss and David H. Murdock. Yesterday Mr. Murdock issued a statement confirming earlier reports that he had resigned.
''The Joffrey is an outstanding ballet company that has performed superbly,'' Mr. Murdock said in his statement. ''I have been active as a co-chairman of the board for seven years, and I feel it is time to step down. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve with this fine ballet company.''
 
A Series of Crises
The three resignations followed a financial and administrative crisis at the Joffrey that became public when Gerald Arpino resigned as its artistic director and resident choreographer on May 1. His resignation was not accepted by the board. Mr. Arpino, who founded the company with Robert Joffrey, who died in March 1988, also withdrew his ballets from the company's repertory. On Tuesday he gave the Joffrey permission to perform them again starting May 25.
Mr. Arpino resigned when the board voted to establish an operating committee to run the company. The vote followed the discovery that the company owed $800,000 in payroll withholding taxes, as well as a $1 million accumulated deficit.
Mr. Arpino and his lawyer, Harold Messing, have been negotiating with the board since May 4.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up By 0.2%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
In a report that largely dispelled fears of accelerating inflation, the Labor Department said today that consumer prices climbed a modest two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the smallest increase since September.
Economists said the report on the Consumer Price Index was important confirmation that price pressures have abated since a late-winter surge and that inflation might turn out to be little, if any, worse this year than the 4.6 percent increase in prices recorded for 1989.
The report for April was in sharp contrast to the one for March, which showed an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent and was even higher when the erratic food and energy components were excluded. The March data worked out to a worrisome annual pace of 8.5 percent for the first quarter. But factoring in today's report, the annual rate for 1990 now stands at 6.8 percent. 
 
Fearing a 5% Rate
''There was a fear out there that we were moving toward 5 percent inflation'' for a sustained period, commented Kevin Logan, chief economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
With today's report, and the one last Friday showing a decline in the price that American producers received for their goods in April, Mr. Logan said inflation now had probably stabilized.
The low overall rise in last month's price index was largely anticipated and thus made little impact on the financial markets. Still, analysts said they were heartened by the fact that so-called core inflation, which excludes food and energy, eased to two-tenths of 1 percent from seven-tenths of 1 percent in March.
This meant that the better performance of the index did not depend entirely on food prices, which posted their first decline since July 1987, or on energy prices, which registered their third straight decline.
 
Other Factors at Work
In other words, while much of the improvement represented the reversal of weather-related price jumps during the winter, other factors were also working to keep price pressures in check.
The recent inflation figures are consistent with other economic gauges - including employment, retail sales and industrial production -that signal a resumption of slow economic growth after some late-winter vigor that owed much to unseasonably warm weather stimulating construction activity. But housing starts fell sharply last month, according to a separate report today. [Page D19.] For inflation over all, ''things look somewhat better,'' declared Patrick C. Jackman, a senior price analyst at the Labor Department. He said that the 6.8 percent annual rate for the first four months of this year was scarcely worse than the 6.6 percent recorded at this time last year, and thus the rise for all of 1990 could be held below 5 percent.
On the other hand, today's price report was not so good as to inspire thoughts that the Federal Reserve would be able to move soon to ease monetary policy. Analysts said the Fed's strategy-setting arm, which met yesterday, probably decided to make no significant change.
The cost of medical care, for example, rose eight-tenths of 1 percent for the third straight month, a 9.8 percent annual rate. Health benefits have been a major factor pushing up costs to businesses and those costs tend to be passed on to consumers.
Today's report also showed that the metropolitan areas of New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco each had price increases of five-tenths of 1 percent last month, while prices in Chicago surged seven-tenths of 1 percent. Los Angeles, the other city for which monthly data are published, posted a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Big Drop in Vegetables
The April drop in food prices was mainly the result of a sharp decline in the price of fresh vegetables, which skidded a total of 20 percent in March and April after rising 30 percent in January and February. Dairy products fell for the second straight month after rising nearly 11 percent during the preceding six months.
On the other hand, prices rose sharply for cereal and bakery products and for the component comprising meat, poultry, fish and eggs.
Housing prices rose just one-tenth of 1 percent after a March surge. Fuel oil retreated to its December level, and natural gas fell 3 percent, the biggest decline in almost three years. Charges for collecting trash, however, rose sharply for the fifth straight month.
Apparel rose a negligible one-tenth of 1 percent after two very sharp increases, and transportation rose the same amount, because gasoline prices turned up. Unlike fuel oil, gasoline prices have held onto nearly all of the 7.7 percent advance they recorded in January.
Entertainment and ''other'' goods and services both rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, the report showed.
 
Services Cost More
The price of services rose three-tenths of 1 percent, compared with seven-tenths in March, while commodity prices declined one-tenth of 1 percent.
The Consumer Price Index covering all urban consumers now stands at 128.9, which means that a group of goods and services that cost $10 in 1982-84 now costs $12.89. Before rounding, the April increase was 0.155159 percent, a hair's breadth from being reported as up only one-tenth of 1 percent.
A companion price index covering a smaller universe of urban wage warners and clerical workers rose one-tenth of 1 percent after rising four-tenths in March and five-tenths in February.

HEADLINE: New Goal for Accountants: Director

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Each spring, as the nation's major accounting firms conduct the ritual of naming their best up-and-comers as partners, James A. Gibson remembers four years ago when his turn came at Arthur Young, the large New York firm.
After spending eight years on the firm's fast track, the 37-year-old knew exactly what was at stake: people either made partner or they left the firm. Sure enough, he got the news at the end of the day. He would get a larger office, a six-figure salary, more vacation time, secretarial help and a paid membership in an executive health club.
The funny thing was, he had been turned down for the partner's position. 
 
A New Position
Instead, Mr. Gibson became a director, a permanent, salaried executive position that Arthur Young, now part of Ernst & Young, created that year as an alternative to a partnership. While they do not share in the firm's profits or have as much decision-making power, directors receive most of the perquisites of partners and rank just below partners in the firm's hierarchy.
Arthur Young created the position as way to retain employees who are valued but considered unsuitable for partnerships because they have narrow specialties, like economic analysis, which keep them behind the scenes, removed from client contact.
Several other firms have adopted similar tactics to address a decline in the number of talented college graduates who choose accounting as a career. In January, Coopers & Lybrand created a permanent executive position other than partner, and Arthur Andersen said it was committed to doing so. Other firms are testing new positions.
This trend is a major departure from the profession's age-old ''up-or-out'' policy, in which people either make partner or leave the firm.
''The up-or-out route is good management in an environment where you only need to keep the best or brightest and there's always another group coming through,'' said David Maister, a Boston-based consultant who has taught at the Harvard Business School about the service sector. ''But that is not today's demographic environment and won't be for the next 15 years.''
 
Similar to the Legal Field
Much like the legal profession, which created ''permanent associate'' positions in the early 1980's, accounting is labor intensive. That makes executives acutely concerned about the shrinking number of post-baby-boomers entering the work force.
For years, accounting firms could be cavalier about inviting only the most talented recruits to join the partnership ranks. Replacing those who failed to make the cut posed little hardship when there were more than 50,000 graduates in accounting each year and when there was a brisk progression up the ranks.
The odds of making partner at the big firms were slim - about one in 10 in the early career years and about one in two if they stuck it out for 10 to 12 years. But the rewards were enormous for the 600 or so who got the nod each year.
 
Profit-Sharing Plans
These partners are paid through profit-sharing plans and at the large accounting firms typically earn $150,000 to $400,000 a year, not including fringe benefits. Directors earn salaries in the low $100,000 area.
In the past, those who fell short of their dream walked away with a consolation prize: years of professional training and industry contacts.
''It used to be the poor person's M.B.A.,'' said Robert N. McDowell, the partner in charge of personnel administration for Coopers & Lybrand.
But now, recruitment and training costs are eating into profits, and there are mounting concerns that the quality of accounting graduates is declining along with quantity as the best business students pursue a growing choice careers. That shortfall suggests employers will have to spend even more on training.
 
Push Toward Specialities
Another factor is the push by many firms into specialties beyond tax and auditing, which means they vie with other businesses for experienced talent in a wider range of fields. And the growing interest of many career-minded employees in trying to balance work and family life also argues for the introduction of alternative career paths. Some women, for example, may choose to become a director, rather than a more-involved partner, because they want to take time out to raise children.
Officials of the firms on the vanguard of the trend say their motives have little to do with a change of heart about pushing loyal employees out the door. ''Some people think up-or-out is a bit too severe,'' said Richard L. Measelle, the managing partner of Andersen's audit, accounting and tax business unit. ''I'm not too troubled by that. What is driving me to this is demographics, and the specialization that is growing so rapidly within the profession.'' He hopes to have a program in place by this fall for at least a few of those who fall off the firm's partnership track each year.
 
Not a Booby Prize
Arthur Young, the first accounting firm to create the title of director, also appears to have the largest contingent, having retained 44 of the 47 managers offered the title. Paul J. Ostling, a partner and the firm's vice chairman for human resources, said the key was to keep the job from being seen as a dead end or booby prize. While making partner after having been named a director is a long shot at many firms, it is not out of the question.
''We don't want this to be a parking place for people who are not good enough to be partner,'' he said. ''If we put rejects in the director position, it would never become something people would aspire to.''
Among the major firms, only KPMG Peat Marwick said it was opposed to tampering with its partnership structure.
''We as a firm have no interest in doing that,'' said Bernard J. Milano, KPMG's partner in charge of recruiting and personnel administration. ''To recruit and motivate people, you need to be able to display an opportunity for growth, and the more people you have occupying positions below partner on a permanent basis, obviously the fewer opportunities you can offer.''
 
Satisfaction With Decision
But at Ernst & Young, many directors seem satisfied with the path their careers have taken.
Rosemarie Meschi, a 37-year-old accountant who rose through the auditing ranks at Young, switched to the human resources department in 1983. The transfer practically killed her chances of making partner because it meant giving up her clients, but Ms. Meschi liked the work better. ''The title of partner was not as important to me as having job satisfaction,'' she said.
Ms. Meschi continued to impress her superiors - she recently headed the firm's effort to provide its New York employees with emergency child care. Last year, after being considered for partner after all, she became one of eight to advance to director.
''My friends, all say, 'Aren't you ever going to leave?' '' said Ms. Meschi, who has been with the firm for 16 years. For now anyway, her answer is no.
 
Choice of Living Style
Mr. Gibson's problem was that he worked for a small branch office in Northern California. When his turn for partner came up, he was told he could stay in Sacramento as a director or take his chances at a larger office that might be able to absorb another partner. Since he liked his job and its location, he stayed.
''I've made a conscious decision to trade off some perceived quality of life that I have here for a partnership position in a larger city,'' Mr. Gibson said.
In other cases, the director's title has helped attract and keep outside specialists who are not straight out of college. One is R. Allen Saville, 45. He had a doctorate in environmental design, a law degree, and 10 years of consulting experience before he joined Young's office in Reston, Va., as an internal consultant in 1986. With no client contacts, Mr. Saville has never come up for partner and said that he frankly did not care.
''Just as the up-or-out model is fading, the model about what defines success is also changing,'' said Mr. Saville, who became a director two years ago. ''The mere fact I'm not called a partner does not bother me a whole lot.''

HEADLINE: Soviet Union Becomes Observer in Trade Body

BYLINE: By BURTON BOLLAG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 16

 BODY:
The Soviet Union was accepted today as an observer in the world organization that oversees international trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The move, which was expected, is seen as a significant step in that country's efforts to integrate itself into the world trading system.
As one of more than 20 observers, the Soviet Union will be able to attend most meetings of the 96-nation group that serves as a watchdog on trade. But it will not be able to participate in decison making or in the settlement of trade disputes. Nor will it be able to take part in the current trade negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round, that are scheduled to finish in December. The Uruguay Round is the GATT-sponsored effort to eliminate trade barriers in services and farm products and to provide better protection for patents, copyrights and other intellectual property. 
 
Adopted by Consensus
Soviet observer status was adopted by consensus at a meeting of most of the member countries at the organization's granite headquarters in a park along the shores of Lake Geneva.
As soon as the decision was made, the Soviet delegation of about five members was invited to enter the richly wood-paneled meeting hall as reporters and television camera crews crowded around. ''We've never had such a ceremony for the admission of an observer,'' one Western delegate said Yevgeny N. Makeyev, the Soviet delegate to the United Nations in Geneva, then told the meeting that the new status would allow his country to ''get acquainted'' with the workings of GATT and study ''the conditions for a future accession'' as a full member.
So many countries requested the floor to welcome the Soviets that the chairman finally cut short the discussion. But many countries made it clear that they expect the Soviet Union to use its new status to help push forward important domestic economic reforms and to report back regularly on progress, as promised.
At a summit meeting in Malta in December, President Bush informed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union that the United States had dropped its objections to the granting of observer status to the Soviet Union. But the United States wanted the move put off until the end of the Uruguay Round in December.
On Monday, however, a Bush Administration official in Washington said the President wanted a favorable decision before his meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in two weeks as ''a tangible sign of American interest in bringing the Soviet Union into the world economy.'' And today the United States representative to GATT, Rufus Yerxa, formally told the meeting that in the face of broad international support for the move, the United States was dropping its objections.
 
Japan Drops Opposition
Japan also dropped its previously stated objections. Japan had used the issue of GATT observer status to signal its displeasure with the continued Soviet occupation of four Japanese islands off Hokkaido, seized in 1945. But Japanese officials have also said they want to see the Soviet Union move toward a market-oriented economy, and they said recently that they did not intend to let the occupation issue block the new Soviet status.
The United States representative made it clear the Soviet Union had far to go before it could be considered for full membership. ''The Soviet economic and trade system is clearly not, at this time, compatible'' with GATT principles, Mr. Yerxa said.
He added that it was ''the sincere hope'' of the United States that the Soviet Union proceed with its reforms and ''eventually embrace a market-based price and distribution system.''
Various countries and the GATT Director General, Arthur Dunkel, had strongly urged the Bush Administration in recent months to accept Soviet observer status, in the hope of encouraging Soviet economic reforms.
The Soviet Union was the last big country not in GATT or in the process of joining. Still, the move from observer status to full membership can take years. Negotiations on China's request to move from its current observer status have been virtually frozen since the country crushed student demonstrations last June.
According to GATT economists, the Soviet Union had $108 billion worth of exports in 1989, making it the eighth-ranking exporter.

HEADLINE: Retirement Is Set at Deere

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOLINE, Ill., May 16

 BODY:
Robert A. Hanson, who directed Deere & Company through its stormiest financial period and into profitability, announced today that he would retire as chairman.
Mr. Hanson, who is 65 years old, said he will step down on June 1. He has spent 40 years with the company, which manufactures tractors and agricultural equipment.
Deere's president and chief executive, Hans W. Becherer, is expected to be named chairman at the company's next board meeting.
Last August, Mr. Hanson gave up the chief executive title in anticipation of his retirement, which is mandatory at Deere when an executive reaches age 66. Mr. Hanson, a native of East Moline, was the first person to run the 153-year-old company who was not a member of the Deere family by blood or marriage.
He became president in 1978, and a year later was named chief operating officer. He became chairman in 1982 as the company stood on the brink of economic collapse.
Deere accumulated $328 million in losses in two years and its operating losses totaled $637 million in the six-year period beginning in 1982.
Mr. Hanson instituted a deep cost-cutting program and laid off about 12,000 workers. His problems were compounded by a 163-day work stoppage at 13 Deere plants in six states that ended on Feb. 1, 1987.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Investor Joins Citibank In Private Bank Group

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
A longtime investor in stocks and bonds, James R. Hocking, has joined Citibank's private banking group. Mr. Hocking came to Citibank this week from Templeton International, an investment advisory firm in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
While at Templeton, a subsidiary of Templeton, Galbraith & Hausberger Ltd., Mr. Hocking developed a mutual fund that invests in bonds from around the world. Now, as chief investment officer of Citibank's United States investment division, Mr. Hocking, who is 60, will oversee the investing of $15 billion managed by the private banking group. Citibank, which manages more money in its private banking group than any other non-Swiss bank, has an additional $45 billion under management in foreign offices. 
''I am a firm believer in global investing, and Citibank is a place that has made a firm commitment to managing money of retail accounts around the world,'' Mr. Hocking said.
The private banking groups of large banks like Citibank offer investment advice, special lending arrangements and other services to wealthy individuals. At Citibank, private banking customers are expected to have at least $250,000 under management.
Although Citicorp sold its institutional investment advisory business last year, it has identified investment advice for individuals as a business with a bright future as the ''baby boom'' generation grows older and accumulates more savings. At the same time, Mr. Hocking noted that investment opportunities around the world are multiplying, as more economies mature and businesses once controlled by governments become privately held.
Even after the sharp rise in American stock prices in the last week, Mr. Hocking said, ''We don't think the stock market is at a level that makes it unattractive.'' He declined to identify any companies or industry groups, but he said he favors high-quality investments in both the stock and bond markets.
''In an economy that is growing only modestly, high quality and the ability to sustain earnings is important,'' he said. While the American economy might grow no faster than a few percent a year after inflation, he does not expect a recession.
He is advising investors in both the American stock and bond markets to remain nearly fully invested, holding only small cash reserves.
Describing himself as ''an opera lover'' and a frequent visitor to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Mr. Hocking said he and his wife, Jane, who have five grown children, expect to find a new home in Manhattan within walking distance of the museum.

HEADLINE: New Futures Contract On Insurance Planned

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 16

 BODY:
The Chicago Board of Trade said today that it would seek Federal approval to begin trading futures contracts related to health insurance and automobile insurance. The contract would give insurance companies a mechanism to lock in the price they must pay for reinsurance, which involves spreading their risk by selling policies among other insurers.
''These new contracts will bring down the cost of health care and bring down the cost of auto insurance and health insurance to the public,'' said Leslie Rosenthal, the chairman of the Board of Trade committee that designed the new contracts.
One of the designers of the new contracts, Richard Sandor, said, ''These new contracts could be as major an innovation as interest-rate futures.'' He is also considered one of the architects of interest-rate futures, which allow banks, insurance companies and other institutional investors to hedge against swings in interest rates. 
 
'The Timing Is Right'
''The timing is right because the risks faced by insurers are greater than ever, as is the capital needed to write these types of insurance,'' Mr. Sandor said.
To the extent that the new futures contracts would allow insurance companies to know before they write policies how much they would have to pay for reinsurance, proponents said that consumers could benefit in a big way.
Christian Milton, the head of reinsurance buying at the American International Group, a big New York-based insurer, said, ''If I could lock in the price of reinsurance for my property-and-casualty portfolio, that would be just fine.''
But both Mr. Milton and other insurance executives interviewed today questioned whether the board could actually design a standardized reinsurance agreement on which to base trading. They noted that reinsurance agreements are typically renegotiated every year, with the insurance companies involved changing the amount of insurance covered by the reinsurance agreement and changing what risks are excluded from reinsurance.
''Each time we go back to renegotiate, our client companies may have a higher appetite for risk or lower,'' said Robert Faber, a reinsurance executive at the Allstate Insurance Company. ''There just isn't any standard reinsurance arrangement.''
 
Others Skeptical
Some analysts were also skeptical. Michael Sutton, a Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst, told Reuters, ''The insurance industry is looking for security in its reinsurance relationships, and this won't be viewed as secure.'' He predicted the new product would have a tough time winning approval from state insurance commissioners. 'Who Backs It Up? ''There are clearly numerous questions that have to be asked,'' Myron Picoult, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, told the news service. ''The most obvious question is who backs it up. Who would make payments on a reinsurance futures contract? What's the balance sheet?''
Answers to these questions were not immediately available. Citing competition with other exchanges, Mark Prout, a spokesman for the Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market, declined to give any details of how the new futures would work.
Mr. Sandor said that like other futures contracts, they would provide a hedge against price swings. An insurance company that dealt in reinsurance futures would be protected against increases in the price of reinsurance, he said, since any such increase would be offset by an equal profit in the insurance company's futures position.
Reinsurers, he added, would be in a similar position: Any increase or decrease in the amount of premium income they received for entering into reinsurance agreements would be offset by a gain or loss on their futures contracts.
Futures contracts involve the delivery of a commodity - either a physical commodity like grain, or a financial instrument like cash or Treasury securities. Mr. Sandor, a former Board of Trade economist who is now president of the Banque Indosuez International Capital Markets, would not disclose what that commodity would be in the case of reinsurance futures. Presumably, though, the Board of Trade will attempt to design a standard reinsurance agreement, and as the price of that agreement changes in the normal, ''cash'' market, the futures price will change.
Although the idea of reinsurance futures has been bandied about for years, today's announcement marked the first time that a major American futures exchange had embraced the concept.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 19, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about a proposal for the creation of futures contracts related to insurance misidentified an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. He is Michael Smith, not Michael Sutton.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money-Fund Yields Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday.
Analysts at Donoghue's said the well-received government quarterly refunding last week, plus reduced fears of inflation, both here and abroad, helped move rates lower in the fixed-income markets. ''And the markets are in the process of correcting those earlier expectations,'' said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's. 
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund rose 4 basis points, to 8 percent. The temporary increase was the result of the recent rally in short-term fixed-income securities, analysts noted. The 30-day average yield remained unchanged at 7.98 percent.
Assets of taxable funds decreased by $2.3 billion for the week, to a total of $374.7 billion, with institutional assets up by $200 million, to $79.3 billion. Consumer assets, meanwhile, were off by $2.5 billion, to $295.4 billion. Fund managers pointed to the Treasury's refunding and stock market rally as explanations.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios was unchanged at 44.
Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million that are surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's, Summit Cash Reserves, distributed by Merrill Lynch Funds Distributors Inc., Princeton, N.J., led with a yield of 9.62 percent.
Yields of tax-exempt funds were down for the week ended yesterday, as assets decreased by $262 million, to total $75.3 billion. The decline was not viewed by analysts as significant. The average seven-day compounded yield was down 7 basis points, to 5.67 percent. For investors in a 28 percent tax bracket the equivalent yield in taxable securities is 7.875 percent, and 8.462 percent for those in a 33 percent bracket.
Donoghue's reported that for the third consecutive week the Calvert Tax Free Reserve California portfolio, distributed by the Calvert Group, Washington, had the best yield at 6.40 percent, down 9 basis points from the previous week. The spread over the seven-day average yield narrowed by two basis points, to 73.
By comparison, The Bank Rate Monitor's national index shows bank money market account yields off a basis point, to 6.22 percent, and six-month certificates off 3 basis points, to 7.99 percent. One-year certificates declined by a basis point, to 8.17 percent, and five-year certificates fell 3 basis points, to 8.21 percent. Two-and-a-half year certificates remained unchanged at 8.20 percent.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Japanese Rally Made in the U.S.A.

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
WHEN the Japanese stock market was tumbling in January, February and March, there was concern that the malady would spread to the United States and other world markets. But Japan's problems, for the most part, stayed at home, despite an anemic yen and rising interest rates.
Now, as if it were a payback for Japan's quarantine of these financial troubles, the United States is helping to restart the Japanese markets.
The American help came with the new forecasts this month that interest rates here would not be rising. This sent the yen, which had weakened to 160 to the dollar in April, on its strongest rally of the year as it gained 6 yen against the dollar in three trading days to settle just above 150. 
With this stronger yen, the Tokyo stock market shot up more than 500 points on Friday and Monday. Even with small declines in the last two days, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks, at 31,967.62 yesterday, is 14 percent above its low and has regained almost 4,000 of the 11,000 points it lost this year.
In the bargain, the New York Stock Exchange set its own new high this week, 2,822.45 on the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday.
Christopher M. Mitchinson, Salomon Brothers' Japanese expert in London, gives the United States ''about 100 percent'' credit for the revival in Japan. Because of the changes in May, he said yesterday, he sees a new bull market starting in Tokyo. He raised his near-term forecast for the Nikkei by 1,000 points, to a range of 29,500 to 33,000.
''I don't think there has been a lot in Japan that has changed,'' added Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York.
The change in the outlook for interest rates started with the release of the surprisingly weak United States employment report for April. The report was released on May 4, the end of Japan's so-called Golden Week, when the markets are closed for three days.
This new perception has been reinforced since then by the six-tenths of a percent fall in April retail sales, the four-tenths of a percent decline in industrial production and the 5.8 percent dip in housing starts. At the same time, the inflation outlook has eased, with the Producer Price Index for finished goods falling three-tenths of a percent and the Consumer Price Index, which was reported yesterday, rising only two-tenths of a percent in April.
Some analysts say the new signs of weakness in the economy, combined with the reassuring numbers on inflation, will even tip the Federal Reserve toward easing interest rates a little. Certainly, by the middle of last week, most investors were no longer thinking that the Fed might raise interest rates.
In this climate, Japanese investors began buying yen again. The result, which was followed by investors around the world, knocked the dollar down almost 4 yen Friday and 1.5 yen Tuesday. The dollar moved up yesterday to 151.67, but it is still well below the 158.45 level on Friday, May 4.
''If the economy is slowing down, it is not so good to chase the dollar so much,'' said Hideaki Matsuura, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. ''So they reversed.''
''Japanese investors can change their minds very quickly and Japanese investors always have the same opinion,'' Mr. Matsura added, explaining the yen's sudden, sharp rise against the dollar.
''They got confidence from these reports, so it was very easy for the Japanese investors to take this position,'' he said.
Mr. Matsuura and Mr. Mitchinson have also seen early signs of Japanese investors selling American bonds so they can take advantage of low prices in the Japanese stock and bond markets.
Mr. Mitchinson added that Japanese were beginning to reverse their hedging positions in favor of a slightly stronger yen. By his estimates, they have bought $5 billion to $15 billion worth of yen recently, after selling as much as $175 billion in the first three months of the year in anticipation of a weaker yen.
Psychological assistance may also come from the muting of the unusually public dispute between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance over interest-rate policy.
Because of this new impetus from the United States, many analysts have declared the start of a new rally in Japan, although they caution that there may be some backsliding.
But if the yen rally is reversed - or if it does not break through the 150 level - there may be more steps backward for a while than expected.
Peter Rona, president of IBJ Schroder Bank and Trust Company, is worried that the yen's turnaround will not last. While he is not concerned about consumer inflation, which is very low, the rapid rise in land and other asset values means the economy is still at risk. Mr. Rona is also not yet assured that West German pressure for higher interest rates has abated.
''The difficulities in the Japanese market are not resolved,'' he said, ''and this incredible rise in the yen is just that, incredible.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower; Gold Prices Retreat in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly lower on world currency markets yesterday in light trading. Gold prices retreated after rising overseas.
Traders said the dollar was barely affected by fresh Government data pointing to slow economic growth and moderate inflation. The Government said consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted two-tenths of 1 percent in April, while housing starts were down a larger-than-expected 5.8 percent. 
The figures were ''enough to weaken the dollar, but it has not gone down that much,'' said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
There was a feeling in the market that the dollar had bottomed out for the time being, traders said. Some noted that they were unable to push the dollar below 150 Japanese yen, which proved to be a ''formidable barrier,'' Mr. Johnson said.
Most market participants were awaiting today's release of merchandise trade data for March to confirm their suspicions that the dollar is headed lower. The expectation is for a deficit of between $7.7 billion and $8.5 billion. February's deficit totaled $6.49 billion.
A large deficit is negative for the dollar. When the United States imports more than it exports, it diminishes the need for dollars by foreigners to purchase United States goods. But over time a weak dollar helps the trade picture by making United States goods more competitive overseas.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 151.95 yen, up from 151.30 on Tuesday. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 151.33 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 151.67 yen, up from 150.83.
In London, the pound rose to $1.6805 from Tuesday's late $1.6775. In New York, one pound fetched $1.6805, more expensive than $1.6725 on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.6450 West German marks, down from 1.6465; 1.4005 Swiss francs, up from 1.3980; 5.5460 French francs, down from 5.5540; 1,210.00 Italian lire, down from 1,211.75, and 1.1751 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1770.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $369 a troy ounce, off $1.90 from late Tuesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $369.05 an ounce, down $1.20.
In overseas precious metals markets, gold traded at a late bid price of $370.00 a troy ounce in London, up from $367.75. The closing bid price in Zurich was $369.85, up from $367.50. Gold closed in Hong Kong at $369.95 bid, up from $368.10.
Silver prices eased. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current deliver settled at $5.010 a troy ounce, off slightly from Tuesday's $5.012. In London the metal traded at a late bid price of $5.05 a troy ounce, down from $5.07.

HEADLINE: Senate Control: Who Cares?

BYLINE: By Ken Bode; Ken Bode directs the Center for Contemporary Media, at DePauw University.

DATELINE: GREENCASTLE, Ind.

 BODY:
The Senate is in danger of losing its leading student of U.F.O. abductions, near-death experiences and other psychic phenomena.
Claiborne Pell, sixth-ranking in Senate seniority and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is rated as no better than a toss-up to beat Representative Claudine Schneider in a race that is as near as there is to a bellwether indicator for 1990.
For the G.O.P. to regain control of the Senate - which is more than a theoretical possibility - Representative Schneider, a moderate Republican, must beat Mr. Pell, a moderate Democrat, in a race that lacks burning issues. Republicans also must win four other Democratic seats (they're within hailing distance of winning a total of six), while holding all those they now occupy (no Republican seat is now in serious jeopardy). A 50-50 split would cast Vice President Dan Quayle as the permanent tie-breaker. 
This year's main issue ought to be who controls the Senate. But the way the Senate operates, it doesn't much matter who is in the driver's seat.
Senate elections have proved more volatile than any others in recent cycles. In 1980, fueled by Jimmy Carter's high-inflation, high-interest economics, all the close races broke in the same direction as the Reagan landslide, giving the G.O.P. control for the first time in 25 years. Six years later, when Ronald Reagan put his prestige on the line to save the G.O.P. incumbents, all the close races broke the other way, creating the Democrats' 55-to-45 margin.
This year, substituting, say, the liberal, pro-choice Republican Lynn Martin in Illinois for the liberal, pro-choice Democrat Paul Simon, and the Republican Tom Tauke for the Democrat Tom Harkin in Iowa won't mean much one way or the other.
A Republican-controlled Senate wouldn't embrace Daniel Patrick Moynihan's Social Security plan, but the Democrats didn't either. It wouldn't give George Bush much trouble on dicey foreign policy choices like Lithuania, but neither did the Democrats.
How much it matters may be seen in the faces of the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, and House Speaker Tom Foley as they arrived at the White House to do the tax lambada. Interest rates are nudging up; Mr. Bush needs cover so he can duck out on his no-new-taxes pledge; Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Foley were there to help. No teen-agers ever looked happier to be invited to a party.
With no firm national agenda, Mr. Bush is not asking the Senate to do much, but when he does, the Democrats go along, with or without a veto.
Granted, without control of the committee structure, the Democrats would not be able to put a Supreme Court nominee through the torture they organized for Robert Bork. Yet, on a partisan issue like renewing the Chinese students' visas, would a G.O.P.-controlled Senate be any less accommodating to Mr. Bush than the Democrats?
Cowed by his poll ratings, the Democrats have become a party of policy freelancers who communicate with each other through Op-Ed pages.
Here in Indiana, Representative Lee Hamilton might have won Dan Quayle's old Senate seat, but he declined to run. Mr. Hamilton now tells Democratic audiences that they must not think of the Democrats only as the opposition party. ''We're also the governing party,'' he says. ''We have a joint responsibility [with President Bush] to make the country work. We're in an uneasy coalition.'' That is a good statement of the problem. U.S. coalition governments are for wartime. Both parties have been propping each other up long enough; it's time for opposition.
Richard Nixon used to say that a President who is not irritating his own political base isn't doing all he could as a leader. George Bush isn't even irritating the Democrats.
In an issueless election cycle, with the economy teetering but not falling and little to stir public interest, it's a long shot that the G.O.P. could beat enough Democratic incumbents to take over the Senate. But if it does happen, Senator Pell will no longer be around to receive special back-room briefings from Uri Geller, the psychic spoon-bender. Without Mr. Pell, research support for sneak peeks at the hereafter will be endangered. Apart from that, it's hard to see how things will be much different.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with the Prime Minister of Lithuania in the Kremlin tonight and agreed to begin talks with the breakaway republic if the Lithuanian Parliament suspends its declaration of independence.
The official, Kazimiera Prunskiene, said tonight that the meeting, the first face-to-face encounter between Mr. Gorbachev and a leader of the Baltic republic, was a significant move toward negotiations that could lower the tension surrounding Lithuania's claim of sovereignty, made on March 11, and possibly end the limited economic blockade that Moscow has imposed in retribution.
Both the Lithuanian Prime Minister and the Soviet press agency Tass, reporting on the meeting tonight, said a serious hurdle remained in the way of beginning talks.
 
Status of the Argument
Lithuania has offered to suspend the application of its independence proclamation, including laws repealing the Soviet military draft and laying claim to national property, but the republic has previously insisted that suspending the act itself might jeopardize its status as an equal partner in talks with Moscow. 
Mrs. Prunskiene indicated that this difference should not be insurmountable. She said she would offer a version of a new compromise that might be considered by the Lithuanian Parliament as early as Saturday.
She emphasized that she had told Mr. Gorbachev that independence itself was not negotiable, and said he did not dispute the point.
''He said the fact that we met, that we discussed the issues, that we made progress from our previous positions - this was a big step forward,'' Mrs. Prunskiene said.
 
Freer Hand for U.S. Talks
The meeting, which lasted an hour and 40 minutes, also appeared likely to ease the threat that the Lithuania conflict could overshadow Mr. Gorbachev's meeting with President Bush in Washington, beginning May 30.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, reached tonight in Moscow, said that from what he had heard of the Kremlin meeting, ''it would be a very encouraging step.''
Mr. Baker is scheduled to see Mrs. Prunskiene on Friday after a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, a session that tonight promised to be a bit more relaxed.
''One of the things we have wanted to see throughout this was the two sides talking face to face,'' said a senior American official who is here with Mr. Baker. ''Here, you have them not only talking face to face, but at a high level.''
The official added: ''We're pleased. You don't want to get carried away with it, either. But it's a real positive step in the right direction.''
The Lithuanian offer and Mrs. Prunskiene's mission to Moscow were timed to catch Mr. Gorbachev at a moment when he would be eager for progress toward a settlement. Unless Moscow eases its embargo on fuel and other supplies, Lithuania is expected to exhaust its oil supplies around the time of the Washington meeting.
 
Quickly Invited In
Mrs. Prunskiene had no assurance she would be welcomed in Moscow when she arrived this afternoon, bearing a compromise offer approved by the Lithuanian Parliament in a closed session on Wednesday.
But soon after her arrival, she said, Mr. Gorbachev telephoned and invited her to meet there this evening. They were joined by the Soviet Prime Minister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
Mrs. Prunskiene said she got no firm commitment that Moscow would lift the economic sanctions that have caused an estimated 30,000 workers in Lithuania to be sent home from fuel-starved factories.
But she said the issue was discussed, and she left with an understanding that ''there will be an appropriate decision'' if the Soviet leadership is satisfied by the Lithuanian Parliament's next move.
 
Paris-Bonn Blueprint
The offer that Mrs. Prunskiene brought to Moscow closely resembled a compromise suggested last month by President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany. They proposed that Lithuania's sovereignty be accepted, but that the republic suspend any actions flowing from the decision as a basis for opening talks.
The meeting with Mr. Gorbachev was a significant step forward for several reasons.
First, the Soviet President has forsaken his earlier insistence that he would not meet with Lithuanian leaders until they had agreed to abide by Soviet law.
Second, it was the most explicit statement to date of the Kremlin's position, which has at times seemed deliberately ambiguous - at one point praising the Mitterrand-Kohl proposal, at other points insisting that Lithuania retreat all the way back to March 10, the day before it voted on independence.
 
How Moscow Views It
Tass confirmed tonight that if the declaration was not repealed but suspended, it would be sufficient.
Third, Mrs. Prunskiene got a clear and direct promise that if Lithuania agreed to those terms, this would lead to the long-sought talks.
Suspending the independence act, Tass said, ''will immediately pave the way for the discussion of issues that worry peoples inhabiting Lithuania and that give rise to grave concern of Soviet republics, Soviet, and world opinion.''
This promise, along with whatever message she takes home from her meeting with Mr. Baker on Friday, may be enough to ease suspicions on the Lithuanian side.
 
Effect on Neighbors
Lithuania's situation is likely to affect the two other Baltic republics, Estonia and Latvia. After Lithuania's declaration of independence, announced as a clean break with Moscow, Estonia said on March 30 that it would make a gradual withdrawal from the Soviet Union. On May 4, Latvia declared independence. In a move seemingly intended to reduce the possibilities for confrontation with Moscow, it established an open-ended transition period to independence, during which most Soviet laws would apply.
Mr. Gorbachev has insisted that any move to leave the Soviet Union must follow the procedures spelled out in a new Soviet law. These procedures include approval of independence by the republic's residents in a referendum, a transition period up to five years, and final approval by the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies.
But Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have said that they were illegally incorporated into the Soviet Union and that therefore they will not submit to such laws. In 1940, Stalin annexed the three republics under a secret protocol to a pact with Hitler.
 
Freedom Is Another Matter
Mrs. Prunskiene, now a seasoned diplomat after her missions to the White House, Canada and European capitals, appeared buoyed by the Kremlin reception.
''Now we know to what the extent the other side has moved ahead, that there has been major progress, and what are the sticking points on the main issues,'' she told reporters tonight at the Lithuanian mission in Moscow. ''We can say quite clearly that the desire and intentions to begin a discussion on the entire range of issues, within a framework of interests on both sides, have been expressed.''
Mrs. Prunskiene said that while the Soviet leaders seemed eager to end the stalemate, they were far from enthusiastic about the idea of Lithuania actually getting its freedom from the Soviet Union.
''Do they want or welcome the independence of Lithuania?'' she asked rhetorically. ''I not only doubt this, but I am sure they have no such desire. I confirmed once again today that they have trouble with this kind of decision, when a people independently decides an issue without the involvement of the Kremlin.''

HEADLINE: NEGOTIATORS SEE A $60 BILLION LIMIT ON CUTS IN DEFICIT

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
White House and Congressional negotiators ended their second day of budget talks today in general consensus that the Federal deficit for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1 could not be cut more than $60 billion without tipping the economy into a recession.
That assessment complicated the negotiators' task, because even the most optimistic forecasts suggested that a cut of $50 billion to $60 billion would not be enough to bring the deficit down to the $64 billion ceiling mandated for 1991 by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law. Such a cut would also be more than twice what has ever been achieved in a single year since the Government began the effort to rein in the defiicit five years ago.
The consensus that emerged today, therefore, seemed to enhance the likelihood that in addition to cutting spending and raising taxes, the negotiators will ultimately have to raise the Gramm-Rudman ceiling. 
 
Bush Turnabout on Taxes
The negotiations between Congress and the White House got under way Tuesday, two weeks after President Bush had abandoned his staunch position against new taxes and called for the talks. In the days since the President's appeal, it has become apparent that Administration officials saw negotiations as a way of remedying incorrect signals sent early this year when the White House offered a budget proposal based on economic forecasts that were far too optimistic. [News analysis, page A15.] Participants in the talks said today that an early item on the table when the negotiators begin examining their options would be removing the cost of the savings-and-loan bailout from the formula used to calculate the budget deficit.
Even after that, however, the deficit would be $65 billion to $100 billion or more above the Gramm-Rudman target, participants said. The negotiators are thus facing unpalatable choices: risk recession, in their view. with spending cuts and tax increases totaling more than $60 billion; raise the target in the budget-balancing law and thus loosen the only current form of discipline that governs the Federal budget-making process, or both.
The negotiatiors were far from having to face such difficult decisions, since they have not been able to agree on the ground rules for their bargaining: the figure that will be used as the estimated size of the deficit from which they will be paring.
The Gramm-Rudman law requires automatic cuts in domestic and military spending if the ceiling that the law sets is not met. According to documents distributed after the talks today, Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, said automatic cuts would total from $59 billion to $74 billion, with as much as 20 percent coming from military programs and 27 percent from domestic spending.
Congressional estimates for automatic spending cuts were even more pessimistic, ranging from $85 billion to $95 billion. Neither estimate takes into account the estimated $50 billion that the savings-and-loan bailout will cost in 1991.
 
Political Risks Likely
A decision to abandon the rules that have governed fiscal policy for the last five years by raising the ceiling of the budget-balancing law would allow the Government to avoid larger cuts than officials believe the economy can handle, but it would be politically risky.
Such a decision could raise questions in the financial markets about the Government's will to control the deficit. It could also affect local elections if lawmakers appear to be reneging on their commitment to get the deficit under control, and might encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
Participants in the budget negotiations said today's two hours of discussions, which took place on Capitol Hill between a team from the White House and a bipartisan Congressional delegation, were devoted to exploring the vast differences between the economic forecasts and the deficit estimates provided by economists in the Administration and on Capitol Hill.
Before discussing in detail ways to cut spending and raise taxes, Congress and the White House must first agree on a way to estimate how big the gap between Government spending and Government revenue will be in the next fiscal year. To do so, they must agree on forecasts for interest rates and other economic indicators, on estimates of how much the Government will make in taxes in the next fiscal year and on other economic factors.
Several participants in the budget negotiations said the two sides have been narrowing their differences, but that a significant gap remained.
Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the Congressional estimate for the budget deficit was still about $26 billion higher than the White House estimate. And that did not include the cost of the savings-and-loan bailout.
 
Some White House Flexibility
Representative Leon E. Panetta, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the Administration seemed more flexible about its budget figures than it had in the past. ''If there is any change that we've seen, it is that Darman is willing now to move toward more realistic assumptions,'' Mr. Panetta said.
But he and other Democratic lawmakers said there was much work to be done on this issue, and the negotiators asked Mr. Darman and Mr. Reischauer to work over the weekend to reconcile their deficit estimates.
The next session of the budget talks is set for next Tuesday, but Representative Richard G. Gephardt, the House majority leader, indicated that it did not seem likely the dispute over the deficit figures would be resolved by then.
Mr. Panetta said that in today's negotiations Mr. Reischauer suggested that the deficit could not be reduced by more than about 1 percent of the gross national product, or $50 billion to $60 billion, without risking damage to the economy.
He said Mr. Darman and Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, concurred with that assessment. But Mr. Panetta indicated he was not convinced that even that much could be achieved.
Other Democratic lawmakers said they agreed in concept that there is a point at which cutting the deficit would do more harm than good to the economy. But they said they did not know what that figure was because they remained skeptical about the Administration's economic estimates, which have been changing over the last few months.

HEADLINE: Economic Pulse; The Farm Belt;
New Decade Finds New Hope on Farm

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 17

 BODY:
This is a springtime of renewed hope in the nation's Grain Belt.
After a decade of widely varying fortunes and misfortunes, including an economic crisis in the early 1980's and a drought across some of the most productive grain-growing areas in the last two years, farmers have entered the first growing season of the 1990's with more money to spend, lower debts to pay and the benefits of a three-year resurgence of profits.
Those changes have taken place against some longer-term changes in agriculture. Big farms keep getting bigger and small farms, while still the most numerous, are likely to be the avocations of people who make most of their money elsewhere.
 
Big Farms Are Big Gainers
The big farms continue to enjoy disproportional shares of the profits from agriculture, as they have long done, because they are aided by the biggest shares of Government subsidy payments. But these big farmers end up spending their income farther and farther from the home town: small rural towns in agricultural counties continue to lose people and stores. 
Agricultural economists say most of what is happening in the dozen states in the Grain Belt, from North Dakota to Texas, is also taking place in predominantly agricultural counties throughout the United States.
Mark Drabenstott, an assistant vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., sketched the broad picture in a few strokes: ''The farm economy is very strong. The weaker farmers have already been squeezed out. Farming now is mostly in the hands of efficient producers with reduced debt loads.''
 
Rural Towns Are Hurting
''The big farms,'' he said, ''are getting larger and more profitable, and they have seen three years of record farm income, but all that has not done much for most of our small rural towns.''
Gary Benjamin, a vice president and economic adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, offered much the same assessment.
''If you look at the farmers' balance sheet, you see a very strong picture,'' he said. ''Land values have recovered, and farm debts have declined 30 percent from the peak of 1983. In fact, the national farm debt in relation to farm assets is as low as it has been at any time since the 1960's.''
 
The Bumpy Decade
Soaring Heights To Rock Bottom
In some ways, the optimism spreading across the Grain Belt recalls the crest of optimism at the start of the 1980's. Farmers entered the decade with a sense of well-being buoyed by steadily rising land values that could, if growers had sold out at the peak, have made millionaires of many people.
In the early 1970's, Communist countries had opened their markets to American farm products. Drought-stricken developing countries turned to the United States for food. Richard M. Nixon's Administration devalued the dollar, making American farm goods cheaper for foreign customers.
In response, American growers eagerly expanded production. American farmers were told they had a mission, to feed the world, and they set out to do it. Prices kept rising. The future seemed limitless, and many farmers bought up all the land their neighbors were willing to sell, blithely paying steadily escalating prices for new acreage and plunging still deeper into dept for new machinery to farm it.
 
World Competition Increases
By 1982, the situation had changed. Because crops were bringing such high prices in international markets, largely because of the guaranteed prices under the United States farm policy, increasing numbers of growers around the world decided to compete for part of the pie. Former customer countries began to vie for markets the American farmers had long regarded as their own.
Exports, which reached a peak of nearly $44 billion in 1981, dropped 40 percent, to $26.3 billion in 1986. The country's agricultural trade surplus, $26.5 billion in 1981, plunged to $5.5 billion in 1986.
Suddenly, farmers who had borrowed lavishly found themselves under mountains of debt, with bills for interest they could not pay. Surpluses mounted, prices fell, and the nation's farmers, who had earned more than $27 billion in 1979, made only $23.5 billion in 1982. And that looked like a good year by 1983 when they earned only $12.7 billion.
 
Horror Story of Farm Sales
By 1985, many farmers, in the grip of the worst agricultural depression in 50 years, were surrendering their land and equipment to rural bankers, who often found themselves in trouble, too. County sheriffs plastered their bulletin boards with notices of bankruptcy sales, and in small towns like Plattsburg, Mo., about 50 miles north of here, sheriffs' sales of bankrupt farms became a weekly horror story.
Congress came to the rescue, and, as it had done so often, it poured money on the farm troubles, passing the Food Security Act of 1985. The bill was intended to cut farm price supports enough to recapture foreign markets for American growers. To make up the difference for farmers, the Government gave them increased subsidy payments.
The bill did most of what it was intended to do, but at a heavy cost to taxpayers. Federal outlays on farm programs totaled $26 billion in 1986 - more than all the income all farmers earned in 1982 and twice what they made in 1983. But farm exports began to recover, and farm income started rising.
By 1987, the recovery was well under way. Land values, which had fallen anywhere from about 30 to more than 50 percent across the Grain Belt, began a long, slow recovery.
 
Weather Presents Problem
But in 1988, yet another blow fell. The weather turned hot and dry, and from Nebraska across Illinois and Indiana eastward to Ohio, corn and soybeans withered. In Missouri and Iowa, farm ponds dried up. In some states whole fields blew away.
Once again, Congress came to the rescue, this time with $3.9 billion in drought relief. And when the Corn Belt's drought of 1988 was followed in 1989 by a dry summer in Kansas and other winter-wheat states, Congress voted still another rescue bill, with nearly $1 billion for farmers.
Even dust clouds can have silver linings, as farmers like Mark Borchers and Barry Bergman discovered when they started to harvest their 1988 crops near Ida Grove in western Iowa. The vagaries of the weather gave them decent rains while other Iowans were suffering. As the drought created shortages that helped to deplete surpluses in the nation's grain bins, it produced a bonus for thousands of farmers like them. Not only did they get good prices for their new crops, they also found a better market for the thousands of bushels of corn and soybeans stored in their bins.
And now, as economists assess the results of the influences on the farm economy for the last two years, they find that even the drought did not stop the recovery.
 
The Harvest
Ebullience In Grain Fields
Their assessment is borne out by changes that have taken place in the grain fields and at rural auctions as well as in the offices of groups like Prairiefire that provided both comfort and aid for farmers through the depths of the farm crisis.
Although there are still some areas that are too dry and many, especially in the Southern Plains, where heavy rains have not only delayed spring planting but also caused severe flooding, most farmers across the broad midlands have seen improvements in the weather this year as well as in the agricultural economy.
Darwin McCall, for example, has been watching lush green stands of wheat grow in fields where both topsoil and seedlings blew away in dust clouds a year ago. With a hint of a smile, Mr. McCall remarked the other day, ''It looks like 1990 is going to be a little different.''
David Ostendorf, Prairiefire's director, said, ''There is no question the dynamics of the situation has changed.'' The group's toll-free telephone line, set up to counsel distressed farmers, now receives about a dozen calls a week, he said; in 1985 and 1986 the numbers were 20 to 30 a day.
 
Different Reason for Auctions
At a recent auction of used farm equipment at Larned, near Great Bend in central Kansas wheat country, Larry Carr of Carr Auctions and Real Estate pointed out a still more striking illustration of changing moods. In 1985 and 1986, most of the sales were signs of farm failures, he said. In a dismal atmosphere, neighbors of the farmers who could no longer hang on gloomily watched the process. The bidding was languid and often tinged with a sense of guilt.
The other day the bidding was spirited with hundreds of items, including 56 tractors and more than 100 farm trucks up for sale. ''I don't think I've ever seen used farm equipment sell so well,'' Mr. Carr said.
He said that rather than making distress sales, farmers were selling machinery they no longer needed because of the Federal Government's Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to leave land fallow for 10-year periods. Many bidders had money from subsidies received through the Food Security Act of 1985.
Behind such signs, economists note, are figures reflecting improvements in farmers' finances. For three years in a row, farmers' net income nationwide has exceeded $40 billion, a level reached for the first time in 1987. Last year the net farm income was $49 billion. In constant dollars, adjusting for inflation, that was more than three times as much as growers earned in 1983.
Economists say the outlook for the year ahead is equally strong, with both crop producers and livestock growers expected to do well, a rare combination on the farm front. Total cash revenue from livestock and crop production is expected to exceed $160 billion this year for the first time ever. The forecast for net farm income is $45 billion to $49 billion. In 1983, when farmers' net income hit bottom at $12.7 billion, their sales totaled $135 billion.
 
Word From the Other Side
Not everyone is as ebullient as Mr. Drabenstott and Mr. Benjamin of the Federal Reserve Bank.
''It's a shallow rebound,'' said Mr. Ostendorf of Prairiefire. ''The Federal Government made a decision to buy its way out of the farm crisis and pumped dollars into the agricultural economy. But nothing basically has changed except that the most economically distressed are now gone. They had already been wiped out.''
Mr. Drabenstott had a similar concern. ''What is very bothersome is that after three years of a strong recovery, agriculture is still so dependent on Government payments,'' he said.
Although they are likely to drop slightly this year, he said, ''direct Government payments of $9 billion to $10 billion will continue to remind us of Washington's role in the recovery.''
 
The Future
Changing Face Of Rural America
Not everyone has participated to the same extent in the benefits of the agricultural turnaround.
The latest analysis of farm-income data by the Agriculture Department, published in December, is based on figures for 1988 from the agency's annual Farm Costs and Returns Survey. It shows total net income for farmers continuing to rise despite that year's severe drought. On average, the increase was about $350 a farm.
But only the largest category of farms analyzed, those with sales of more than $500,000 a year, showed an increase in profits in 1988. The middle-size farms held relatively steady, continuing to improve their financial picture by reducing their debts, but showing little change in income.
 
Money Made Off the Farm
The profit picture of the small farmers is more complicated. Even though many lose money and few make more than a few thousand dollars a year on farming, which is usually a part-time business, most have substantial incomes from nonfarm vocations.
The average combined farm and nonfarm income for those with operations producing $10,000 to $20,000 in sales, for example, was $46,934 in 1988. Most of that - $41,217 - was income that had nothing to do with farming.
Other disparities can be found in the effects of the farm recovery on rural communities, the experts say.
''The breakpoint now is a population of about 5,000,'' said Kenneth Stone of Iowa State University, who has studied the rise and fall of his state's small towns for many years.
''There seems to be a point where they have a critical mass,'' he continued. ''If they lose important stores, other trade slips away, too. Grocery stores seem pivotal. If the grocery store leaves, the hardware trade won't be far behind.''
Mike Cheese, who runs the only grocery store left in Lenox, a town of about 1,300 people in Taylor County, Iowa, is all too familiar with the problems. A competing grocery store, a farm-implement dealer, an automobile dealer and a feed store, among others, closed during the farm crisis. And, though his own business has picked up, Mr. Cheese said nothing had replaced the closed stores.
 
'Slowdown in Deterioration'
''What you are seeing is a sort of slowdown in the deterioration, but in the small towns you are not going to see a turnaround,'' said Barry L. Flinchbaugh, an economist at Kansas State University. ''Agriculture is not a people-intensive industry anymore, and there aren't enough to support the number of small rural towns we still have. And when those small towns lose their bank, lose their grocery store and lose their machinery dealer, those things just don't come back.''
Kenneth Deavers, an economist who heads the rural development division in the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service, agrees with the two professors.
''The process they are describing is one that has been going on for 10 or 15 years,'' he said. ''And it is happening not only there but across the rest of rural America.''

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Baker Has New Arms Deal For Moscow, Officials Say

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has taken new ideas for reducing conventional forces in Europe to Moscow, in an attempt to accommodate the Soviet position on a number of issues that have slowed completion of a treaty, American and Western diplomats said today.
Mr. Baker told NATO foreign ministers in a letter sent on Tuesday, the day he arrived in Moscow, that he planned to explore the compromise ideas in his meetings with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union. The ideas include a higher limit on tactical aircraft, which has been a major point of contention in conventional force talks in Vienna.
The Soviet press agency Tass said today that Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze had a thorough discussion of conventional arms questions in their talks in Moscow, but provided no details. 
 
Growing Concern Over Talks
Mr. Baker's trip to Moscow comes as concern grows in the Administration over the lagging pace of the East-West conventional arms talks, which involve 23 NATO and Warsaw Pact nations.
The two sides have said they hope to conclude a treaty this year. But NATO and the Warsaw Pact have been at odds over what limits to set on tactical aircraft and other technical issues.
A Bush Administration official said this week that the Administration wanted to speed the talks, fearing that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev might have second thoughts about the large reductions in Soviet forces and weapons in Eastern Europe that are under discussion.
''We wanted to give Gorbachev an incentive to move ahead and complete this treaty as quickly as possible,'' the official said.
The Bush Administration's interest in negotiating cuts in conventional forces comes as the United States and Western European nations are looking to cut their militiary force and budgets. The Pentagon said today that the United States would not formally ask NATO allies to increase after-inflation defense spending by 3 percent a year when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney goes to Brussels next week for a meeting of NATO defense ministers.
 
Pentagon Sets Percent of Cuts
''Given the changes in European security requirements, we are no longer asking our allies to increase their defense budgets by 3 percent,'' the Pentagon statement said. Instead, the United States will ask its allies to ''contribute to the military force structure required by the NATO military command.''
The Pentagon is projecting 2 percent annual cuts in its budget over the next six years, after inflation has been taken into account.
In his letter to the NATO foreign ministers, Mr. Baker identified six areas in which he hoped to find common ground with Mr. Shevardnadze during his talks in Moscow, officials said.
 
Limit on Aircraft
Mr. Baker reportedly said in his letter that he was prepared to discuss a limit on aircraft in the 6,000 range, a higher level than NATO had previously been willing to accept. Such a limit would be intended to partially accommodate the Russians, who have resisted earlier Western demands for deeper cuts in their conventional aircraft, officials said.
Mr. Baker also reportedly indicated a willingness to explore a compromise on another difficult issue - the maximum number of weapons that any single country would be permitted.
NATO has previously said that no more than 60 percent of total tanks, artillery pieces and armored troop carriers held by the Warsaw Pact could be Soviet. Moscow has said that this limit is too low, especially since the Warsaw Pact is becoming an alliance in name only.
Other issues identified by Mr. Baker for potential compromise include the rate at which equipment is to be destroyed, the definition of ground equipment, and the extent of verification provisions.
 
Concerns About Inspections
Moscow, which would have to destroy far more equipment under the emerging accord than the United States would, has indicated that it would have difficulty quickly eliminating its tanks, artillery pieces, armored troop carriers and aircraft. And the Soviet Union has reportedly raised concerns about the number of inspections that would be held on its military bases.
Officials familiar with Mr. Baker's letter said that the Secretary expressed his intention to explore possible compromises with an eye to developing formal proposals for presentation in the Vienna talks.
''The general sense of the letter is exploring Soviet flexibility and splitting the difference,'' a Western official said.
Mr. Baker also indicated that he would assure Moscow that the United States would begin a second round of conventional arms talks after an initial pact is reached on reducing conventional forces in Europe.
 
Ceiling on German Army
During a recent meeting in Bonn with Mr. Shevardnadze on German reunification, Mr. Baker reportedly indicated that the United States would consider a Soviet proposal to limit troops in central Europe in a second round of talks, Administration officials said.
The Soviets have sought such a limit in the current negotiations to establish a ceiling on the size of the German Army. The West has rejected such a limit in the current talks, but Mr. Baker's indication that Washington would take this up in the second round was intended as a conciliatory move.
On tactical aircraft, the United States had previously proposed an effective limit of 5,200 combat aircraft. Moscow, in contrast, has proposed an effective limit of 7,700 combat planes, though the two sides do not agree on all of the types of planes that should be covered by the accord.
A limit in the 6,000 range would appear to roughly split the difference between the two sides. Depending on what precise limit is specified, such a provision might not require any cuts in NATO forces because the West has fewer planes. Previously, NATO has said that it was seeking a limit on weapons that would be 15 percent below its current holdings.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Gorbachev Are Cookies, Song and Friendly Advice From Ex-Foes: Minnesota;
Companies Hoping for New Market

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, May 17

 BODY:
A man who lives on the St. Croix River called to offer Mikhail S. Gorbachev use of his cabin, in case he wanted to rest up before his flight.
A woman telephoned, saying she wanted to bake the Soviet President some cookies. Students at a local elementary school asked if they could sing him a song. And in case he needs a car, when he is here, a dealership has set aside a nice four-door, free of charge. 
Two days after Minnesota learned officially that Mr. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, would be passing through town on June 3, state officials have been inundated with invitations, offers of gifts and advice.
''I've had to set up a phone bank to handle the volume,'' said Richard Bohr, who as head of the state trade office is in charge of arrangements.
Some of the most eager suitors have been business leaders who hope to use the visit to tout the state's business and industry, in the hopes of tapping into the Soviet market.
 
The Biggest Dividend
But with more than two weeks to go before Mr. Gorbachev arrives, the biggest dividend has already been earned by Gov. Rudy Perpich.
By accepting Mr. Perpich's formal invitation to visit Minnesota, following his summit meeting with President Bush, Mr. Gorbachev just gave the Governor's sagging political fortunes a world-class election-year lift.
Mr. Perpich, a member of the Democrat Farm Labor Party, had been fading in the polls in his bid for a third term as Governor. Some doubted he would even win his party's nomination in the primary next fall.
''Pre-Gorbachev, and I mean just a few days ago, I don't think anyone took him seriously,'' said D. J. Leary, who edits a political newsletter here. ''Now he looks like a kind of visionary. It's given him credence he didn't have.''
 
Grudging Congratulations
Doug Kelley, one of four Republicans who are planning to run for governor, said he had to offer Governor Perpich grudging congratulations. ''I don't know who deserves the credit,'' he told The St. Paul Pioneer Press earlier this week. ''But I know who will take the credit.''
Mr. Gorbachev's planned visit to Minnesota marks the second time a Soviet leader has stopped over in the Midwest. In 1959, Nikita S. Khrushchev spent two days in Iowa, where he sampled hot dogs at a meat-packing plant, and toured a farm where he complained that American corn had ''too much stalk and not enough corn.''
If an Iowa farm served as the appropriate metaphor for the Midwest in 1959, then Minneapolis and St. Paul describe a more accurate contemporary illustration of the region.
 
Diverse and Prosperous Economy
While the Twin Cities still reflect the prowess of Midwestern agriculture, their skyscraper-like grain elevators, spread out freeways and ranks of steel-and-glass office towers underscore an increasingly diverse and prosperous urban economy, in which computers and high technology now play a very large role.
Tom Triplett, the executive director of the Minnesota Business Parternship, which represents the state's 90 largest companies, said Soviet leaders see in Minnesota ''the ABC's they need -agriculture, biotech and computers.''
It was one of those companies, Control Data, that had an important role in steering Mr. Gorbachev toward Minnesota. Control Data sold the first large American computers to the Soviet Union in 1968, and the company has maintained a strong relationship with Moscow ever since.
 
Invitations and Gifts
The news of the Gorbachev visit has taken Minnesota by storm.
Moscow Township, a rural community in southeastern Minnesota, has invited Mr. Gorbachev to visit the town, the namesake of the Soviet capital. As an added lure, the township clerk, J. Michael Taylor, said they have even promised him some Rubles, as in the family of Richard Ruble, chairman of township board.
So far, no one has come up with a schedule for the visit, which Governor Perpich and his staff are still planning in consultation with Soviet officials.
Several different events are being considered. There is talk about a trip to a farm, or motorcade through the city, or a public appearance at the state Capitol.
 
Possible Protests
Some political groups representing Baltic organizations also talked about possible protests during Mr. Gorbachev's visit, although it was expected they would be low key.
''This is a very polite, a very well-mannered state,'' said Mr. Leary. ''It took people here 20 years before they decided it was okay to boo the Vikings.''
There are plans to put signs around the city, welcoming Mr. and Mrs. Gorbachev. But the Gorbachevs might also catch a glimpse of other billboards that were put up several weeks ago, and which use Mr. Gorbachev's face to advertise a locally manufactured vodka brand.
The billboard shows Mr. Gorbachev, appearing to hold a bottle of the vodka. The text alongside reads: ''The party's over,'' an apparent reference to the demise of Communist power. There have been calls to cover the billboards during the visit, but so far no action has been taken.
State officials said the public reaction to the visit underscored the good will Mr. Gorbachev has among Americans. A state poll last summer showed that two out of every three Minnesotans regarded him favorably.
With the primary just four months off, that's good news for Mr. Perpich, who could use Mr. Gorbachev's coattails. In recent polls here, only one in three voters gave the Governor a favorable rating.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Gorbachev Are Cookies, Song and Friendly Advice From Ex-Foes: Stanford;
Red Carpet Readied by Conservatives

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif., May 17

 BODY:
The archivist at the Hoover Institution here is readying a display of Soviet historical documents that will include the final draft of the abdication letter of Czar Nicholas II, a rare first edition of the Communist Manifesto and the only surviving copy of Pravda's first issue.
Meanwhile, the economists at this conservative think tank, which was a source of policy ideas and personnel for the Reagan Administration, are polishing their presentation of how free market principles are best applied to taxes, spending, welfare and business regulation.
These are heady days at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, which shares a bucolic campus on the peninsula south of San Francisco with Stanford University. On June 4, if all goes according to plan, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will spend at least several hours here as the centerpiece of his visit to the San Francisco Bay Area after his summit meeting with President Bush. 
Officials of the Hoover Institution and the university, who are often at ideological odds, have joined forces to submit a proposed itinerary to the Soviet Embassy in Washington. That itinerary is expected to include a visit to the archives, with its peerless 20th-century Russian collection, a meeting with economists who have already offered advice to officials from Poland and Romania and an introduction to various Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.
 
George Shultz's Role
Officials and fellows at the Hoover Institution see the Gorbachev visit as a way to show the world that they have taken a new role, that this bastion of anti-Soviet thinking has recast itself as a guide and resource for Eastern European nations trying to reshape themselves economically and politically.
The key link in this process is George P. Shultz, who as Secretary of State for President Ronald Reagan was the principal architect of the United State's rapprochement with the Soviet Union. He is now a distinguished fellow at the Hoover Institution and a professor of international economics at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford. ''George Shultz is the linchpin in this whole business,'' said John Raisian, Hoover's new director and a labor economist.
Mr. Shultz was traveling home from South Korea and unavailable for comment. Charles Hill, Mr. Shultz's right-hand man at the State Department and now a fellow at Hoover, said that Shultz had made no formal invitation to Mr. Gorbachev and that he was reluctant to speculate that the Soviet leader wanted to come here solely because of his fond relationship with the former Secretary of State.
''We don't want to attribute motives to the Soviets,'' Mr. Hill said. He cited an array of possible attractions here, including the archives, where both Aleksandr Kerensky, Russia's first democratic leader, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel laureate, studied, and Silicon Valley, where the computer revolution was born.
''The combination of past and future is so dramatic here,'' Mr. Hill added.
 
A Legion of Foreign Visits
Mr. Shultz was a major reason Sergei F. Akhromeyev, Mr. Gorbachev's chief national security adviser, visited the Hoover Institution last summer. Mr. Akhromeyev's two-day stay, after a trip to Washington to meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, included seeing the archives, the university's linear accelerator and genetics research center, and riding a helicopter above the graceful landscape of the Bay area. Mr. Akhromeyev was a guest in the Shultz's home on the campus.
The Hoover Institution has also recently entertained dignitaries from Poland and Romania. The Polish visitor, Jerzy Makarczyk, the deputy foreign minister of foreign affairs, also saw the archives, including the records of the Polish government in exile after the Nazi invasion.
At the end of Mr. Makarczyk's visit, an exchange agreement was signed that called for the Polish government to provide copies of current documents and the Institution to send microfilm of historical material that has been unavailable in Poland. In addition, according to Mr. Raisian, the deputy foreign minister asked for help training young diplomats. Mr. Raisian said he hopes to put together a 12-week seminar in the fall.
Then came a contingent from Romania, including the foreign minister, the minister of finance and an adviser to the prime minister. Mr. Raisian said they brought a 100-page document about the transition to a market economy, which was reviewed and criticized by a panel of Hoover fellows. The economists at Hoover include Milton Friedman, Michael Boskin, Martin Anderson and John Taylor.
 
Smugness Among the Fellows
Mr. Raisian said he hoped the Hoover Institution, founded by Herbert C. Hoover in 1919 as a repository for the records of World War I, can similarly be a resource to Mr. Gorbachev, and a place to ''network'' with economic scholars and high-technology experts. ''The idea is to put him in touch with people he can continue to interact with,'' Mr. Raisian said.
Throughout the halls, offices and courtyards here today, the Institution's fellows seemed to be gloating a bit, as if Mr. Gorbachev's visit vindicated their longstanding ideologies, particularly on economic matters, which many of them predicted would be the focus of the dialogue here in June.
''We've been saying all along that the Marxist system is a bad system,'' said Mr. Hill. ''Now the Soviets themselves agree with us. These people have read our stuff and underlined it very carefully. They know what we say has to be done. It isn't a matter of 'We're smarter than they are.' What is needed is a conversation among economic people.''

HEADLINE: Behind Bush's Turnaround on Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Why, after whistling a happy tune about the economy for 15 months and singing ''no new taxes'' as the anthem of his Administration, did President Bush suddenly change his tune, demand full-scale budget negotiations with Congress and imply that he was prepared to support higher taxes?
The President's turnabout seems to be primarily a result of having overestimated the strength of the economy, either as a political gambit or as an honest miscalculation. The savings and loan mess has worsened the problem, not only in budget terms but also in economic terms.
What the White House is seeking to remedy is the incorrect signal that Mr. Bush and his economic advisers sent early this year when they based the Administration's budget on wildly optimistic economic forecasts. Now they apparently fear that if the mistake is not corrected quickly it could damage the financial markets, send the economy into a tailspin, hurt Republicans' chances in the November elections and perhaps even jeopardize Mr. Bush's own re-election prospects in 1992. 
 
A Shared Assessment
In the budget he submitted in January, the President told the nation and the financial markets that the Federal budget deficit could be reduced enough in the next fiscal year to meet the requirement of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law without unpopular spending cuts or new taxes. That, it is now clear, cannot be done. Mr. Bush and his advisers seem to believe that if they are not perceived as acting to reduce what they now concede is the real budget deficit, interest rates for private borrowers will rise, business costs will go up and investment will be choked off, a set of circumstances that could lead to a recession. That assessment is shared on Wall Street.
Furthermore, massive additional Government borrowing to liquidate failed savings and loan institutions and pay off the depositors could push up interest rates, at least temporarily.
 
Tighter Lending Practices
Even more important, commercial banks seem to be feeling a ripple effect from the savings and loan disaster and have tightened their lending practices. Tougher credit and the impending ''fire sale'' of property repossessed by the failed savings institutions threaten to drive down real estate prices, lowering homeowners' estimates of their own wealth and inducing them to spend and invest less.
The main concern on Wall Street is high interest rates. Economists for the investment banking houses are telling their customers that it does not matter whether the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target is met precisely, but that it is important for the Administration and Congress to take bold steps to lower the deficit. Otherwise, these economists say, the Federal Reserve will have to keep a strong hand on the money supply lest inflation get out of hand, and interest rates will stay high.
Wall Street figures said they found preposterous the President's statement at his news conference Wednesday that he could not spell out publicly the real nature of the problem now because to do so would ''frighten the markets.''
''By saying that,'' said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist in the New York office of Lloyds Bank, ''he's implicitly saying, 'You'd better be scared.' ''
''The markets are pretty astute,'' Mr. Chandross added. ''They realize the true position of the budget is worse than he's been saying.''
 
Unlikely Economic Forecasts
In January, Mr. Bush and his advisers took a gamble by basing the Administration's budget on barely plausible economic forecasts. If they had proved to be correct, only $36 billion would have had to be found in spending cuts or revenue increases to meet the $64 billion deficit target under the budget-balancing law.
But Richard G. Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, is now saying that deficit reduction of twice or three times what the President predicted will be needed to meet the target. If it is not met, automatic spending cuts in most Government programs will be required.
A Congressional study shows that if the target is missed by $50 billion, a reasonable figure if belt-tightening measures are not taken, the result would be, for instance, an $18 billion cut in Pentagon spending, a $550 million cut in aid to Israel, 1,000 fewer air traffic controllers, 600 fewer air safety inspectors and the elimination of 75,000 children from the Head Start preschool program.
That would be politically intolerable, so Mr. Bush and Congress must find a way to meet the budget law's target through spending reductions or tax increases, or change the law. $55 Billion Target Suggested Keynesian analysis suggests that reducing spending or raising taxes would slow economic growth. But the President seems to feel that would be offset by the lower interest rates that would result from less Government borrowing. He suggested at the news conference that the deficit could be reduced by $55 billion without risking a recession.
By Mr. Darman's new calculations, that might not be enough to meet the law's deficit target. But if the deficit could be reduced by $55 billion, an amount that would almost certainly require a tax increase, the financial markets would probably be satisfied that a serious effort was under way in Washington, and the law could be changed to accommodate the new figures.
Many Democrats hold the conspiratorial view that Mr. Darman doctored the forecasts so that Mr. Bush could maintain his no-taxes pledge for the first 18 months of his Presidency. Mr. Darman responds that the Administration's forecasts in 1989 were also more favorable than those of private economists, and that the Administration proved to be closer to the mark. He also said some outside economists were as optimistic early this year as he was.
The budget director has given three main reasons why the Administration got into this box.
First, he says, Government tax receipts are not as high as the Administration expected. Second, interest rates are higher than anticipated, and the Government thus must pay more on its bonds. Finally, the savings and loan bailout is costing more than expected.
The first two are the result of the overly optimistic forecasts.
Receipts are less largely because the Administration vastly overestimated corporate profits and thus corporate tax payments. The Administration predicted that corporate profits would rise by 18.8 percent in 1990 and 16.9 percent in 1991. The consensus of 50 leading private economists in January, when Mr. Bush submitted his budget, was that profits would fall by 1.9 percent this year and rise by 4.7 percent next year. The private forecasters have proved so far to be more accurate.
Similarly, the Administration predicted that the average rate on three-month Treasury Bills would be 6.7 percent this year and 5.4 percent next year. The private economists put the figures at 7.1 percent and 7.2 percent. So far this year, the rate has run between 7.5 percent and 8 percent.
 
'Read My Book,' Official Says
No one in Congress should be surprised by the revised budget figures. They jibe with what the Congressional Budget Office forecast.
''I am tempted to say, 'Read my book,' '' said Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the budget office, who is Congress's chief economist. Mr. Reischauer was referring to the book his office published in March analyzing the President's budget.
The budgetary cost of the savings and loan bailout is another matter. Mr. Darman put no money in the budget in January to liquidate failed savings institutions because he said it was impossible to determine how much would have to be spent in the next fiscal year to pay off depositors, and how much would be returned to the Government when the assets of those institutions are sold.
Mr. Darman is now saying the difference could be as high as $50 billion, although it is not clear how he arrived at that figure. In any event this matter is probably moot, since both Congress and the White House are prepared to remove this part of the bailout program from the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings calculations.
Mr. Bush said Wednesday that reaching an accommodation on the budget would be the biggest test of his leadership on domestic policy. It is also likely to be the first time he had to go before the public with bad news. That might lower his 70 percent popularity rating. But if he can pull off a solution without a recession, he will have succeeded not only in economic terms, but also in political terms.

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 17

 BODY:
Once considered a long shot, Atlanta will submit itself to close scrutiny this week as a possible host city for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games.
A team of Olympic officials arrived in Atlanta today to begin inspections of the city and its sports facilities amid growing speculation that Athens, the sentimental favorite to stage the 1996 Summer Games, may have difficulty winning the bid.
For the next month, Olympic officials will be in Atlanta to study the city's hotels, sports facilities, airport, crime statistics, weather, hospitals, drinking water, symphony orchestra - even its hairdressers and laundries.
Political and economic instability in Greece coupled with recent blunt statements by members of the International Olympic Committee have given rival cities hope that they can overcome the sentimental desire of Olympic officials to return to the birthplace of the Olympic movement. 
 
Binder Full of Detail
''Sentiment isn't going to be the only factor in this vote,'' said William Porter Payne, a former defensive end for the University of Georgia who heads Atlanta's Olympic effort.
''If they were only going to vote with their hearts, they wouldn't be asking for all of this information,'' Payne said, holding aloft a three-inch thick binder filled with detailed analyses of Atlanta and its facilities.
The three Olympic technical committees studying Atlanta this month will report to the full I.O.C. in September at a meeting in Tokyo at which the 1996 host city will be chosen from among six candidates.
Conventional wisdom places Atlanta among the leading contenders, along with Toronto and Melbourne, Australia. The two dark horse candidates are Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and Manchester, England.
During an informal visit to Atlanta last month, three members of the I.O.C. expressed doubts about the ability of the Greek Government to make physical improvements considered necessary for the 1996 Games.
The French I.O.C. member, Maurice Herzog, said he had visited Greek political leaders and Olympic officials to warn them that their antiquated airport, congested streets and air pollution put the Athens bid in jeopardy.
 
Very Strong Pollution
''It's a fact, and I told them I think it's very serious,'' Herzog told reporters here. ''It's not possible with the transportation as it is to insure a good organization for the Games. The lack of a good airport, for example. The lack of an underground, because the traffic in Athens is completely blocked. The pollution is very strong.''
Last month, one of Greece's three major political parties was able to claim a one-seat majority in the 300-member Parliament for first time since voters ousted the two-term Prime Minister, Andreas Papandreou, in June.
''Athens is the sentimental candidate for everyone,'' said Fernando Ferreira Lima Bello, an I.O.C. member from Portugal. ''But the problem is the economic situation. If they don't quickly get a stable government moving things ahead, improving their economic situation, it's a serious problem.''
Robert Helmick, president of the United States Olympic Committee and a member of the I.O.C., said this week that his informal conversations with I.O.C. members convince him that there no longer is any front-runner.
''I tell you quite candidly that it is a serious mistake to assume any corporate mentality on the part of the I.O.C. members,'' Helmick said. ''It's simply not correct to assume that the I.O.C., as a group, wants to go to Athens. There are 90 individuals who will vote. The factors involved are very complex. To read any negotiated consensus would be incorrect.''
Sentiment aside, the I.O.C. members are asking an array of questions about potential host cities. The I.O.C. and its various sports federations have sent the potential host cities 43 pages of questions.
 
Covering All Matters
They cover everything from the height of ceilings above the proposed badminton courts to the status of diplomatic relations between the host country and all other Olympic countries.
While there are numerous questions about the proposed Olympic village and sports venues, there are even more questions covering such issues as the gross national product and inflation rate of the host country, the local school system, the laws in place to protect the Olympics and local racial, ethnic and religious problems.
Although I.O.C. members have said they are suitably impressed with Atlanta's enthusiasm and technical prowess, they also have said the I.O.C. will have difficulty voting to hold the Olympics in either the United States or Canada since each country has staged both winter and summer games within the last 14 years.
 
Matter of Safety
Atlanta must also convince the I.O.C. that the city will be safe for the Olympics. Statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation last month showed Atlanta has the highest rate of serious crime of any American city.
''The fact is, Atlanta is extraordinarily safe for visitors and conventioneers,'' Payne said. ''Our crime, regrettably, is domestic; it's drug related. That said, however, we've got to be able to demonstrate that we are taking steps to deal with the problem.''

A Rage To Kill

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
''One of the most striking differences between the United States and other industrial countries is America's enthusiasm for execution.'' The Economist of London thus summed up a phenomenon that puzzles many foreign friends of the United States.
The death penalty has been effectively abandoned in all the countries of Western Europe and most in Latin America. South Africa used to execute more prisoners than any other country; but on Feb. 2 President de Klerk, in announcing steps toward negotiation, suspended all executions. 
The United States is now the execution capital of the Western world. There are about 2,200 prisoners on death row. And executions are taking place at a quickening pace as legal constraints are removed.
It used to be assumed that a juvenile who committed a capital crime would not be put to death. But the Supreme Court has now held that there is no constitutional barrier to such executions, and they have begun.
Mental retardation is not a reason for withholding the death penalty either. We learn that from the case of Dalton Prejean, who is scheduled to be electrocuted in Louisiana a few hours after this column is written.
Dalton Prejean killed a policeman in 1977. His guilt was not in issue. His responsibility was. To put it another way, the question was whether a civilized society would take the life of a criminal whose nature had been shaped as Mr. Prejean's had.
He was 17 when he shot the policeman. Doctors found that he had suffered brain damage at birth or in childhood. The aunt who brought him up beat him with belts and sticks. He had an I.Q. of 76.
An all-white jury imposed the death sentence on Mr. Prejean, a black man. Studies have shown that prosecutors are far more likely to seek the death penalty, and juries to impose it, when blacks kill whites. The Supreme Court has held that fact, too, to be constitutionally irrelevant.
This week Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist again urged a swifter legal process for executions. He sought passage of a bill before Congress that would allow prisoners on death row to bring only one constitutional challenge in a habeas corpus petition in the Federal courts.
At present prisoners may bring successive petitions. It may take eight years or more between the time a person is convicted in a state court and the moment when Federal courts end their consideration and remove the last obstacle to execution.
The Chief Justice said a system that allows such delays ''verges on the chaotic.'' Certainly it imposes cruelty and frustration on the parties. But speeding the process up by limiting constitutional challenges would not deal with the real legal problem underlying that process.
The problem is inadequate legal representation at the start. Inadequate is indeed too weak a word. Most of the people who are on death row in this country got there simply because they had no effective lawyer's help at their trial or original appeal.
Stephen B. Bright, a lawyer for the Southern Prisoners Defense Committee in Atlanta, was teaching in Washington, D.C., 10 years ago when he was asked to help prepare a petition to the Supreme Court in a death case. He expected to find a massive trial record reflecting a careful defense. He found almost nothing. ''The students in our clinical program tried shoplifting cases better than this capital case had been tried,'' Mr. Bright told a House Judiciary subcommittee last week. The defendant had a court-appointed lawyer, but he presented no evidence.
Many lawyers have had Mr. Bright's experience, coming in to represent someone already on death row and finding that crucial evidence was never presented. Dalton Prejean's jury was never told about his mental problems or history of abuse.
For those reasons, the idea that only especially evil criminals are selected for execution is a joke. The ones who lose are poor, mentally impaired, black - and had lawyers who did not take the case seriously. The results are so unfair that half of all state death sentences have been set aside in recent years during the long process of Federal habeas corpus.
But the American public wants executions, even though there is no evidence that capital punishment deters crime. And politicians respond. The Louisiana parole board recommended that Gov. Buddy Roemer commute Dalton Prejean's sentence, but he refused. Candidates everywhere are vying to say who can push the execution switch faster.
Why? Somewhere in our history and our violent society must lie the reasons for the rage to kill.

Tide Rises on Suits for Bilingual Work Bonuses

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
As government agencies and private companies have struggled to serve more and more people who do not speak English, they have leaned hard on their bilingual employees for help. Now the employees are leaning back.
In a swelling tide of lawsuits, job grievances and contract demands, employees who say their foreign-language abilities bring them extra work are demanding extra pay.
From California beach towns to New York City, Spanish-speaking police officers, teachers and hospital workers are pressing for bonus money, salary differentials and promotion points.
Employees fighting the police department of Tucson, Ariz., for bilingual bonuses are heading for a trial in Federal District Court. Hispanic patrolmen just beginning a similar case in Miami have threatened to selectively forget their Spanish on the job. 
A court ruling in favor of Hispanic agents who charged the Federal Bureau of Investigation with shunting them to undesirable Spanish-speaking jobs has unleashed a stream of similar complaints against other Federal law-enforcement agencies.
 
Widely Watch Suit in West
And from California's Central Valley has come a Federal court suit that could have wide implications for the private sector. Backed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and her union, Paula Soriano, a 58-year-old telephone service representative, has charged that because she is the daughter of Mexican parents - and fluent in Spanish - her job duties have been made overwhelming. Her Anglo co-workers, she says, have faced no such demands, and in fact have made money for the work she performed with them.
''All of this, I think, is going to be the new frontier of equal protection and anti-discrimination legislation and litigation,'' said Laurence H. Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School. ''It's a little surprising that there wasn't more ferment along these lines before.''
The rising demands are partly the product of earlier battles against discrimination - of the job opportunities they helped to create, the pride they bolstered and the growing economic power they brought to ethnic minorities.
Yet perhaps even more sharply than the lingering debate over bilingual education, the workplace dispute has brought into focus a basic issue of America's changing ethnic makeup: To what extent will the ability to speak languages besides English come to be accepted as a valuable skill even among workers hired to do other jobs? Or will it simply be regarded as a product of cultural circumstance, to be used as circumstances require and meriting no special rewards?
 
New Demands by Consumers
Companies and government agencies have scrambled in recent years to service growing legions of non-English-speaking consumers. Yet for Hispanic as well as other bilingual employees, a chasm remains between the fees commanded by a professional translator and the value assigned a stop-gap interpreter.
Into the gap have plunged thousands of bilingual nurses, dishwashers and secret service personnel who, in a pinch or out of habit, are called on to answer the telephone, write a letter, read a suspect his rights for monolingual colleagues.
''It's a constant source of irritation for the bilingual workers,'' said Ruben Castillo, a Chicago lawyer representing Hispanic agents in a suit against the United States Customs Service. ''Virtually every level of government employee has talked to me about doing some kind of case.''
For a shoe salesperson, the extra time spent helping co-workers might mean fewer commissions. For law-enforcement officials and social workers, the result is often less time for their own cases and nothing to show for their efforts.
Hispanic and Asian rights advocates say the situation often begets a discriminatory pattern in which bilingual employees must work harder to qualify for promotions. If their language skills become indispensable, they are sometimes kept in lower-level jobs dealing directly with the public regardless of their performance, the advocates contend. Extra Pay Rare in U.S. Although not unheard of in schools, police departments and social service agencies, especially in the Southwest, extra pay for bilingual work is rare elsewhere in the country and in the private sector generally, employer associations say.
In the Federal Government, the first extensive foreign-language bonus policy is just being set up in the F.B.I. and Drug Enforcement Administration, two years after Congress voted to allow them to pay agents differentials of up to 25 percent of their salaries for bilingual work.
Legal experts say the mere handful of lawsuits now pending in court are less a measure of the problem's scope than test cases in a realm where laws are ill-defined.
''I would have absolutely no trouble filing 10 of these cases tomorrow if I had 10 lawyers to handle them,'' said Jose Roberto Juarez Jr. of Los Angeles, who like Mr. Castillo is a regional counsel for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ''Really what they're going to have to do is await the outcome of these cases.''
 
Impetus for the Lawsuits
The relatively few disputes that have reached the courts have been propelled by demographic and socioeconomic shifts of extraordinary speed.
Paula Soriano began only a decade ago taking orders for new telephones for the Contel Service Corporation near Fresno, Calif. But even then, she never expected that migrant farm workers in the area would become established enough to abandon the roadside shape-ups where they used to find work, rely on telephones and answering machines, and overwhelm her office with Spanish-speaking customers.
Hispanic agents who joined the F.B.I. and D.E.A. in the 1960's and 70's might have guessed that illegal drugs would remain a growth industry. But they could hardly have predicted the cocaine boom that pushed them into the most dangerous undercover assignments and tedious tasks like listening to wire-tapped conversations in Spanish for days on end.
Nor could young Latins who joined the Miami police years ago have foreseen that they would shrink into an even smaller minority - the few officers able to communicate with the great majority of people they were to protect and serve.
What legal precedent does exist on the issue of bilingual work rests largely on the 1988 ruling against the F.B.I. by Federal District Judge Lucius D. Bunton of El Paso, and the remedies he ordered last May.
Judge Bunton found that the bureau had systematically discriminated against its Hispanic employees in promotions and assignments.
Hugo Rodriguez, a Miami lawyer who represented the plaintiffs, said the decision could be interpreted to mean that bilingual employees should receive extra compensation under certain circumstances: if they are required to use their foreign-language skills, were not expressly hired to do so, and end up because of those duties on footing unequal to that of their colleagues.
 
Scope of the Legal Issue
While language was at the heart of broader charges of discrimination by the bureau, Mr. Rodriguez said that on its own, the legal issue surrounding bilingual compensation was not necessarily one of equal protection.
''It's a contracts issue in my mind,'' said Mr. Rodriguez, who also is representing Hispanic officers in suits against three South Florida police departments. ''If you hire me and I understand that I was hired to speak Spanish as a condition of my employment, then you've got me.''
Other lawyers speculated that for all of the complaints, there would be relatively few cases where an employer's demand for work in a foreign language might constitute clear proof of discrimination.
In Mrs. Soriano's case, an employment commission lawyer, Stephen P. Passek, said that Contel had assumed because of her appearance and accent that she could speak Spanish and dispatched her to deal with Spanish-speaking clients. Lawyers for Contel were said to be traveling yesterday and unavailable for comment. In the past they have said that Mrs. Soriano's duties never exceeded those of her English-speaking co-workers.
In one of two cases against the Tucson police, Richard Martinez, a lawyer for the plaintiff, argued that a patrolman was suspended for refusing to speak Spanish even though, like roughly three-fourths of Hispanic people in the United States, he did not know the language.
Both private and public employers have sought to meet new demands for bilingual service with their old employees. But several business executives said they believed the private sector would face fewer complaints because they had been clearer in describing the language duties of their jobs to prospective employees.
Others, like banks and fast-food restaurants, have found that where immigrant communities demand service in a foreign language, they also tend to provide more than enough job applicants willing to do the same job for the same pay in two languages.
 
Another Response on Issue
For each worker who has openly complained about bilingual duties, there appear to be scores more willing, even grateful to use their other languages.
''I enjoy what I do,'' said Rita Rodriguez, 40, the lone Spanish speaker advising new mothers about the mysteries of child care for a toll-free telephone service of the Gerber Products Company in Fremont, Mich. ''My gratuity is to know that I can help them.''
But lawyers and immigrant-rights advocates also say that many disgruntled workers have kept quiet about their foreign language burdens out of fear. And as a few public cases have illuminated the predicament of others, they say, that fear has begun to recede.
''It has always been a problem,'' said Kathryn K. Imahara, a lawyer at the Asian Pacific Legal Center in Los Angeles. ''What's happening now is that people are finally complaining about it.''
Ms. Imahara said that while many Asians share the predicament of Spanish-speaking workers, she knew of none so far who had taken legal action against their employers. She added, ''They all say, 'I don't want to lose my job, I need this job.' ''
Some Hispanic people have argued against demanding higher pay for bilingual work because they fear it could produce a backlash of resentment.
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, which has the largest number of non-English-speaking students of any in the country, English-only advocates fought bitterly to overturn annual bonuses of $5,000 for bilingual teachers. The bonuses passed in March by a 2-to-1 union vote.
Walter Alicea, a New York police detective who is president of the Hispanic Society, a police group, acknowledged similar sensitivities in saying that Hispanic officers had set aside their demands for bilingual pay after a meeting 10 days ago with Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown.
But like others, he said a number of steps could be taken to reward bilingual abilities, like awarding points in hiring and on promotional examinations. .
After years of assignments on what Hispanic agents disparagingly called ''the taco circuit,'' the chief plaintiff in the discrimination suit against the F.B.I., Bernardo M. Perez, now runs programs established by bureau to reward foreign language skills. But he insisted that neither the turn of his personal fortunes nor the advent of higher pay for bilingual work had brought the change he has sought.
''There is an ignorance in this country of what it means to speak another language,'' Mr. Perez said. ''The change will come in seeing bilingual skills as a benefit and not a detriment.''

A Plan for Land Vs. 8 Generations Of a Family Farm

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: RAMAPO, N.Y.

 BODY:
Since before the American Revolution, Concklins have farmed here. ''Eight generations,'' Richard Concklin said. ''We hope many more.'' The ninth is in the pipeline: Scott, a junior at Cornell agricultural school.
They run a you-pick-it apple orchard and farm store, one of the last in a suburbanized area. Each year thousands of schoolchildren make trips to Concklin's and learn that apples do not come from a greengrocer's back room. The Concklins are the sort who save trees near the road for handicapped children. 
Even the environmentalists whose lawsuit may finish the farm know better than to attack the Concklins personally. Still, June 1 foreclosure is to begin.
A hailstorm killed 90 percent of the crop, a fire damaged buildings and by 1986 the Concklins were $1.6 million in debt. To keep the farm they had a plan: sell 37 of their 100 acres, retire the debt and modernize. They found a builder who wanted to buy 23 acres and put 10 $750,000 homes on two-acre lots. The area is zoned for two-acre lots. In November 1988, after two years of review, the town approved.
A local environmental group, West Branch Conservation, did not. It prefers clustering the 10 homes on eight acres and leaving the extra 12 acres wild.
The Concklins say they cannot afford to cluster, that the developer will pay them half as much if they do. ''We're trying to maximize our profit to retain the most farmland,'' Richard Concklin said. The town Supervisor, Herbert Reisman, says two-acre wooded lots provide plenty of open space.
In late 1988 West Branch sued, charging that the Concklins had failed to file a mandated environmental impact study. And there it has sat for 17 months with no court decision yet, the Concklins prevented from selling the land and two weeks to foreclosure.
It's a terrible game of chicken. The Concklins seem to be winning far more hearts, but it may not matter. The Rockland County Legislature passed a motion 18 to 2 asking West Branch to withdraw its suit. West Branch has in the past enjoyed considerable popularity for preserving 600 acres. This time, many members have deserted to the Concklins, saying the difference between a clustered plan and two-acre lots is not worth destroying a rarer species, a family farm. ''Environmentalism gone bananas,'' said a West Branch deserter, Arthur Wang. A civil rights lawyer, Conrad Lynn, has volunteered time to the Concklins. ''They are conservative; I represent the left, but I see a human issue. Are you telling me two-acre lots menace the environment?''
Since the suit was filed the Concklins' debt has grown by $225,000 in added interest. Another West Branch deserter, John Holmes, says the Concklins' problem is that they were not cynical enough. He says most developers would conduct a token impact statement justifying two-acre zoning. ''The real-estate market gets softer by the day,'' Mr. Holmes said. ''West Branch figures the longer the suit goes the more concessions it gets. If the farm's foreclosed, it will go to a developer to cut up any way he pleases.''
A lot of the anger has focused on Martus Granirer, West Branch's president, who has stood firm. He acknowledges that the law mandating impact statements is weak and developers often get away with tokenism. ''If they had filed one,'' he said, ''we'd be boxed in now. But they didn't.''
''We're really looking for a better plan,'' he said. He believes the Concklins intend to keep farming but asks what happens in a few years if they face problems and decide to sell out. He says there should be a clustering plan for all 100 acres. He says he doesn't want them to lose the farm - ''We care about this farm'' - but if there is a foreclosure people shouldn't think a big developer would mean environmental disaster. ''Because of what we've done here, I think a developer would deal with us.''
Mr. Granirer says the Concklins should have pressed the county for a grant to preserve the farm. County leaders say they face budget cuts. Mr. Granirer wanted the American Farmland Trust to donate money to perserve the farm. Robert Wagner of the trust says that funds are limited and that he believes the Concklins' plan is good. He found West Branch ''unsympathetic and unrealistic.''
The Concklins pursued these tacks at Mr. Granirer's urging, though it galled them. ''We don't want special consideration,'' Mr. Concklin said. ''We're not that type of person. We're realists. To ask for money for something we can achieve by doing a responsible development does not make economic sense.'' His sister, Linda, says: ''We've farmed the same land 250 years. It's not worn out; it's not abused. We've kept it sweet. We think we understand our land.''
Two weeks to foreclosure.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 22, 1990, Friday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
The Our Towns column on May 18, about efforts to save a farm in Ramapo, N.Y., misstated the role of a local group, the West Branch Conservation Association, in seeking the aid of the American Farmland Trust. The head of West Branch, Martus Granirer, proposed that the trust help the farm's owners obtain Federal relief under the 1985 farm bill; he did not ask it to donate money. (Mr. Granirer reported the error soon after publication, but some authorities involved were not available promptly to resolve conflicting accounts of the preservation effort.)

HEADLINE: Paulette Goddard Left N.Y.U. $20 Million

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
The actress Paulette Goddard has left more than $20 million to New York University to establish scholarships, endowed professorships and a development fund for junior faculty members, the school's president announced yesterday.
The president, Dr. John Brademas, said the gift from Miss Goddard, who died last month, was the largest bequest and the third largest gift in the history of the university and culminates more than a decade of donations from her.
''There is a harmony between this bequest and what we are now doing and hope to do academically at N.Y.U.'' Dr. Brademas said. ''It will enable us to build on the major commitments of N.Y.U.: performing arts, public service and European studies.'' 
Dr. Brademas announced the bequest during the university's 158th commencement exercises in Washington Square Park, where more than 7,000 students, clad in purple gowns, and as many parents and friends defied grim overcast skies, filling the park and overflowing into the streets and nearby buildings, where television monitors had been set up.
The university awarded five honorary degrees, the first of which was presented to Johnnetta B. Cole, president of Spelman College in Atlanta. Later, responding on behalf of the others, all of whom were men, she said, ''Let us mark the day a woman is speaking for all of the men,'' prompting a round of applause. Then she challenged the students receiving undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees to ''think, feel and act in terms of our interdependence.'' She welcomed the freedom in Eastern Europe as an example of how human needs and dreams are intimately tied together. ''In the spirit of an African saying,'' she said, '' 'I am because we are. We are because I am.' ''
Besides Dr. Cole, honorary degrees were conferred upon Placido Domingo, the operatic tenor, for ''a searching intellect and reservoirs of energy that have taken you where few other singers have dared to go;'' Thomas H. Kean, former governor of New Jersey and president of Drew University in Madison, N.J., for demonstrating ''the precepts of good government based on broad support cutting across ethnic and racial lines;'' Roald Zinnurovich Sagdeyev, a physicist, for dedication ''to the pursuit of scientific knowledge to expand human horizons to the edge of the universe,'' and Elie Wiesel, the nobel laureate and author, as an ''impassioned advocate for persecuted people throughout the world.''
The students cheered the announcement of Ms. Goddard's gift. Dr. Brademas said that an initial pledge of $13.4 million was made by Ms. Goddard in 1984, but that it was to remain anonymous until after her death. Ms. Goddard, famous for performances in classics like Charlie Chaplin's ''Modern Times'' and ''The Great Dictator'' and Jean Renoir's ''The Diary of a Chambermaid,'' died April 23. She left her entire estate to the university, Dr. Brademas said, which included $7 million more than her initial pledge, bringing the gift to more than $20 million.
Although not an alumna of N.Y.U., Dr. Brademas said that the actress was a longtime friend of the university and that her interests in theater, film, dance, art and literature motivated her contributions. In 1977, Ms. Goddard created a $3 million scholarship fund for students at the Tisch School of the Arts, which has provided more than 300 students with scholarships in the past 12 years. In 1984, Ms. Goddard presented N.Y.U. with the collected writings of her husband, Erich Maria Remarque, author of ''All Quiet on the Western Front.''
''She wanted her money to be used for people, as distinguished from buildings,'' Dr. Brademas said. Her gift will establish seven endowed chairs: a film chair in the Tisch School, an urban planning chair and chairs in creative writing, literature, European studies, languages and political economics. The bequest also creates a $3 million junior faculty fund, providing stipends for research, publications and travel.
 
Naming a Residence Hall for Her
The largest single gift to N.Y.U., for $31.2 million, was made in 1988 by Leonard Stern, a 1957 and 1959 graduate. It is being used to relocate and expand the business school.
The largest gift to a single institution is believed to be $105 million to Emory University in Atlanta from Robert W. Woodruff, the former chairman of the Coca-Cola Company. Less than two weeks ago, Yale University received $20 million from the Bass family of Fort Worth to establish an institute of biospheric studies.
Other recent large gifts include $25 million pledged to Columbia University in 1987 by John W. Kluge, the founder of the Metromedia Company, and $20 million to Spelman College in 1988 by the comedian Bill Cosby.
Dr. Brademas said the university would name one of its Washington Square residence halls in Ms. Goddard's honor. ''She was a woman who, at the age of most of you, was much like many of you: young, brainy, adventurous, full of spunk,'' Dr. Brademas said. ''She was determined to take on the world and she did.''

HEADLINE: Spending Cap Seen as Last Hurdle to Adopting a Budget in Albany

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 17

 BODY:
With virtually all of their differences over this year's spending resolved, lawmakers today continued to wrangle over the state budget because of Republican demands for a spending cap that would not take effect until next year.
''The spending cap is really the last issue,'' said a spokesman for the State Senate's Republican majority, John McArdle.
The issue of a spending cap is perennial in Albany, where the urge to overspend is almost irrepressible. The issue is viewed as largely symbolic. Even lawmakers acknowledge that the cap has not yet been invented that the New York State Legislature could not slip past. 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has long advocated a spending cap, but his proposal differs substantially from that of the Republican-controlled State Senate. The Governor said today that he did not believe the spending cap should hold up the budget, which is now almost seven weeks overdue.
 
'Hold the Whole Budget Hostage'
''What they're saying is we're going to hold the whole budget hostage until you give us what we want,'' he said.
Under the cap proposed by the Senate, the growth in state spending each year would be limited to the average growth in personal income over the previous three years, or to the prior year's inflation rate, whichever was lower. The cap could be lifted if the Legislature declared a ''financial emergency,'' defined as an ''extraordinary occurrence.''
Republican senators say a spending cap is the only way to cure the state of its habitual spending problems. But members of the Democratic-led Assembly say a cap would worsen the state's problems in hard times and make little difference in good times.
Democrats accused Senate Republicans today of trying to use the spending cap to bolster their image as fiscal conservatives. That image has been badly tarnished during the last several months, as the Senate agreed to almost $1.4 billion in new taxes.
 
'Deliberate Process of Stall'
''They want a spending cap so they can say they reduced spending while they're raising it,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
Some Democratic lawmakers suggested today that the reason the Senate was holding out for a spending cap was that the majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., has not been able to muster enough votes to pass some of the more unpopular budget bills, like the $1.4 billion tax package agreed to earlier this week.
''I think there has been almost a deliberate process of stall here,'' the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, said at a news conference. ''Is it the game of hostage or is it the game of there's no votes to pass the tax package?''
Mr. McArdle denied that the Senate lacked the votes to pass the tax package. ''They say that every year,'' he said. ''We'll have the votes.''
After an all-night debate, the Assembly approved the tax measure early this morning. No vote has been scheduled in the Senate. Many Republican senators have said they are unhappy with the package, which raises taxes on goods ranging from liquor to rental cars, but not one has said publicly that he would not vote for it.

HEADLINE: Teacher Who Broke Boycott Seeks a Transfer

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The Brooklyn teacher who led his high school class into a Korean-owned grocery store to protest a boycott there requested a transfer from his school yesterday, saying his life and the lives of his family have been threatened.
James S. Vlasto, press secretary for the Board of Education, said that Fred McCray, a 40-year-old economics teacher, notified officials yesterday ''that he is endangered if he remains at Erasmus Hall High School and he has asked to be reassigned.''
Mr. McCray was not in school yesterday and was described by officials of his union, the United Federation of Teachers, as incommunicado. 
On Monday, Mr. McCray and 30 of his students walked four blocks from Erasmus on Flatbush Avenue to the Family Red Apple market, which has been the scene of a four-month boycott, and bought some food. The students and Mr. McCray, who is black, were harangued by the protesters, who are also black. The boycott began after a dispute between a Haitian customer and a store employee.
 
Meeting With Parents
Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the teachers union, said Mr. McCray attended a meeting of the executive board of the high school parents association Wednesday night, then told union officials afterward that he had been asked by parents to resign.
''He says that the parents who are demanding his resignation are tools of Sonny Carson,'' said Ms. Amlung, referring to the community organizer who was instrumental in starting the boycott. ''There are plenty of parents who support him but they have told him they dare not speak up.'' Mr. Carson held a rally at Erasmus the same night, Ms. Amlung said.
Another union official said the school's principal, Stanley Saretsky, disputed Mr. McCray's account of the meeting with parents. But Mr. Saretsky has reported receiving 20 telephone calls assailing Mr. McCray's actions, some including death threats, Ms. Amlung said. Mr. Saretsky could not be reached yesterday.
 
Revealing His Past
In an appearance on ''The Joan Rivers Show'' on CBS yesterday, Mr. McCray said some parents had threatened to reveal his past as a drug addict and convict to ''discredit me with the students, with the press.'' Crying at one point, Mr. McCray told Ms. Rivers that after receiving an honorable discharge from the Army, he had become a drug addict and ''committed some crimes.'' He said he had been sentenced to up to life in prison at Elmira state prison, but did not say what he was convicted for or how long he was in prison.
School officials declined to disclose details of Mr. McCray's background. They said he disclosed his criminal record when he joined the school system in 1980, and was permitted to teach after a review. Mr. McCray received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and is pursuing a doctorate at New York University.

HEADLINE: Character Actors Are Taking a Star Turn

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW

 BODY:
IN his book ''On Acting,'' Laurence Olivier expressed his admiration for John Gielgud, with direct reference not to his Shakespearean performances but to his stage roles in plays by Harold Pinter and David Storey. ''Today, for me, John has somehow completed the acting circle,'' he wrote. ''He has found his center, he is a brilliant character actor.''
From Olivier, that must be taken as the highest compliment. In Britain, the art of the character actor is an honored tradition. Actors have often made careers by not playing leading roles, or by playing leading roles as if they are character parts. (Olivier qualifies in that latter category.) In the United States, however, the character actor has sometimes been regarded as a lesser artist, the theatrical equivalent of baseball's relief pitcher. If he had his choice, he would prefer to be a starter - or star. This is in spite of the fact that many of America's most celebrated performers (like Spencer Tracy and James Cagney) have been character actors as well as stars. Because of the work of Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall, among others, that perception has been altered. Now, many people, here as in Britain, are flattered to be considered character actors. 
There have always been outstanding performances by character actors in the New York theater, many of them given by Philip Bosco, who, as a kind of one-man repertory company, has proven that an actor can have a full, gratifying career on the New York stage. Mr. Bosco is not appearing in a play at this moment - a most unusual absence. But this season has been particularly active for character actors, beginning with Mr. Hoffman, who returned to Broadway as Shylock last December, and extending through a number of current productions. This weekend theatergoers may see the following:
* Josef Sommer as Polonius in ''Hamlet.''
* Larry Bryggman in ''Prelude to a Kiss.''
* Nathan Lane in ''Some Americans Abroad.''
* Charles S. Dutton and S. Epatha Merkerson in ''The Piano Lesson.''
* Danitra Vance in ''Spunk.''
* Gary Sinise and Terry Kinney in ''The Grapes of Wrath.''
* Charles Durning in ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
* Stephen Lang in ''A Few Good Men.''
Though the styles of acting and the kinds of roles vary widely, these actors and actresses are united by the fact that they immerse themselves within a character - a kind of artistic self-effacement. This is not to suggest that they lose their individuality, but through an exercise of a chameleonlike talent, they can change markedly from role to role. This is the opposite of a star appearance by a performer who has made an impact (usually on a television series or in the movies) and continues to play a variation of that persona.
The difference between a leading man or leading lady and a character actor can seem arbitrary. Any principal role, beginning with Hamlet, could be approached as a character part, but some performances are more richly charactered than others. An actor can bring distinction to the smallest of roles. Character actors are created partly through choice, partly through opportunity. Sometimes an actor's visage can limit his possibilities in romantic parts; conversely, good looks may make it difficult for audiences to accept him in character roles.
Olivier accomplished his transformations with the help of makeup and accents. He often said that in playing a character, he began by choosing a specific false nose. Alec Guinness is another English master of what could be called the cosmetics of character acting, although in both of their cases the personification has always been penetrating.
In the United States, there are actors like Josef Sommer, who seldom changes his appearance or his accent (even when playing a foreigner), yet manages to incarnate a diversity of human traits - heroic, villainous and everything in between. Although he has had a distinguished career, he is still not known by name to the general public; his relative anonymity is itself a tribute to his versatility.
Mr. Sommer has had leading roles onstage in New York as well as in regional theater. (He was, most memorably, the Soviet diplomat in the original Yale Repertory Theater production of ''A Walk in the Woods.'') Often he is one in an ensemble, as is the case in Kevin Kline's production of ''Hamlet.'' Mr. Sommer approaches the often-ridiculed figure of Polonius as a sincere, though still obsequious, father and counselor -not, as is often the case, as a buffoon who cannot tell a cloud from a whale.
In that sense, he reminds one somewhat of other character actors who have preceded him in the role, people like Hume Cronyn, who was Polonius in Richard Burton's Broadway ''Hamlet,'' and Michael Bryant, who played Polonius in Daniel Day-Lewis's recent ''Hamlet'' at the National Theater in London.
Mr. Kline's production at the Public Theater is very much an actor's ''Hamlet,'' one might say, a character actor's ''Hamlet,'' with Mr. Kline as the leading character actor in residence. As director, he has surrounded himself with performers of his choice and led them to concentrate on diction, clarity and details of character while de-emphasizing matters of directorial concept and design.
Larry Bryggman, an exacting professional in scores of plays on the New York stage, can do more with a cameo than many of his peers can do with a major role. Such is certainly the case in ''Prelude to a Kiss,'' in which he plays the father of the bride with a knowing look of laissez faire -if this is what his daughter wants to do, he will not impose his will. Lane's Triple-Header Nathan Lane, an actor with the most expressive eyebrows on the New York stage, deserves this year's Philip Bosco Award for three fine performances in a single season. Without a break, he moved from his bravura performance in ''The Lisbon Traviata'' to two nutty roles (as doctor and patient) in the revival of ''Bad Habits'' to ''Some Americans Abroad,'' in which he plays a teacher about to be relieved of his position at a New England college.
Usually cast in flamboyant roles, Mr. Lane can be an actor of great subtlety, as he demonstrates in ''Some Americans Abroad,'' where his overeagerness to please his employers moves the audience to empathy. From his first Broadway performance, in George C. Scott's production of ''Present Laughter,'' he has been a devastatingly funny actor. Increasingly he has been revealing the breadth of his talent. Were there a lively classical theater in this country, he might next move on to Shakespearean clowns and Restoration comedy. Egos and Ensembles Charles S. Dutton is a dynamic force who can, as Boy Willie in August Wilson's ''Piano Lesson,'' overwhelm others when he is onstage. But that heightened quality of acting is demanded by the role, which is meant to energize the conflict between Boy Willie and his sister, Berniece. In contrast, in Mr. Wilson's ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,'' he was indelibly part of an ensemble.
In performance, he can display the most sizable of egos and emotions, which is why he was such a striking Othello several seasons ago at the Yale Repertory Theater. As with Mr. Lane, he could have - if opportunity presented itself - a future in classics.
Berniece, his antagonist in ''The Piano Lesson,'' is played by S. Epatha Merkerson, who lends a quiet resilience to her role as a woman who chooses the perpetuation of a family legacy (the piano of the title) over economic advancement. Until now, Ms. Merkerson has been a figure in the background, as in ''Moms,'' in which she added luster to her role as a faithful aide to Clarice Taylor's Moms Mabley. ''The Piano Lesson'' offers signs of her ability to dominate a stage.
In contrast to Ms. Merkerson's reserve, there is Danitra Vance's ebullience, as demonstrated in her performance as three different Zora Neale Hurston women in George Wolfe's ''Spunk'' and, several seasons ago, in Mr. Wolfe's ''Colored Museum.'' Appearing on stage, she has a cheerful effect on theatergoers; then her acting validates the anticipation.
The Steppenwolf Theater Company has redefined character acting in its own image. This troupe achieved its reputation for visceral performances in works by Sam Shepard, Lanford Wilson and others. But there is another, understated dimension to Steppenwolf acting, as is demonstrated in ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and, in particular, by the performances of Gary Sinise and Terry Kinney. Their roles as Tom Joad and Jim Casy, the preacher, are, of course, pivotal, but in the hands of these astute actors, they are integrated into the symphonic whole. Durning's Domain Before becoming known for his film roles, Charles Durning had a long, rewarding career in the New York theater, much of it spent at the New York Shakespeare Festival. Admiration increases when one considers the range of his roles - from the inept mayor in ''That Championship Season'' to his authoritative Big Daddy in the current production of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
Big Daddy is certainly the most colorful character in ''Cat,'' although he is onstage for only one act. With his usual circumspection, Mr. Durning avoids overplaying his hand, becoming a powerful presence through a kind of actor's right of eminent domain.
Mr. Durning and Mr. Dutton, among others, have been deservedly nominated for Tony Awards. (The winners will be announced on June 3.) The one major oversight in the acting categories was the omission of Stephen Lang. As the autocratic Marine colonel in ''A Few Good Men,'' he is a loose cannon about to implode. In the play, the actor offers an object lesson in stage menace, intimating violence without activating it. This colonel is a 180-degree turn from his last Broadway appearance as Happy, the cheerfully sybaritic younger brother in ''Death of a Salesman,'' starring Dustin Hoffman.
For many actors, Mr. Lang included, Mr. Hoffman could be a role model. He began his career on stage playing the most diverse range of unusual characters, conquered Hollywood as a character juvenile and went on to play everything from the ancient ''Little Big Man'' to a woman, herself a character actress. At the outset of his career, he expressed his desire to be the world's first character lover. He has achieved that goal - and a great deal more, proving that, talent permitting, there are no limits to the roles of a character actor.

Still in New Orleans And Singing the Blues

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''Further Mo,' '' Vernel Bagneris's rollicking sequel to his successful 1979 blues and jazz revue, ''One Mo' Time,'' returns to the original show's seedy stomping grounds, the Lyric Theater of New Orleans, to catch up with its four vaudevillian troupers. It is a year later (1927), and bawdy blues songs are still the specialty of the house.
Like its forerunner, the sequel offers lusty performances of vintage blues, jazz and popular tunes arranged in a modified Dixieland style for a small jazz ensemble. While the program's high points are its hilariously salacious numbers like ''One-Hour Mama'' and ''Positively No (Construction Gang),'' its two dozen songs offer a fairly wide cross section of styles from torch (''My Man'') to jazz (''Alabamy Bound''). 
Two cast members of ''One Mo' Time'' - Mr. Bagneris and Topsy Chapman - again portray their characters (Papa Du and Thelma) from the original show. The sequel opened last night, downstairs at the Village Gate, where the original show had also opened. As the loose-limbed vaudeville singer and dancer who juggles relationships with two women, Mr. Bagneris has only a passable singing voice, but he dances superbly and projects a cool devil-may-care charisma. Using a minimum of fancy footwork, he slinks around the stage with a grace so airy in its confidence that at moments he almost seems to be floating.
Ms. Chapman is a versatile pop-blues stylist whose singing suggests a bluesier Nancy Wilson. Frozine Thomas, who plays Ma Reed, the least flamboyant of the four, has a smooth gutbucket blues delivery that contrasts with the more raucous style of the show's most vivid character, Big Bertha.
The role of the huffy blues diva, which was originally played by Sylvia (Kuumba) Williams, has been taken over in the sequel by Sandra Reaves-Phillips, who with her earthy roar seems ideally cast. In ''Further Mo,' '' the character, who has just returned from a European tour, flounces about the stage fantasizing about imminent stardom in the movies.
In ''One Mo' Time,'' Mr. Bagneris, who conceived, wrote and directed both shows, took a standard nostalgia-revue format and gave it a mild political twist by following its four black vaudevillians backstage. Without seriously dampening the high spirits, he was able to suggest how even in a town as relaxed as New Orleans in the 1920's, blacks were exploited and restricted. And this double vision of euphoric hijinks on the stage and the exploitation and bickering behind the scenes gave the music a historical dimension.
The sequel also insinuates racial politics into the raunchy fun. Early in the evening the Lyric's white owner, played by James (Red) Wilcher, confides to Papa Du that after that evening's performance, the theater, which has not been profitable, will be burned to the ground for the insurance money. The performers will be out of work, and the closest city with a comparable vaudeville house is Mobile, Ala. Though warned in advance of the fire so they can remove their costumes and other belongings, the performers are afraid to leave the theater loaded with baggage lest they be arrested for theft.
Because ''Further Mo' '' crams its story into the nooks and crannies between numbers, its little backstage dramas remain undeveloped, and much remains unclear. In the most enigmatic scene, the theater owner disguises himself in drag to go on an unexplained mission in behalf of his soon-to-be-unemployed troupe.
Although the drama fizzles, the music sails. The singers' voices are well matched, and the five-member New Orleans Blue Serenaders play with verve and fluency. Pepsi Bethel's undemanding choreography gives the show an easygoing lilt without taxing the performers. For those who insist on high-style virtuosity, the show to see for this sort of thing is ''Black and Blue'' on Broadway. ''Further Mo,' '' though not as ambitious as its uptown cousin, still offers plenty of hot music, steamy atmosphere and lowdown fun.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Drop After Fed Signal

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities sagged yesterday after the Federal Reserve Board sent a strong signal that it has not eased monetary policy.
Speculation that the central bank's Open Market Committee might have voted to ease its grip on credit at Tuesday's meeting was raised late Wednesday, when the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market dipped slightly.
The funds rate, the rate most closely controlled by the Fed, was trading at 8 1/8 percent late Wednesday, and remained at that level during morning trading yesterday.
 
Fed Drains Reserves
 The softness in the funds rate prompted dealers to buy securities early in the session. But just before noon the Fed quashed any notion that it had eased policy when it entered the open market to drain reserves from the banking system. 
The funds rate, which had been trading at 8 1/8 percent at the time of the Fed's move, quickly returned to the 8 1/4 percent level it has occupied since mid-December.
The speculative buying took most analysts and traders by surprise, since Wall Street appears firmly convinced that current economic conditions make it highly unlikely the Fed will change policy for some time yet.
''The fact that the Fed came into the market was not as interesting an event as the fact that there were some people who actually thought the Fed had eased,'' one government bond trader said. ''At the earliest, the Fed won't move until it gets a look at the May employment data at the beginning of June.''
Any lingering doubt about the intent of the Fed's action was erased after remarks by Edward G. Boehme, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, flashed across dealers' screens.
In a speech yesterday, Mr. Boehme said that the Fed has not changed policy since December.
''If you couldn't read between the lines earlier, Mr. Boehme's remarks put it in black and white for the market,'' said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. ''We have had a long period when the funds rate has been very stable, and it looks like that period is going to last for a while longer.''
The speculative activity surrounding the Fed's move was the only real focal point yesterday, dealers said.
 
Jump in Trade Deficit
 A big jump in the merchandise trade deficit, which rose to $8.4 billion in March, had little impact on prices. While the composition of the figures was something of a surprise, most economists had projected a widening in the deficit.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 101 1/8, down 6/32, to yield 8.64 percent. Late Wednesday the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.63 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 101 9/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 8.68 percent. And the 8 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 19/32, down 2/32, to yield 8.53 percent.
''Right now we are in a counter-trading market,'' the bond trader said. ''That means you buy on the dips and sell on the upticks. It will probably be that until we get through the employment number.''
Meanwhile, short-term Treasury bill rates rose modestly.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 7.67 percent, up three basis points, or hundreths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were offered in late trading at 7.68 percent, up five basis points. And one-year bill rates rose by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.64 percent.
 
Continued Flow of New Issues
 New issues continued to flow into the investment-grade corporate bond market.
Among the deals priced yesterday was a $150 million offering of 20-year debentures from Dow Capital B.V.
The 9 percent debentures, which mature May 15, 2010, carry a ''put'' that is exercisable on May 15, 1995. The securities were priced at $99.870, to yield 9.032 percent, 42 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent five year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
Nassau County, L.I., offered $71 million of insured serial bonds at competitive bid in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
The issue, which is insured by Ambac Inc., consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1991 to 2009. Coupons on the bonds range from 6 percent on bonds maturing in 1991 to 7.10 percent on securities that mature in 2009.
A bid from an investment group led by Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. won the issue, which is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Services and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt bonds was light, dealers said. Traders in both markets said that prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended May 7. The narrowest measure, M-1, fell by $200 million.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widened In March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit widened substantially in March, to $8.4 billion, as exports and imports both surged, the Commerce Department reported today.
Although the deficit in international trade - the amount by which purchases from abroad exceed goods sold to foreign customers - rose somewhat more than expected, economists and the financial markets took the news in stride.
The March deficit was not out of line with most other recent months and was lower than the $8.9 billion of March 1989. But this year's March performance followed a sharp narrowing of the deficit in February, when the trade gap was the lowest in more than six years. The February plunge resulted from a steep drop in spending on imports, and few experts expected that to be repeated. 
 
Exports at Record Level
 Imports in March rebounded by 10 percent, to a level just short of the peak reached last October. Exports rose to a record $33.3 billion, or 4.6 percent above the February level. That rise was hailed by some analysts who have been counting on foreign orders to help sustain American economic growth.
''The thing is the exports, which means that we continue to see growth from the external side,'' said Rimmer de Vries, chief economist for the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
Others, however, were a bit more wary, noting that the trade figures were for March, not April, and that more recent statistics appeared to belie a pickup in the industrial sector. Manufactured goods account for some 80 percent of exports.
''I wouldn't regard it as a sign that the economy is recovering,'' said Christopher S. Rupkey, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York.
 
Assessing the Dollar's Drop
 As for imports, analysts tended to agree that their growth would probably start to ease, and for two reasons. The dollar has recently been weakening in value, which reduces American purchasing power, and Japan and some other trading partners are trying to reduce their surpluses with the United States.
Nevertheless, today's report said the American deficit with Japan bounced back to $3.6 billion in March, from $3.1 billion. The deficit with South Korea did shrink significantly and there were slight reductions in the gaps with Taiwan and Singapore.
For the first three months of the year, the cumulative deficit was $23.9 billion, down from $26.4 billion in the comparable 1989 period and $30.9 billion in the 1988 period.
The improvement is not an unmixed blessing. With fewer dollars going abroad to pay for imports, foreign investors are less able to help finance the United States' budget deficit. This increases the demand on the domestic savings pool and adds to upward pressure on interest rates, with higher rates perhaps choking off economic growth. Some analysts said concerns about this possible chain of events helped prompt the Bush Administration to seek the budget talks with Congressional leaders that began this week.
 
Both Sides of Ledger
 The rise in March exports was $1.5 billion, to $33.3 billion, surpassing the previous high of $31.9 billion posted in January. The increase in imports was $3.8 billion, to $41.7 billion, supplanting January's $41.3 billion as the second-highest level after October's $41.9 billion.
The February deficit, which had initially been reported at $6.5 billion, was revised even lower today, to $6.1 billion. The nation's spending on imports, particularly oil, fell sharply that month, while exports were basically unchanged. Oil prices had surged in January because of extreme cold early in the winter.
Motor vehicles, parts and engines had the biggest impact on both sides of the ledger in March, raising imports by $1.5 billion and exports by $600 million. Imports of Japanese cars rebounded to $1.8 billion, from $1.5 billion in February. Exports of aircraft declined after a surge of deliveries related to the end of last fall's strike at the Boeing Company.
Spending for imported oil remained at $4.7 billion in March, as the effect of bringing in an additional 18 million barrels that month was offset by an average price decline of $1.21 for each imported barrel. Oil accounted for 56 percent of the March trade deficit, down from February's extraordinarily high 77 percent. Because imports in general, including oil, fell in February, the huge oil component made up a large part of a shrunken category.
 
Regional Variations
 The overall March deficit with Western Europe edged down to $714 million, from $960 million. The deficit with West Germany widened by $110 million, but a surplus with Britain expanded by $185 million. The deficit with Canada, the nation's biggest trading partner, eased to $90 million from $227 million.
In terms of goods traded, two of the biggest surpluses for the United States in March were $3.6 billion in advanced-technology products and $1.8 billion in farm commodities.
Measured on a three-month moving average, the overall trade deficit was calculated at $8 billion for March, in between the $7.7 billion of February and the $9 billion of January.
In constant 1987 dollars, the deficit for the month was $7.9 billion, compared with $5.5 billion in February.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
German Worries On Unification

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
The stunning defeat of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union by the Social Democratic Party in two key West German states reflected voters' anxieties that unification with East Germany will cost them heavily. Mr. Kohl is now moving to head off a buildup of political pressures that could disrupt unification.
There are also anxieties in the markets and industry that economic and monetary union could unleash inflation and undermine the remarkable stability and prosperity that have made West Germany the strongest economy in Europe.
The official Government line is that such inflationary fears are misplaced because German monetary growth has been low and will continue to be so under the control of the independent Bundesbank. Further, say the reassuring voices in Bonn, East Germany's economy is small, only 10 percent the size of West Germany's, and the tail cannot wag the dog. Indeed, they add, low-paid East German workers are likely to put downward pressure on West German wages, and troop reductions in both East and West Germany will hold down wages and economic activity. 
But anxieties persist in West Germany that the party line pressing for early unification is rose-colored - and election-colored. Many in the West believe the currency conversion deal offered to East Germany by the Kohl Government is too generous, with the feeble East marks to be converted at a 1-to-1 rate for the strong West marks for wages and at a 2-to-1 rate for cash and savings up to 6,000 marks.
Dr. Wilfrid Guth, chairman of the supervisory board of the Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, said in a speech in New York on May 8 that the 1-to-1 conversion rate for wages ''puts great responsibility on those who will negotiate new contracts since this rate leaves no room for wage increases to compensate for the upward adjustment of the heavily subsidized prices of food and other essentials.''
Dr. Guth said it was important to note that monetary control and monetary stability in the enlarged D-mark area would be ''the exclusive responsibility of the Bundesbank, which has endorsed the agreement between the two Governments.''
After earlier resistance because of his own concerns about inflation, the president of the Bundesbank, Karl Otto Pohl, accepted the Government's conversion deal. But he has privately continued to express his concerns about inflation stemming from the East.
The Bundesbank is not yet in control of the money supply in East Germany, and the German Democratic Republic's central bank is printing an extra 5 billion East marks a month, according to West German officials. At the official rates of exchange, that means a continuing rapid growth of the unified German money supply. That is another reason why the West Germans would like to bring about economic and monetary union as soon as possible.
In his speech to the American Council on Germany in New York, Dr. Guth said that currency conversion by itself was not the decisive issue but should be seen in a much wider context. ''Of much greater significance,'' he said, ''will be that a new entrepreneurial spirit and dynamism emerges and everything will be done to make the G.D.R. an attractive location for investment. We are already seeing many approaches by West German companies, and there are plenty of concrete plans.''
The crucial contribution toward revitalizing the East German economy, he said, would come from ''our business sector and from companies of other Western nations.'' East Germany, he added, ''is not a privileged territory for West German firms.''
Nevertheless, the costs to the West German Government of unification, even beyond the currency conversion, will be huge. This week West Germany announced a plan to set up a ''German unity fund'' of $70 billion, to help pay for the reconstruction of East Germany's economy through 1994. Other Eastern European countries are going to worry that a disproportionately large share of private and public West German capital will be flowing into East Germany, to their own disadvantage.
To avoid intensifying unification anxieties, Chancellor Kohl has said that there will be no tax increase and that the new unity fund will be kept off budget. The money is to be borrowed in capital markets, with half to be raised by the federal Government and half by the states. But given the electoral defeats the Christian Democrats encountered in the elections in North-Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony, there could be foot-dragging in those states and possibly others.
Mr. Kohl may also encounter resistance to swift unification from East Germany. Indeed, East Germany's Christian Union Prime Minister, Lothar de Maiziere, is resisting Mr. Kohl's suggestion that all-German elections could be held as early as December. Rising unemployment, which could get worse as state-mismanaged companies shut down, and rising prices, as East Germany shifts to a market economy, could throw an election to the opponents of capitalism on the West German model.
Worried that the political situation could deteriorate as time wears on, Mr. Kohl and his supporters have a new battle cry: ''Now or never!''

HEADLINE: Problem Real Estate Loans Rise Sharply at First Fidelity

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The First Fidelity Bancorporation in Lawrenceville, N.J., the 20th-largest banking company in the country, announced a sharp rise in problem real estate loans yesterday. Analysts expect the problems to result in a large loss for the second quarter.
The company's problems with real estate loans and other borrowers were not a surprise. Despite the financial setback, which includes a cut in its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share, from 50 cents, First Fidelity's stock rose sharply yesterday after the announcement, closing at $19.50, up $1.875, in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Analysts said that the loss would not be as great as feared, and that by recognizing it now, the company's new management could move forward with a cost-cutting program that would improve profits.
On Wednesday, the company's shares traded at the lowest price of the year, reflecting investor anticipation of more losses upon completion of a review of its loans. Like many other banking companies in the Northeast, First Fidelity has been hurt by the slowdown in economic activity and a glut of unsold real estate projects built in the late 1980's.
 
Not 'Life-Threatening'
 ''Today's news is not a life-threatening event,'' said James Rosenberg, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. He said the problems were anticipated in the second quarter.
In March, the company announced a program to reduce its payroll by 1,400, or nearly 10 percent. The savings from payroll cuts, plus reductions in other expenses, are expected to save First Fidelity $95 million this year and about $115 million annually in future years.
Anthony P. Terraciano, First Fidelity's stern-faced chairman, came to the company in early February from the Mellon Bank Corporation, another banking company that fell on hard times but has recovered. He said First Fidelity should return to profitability in the second quarter, when the need to set aside reserves for bad loans would be much smaller.
As the company recovers from the second-quarter setback, Mr. Terraciano said he did not expect much growth, ''but I do expect a better mix of loans, with more lending to consumers.''
First Fidelity, which is New Jersey's largest banking company, said yesterday that it would add as much as $300 million to its reserves for loan losses. That amount, which is subtracted from income, is far greater than average quarterly profits of about $64 million the company earned in the first half of last year.
The additional reserves were needed, the company said, because the weaker economy in New Jersey has increased the likelihood of losses on many loans. It said nonperforming loans - those that are not paying interest or that are clearly in trouble - could rise by as much as 40 percent, or $240 million, from the March 31 level of $604 million.
''Accepting a large loss now is a pre-emptive action that puts the company ahead of any rigorous examination by the regulators,'' James McDermott, the head of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a securities firm specializing in banking companies. ''Unless the New Jersey economy turns significantly weaker, they have recognized most of the credit problems.''
 
Plagued by Slow Economy
 Since First Fidelity was created in 1988 in a merger of banking companies in Newark and Philadelphia, it has been plagued by softness in its local economy and falling real estate prices. Those problems resulted in losses in the fourth quarters of 1988 and 1989, led to the departure of senior management and delayed a program of expense reductions expected from the merger.
Stocks of other large New Jersey-based banking companies have been weak in recent months, but they did not weaken appreciably yesterday in sympathy with First Fidelity. But analysts said that First Fidelity's real estate problems suggest that other New Jersey banks also face big troubles.

HEADLINE: Study on '89 By C.F.T.C.

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
A study by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has found no evidence of manipulation of stock index futures or intramarket trading activity that would have hastened the stock market plunge last October.
The report by the C.F.T.C.'s Division of Economic Analysis studied the relationship between the stock market and stock-index futures on Oct. 13, 16 and 24, days of significant stock market and index futures declines.
The report comes as the C.F.T.C. is fighting a move by the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to move stock-index futures regulation from the C.F.T.C. to the S.E.C. Those agencies contend that stock markets and the stock index futures markets based on them should be under one regulator.

HEADLINE: Milk Hormone Poses Health and Welfare Risks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your editorial ''Crying Wolf About Milk'' (May 1), opposing the banning of synthetic bovine growth hormone by Wisconsin and Minnesota, is misinformed and misleading.
You state that opposition to this genetically engineered animal drug, which is administered to dairy cattle to increase milk production, has two adversaries, the Foundation on Economic Trends and small farmers.
While the foundation has spearheaded opposition to bovine growth hormone, several of the country's leading farm, animal protection and environmental groups have also taken anti-BGH positions. These include the Humane Society of the United States, the National Farmers Union, the National Toxics Campaign and dozens of similar groups. Together they represent millions of Americans. You also neglect to mention that opposition to the drug is international and that there is a moratorium on its use in Europe. 
There is widespread opposition to bovine growth hormone because it is bad for the cow, bad for the farmer, bad for the taxpayer and potentially bad for the consumer. Independent studies by university scientists have determined that the drug causes significant health impacts on cattle and will drive large numbers of dairy farmers out of business. These claims are not disputed by the Food and Drug Administration, which has yet to approve the drug.
While you may believe that animal suffering and the destruction of the small dairy farmer are the price to be paid for ''new technology,'' Govs. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and Rudy Perpich of Minnesota are justifiably concerned about a product that could cause a flooding of the milk market, destroy farm communities, and cost their states tens of millions of dollars annually.
It's not just Wisconsin and Minnesota. In recent years, the Federal Government has spent more than one billion tax dollars to buy out dairy farmers and kill cows in a desperate attempt to hold down the level of milk production. Bovine growth hormone would undermine Federal policy by worsening the problem, and taxpayers would inevitably again be asked to pay for a new effort to cut milk production.
You recite chemical companies' claims that humans will suffer no adverse health effects from consuming dairy products containing the hormone. But researchers, including Dr. Samuel Epstein of the University of Illinois School of Public Health, warn of potentially significant adverse health effects, especially on infants. Although the F.D.A. has promised to respond, it has yet to release any scientific data proving the hormone's safety for human consumption.
Finally, you fail to mention the widely publicized testimony of whistleblowers inside the scandal-ridden F.D.A., who have said the agency has colluded with chemical companies to downplay the hormone's adverse health effects on cows and humans. These charges led Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont to call for a General Accounting Office investigation, now under way.
Governors Thompson and Perpich are to be congratulated for enacting a moratorium on the hormone to study the health, welfare and safety risks it poses to their constituents. They understand well that technology should not control human choices, but that human choices need to control technology.

HEADLINE: Phase Out the Philippine Bases

 BODY:
If the Philippines truly doesn't want the United States to keep its bases there, the thing to do is simple: Leave. Maintaining a good relationship and avoiding rancor is more important to American security than holding on to the bases. But there's a better answer: Leave gradually. 
The two giant installations - the naval base at Subic Bay and the air base at Clark Field - remain important but are no longer critical. Just as the cold war is melting in Europe, there's a thaw in Asia and the Pacific. In the emerging Pacific world, American air and naval forces can be reduced and otherwise accommodated.
The Philippines recently served notice that it would terminate the current 25-year base pact when it expires in September 1991. The action was more a bargaining step for more aid than a threat. But it also reflected growing nationalist resentment of the old colonial relationship.
Even so, the U.S. presence has strongly supported Philippine as well as American security. And to operate the bases, the U.S. injects $1 billion a year into the Philippine economy, some 3 percent of its gross national product. This year, U.S. aid includes an additional $513 million, most of which is considered rent for the bases.
But many Filipinos also bridle at the U.S. presence, attributing the predatory dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos to Washington's enduring power. Even President Corazon Aquino, a friend of the U.S., cannot envision an indefinite large-scale American presence.
There is a way to reconcile American bases with Philippine nationalism: gradualism. The two sides could agree now to phase out the bases by the end of the century. Such an arrangement would allow the Philippines time to make the necessary economic adjustments.
Meanwhile, the U.S. could arrange alternate bases in Japan, Guam, Hawaii or Singapore. Manila also could follow Singapore's example, commercialize the facilities and make private contracts with U.S. forces.
Whatever strategic value the two U.S. bases still possess would be more than negated if they come to poison the relationship between the two countries. Phasing out the bases gradually can meet everyone's needs.

HEADLINE: Auctions' Big Spenders: The Japanese

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
Japanese art buyers dominated the bidding for Impressionist and modern paintings this week at Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses in New York. The sales were high points of the spring auctions in New York.
In all, Japanese buyers acquired 23 of the 58 artworks sold at Sotheby's on Thursday night, paying $185.2 million in a sale that totaled $286.2 million, a record for any art sale. At Christie's on Tuesday night, Japanese bidders came away with 25 of the 57 works sold, paying $154.9 million in a sale that brought $268.4 million. 
When asked to assess the impact of Japanese buyers on the current market, Julian Agnew, a London dealer, said: ''At the moment they are the principal buyers and supporters. I think it is very similar to the Americans in the period of 1880 to 1914, and again in the 1920's.'' Societies that have experienced tremendous industrial growth generally want to enjoy their wealth, Mr. Agnew said, and buying art is one of the more desirable ways.
 
Art and Economics
Richard L. Feigen, a New York dealer, said: ''What is clear is there is no abatement of the influx of Japanese investment in the art market. This is now flight money - an escape from their stock market and real-estate market. There is volatility in the yen and vulnerability in the Japanese real-estate market. And the Japanese view art as an intrinsically valuable financial instrument, an idea that has been successfully propounded by the auction houses.
''The Japanese economy is in a state of flux, and Japanese art-buying is also in a state of flux: they are moving out of Impressionists and into the 20th century and into Old Masters.''
One Japanese industrialist, Ryoei Saito, established himself as perhaps the world's most flamboyant art-buyer by spending $160.6 million on two paintings. He paid a record $82.5 million for Vincent van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' which was auctioned Tuesday night at Christie's, and $78.1 million for Pierre Auguste Renoir's outdoor cafe scene ''At the Moulin de la Galette'' on Thursday night at Sotheby's.
 
Dozens of New Buyers
After Sotheby's Thursday auction, at which 12 works of the 70 offered did not sell and 8 others brought prices below their presale estimates, Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America, said the Japanese were responsible to a great degree for the results of this sale.
''They were active at all price levels in the sales over the last two weeks,'' she said. ''We had more Japanese in the salesroom than ever before - approximately 30 to 40 new Japanese buyers requested to be cleared before the sale. I would guess about half of them bought - not necessarily in any major way, but they bought something.
''A great many paintings that came to this country in the 1920's and 30's are now going out of this country -and many are going to Japan. Why? It's primarily because of the tax laws and the extraordinary appreciation in the values of works of art.''
Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York, said the figures for Japanese buying ''are obviously a bit swollen because of the two big pictures.'' More than just the huge amount of money was different at these sales, he said.
''You saw the Japanese bidding not only on pictures known as traditional Japanese taste in Renoir and Monet paintings, but also on top-quality 20th-century pictures,'' Mr. Burge said. ''The upward curve has flattened to some extent, but I don't think this is a downward curve.''
 
An Offstage Buyer
Hideto Kobayashi, the Tokyo dealer who bid for Mr. Saito at this week's sales, made additional purchases for Mr. Saito and other clients at Sotheby's on Thursday night and yesterday. Among them were Auguste Rodin's bronze ''Thinker,'' from 1880-81, for $1.2 million; Rodin's ''Burghers of Calais,'' six huge bronze figures, each about 80 inches or more in height, for $4.3 million; Paul Klee's watercolor of a theater from 1923, $1.3 million, and Tsuguharu Foujita's ''Girl With Cat'' from 1958, for $77,000.
Mr. Kobayashi never appeared in Sotheby's salesroom Thursday night. He and his party were secluded in a room above the auction floor, where Mr. Kobayashi relayed Mr. Saito's bids through Kazuko Shiumi of Sotheby's Tokyo office to Debra Hatch of the order-bid department, next to the auctioneer's rostrum. Before the sale ended, Mr. Kobayashi left the building through a side door.
Another Tokyo dealer, Kiyotaka Kori of the Gallery Aoyama in Tokyo, part of the Aska International Corporation, said he spent more than $30 million this week for the artworks he bought, mostly in the evening sales at Christie's and Sotheby's. Last November Mr. Kori bought $115 million worth of art in New York and London and acquired additional artworks worth $6.5 million at the New York sales of Habsburg, Feldman, a Geneva-based auction house.
As always, Mr. Kori bid this week from his seat in the auction room, a telephone in one hand and the bidding paddle in the other. Aska is a subsidiary of the Aichi Corporation, a Tokyo-based finance company headed by Yasumichi Morishita, which owns 6.4 percent of Christie's.
 
Renoirs Preferred
Mr. Kori spent about $10 million on Tuesday night at Christie's, where he bought four Renoirs. At Sotheby's on Thursday night he paid $19.5 million for six paintings - four by Renoir, one by Berthe Morisot and one by Marc Chagall.
Mr. Kori said he buys Renoirs because his clients prefer them to other works.
''In Japan every gallery has its specialties,'' he said. ''One has Monets, another Renoirs. Last year we sold many Renoirs and 99 percent of them were bought by corporations. In Japan it is very difficult for private collectors to buy big paintings.''
The Tokyo dealer Kazuo Fujii also bought artworks worth more than $30 million at Christie's and Sotheby's sales of contemporary, Impressionist and modern art. He said yesterday that major changes have occurred in the approximately 50 years he has been an art dealer.
''Until recently, Japanese people bought Impressionist paintings -even if they were not masterpieces,'' he said. ''Now some Japanese people want to buy high-quality Impressionist paintings - at any price.''
''The main reason is that Japanese people became rich and they have the potential to buy the masterpieces,'' Mr. Fujii said. ''Now Japanese people would like to leave some culture to Japan and to their children.''

HEADLINE: A Writer Moves Up, This Time in Hungary

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
He is a playwright. He became the symbol of his nation's resistance to Soviet domination. He spent years in jail. The head of his country's writers' union, he was recently voted President of a newly non-Communist nation in Eastern Europe.
His name is not Vaclav Havel, the oft-jailed playwright and current President of Czechoslovakia.
He is Arpad Goncz, the 68-year-old interim President of Hungary, who is also a translator, essayist and novelist and who was jailed for six years after the 1956 uprising in Hungary. 
Yesterday, only three months after Mr. Havel met President Bush in the White House, Mr. Goncz's own good-will mission to the United States took him to the Oval Office. During the meeting, President Bush assured Mr. Goncz that the issue of Soviet troop withdrawals from Eastern Europe would be on the agenda at the coming United States-Soviet summit conference.
 
A Most Unlikely Script
The story of the ascendancy of these writers to the leadership of two Eastern European nations was a script that few playwrights would have ventured only a year ago. Mr. Goncz seemed delighted, in an earlier interview, to point out some of the other similarities between himself and his friend Mr. Havel.
''He and I are part of the same conspiracy,'' Mr. Goncz said, eyes twinkling, leaning closer to his interviewer and lowering his voice. ''It is the international conspiracy of writers. We're trying to grab all the power in the world!''
But Mr. Goncz, during a brief visit to New York this week, said he had not been able to do ''any writing at all'' since he was voted President on May 2. ''Except, of course, for my signature! Signing bills, you know.''
''So far,'' he added more seriously, ''the legislative acts I've been signing have created 85 percent of the constitutional and institutional framework that is needed to insure that Hungary is smoothly governed. And we are bearing down on our responsibility to the economy and to restabilization.''
On Thursday, Mr. Goncz said at a Washington news conference that he was seeking American support for his country's economic changes. He also said Hungary wanted to leave the Warsaw Pact and become a neutral country.
Earlier on his American trip, Mr. Goncz received an honorary degree at the University of Indiana and met in New York with members of the World Jewish Congress to discuss the dedication of a Holocaust memorial in Budapest, 'A Figure of Immense Integrity'
''In a way, he's very like Havel,'' the American novelist E. L. Doctorow said of Mr. Goncz in an interview. The novelist met Mr. Goncz after he translated Mr. Doctorow's novels ''Ragtime'' and ''World's Fair'' into Hungarian. ''Because he was outside the system, Arpad became for the people of Hungary a figure of immense integrity and a truth-teller, in much the way that writers and poets and musicians in Czechoslovakia were perceived.''
''He's terribly modest about his attainments, but he's a real patriot,'' said Mr. Doctorow of Mr. Goncz. Hungary's future leader fought against the Nazis as a member of the underground and was wounded in 1944. Subsequently, he earned a law degree and joined the Independent Smallholders' Party, which won Hungary's last free elections in 1945.
Denied other employment after the Communists consolidated power in 1948, Mr. Goncz worked in agriculture and as a welder and pipe fitter, ''quite a good pipe fitter, I assure you,'' he said with a laugh.
After the insurgency failed in 1956, Mr. Goncz was sentenced to life in prison for conspiracy and high treason.
''Prison was a real party,'' he said. ''The best minds of Hungary were in prison.''
To challenge his intellect while in prison, his wife, Susan, gave him an English grammar, ''and I taught myself the language,'' he said.
''You will have to forgive my pronunciation,'' Mr. Goncz said in his strongly accented English. ''Since I learned English in prison - well, I had to invent something similar to English - I have what you would call a real Hungarian prison accent.'' He shook his head with mock sorrow. ''You have probably never heard this kind of English accent before.''
 
Translating Kennedy's Speeches
After a few years in prison and even though he was a dissident, Mr. Goncz found himself translating World War II memoirs and the speeches of John F. Kennedy into Hungarian for the Ministry of the Interior.
Then he translated part of John Galsworthy's ''Forsyte Saga'' and smuggled it out to his wife, who sold it to a publisher and earned Mr. Goncz his first money as a translator. ''This was necessary,'' he said. ''I had to put four children through university.''
Mr. Goncz was released in a general amnesty in 1963, and subsequently his chief source of income came from the translations of English works into Hungarian. Among the authors he has translated are Mr. Doctorow, William Faulkner, William Golding, Ernest Hemingway, William Styron, John Updike and Edith Wharton. Mr. Havel said he also translated President Bush's 1988 campaign book, ''Looking Forward: An Autobiography.''
''American writers are very popular in Hungary,'' he said, ''Faulkner most of all. 'The Sound and the Fury' sold more than 150,000 copies in hard cover. That's the same as two million in America.''
The author of six plays, Mr. Goncz has also written a collection of short stories and one novel. ''He's considered one of Hungary's best playwrights, and at least one of his plays is classically impressive,'' Mr. Doctorow said. The play is called ''Men of God,'' and ostensibly it is about the Waldensian heresy, which figured in the Reformation. ''But of course it really applied to the political situation under Communism,'' Mr. Doctorow said.
Mr. Goncz's plays have been performed in eight countries, but not yet in America. ''Who knows what the future may bring?'' he said.
In July, the future will bring the American publication of a collection of his work, ''Plays and Other Writings of Arpad Goncz.'' The anthology, translated from the Hungarian by Katharina M. Wilson and Christopher C. Wilson, will make Mr. Goncz's collected works available in English translation for the first time. Mr. Doctorow has written an introduction to the collection, which will be issued by Garland Publishing of New York.
 
The Virtues of Amateurism
''I have a theory that, as new democracies, Czechoslovakia and Hungary believe in amateurism,'' Mr. Doctorow said. ''They turned to Havel and Goncz just as we turned to Jefferson and Madison. Of course, Jefferson and Madison were writers, too. To them, politics was seen as a temporary public service. They were not afraid to act on principle. They were freer to speak and to act because they didn't see politics as a career, as a job they had to protect. And I'm sorry that that seems to be an idea we've lost.''
On May 2, the first freely elected Hungarian Parliament in four decades elected Mr. Goncz interim President of the nation. Mr. Goncz, a founder of the Alliance of Free Democrats, was supported by Jozsef Antall, a leader of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the largest of six parties that that won seats in Parliament in elections on March 25 and April 8. Mr. Goncz named Mr. Antall Prime Minister the next day.
''You know, I am two times a president, and I wear two presidential hats,'' Mr. Goncz said, referring to his continuing leadership of the National Writers' Association. ''I believe being president of the writers' union is the far more difficult task!''

HEADLINE: Chinese Aide May Seek U.S. Refuge

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
A senior Chinese official who disagreed with the military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last spring has quietly arrived in the United States, apparently seeking refuge, American officials said yesterday.
The arrival of the official, Xu Jiatun, who until last fall served as China's top representative in Hong Kong, could further strain United States-Chinese relations, which are already upset by American outrage at the killing of protesters in Beijing last June.
Mr. Xu arrived in Los Angeles with two relatives around May 1, traveling on a tourist visa arranged by the United States Consulate in Hong Kong, Administration officials said yesterday. They said Mr. Xu has not applied for political asylum, but they said they believed that he left China to escape attacks by hard-liners. 
 
'Just a Tourist'
Mr. Xu could not be located for comment, and his plans remain unclear.
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said it had been told by the official New China News Agency in Hong Kong that Mr. Xu had come to the United States ''for a rest,'' and was in this country ''just as a tourist.'' He said the embassy had no information on how long Mr. Xu would remain.
Mr. Xu, 74 years old, was a member of the Communist Party Central Committee, and if he does seek asylum he would be the highest-ranking Chinese leader to ask for refuge in the United States.
Mr. Xu was serving as director of the New China News Agency in Hong Hong. The position made him China's unofficial governor in the British colony, which in the eyes of many residents gave him greater power than the British Governor.
 
Movie Stars and Nightclubs
As an indication of Mr. Xu's status, when he took over the job in 1983, Hong Kong was effectively elevated to the provincial level in China. Mr. Xu reported directly to the central Government in Beijing, Chinese analysts say.
Mr. Xu was a veteran Communist revolutionary who served as a political commissar in the Red Army before the Communists' victory in 1949 and rose to be first party secretary of Jiangsu Province.
When he arrived in Hong Kong he was regarded as a hard-liner, an impression he confirmed during a speech by banging his glasses on the lectern and warning that China would not tolerate steps toward democracy in the British colony.
But Mr. Xu rapidly underwent a change, hobnobbing with wealthy Hong Kong business executives and escorting movie stars to Hong Kong nightclubs. He wrote articles suggesting China should learn from capitalism.
This may have been in part his mission in Hong Kong, to reassure the colony about China's intentions as Hong Kong faces a return to Beijing's control in 1997. Mr. Xu's actions may also have reflected the market-oriented economic changes then being carried out in China by Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang.
 
High-Level Connections
Mr. Xu often boasted of his close connections to both Mr. Zhao and Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader.
Last spring, when student protesters called for greater democracy in Beijing, Mr. Xu is said to have urged a conciliatory solution as the only way to maintain Hong Kong's confidence.
But this January, Beijing announced that Mr. Xu's ''request to retire'' had been accepted. He apparently hoped to stay on in the new city of Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, but in April the Hong Kong press reported that Beijing had ordered Mr. Xu to return to his hometown, Nanjing, in central China.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Saberhagen's 2-Hitter Too Much for Yanks

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Bret Saberhagen had not won a game in more than a month. After winning 23 games and the Cy Young Award last year, Saberhagen struggled and managed one victory in his first seven starts.
Mike Macfarlane had not hit a home run this year. He plays once every three games. 
Both players saw their fortunes change last night, and their splendid performances helped the Royals to a 4-1 victory over the Yankees at the Stadium.
If Saberhagen continues to pitch the way he did last night, he might not lose a game for the next month. Saberhagen mixed a nasty curve with a fastball that was humming, and held the Yankees to two hits.
 
Dominant and Economical
From the time he took the mound until he shook Macfarlane's hand after the game, there was no doubting his dominance. It was a tidy outing. Saberhagen faced only 29 batters and threw 108 pitches.
''It is as good as you can pitch without throwing a shutout,'' said John Wathan, the Royals' manager.
Macfarlane probably deserved more than a handshake from Saberhagen. In addition to calling Saberhagen's pitches, Macfarlane was the Yankees' nemesis with two doubles, a home run and four runs batted in.
Kansas City, which had lost 15 of its last 21 games, limped into New York with the highest payroll in the majors and the worst record. Expected to challenge the Oakland Athletics for the American League West title, the Royals instead have been perhaps the season's biggest disappointment.
 
Feeling Fresh Motivation
''There has been a lot of talk about all the money we're making,'' Saberhagen said. ''We have to go out there and do what we're capable of doing.''
In the first six innings, Saberhagen faced 19 batters. The only hit was a sinking liner to left by Claudell Washington in the second that dropped a foot in front of a diving Willie Wilson. Saberhagen promptly picked Washington off first.
Macfarlane, who entered the game with six runs batted in, drilled a long double over Roberto Kelly's head in center field in the second. He opened the seventh with a homer to left that put the Royals on top, 3-0, and hastened the exit of Tim Leary. Macfarlane closed out his night with a run-scoring double in the eighth.
The Yankees scored in the seventh when Kelly doubled and moved to third on a groundout by Don Mattingly. Mel Hall drove in Kelly with a sacrifice fly.
In the eighth, Saberhagen started to trot off the field even though there were only two outs. It didn't matter much. He quickly got the third out.
Macfarlane said his three hits were more than he remembered getting against the Yankees all of last season.
''Right before I left, my wife told me not to get into that Yankee rut,'' Macfarlane said. ''I think I had two hits off them. Tonight was just one of those nights.''
 
 Pascual Perez, who has been on the disabled list since April 29 with a strained shoulder, threw for 12 minutes without pain before the game and is expected to be sent to Tampa, Fla., for rehabilitation. . . . Danny Tartabull, out since the season opener with a leg injury, was activated yesterday by the Royals. . . . A hitting streak by the Royals' Kevin Seitzer was snapped at 17 games.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher; Traders Focus on Pound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained against most currencies in light trading yesterday, while the spotlight remained on the British pound.
Gold prices, meanwhile, rose worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $374.70 an ounce, up $5.20 from late Thursday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $373.25 an ounce, up $4.15. 
Currency dealers said the dollar was partly helped by the continued strength of the British pound, particularly in the European market.
 
Speculation About Britain
 With demand for the pound up, foreign traders sold their currencies to buy sterling, and that made the dollar more valuable against those currencies, explained Zlatko Glamuzina, the chief dealer at the New York office of Banco di Sicilia.
The pound has been supported in recent days by speculation that Britain was preparing to enter the European Monetary System. Some traders acknowledged imminent entry was unlikely, but they said the prospect of entry alone would provide underlying support for the pound for several weeks.
Trading was described as quiet in New York in the absence of any new economic indicators or financial developments. Also, some dealers have already departed for next week's annual gathering of foreign exchange dealers in Copenhagen.
Sterling rose to $1.6910 in London, from $1.6905 Thursday, but it eased slightly on profit taking, to $1.6900 from $1.6920, in New York.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar rose in New York to 153.00 yen from 152.15. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 152.90 yen, up 0.90 yen from Thursday's 152.00-yen finish. And in London it traded at 152.80 yen. The dollar fell, however, against the West German currency, to 1.6483 marks, from 1.6498 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's quotes, included: 1.4050 Swiss francs, up from 1.4045; 5.5595 French francs, up from 5.5570; 1,212.75 Italian lire, up from 1,212.50, and 1.17975 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17475.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $369.75 an ounce, from $369.25 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to $370.60 an ounce, from $369 Thursday.
In Hong Kong, gold rose 15 cents an ounce to close at $370.30.
Silver prices also gained ground. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.122 an ounce, up from $5.026 late Thursday. Silver rose in London to $5.06 an ounce from $5.05.

HEADLINE: Fed Voted in March for Tight Rein

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers concluded at their March meeting that excessive inflation would continue and decided to maintain high interest rate policies in the face of a moderately growing economy, according to minutes of the meeting released today.
The minutes were made available amid signs that the policy makers, who met in secret again on Tuesday, decided at the latest meeting to continue the policies at least for the next seven weeks while they try to determine the economy's direction before they meet again.
 
 Recession Is Feared
 The Fed has tried for more than two years to stem inflation by keeping a tight grip on credit and thus slowing the economy. Some analysts fear that the tight-money policies could restrain the economy too much and push it into a recession. 
But at its March 27 meeting, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee reviewed information that ''suggested that the economy was likely to expand at a somewhat faster pace over the next several quarters than in the fourth quarter of 1989,'' the minutes said.
At the same time, a staff projection said that ''little improvement was anticipated in the underlying trend of inflation.'' And some members commented that ''the prospects for inflation remained the most disturbing aspect of the economic outlook.''
''On balance,'' the minutes said, ''little or no progress in reducing inflation appeared to be in prospect for the quarters immediately ahead.''
 
Two Dissented in Vote
 As a result, most members indicated a preference for an unchanged policy, although several preferred an immediate move toward a tighter stance to achieve price stability. The vote for maintaining policy was 9 to 2, with W. Lee Hoskins of the Cleveland district and Robert H. Boykin of the Dallas district dissenting.
Until several weeks ago, many analysts thought the Fed might tighten credit at its meeting this week. However, statistics for employment, industrial production, retail sales and inflation all pointed to a return to slower growth in April.
In fact, some traders thought the central bank had loosened credit to stimulate growth when the Federal funds rate dropped below the Fed's 8.25 percent target late Wednesday and early Thursday. But the Fed took steps on Thursday to push up the rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. That signaled to many market watchers that a relaxation of monetary policy was not imminent. The Federal funds rate is the primary lever the Fed uses to control short-term interest rates.
Edward G. Boehne, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and a member of the committee, also told a bankers group on Thursday that Fed policy had been unchanged since December.
 
Funds Rate at 8.25 Percent
 The Federal funds rate has remained at 8.25 percent since Dec. 21, when the central bank permitted it to drop from 8.50 percent. That move followed its Dec. 18-19 meeting.
The open market committee, which is made up of the seven Fed governors and five of the presidents of the 12 Fed regional banks, meets in secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy and confers by telephone as needed. Minutes of the meeting are released six to seven weeks later.

HEADLINE: A G.M. Plant Adjusts To the 'New Brazil'

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAO CAETANO DO SUL, Brazil

 BODY:
Robert B. Stone, the American who heads the General Motors Corporation's subsidiary here, will not soon forget March 16, when Brazil's new Government announced its radical attack on inflation.
President Fernando Collor de Mello's main weapon was a freeze on 80 percent of the nation's savings held by individuals and private companies. The Government program all but halted inflation, which had been running at almost 5,000 percent over the 12 months ending in March, but it also closed factories and left shops deserted.
''It was panicville,'' Mr. Stone, the managing director of General Motors do Brasil Ltd., recalled during an interview at his office here, 10 miles from Sao Paulo, in Brazil's industrial belt. ''It took everyone by storm.'' 
The G.M. experience provides a glimpse of how Mr. Collor's economic blueprint for a ''New Brazil'' is working and how corporations are coping with the changes.
In the last two weeks of March, General Motors do Brasil, a $2.5 billion-a-year operation that builds 22,000 cars a month and holds 28 percent of the Brazilian auto market, did not sell a single car. By April, 19,000 of the company's 24,000 employees had been sent home with pay.
Yet the economic package prompted a flurry of activity at the headquarters of the G.M. subsidiary as the corporate staff hurried to devise a strategy for dealing with the Government program, which also included a new currency and a series of free-market reforms. For Mr. Stone and his staff, it meant emergency weekend meetings, daily reports to headquarters in Detroit and, the 40-year-old Michigan native recalled, ''sleepless nights and a few gray hairs.''
Today, thanks to the company's tactics and a recent easing of Government policy to revive consumer demand, G.M.'s Brazilian business is starting to return to normal. Some 20,000 of the auto company's employees are back at work and its two plants are producing vehicles at nearly 70 percent of capacity, with a 75 percent rate expected for June.
The Brazilian economy, like the G.M. operation, seems to be bouncing back from the shock recession that began in mid-March. But while the impact of the Government's financial squeeze is proving less harsh than many had expected, Mr. Collor's free-market policies, which are just beginning, promise to have a wrenching effect on Brazilian industry.
Mr. Collor, for instance, has said that he believes Brazil's car industry, the 11th largest in the world, is an oligopoly that has grown inefficient, overpriced and out of date because of decades of protectionism, namely price controls and heavy import duties. Thus the 40-year-old President is starting to allow auto imports - he ended a 15-year ban on May 4 - and plans to free exchange rates and encourage foreign investment.
For Brazilian companies, the Government's program presented a formidable financial challenge. Savings in cruzados novos, Brazil's currency until mid-March, were blocked and companies had to find a way to convert to the new currency, cruzeiros, as quickly and inexpensively as possible. The ease with which concerns like G.M. have made the transition to the new currency has surprised many economists. ''We're entirely on cruzeiros now,'' Mr. Stone said.
 
Hedging Against the Unknown
 The chore was made easier because before Mr. Collor's inauguration G.M., like other Brazilian companies, took a classic Latin American hedge against the unknown: They spent and invested most of their cash, thus reducing their liquidity and risk. Mr. Stone declined to say how much of his company's money had been frozen.
To unload deposits of cruzados novos, which are frozen until September 1991, G.M. took advantage of new rules allowing the old currency to be used to pay state and federal taxes and invoices dated before March. The ruling caused tax collection to soar after the currency switch. Brazil's car industry, one of the most heavily taxed in the world, pays a tax of 43 percent on its sales to dealers.
In another tactic, some Brazilian companies sold cruzados novos for cruzeiros at discounts of about 70 percent to parties who could use them to pay taxes.
The General Motors subsidiary was forced to borrow money to pay idled workers and to shut down several production lines after the freeze because few people had money to buy cars. It finally developed cash flow by converting earnings from car exports that had been retained, as usual, at the central bank, into cruzeiros. Few multinational companies in Brazil heeded the Government's suggestion that they request fresh funds from headquarters.
But for several weeks, the Brazilian auto industry almost ground to a halt. Layoffs spread throughout the industry, affecting Volvo do Brasil, Mercedes do Brasil and Autolatina, a joint venture of Ford do Brasil and Volkswagen do Brasil. Sales were so slow that Luiz Carlos Mello, president of Ford do Brasil, spent an April weekend promoting his cars in a Sao Paulo dealership.
Fiat do Brasil was the only manufacturer going full tilt, solely because most of its production here is for export. G.M. also kept its engine export line open.
 
Funds Released
 Slowly in April, as the Government's financial tourniquet eased, consumers had more money to spend and started to buy again. For example, the Government, as planned, unblocked the money of car credit unions to stimulate auto demand. And it stretched the allowable terms of bank loans for car purchases to 30 months from 4.
In fact, the turn in auto demand came so sharply that it generated new problems. Dealer stocks ran low and the period of temporary layoffs interrupted the normal supply of new cars. Some dealers soon started charging customers under-the-table surcharges of 15 to 20 percent on the prices fixed by the Government.
On May 1, Mr. Collor lashed out at the car companies. A Volkswagen dealer in Sao Paulo was arrested on May 2 for imposing the surcharge.
 
Credit Restricted
 ''High demand with fixed prices'' created the environment for illegal surcharges, Mr. Stone said. In an attempt to temper demand, the Government restricted credit this week.
The Government says that for now it will not decontrol the prices of goods like cement and autos produced by oligopolies, but will instead encourage price competition by relaxing import bans.
Still, an 85 percent tariff on imported cars should give the local auto industry time to adjust. Only a few hundred luxury cars are expected to be imported this year because tariffs, taxes and freight should triple the cost of these autos. But a schedule to reduce tariffs to the 20 percent range over the next three years is expected from the Government next month.
The Brazilian auto industry seems a model of inefficiency, supported by protectionism, taxation and local-content regulations. Accordingly, the lowest-priced new car in Brazil sells for $10,000, almost double the cheapest cars in the United States, even though hourly labor costs in Brazil are about one-seventh of those in the United States and less than one-third the rate in Japan.
The prospect of lowering protectionist barriers to auto imports is viewed with alarm by Brazilian unions and some industry executives. The resistance to such Government proposals underlines the political obstacles that Mr. Collor's free-market reforms are likely to encounter increasingly as they move forward.
''If imported vehicles enter Brazil at a competitive or lower price than Brazilian cars, there will be brutal unemployment in this country,'' warned Pedro Eberhardt, president of the National Auto Parts Industry Union.
 
'A Generation Behind'
 For his part, Mr. Stone welcomes the trend toward opening the Brazilian market. It should make the nation's auto industry more competitive internationally, he said, as long as the market for parts and factory equipment is freed, as well as the market for finished cars. Indeed, the Government is considering relaxing tariffs on car parts, robots and other automated equipment.
''We are a generation behind in electronics,'' Mr. Stone said. ''If you really believe in freedom, let us set prices and import parts, accessories and raw materials without heavy duties.''
Mr. Stone said that in response to the removal of import bans, he was studying the economics of importing General Motors cars to sell through his distribution network.

HEADLINE: Some Curb On Credit Is Reported

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve Board study confirmed today what many financial experts have been saying for weeks: the nation's commercial banks are restricting loans and other types of credit to small and medium-sized companies.
But at the same time, the Fed's study of 60 banking institutions found that while loan growth to some businesses this year had slowed, total lending had not declined, indicating that warnings of a recessionary nationwide credit tightening are unfounded.
''The bottom line is that you don't see the kind of horror stories in the data that you've seen in the anecdotes,'' said Robert E. Litan, senior fellow and a banking expert at the Brookings Institution. ''There has been some moderate degree of tightening, but there has not been the systemic kind of credit crunch we've heard about.'' 
 
Real Estate Loans Affected
 The survey, which is done three times a year, did find that almost all banks surveyed reported tighter policies on loans involving real estate. A large share of the bankers said they had imposed ''considerably'' tighter restrictions on developers of property, indicating that that industry was experiencing a ''credit crunch.''
''For marginal borrowers, who to a considerable degree are companies involved in and related to real estate, it feels like a credit crunch,'' said Robert Dugger, chief economist of the American Bankers Association. ''But in the economy as a whole, sound borrowers are still getting credit.''
The survey of senior loan officers at small, medium and large banks, comes one week after the nation's three top bank regulators held an unusual meeting with the directors of the bankers association and urged them to continue lending to creditworthy customers.
 
Weaker Economy Cited
 Bankers indicated in the survey that their tightening up on some loans was largely motivated by what the Fed survey described as a ''less favorable economic outlook.''
A second reason cited was the deterioration of the banks' loan portfolio, which would also be an indication of a weakening economy.
Last week's meeting with the association officials was seen as the clearest signal the regulators could make to bankers that they did not want them to overreact to reports of pressure to tighten lending. The meeting was attended by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman; L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency.
The regulators stressed that they wanted prudent lending to continue, hoping to prevent a significant slowdown in economic growth that would occur if bankers on a broad scale stopped making loans to mid-sized businesses.
 
Implications for the Fed
 The survey, which was completed before the meeting, now appears to buttress the regulators' actions. It also underscores concerns by some economists that in the face of a softening economy, the Fed's monetary policy has been too restrictive. They say that if Fed officials cannot persuade the banking industry to continue making credit available, the Fed may face the unwanted chore of sharply lowering interest rates to keep the economy from entering a recession.
''The regulators came to the A.B.A. to make sure that there was not overreaction,'' Mr. Dugger said. ''They don't want the economy to tailspin into a recession as a result of an overreaction. They do not want a regulatory-induced recession.''
In the minutes of the March 27 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which were released today, panel members were reporting concern in the banking industry about a tightening of credit, but they did not seem to be overly worried.
''Outside of lending for corporate-restructuring purposes and certain real estate transactions,'' the minutes stated, ''it was difficult to find firm indications of greater credit rationing. Some tightening of credit standards probably was a desirable development in terms of correcting for past excesses and adjusting to a more moderate pace of business activity, but a number of members expressed concern that significant further restraint, should it occur, could have adverse consequences for the overall economy.''
The Fed survey of banks reported that ''about 30 percent of banks indicated that since late 1989 they had reduced the size of credit lines they were making available to middle-market firms.''
In general, the banks said their lending policies toward large companies had not changed and that credit to them was still plentiful. The survey found, however, that some large borrowers had reduced their demand for loans because of a greater reliance on the commercial paper market, which is a way large companies can borrow from the investing public without using a bank as an intermediary.

Who Loses in Yearly Budget Brawls

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 18

 BODY:
Ever since Gov. Mario M. Cuomo presented his budget plan in January, he and the legislative leaders have been engaged in a high-stakes game of hot-potato, devoting at least as much energy to minimizing political losses as to devising a spending plan.
There are no clear victors. But the big loser has been the state itself.
Communities around the state, which were forced to borrow to compensate for missed state-aid payments, lost millions of dollars in interest costs because of the delay. School districts suffered similarly. 
While its leaders haggled, New York's credit rating dropped to its lowest level ever, a development that is likely to raise the cost of borrowing for years.
As is often the case with political jockeying, in the end, none of the politicians seem to have come out ahead.
 
'Really Nobody Wins'
Mr. Cuomo, who has sought a national reputation as a governor able to balance social concern with fiscal responsibility, has been badly damaged by the yawning deficit, the $1.4 billion in new taxes to close it and the perception that he cannot control the state government.
The State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, has gained a reputation for being unable to bring his members into line. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, Democrat of Brooklyn, who earned high marks in the negotiatiions, is unlikely to be remembered for his efforts, given the length of the entire process.
''Really nobody wins,'' Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University at New Paltz, said. ''What people conclude is that government doesn't work in New York. It just reinforces the cynicism.''
 
Array of Problems
Looking over the months of fumbling and procrastination that finally yielded up a budget agreement today, political and financial analysts have in recent days identified several long-term problems that contributed to the delay. These are some of the factors:
* Mr. Cuomo's failure, three years in a row, to present a strategy that would provide an enduring solution for the fiscal problems.
* The continuing efforts of the Republican-controlled Senate to minimize the seriousness of the problems.
* A breakdown in party discipline, which has made it increasingly difficult for the legislative leaders to gain support for unpopular decisions.
 
Slide in Tax Collections
''You see the legislative leaders' not being able to make agreements stick,'' Professor Benjamin said. ''That's a real change in the process. The party as glue is just not there anymore.''
Most political analysts, and even many politicians, agree that the stage for the budget debacle this year was set two years ago, when tax collections began what turned out to be a long and unrelenting slide.
The administration was surprisingly slow to respond to the decline and, indeed, still appears to be struggling to comprehend the magnitude of the problem. Every few months, the adminstration announces that the revenue collections have, once again, fallen short of expectations. The news has become so predictable that it barely makes lunchtime conversation in the Capitol.
''It's like Vietnam,'' the director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, Mitchell Moss, said. ''Every few months they would announce they were sending over a few thousand more troops. Every few months the Governor finds another $300 million shortfall. You lose credibility that way.''
 
Matter of Weeks
Just weeks after the Governor presented his proposed budget to the Legislature in January, he announced that revenues would be $1.5 billion lower than originally projected. That made the executive budget, which is traditionally a blueprint for negotiations, obsolete.
Instead of presenting a plan to bring his proposal up to date, Mr. Cuomo said he would work with legislative leaders to close the gap, cooperatively.
Mr. Cuomo insisted that he was trying to hasten the process. But in Albany cooperation is something that politicians indulge in just as a last resort. Even the Governor's supporters concede that the administration's failure to produce a plan to deal with the $1.5 billion gap, which eventually grew to almost $2 billion, reflected a reluctance to take responsibility for new taxes.
''They didn't want to have their fingerprints on anything,'' said one Democratic politicians who is friendly with the Governor.
 
Jockeying by Republicans
From the beginning of the negotiations, the stance of the Republican-controlled Senate did not bode well for cooperative efforts. For weeks, Republican senators insisted that the Governor was exaggerating the economic problems and maintained that the state should not delay the income-tax cut planned for this year.
The Republicans' insistence on the cut seemed intended to score political points for November, when the Governor and all 211 legislators are up for re-election.
Even after giving in and agreeing to delay the cut, Republican senators continued to insist on extracting some political benefit from the budget. They first refused to agree to new taxes, then pressed to add school aid for the suburban districts that are their core constituencies and finally insisted on a spending cap intended to shore up their image as fiscal conservatives.
This evening, some Republican lawmakers were still insisting on a spending cap as a condition of voting on the budget. Even though their threat to hold up the budget was never carried out, it contradicted the expressed wishes of Mr. Marino, who scheduled a vote on the budget bills for tonight.
Such a conflict between legislators and and a leader was once unthinkable here. But such conflicts have become commonplace in recent years, making the decision making increasingly diffuse and time consuming.
''We cannot fail to recognize that the State Senate is out of control,'' Mr. Moss said. ''What we have here is a collective failure of political leadership.''

HEADLINE: Woman Sues Boycotted Grocery in Flatbush

BYLINE: By ARNOLD H. LUBASCH

 BODY:
A $6 million lawsuit was filed yesterday by the Haitian woman whose claim that she was assaulted in a Korean grocery in Brooklyn in January touched off protests and a boycott that continue.
The woman's lawyer, Colin A. Moore, announced the suit at a news conference in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.
He said the woman, Giselaine Felissaint, had been struck by three employees in the Korean store, the Family Red Apple, at 1823 Church Avenue in the Flatbush section. The owners of the store said that the woman had refused to pay for some items and that she was not attacked. Another nearby Korean-owned store, Church Fruits, has also been a target of the boycott. 
Mr. Moore said that he represents the woman, not those boycotting the stores, but that the demonstrators are ''well within their First Amendment rights.''
Among those attending the news conference were Robert (Sonny) Carson, a black community organizer who is leading the boycott. Some others who attended shouted ''the boycott will continue'' as they left.
 
Trying to Set Up Meetings
The city's Human Rights Commission, which is trying to mediate the bitter dispute, had observers at the news conference, said a spokesman for the commission, Lonnie Soury. ''We are hopeful that we can still move in a positive direction,'' Mr. Soury said. ''We are definitely trying to get more meetings set up.''
A lawyer for the owners of Family Red Apple and Church Fruits, Richard A. Izzo, described yesterday's lawsuit as a ''baseless claim'' and ''attempted extortion.'' But he said it could turn into ''a positive development'' if it moves the dispute into court and off the street.
Mr. Izzo said he and the two Korean merchants want to resolve the dispute, but the demonstrators have ''no one representing them.''
The question of who speaks for the demonstrators became more perplexing this week when their lawyer, Stephen G. James, withdrew because they had rejected discussions with the other side. Later, Mr. James said, ''I would not foreclose the possibility of representing the demonstrators at the discussion table if they asked me to.'' #2 Groups Claim 17 Members Mr. James had represented the two groups that started the boycott, the Flatbush Coalition for Economic Empowerment and the Flatbush Frontline Collective, which are the defendants in a civil suit that the Korean merchants filed against the demonstrators.
At a hearing in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, two people testified for the groups. Sabine Albert, speaking for the Frontline Collective, said it had 10 members. George Dames, speaking for the Flatbush Coalition, said it had seven members.
Justice Gerald S. Held has issued a temporary order to bar the demonstrators from picketing within 50 feet of the two Korean stores. But the police have refrained from enforcing the order so far, saying it involves a civil dispute.

HEADLINE: HOUSE FOR THE HOMELESS PROVOKES DISPUTE

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: TRUMBULL, Conn.

 BODY:
Donna Russell says God led her to open her lakefront house to homeless families, but her neighbors say she is breaking the law.
One of them, Vincent Smith, complained to town zoning officials that Mrs. Russell is violating a local law that requires three-quarters of the residents of a single-family dwelling to be related by blood, marriage or adoption.
Mr. Smith said his complaint was not motivated by any bias against homeless people or against religion. ''I was born and raised a Christian,'' he said. ''I don't really practice any religion now. I believe there's a God, but I also believe there is a law and the law has to be followed.'' 
Mrs. Russell is to appear before the town Zoning Board of Appeals on June 6, where a lawyer from the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union will present her case. Does Law Violate Due Process? ''Basically, it's an outdated family restriction, which as we read it would prevent an unmarried couple from living together,'' said William Olds, the executive director of the civil liberties group. ''Our view is that it's unconstitutional under the state of Connecticut constitution.''
He said that the law violates due process, the right to privacy and freedom of association and that several states, including New York and New Jersey, have struck down similar zoning restrictions. Connecticut state laws allow day-care centers and homes for the mentally or physically disabled to operate in single-family residences.
Although the Trumbull official charged with enforcing the regulation said he thought it was ''way behind the times,'' he also said Mrs. Russell must obey the law.
''The woman is a very nice woman, very religious, and she has her views and genuinely, I think, wants to help people,'' said Donald G. Murray, the Trumbull building inspector who is also charged with enforcing zoning codes. ''God bless her, but she can't do it without permission.''
Other neighbors in the secluded Pinewood Estates subdivision in this town of 33,000 outside Bridgeport declined to be interviewed, but Mr. Murray said several are suspicious that Mrs. Russell's stance is a ploy to get money to finance the mortgage on the $400,000 house.
If the zoning board upholds the law, she intends to continue her fight in the courts, and the civil liberties union will represent her.
Mrs. Russell conceded that the real-estate brokerage and mortgage business she owns has been hit by the region's declining economy, and the white paint that is peeling from her clapboard home attests to a shortage of capital.
But she said she would continue the shelter regardless of whether she received state financing or donations from private sources. ''Money is tight,'' she said. ''But whether I'm living here on Pinewood Lake or somewhere else, I'm going to have this home.''
The 42-year-old mother of three said she expected people to question her motives for opening the shelter, which she has named the Alfred L. Bowles Jr. Home in memory of a friend's husband who was known for helping the homeless. ''I'm not surprised by the opposition, but I know that God's using it for his glory,'' she said.
She said her neighbors' concern is more for their property values than upholding the law.
 
Christmas Card to Neighbors
She said God first told her to open a homeless shelter in August 1983. ''I never heard any more about it until maybe June of 1988, when I was told by the Lord that this was the house,'' she said.
She was showing it to clients but felt compelled to buy it herself. She waited a few months more, and after hearing the director of a homeless shelter in Bridgeport speak at her church, she sought his advice on opening her house to homeless families.
She hosted her first family, a Thai woman and her small child, in December. After she sent a Christmas card from the shelter to her neighbors, Mr. Smith complained to city officials. Until then, the neighbors were unaware that anyone besides Mrs. Russell and her son Daniel, 18 years old, were living in the house.
On a recent visit to the two-story house almost hidden from view by oak trees and dense shrubbery, the only indication that anyone other than the Russells live there was the faint sound of a baby's cry.
The two young homeless mothers living there now declined to be interviewed. One of them has earned her general education degree and plans to attend a local business school. Mrs. Russell said two other homeless women have graduated from the shelter, one to a small apartment of her own and the other after a reconciliation with her family.

Luck and Pluck: From Poverty To Mega-Dealing

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
''The man happens to be lucky,'' said the big man's dapper driver.
Point taken. Dick Gidron owns lavish homes and a 36-foot boat, and is, according to Black Enterprise magazine, the nation's fourth-largest Afro-American car dealer. His best friend is Muhammad Ali, the most famous person in the world. 
Mr. Gidron, 49 years old, earned his luck. He grew up on Chicago's South Side, where he was raised by his mother and his grandmother after his father died when he was 6, 7 or 8 years old. He isn't sure which. He avoided the omnipresent youth gangs (''no future there''), throwing himself into a job in the parts department of a local Cadillac dealership instead. By the time he was 26, he had graduated from college, become Cadillac's first black salesman and was soon selling more freeway schooners than anybody else on this planet.
The big chance came in 1972. General Motors was selling its factory-owned outlets and wanted one of the four in the New York metropolitan area to go to a minority. Mr. Gidron edged out such big-name competitors as Hank Aaron and Sammy Davis Jr. for the chance to bet his last cent on a Caddy emporium.
Mr. Gidron makes light of the difficulties that he has overcome - the poverty he escaped as well as the effects of racism. Others don't.
''There are some things that are very difficult for us to crack into,'' said Mayor David N. Dinkins, a friend who has visited Mr. Gidron's home in Scarsdale.
''He has accomplished all this against all kinds of odds.''
This bear-like man with the huge head and alert eyes doesn't come across as a super pitchman.
There is a slight guardedness, even as he throws himself into such civic duties as serving four terms as president of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce. ''He's a tough guy to get close to,'' allowed John Dunn, a New York Telephone executive who nonetheless did.
Somehow Mr. Gidron became a fast friend to both George Steinbrenner and Dave Winfield, a rare feat. He races to ease the sting of even slightly controversial remarks. For example, after joking that he has personally autographed half the photos of Muhammad Ali, he retracted the remark. ''Those pictures mean too much to people,'' he said.
Not that he doesn't know how to speak his mind. When the fiance of his daughter, Bridget, one of two children, came to ask him for her hand, he blurted out, ''What makes you think she wants to marry you?''
Mr. Gidron is a man of grand gestures -most of which help sell cars. When he learned that the Westchester County black debutante ball might not be held because of financial problems, he dashed off a personal check for $3,000. Not only did he sponsor a youth job fair, he invited an astronaut.
Mr. Gidron says New York has far fewer minority-owned businesses than Chicago, a situation he thinks government should help remedy. He also stresses that blacks must concentrate on selling to whites, who constitute the great bulk of his trade.
But not to the exclusion of blacks. ''The epitome for any black American has always been to own a Cadillac,'' Mr. Gidron declared. ''It shows we've arrived a little bit and are kind of enjoying life.''
Daily, Mr. Gidron spends upward of 15 hours prowling between his Cadillac dealership and two Ford stores in the Bronx and another Ford outlet in Westchester County. He changes cars periodically so he arrives at Ford in a Ford, and so on.
He bargains price here, exhorts a salesman there, picks up a scrap of paper from a sidewalk, forces himself to spew out small talk. He tells a preacher he certainly is saved but not so saved he will buy new windows for his church.
He politely turns down a customer's request that he move his yacht so the two can again dock next to each other. He sells a man known as Hustler on the wisdom of trading up to a $50,000 model.
It seems downright magical how he starts out chatting about a broken alternator and within minutes has a man agreeing to cancel his contract to buy a Plymouth and look at Fords.
This big man has big plans, perhaps running for office. In the last election, he almost took a shot at Bronx borough president. Today's news, though, is that Mr. Gidron is opening what he calls a ''mega-dealership'' in Westchester County. Seven brands and 300 different makes under one roof!
Time will tell whether mega-dealing will make him America's largest black auto dealer. Whatever, Mr. Gidron insists that nothing compares with seeing a first-time Cadillac buyer's sparkling smile.
''You can't express that in words,'' he said.

HEADLINE: GLOBAL CHANGE AND BUDGET CUTS TEST PENTAGON

SERIES: Shrinking the Military - First of four articles: Making Cuts and Changing Missions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON with ERIK ECKHOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
Beyond disputes over dollars and weapons, the battle of the military budget reflects a debate over the shape of the American military in a transformed world.
The Bush Administration has, without apology, taken a cautious approach to the end of the cold war and proposed a modest decline in the military budget. In plans developed so far, the armed forces would be scaled back significantly but without changing their basic structure or missions.
This is ''the worst possible time to contemplate changes in defense strategy,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said earlier this year.
 
'Analyze What Is Right'
''What we need to do is to analyze what is right with that strategy and make adjustments,'' the Defense Secretary added. 
But in interviews a broad variety of experts, including three former Defense Secretaries, former top officers and private experts on the military, called for major, even radical, shifts in America's military posture that would permit deeper cuts in the budget.
Many leading experts say the Pentagon has been timid in reshaping American military forces for a changing world. They have put forth more far-reaching ideas, like withdrawing virtually all combat ground forces from Europe, relying far more on reserve units, spending much less on new long-range nuclear weapons, which the Administration plans to buy even as it cuts the nuclear arsenal under a new arms agreement, and perhaps reallocating missions among the services.
These and other measures would permit the annual military budget, now around $300 billion, to be reduced by 25 percent over five years, yielding a far greater annual ''peace dividend'' than would the annual decline of roughly 10 percent proposed by the Administration for the same period.
''The threats are likely to be very different in thefuture,'' said Harold Brown, Defense Secretary in the Carter Administration, who favors a 25 percent budget cut. ''That requires a more fundamental restructuring of the forces and missions.''
Even conservatives have castigated the Pentagon as engaging in old thinking. Fred C. Ikle, Ronald Reagan's Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, has written that Mr. Cheney's Pentagon is dominated by an ''obsolete mindset.''
''Despite the prudently chosen cuts that Defense Secretary Cheney proposed to Congress for the 1991 budget, about half our defense effort is essentially still devoted to fighting a massive conventional war in Europe,'' Mr. Ikle wrote in The National Interest, a conservative journal. ''Stalin has been buried twice in Moscow, but his ghost lives on in the Pentagon.''
As the extent of the change in the Soviet Union sinks in, the debate over the military budget is building into a full-fledged political war, cutting across party lines and ideologies. And it often pits service against service in an escalating contest for ever scarcer military dollars.
Behind the heated oratory is a deeper debate about the structure of the nation's military forces.
The Pentagon leadership, defending a traditional approach to military planning, sees itself as taking the prudent course.
''In Europe, we want to show the Soviet Union the same picture they have seen all along - a group of nations that are willing to make a real investment in their security,'' Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview. ''And a real investment is combat forces, not quartermaster clerks.''
Responding to the call by critics for more radical restructuring, he said: ''It's not at all clear to me that a balanced downsizing is not the right answer. I've seen no particular Soviet capability disappear; I've seen no part of the world where we have an interest go off the map.''
But where the Pentagon leadership sees prudence, others see an unimaginative failure to grasp a rare opportunity to create a new military structure.
''The Defense Department calculations still focus on the Soviet Union, reducing as the changes in the Warsaw Pact allow,'' said Les Aspin, a Pentagon analyst during the 1960's who now heads the House Armed Services committee. ''We need to do some really fundamental new thinking about where does it all go beyond this and what the threat is out there to which we gear our forces.''
 
The Goals
Readiness Vs. Risk
 Much of the debate involves differing calculations of the risk to national security posed by cutbacks in the armed forces. How likely is it that the Soviet military threat to Europe would or could be rebuilt? How likely is it that the United States will want to intervene in upheavals in the third world, how often and with what kinds of force?
While there are no absolute answers to these questions, the economic and diplomatic stakes are enormous. At its foundation, the budget debate reflects visions of how best to secure America's place in the world.
A 25 percent cut in the military budget would mean $50 billion a year less by 1995 than projected by the Bush Administration. This would be a tidy sum for reducing the deficit, aiding valued allies or fighting domestic ills. Some experts even believe that if Moscow's military retreat and preoccupation with overwhelming domestic problems continue, the American military should shrink still more in the closing years of the decade, to an annual budget level that is only 50 percent of today's $300 billion.
Secretary Cheney has charged that cutting the military budget in half ''would give us the defense budget for a second-class power, the budget of an America in decline,'' and the weight of opinion among leading military experts appears to be that cuts of this magnitude may go too far. General Powell said he worried about ''a drawdown so precipitous that we are seen to be leaving the world stage as the leader of the Atlantic and Pacific alliances.''
 
Concerns About Cutbacks
''The fundamental question is the level of risk that the American public is willing to live with,'' said James Schlesinger, Defense Secretary in the Nixon Administration. I've witnessed two major cuts since World War II and both times we lived to regret it,'' he cautioned, referring to the late 1940's and the 1970's, after the Vietnam War. Still, with a carefully planned reduction of 25 percent, he said, ''I think we can continue to play the role of global superpower that we're accustomed to.''
But William W. Kaufmann, a former Defense Department official who is a leading proponent of the 50 percent cut, replied, ''I don't regard the size of the defense budget or armed forces as the only index of U.S. power.''
''If we don't get our economy and society in order,'' he added, ''we may have a great military facade but we won't be a very great power.''
Mr. Ikle, who favors somewhat deeper budget cuts over five years than Mr. Cheney has proposed, said United States security would be served by redirecting a portion of the military dollars to security assistance to allies around the world and aid to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.
Mr. Ikle said economic aid to Eastern Europe might now be the front-line weapon. ''One-third of a percent of the defense budget would make a whale of a difference there,'' he said.
 
The Critics' Views
Leaner Forces, Narrower Roles
 Several major policy changes were proposed by many leading experts, although not every critic of current Pentagon plans endorsed each one.
One proposal calls for radically revising NATO's time-honored sharing of labor. The United States Army would no longer keep more than a symbolic number of ground combat forces in Europe, instead leaving logistical units there prepared to receive reinforcements. While a strong Air Force contingent would remain, only about one-third as many troops as the 225,000 envisioned by President Bush would stay in Europe.
Proponents including Mr. Schlesinger and Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee, say that these smaller forces might show more realism, given rising West German resentment over the large American military presence.
Under another proposed policy change, the services would cut active forces deeply and rely far more on the Reserves. In particular, the Army would keep fewer heavy, armored forces on active duty, and would assign to Reserves the task of defending Europe in a crisis. Proponents say the approach is justified by the remote chances of a Soviet attack and the months or years it would take the Soviet Union to rebuild an offensive threat once its forces have pulled back.
Some critics also believe the Navy should shift more of its vessels into reserve status, reduce the number of aircraft carriers and cut back their patrolling of far-flung waters.
All these experts would preserve a capacity to mount small-scale attacks, like the recent invasion of Panama, and to make lightning strikes against foes who, for example, sponsor terrorists or threaten oil traffic.
Many experts say costly new long-range nuclear weapons the Administration says it needs to match advances in the Soviet arsenal should be bought over a much longer period than now planned. They also think that drastic cuts in nuclear arms should be sought in new negotiations that would follow the strategic arms treaty now nearing completion. That treaty would reduce American and Soviet arsenals by roughly 30 percent and would permit the deployment of new weapons.
Some critics also believe that the Pentagon should review the assignment of missions to the services, largely set four decades ago, with an eye to meeting goals more efficiently. Some say the Air Force might, for example, be given additional responsibilities for attacking enemy ships at sea, a task now entrusted largely to the Navy, while the mission of providing close air support to Army troops should be taken over by the Army from the Air Force.
 
The Pentagon's Stand
Big Threat Eases; Others Emerge
 General Powell, reflecting the Bush Administration's cautious approach to the Soviet transformation, reacted coolly to many of the proposals that would bring about a steep drop in forces.
Nonetheless, he said that he and Defense Secretary Cheney were seeking to define the ''base line'' forces needed to protect American interests and that deeper budget reductions than they have proposed might prove feasible.
Another senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition that he not be identified, acknowledged that some basic planning choices had yet to be made. ''If Europe needs heavy reinforcement, do we still have the capability to send heavy forces to the Middle East?'' he mused. ''We haven't decided if we want that simultaneous capability.''
The Army, Navy and Air Force offered to Pentagon leaders their plans for meeting the Administration's budget guidelines through 1997. The services projected a significant cutback in forces: active Army divisions would fall to 14 from 18, aircraft carriers to 12 from 14, tactical airwings to 28 from 36. But there would be no changes in basic strategy.
But these were only early salvoes in what is already a contentious review, often pitting service against service and military against civilian leadership, that will last through the year.
''We are planning on the basis of a radical change in the Soviet threat,'' the senior Pentagon official insisted. The changes many critics are proposing ''are not so different from what we're thinking about,'' said the official, who indicated that Pentagon leaders were already considering much deeper cuts in the Army than revealed so far.
 
The Next War
Super Conflict? Or Intervention?
 At least four-fifths of the $300 billion the country will spend this year on the military is devoted to conventional forces: tank battalions, infantry and paratroop units, jet fighters, aircraft carriers and attack submarines that are intended to fight war without a nuclear conflagration. Most of these forces were designed to fight the Soviet Union.
With the Soviet threat receding and the budget shrinking, all the military services are competing for the lead role in future assaults in the third world.
Still, a fight with well-armed countries like Iraq and Syria would require some of the same heavy forces and advanced weaponry needed to fight the Soviets. How well-prepared the country should be for large-scale conflict depends, in the end, on a judgment of the likelihood that it will enter such a war, or that it might at least want to threaten a fight during a showdown.
Former Defense Secretary Brown, who said he would like to see an annual budget ''in the $200 to $250 billion range,'' acknowledged that the smaller active-duty military he advocates would be unable to fight a prolonged war. What this military could do in a crisis, he said, ''is get us there early, put the U.S. on the line.''
He asked: ''Are we prepared, for example, to fight the Iraqis, the Panamanians, the Vietnamese or the North Koreans with more than an early show of air and naval power, and a modest ground force very early to show we're committed? No. We are prepared to play a peripheral role, as we did recently in the Persian Gulf.'' There, the Navy provided escorts for commercial oil tankers in the midst of the Iran-Iraq war.
While a significant mobilization would be required to sustain a major conflict, he said, such a confrontation now appears to be so unlikely that the risk of relying on Reserves is worth running.
More sweeping proposals for reductions have come from Mr. Kaufmann, Robert S. McNamara, a former Defense Secretary, and the Defense Budget Task Force, a private group of 11 former Government officials headed by Lawrence J. Korb, an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration.
 
More Radical Cuts
These critics say the budget should be halved by the year 2000, to about $150 billion in today's dollars. Such a reduction would require, in addition to the changes envisioned by other experts, the cancellation of many more new weapons and, later in the decade, deeper cuts in active forces, like shrinking the Navy's fleet of aircraft carriers to six or nine, in various plans, instead of the 10 or 12 proposed by many other experts.
Under this approach, the country would still be prepared for minor interventions but not for prolonged heavy fighting. Patrolling of the seas by aircraft carriers would be curbed significantly, with the Navy becoming more of a reactive force. This option also presumes a giant cut in superpower nuclear arsenals and an end to buying new long-range nuclear weapons.
''It's very hard to imagine something that would require more than the eight divisions we had in Korea,'' said Mr. Kaufmann, a Defense Department consultant in the 1960's and 1970's who now teaches at Harvard University. ''It's also hard to imagine more than one contingency of that size, or two lesser contingencies that would happen simultaneously.''
He added, ''And I reject the argument that the Navy performs some pacifying function by floating around the South China Sea or something.''
At least for now, cutting the budget in half appears to go beyond what is regarded as prudent by a majority of the country's leading military strategists, including many critics of the Pentagon.
The huge reductions in Army and Navy forces proposed by some ''amount to saying we are going to defend ourselves and let others defend themselves,'' Mr. Brown asserted.
General Powell warned, ''It's hard to see what's wrong with all of this going down until you have a crisis - until you suddenly have to mass forces to deal with a situation and discover you have to strip from just about everywhere else in the world.''

HEADLINE: States' Prisons Continue to Bulge, Overwhelming Efforts at Reform

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WALLA WALLA, Wash.

 BODY:
Fueled by new laws and stiffer sentences endorsed by an impatient public, the states' prison population grew more than 10 percent last year and began to overwhelm even states like Washington, which had been among the few to avoid overcrowding.
By the year's end, state prisons, after a decade of constant rapid growth, housed a record 644,000 inmates, about 67,000 more than the year before. Federal prisons held 56,500 inmates, an increase of 12,000.
Virtually every state prison system is being pushed beyond its intended capacity despite court orders in 37 states to ease overcrowding. Even $4 billion in new prison construction authorized last year, in addition to $4.4 billion in 1988, cannot keep pace with the growing number of convicted felons, many involved with drugs. 
 
Mushrooming Drug Arrests
In California last winter, the Corrections Department opened two new prisons that added 2,200 beds and brought the state's inmate capacity to 49,800. But that is still 37,000 short of the prison population, with 250 new convicts arriving every week to sleep on cots in gyms and dayrooms. In New York the prison population rose 15 percent in 1989, to 51,234 from 44,559.
The pressures on prisons are a result of mushrooming drug arrests, a decline in paroles and the stiffening of criminal laws to create new classes of felonies. The flood of inmates is forcing many states to examine alternative penalties for nonviolent offenders in an effort to insure that convicts receive at least some punishment and to avoid taking up prison space needed for violent offenders.
Some states, especially Washington, Georgia and Missouri, have made extensive use of alternative punishments like halfway houses and house arrest under the intensive supervision of a probation officer. But the proportion of violent offenders has grown with the rising number of drug arrests, and now many prison systems are hard pressed to find enough nonviolent inmates to qualify for such diversions.
 
'Rent-a-Cell' Programs
Until recently, the alternative strategies were so effective that some states had vacant cells, which they rented out to others for a fee. For instance, Washington had 1,800 Federal inmates and prisoners from other states in its Rent-a-Cell Program last year; at $65 a day per inmate, the state collected nearly $40 million over the past few years.
Missouri leased to other states 800 of the 5,000 prison beds that it built in the mid-1980's. Estimating an increase of 150 inmates a year, officials assumed the new cells would handle Missouri's prison population until nearly the year 2000. But in 1989 the number of prisoners increased 1,600, to 13,437. ''Last year was a disaster,'' said Gail Hughes, Deputy Director of Missouri's Department of Corrections.
The extra cells were used up in a few weeks. And this month the last of 800 prisoners from Illinois, Colorado and the District of Columbia will be shipped home to already crowded prisons.
The situation is even worse in Georgia, widely hailed as the leader in imaginative alternatives to simple but costly prison sentences. ''We're being overwhelmed now simply by raw numbers,'' said Vince Fallin, Deputy Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Corrections.
 
Lock Them Up, But Not Here
Last spring Georgia had 19,300 prisoners and 12,000 slots in other punishment programs, from house arrest to intensive probation. Today Georgia prisons hold 21,000 inmates, with 3,200 waiting in overcrowded county jails and 14,000 new beds under construction. Another 20,000 convicts are enrolled in the diversion programs. And Georgia's problems are just beginning: officials expect the prison population to reach 34,000 in the next 21 months, an increase of more than 60 percent.
At Washington State Penitentiary here, workers are installing four beds in cells where one or two used to be, and the state is making plans for housing 700 inmates beyond the prison's capacity of 1,800. That can be avoided only if each of seven new prisons opens on schedule, starting in 14 months.
Last month the office of Chase Riveland, head of Washington's Department of Corrections, mailed 735 letters to towns, cities, civic leaders and others seeking applications for prison sites. So far, he said, he has received 41 inquiries, mainly from economically strapped communities eager for a new, nonpolluting industry and its jobs. (The prison here pumps $30 million a year into the economy, in everything from wages and potato chip purchases to video rentals for the prison's TV station. Twenty percent of the salaries at the community college cover instruction of inmates.) Officials say many other communities are eager to have the criminals locked up, but not in their backyard.
 
Cells as a Scarce Resource
Washington avoided the crowding problem until now largely by presenting an uncommon question in American penology. In the early 80's, instead of asking why they did not have enough cells, the state's leaders asked why they had so many prisoners. That examination led to an unusual alliance.
Liberals wanted more equity in criminal sentencing; conservatives wanted more certainty in the punishment system. Both were bothered by broad judicial discretion that produced widely divergent sentences for people convicted of identical crimes, and by a parole system that could turn a 20-year sentence into a fraction of that. And both believed that just as the growth of urban traffic always overwhelmed new expressways, endless prison building would not end overcrowding.
''We treat prison cells as a scarce resource,'' Mr. Riveland said. ''It sounds simple, but it's an important distinction.'' The new thinking led to the state's Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which established a chart for judges to consult.
In the form of a grid, the chart matched the severity of a crime (armed robbery, for instance, as opposed to armed robbery resulting in an injury) with the convict's criminal history. Where the lines meet tells a judge how many months' sentence must be assessed. Inmates sentenced under this system could no longer be paroled; they would serve until their sentences were up.
''It's worked,'' said Mr. Riveland. ''We get not necessarily longer sentences, but longer sentences served. Now, instead of getting 20 years but being released in 3, what you get is what you serve.''
The law kept many less serious offenders out of prison and produced a temporary decline in the inmate population. That, in turn, was filled with boarders from other states.
Mr. Riveland said he had steered more money into intensive supervision and other special programs for those convicted of first and second offenses, hoping to head off more serious problems later. A burglar convicted for the second time, for instance, would serve 30 days in a county jail and spend one year under strict supervision while working. Without parole, Washington also avoids imprisoning parole violators; such offenders make up more than one-third of California's prison admissions.
 
'Cafeteria of Sanctions'
But now Washington's system is feeling the effects of longer terms served by violent offenders, along with sharp increases in drug arrests and reported sexual offenses.
The same is true in Georgia, which for years has offered what Mr. Fallin calls ''a cafeteria of sanctions'' to avoid sending everyone to prison. The state has also invested heavily in speeches, open houses and videos to sell this approach to the news media and the public, which can be leery of anything that smacks of softness toward criminals.
''This is the historic problem in American corrections,'' said Tony Travisono, executive director of the American Correctional Association, the nationwide organization of prison administrators. ''People can see a prison. They don't see treatment or counseling.''
Georgia's diversions for nonviolent offenders include electronic bracelets that keep prisoners under house arrest, regular probation, community service and halfway houses, all of which cost less than boot camps or prisons.
There are some unintended side effects. The removal of so many nonviolent offenders leaves heavier concentrations of violent criminals in the prisons, presenting greater control problems. Such offenders cannot be assigned as ''trusties'' for chores like cooking, cleaning, and grounds and road maintenance; states now have to hire civilian laborers, at greater expense.
Some states have commissioned public opinion surveys to see if average citizens are indeed as retribution-minded as believed. Along with several more years of ambitious prison building, Mr. Travisono sees such re-examinations of old assumptions as crucial.
''Why should probation officers only work from nine to five?'' he asked. ''We could have 24-hour checks on convicts out there holding a job, paying taxes and restitution to their victims. We could have special centers for short-term punishment of parole violators.''
He suggested that traditional procedures and expensive heavy-handed punishments might have to give way to more sophisticated application of a wide variety of sanctions, not only in states that have long been overcrowded but in those that are new to the problem. ''What's important is not the length of a sentence; it's the certainty of punishment,'' he said. ''And we don't need an expensive baseball bat for every wrongdoer.''

HEADLINE: Bolivians Switch Crops as Coca Market Falls

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ETERAMASAMA, Bolivia

 BODY:
Felix Lazo's harvest of coca leaves lay on the floor of his cinder-block house, unsold because actions against drug dealers and processing laboratories in Bolivia and elsewhere have destroyed the market for the raw material of cocaine.
A hundred pounds of coca today may bring only 15 to 20 bolivianos, the equivalent of $5 to $7, he said, ''and for that I have to carry the bags of leaves up to the crossroads on my back, then pay for transport to market.'' It is a familiar predicament for the small farmers here who produce a third of the world's coca, a crop that once provided a secure cash flow, as much as $400 to $500 for 100 pounds.
Drug experts say the price drop, which has led farmers to plant other crops, is a result of the crackdown on major drug traffickers in Colombia and the relentless assaults on drug laboratories and wholesale buyers of coca paste here in Bolivia.
 
Quick Pace of Substitution
Those actions are believed to have interrupted processing activities and lowered demand for coca leaves. Some of Bolivia's coca is turned into cocaine inside the country and more is processed in Colombia, with virtually all of the marketing done by Colombian dealers. 
''Since the price fell, there is almost nothing for the people here,'' Mr. Lazo said as he led the way through the insects and interminable tropical rain to his remaining patch of coca - about two and a half acres, a third of what he had three years ago. For lack of money, he said, he has stopped fertilizing and spraying it.
Mr. Lazo and other farmers here in the Chapare rain forest, Bolivia's main coca-growing region, have begun to substitute fruit and other crops.
They are doing it at such a quick pace that the aid programs run by the Bolivian Government, the United States, the United Nations and others are unable to keep up with the demand for seeds, plants and eradication payments.
A State Department official in La Paz said that when the United States does its annual aerial survey of drug-producing countries this year, Bolivia will show its first ever decline in total coca acreage.
 
Bolivia's 'Dying Industry'
Drug experts attribute the race to other crops to the almost total collapse in the price of coca leaves in the last six months. Although there are skeptics among them who say they believe that the price drop is temporary or maintain that the farmers are eradicating coca along the roads while going deeper into the jungle to start new seed beds, more of the experts say they believe that in just a few years, Bolivia's part in the cocaine business could be reduced to a minor role.
The State Department official called it a ''dying industry'' in Bolivia. He and other experts said the sharp decline in coca production in Bolivia would not necessarily lower the total supply of cocaine because the Upper Huallaga Valley in Peru, the leading source of coca leaf, is capable of expanded production.
Drug experts in La Paz said the presence of the Shining Path guerrilla organization in Peru greatly inhibited raids and other interdiction activities against drug laboratories and traffickers there. As a result, they said, the price of coca leaf in Peru has not collapsed as in Bolivia, and recent reports from Peru say farmers there are planting more acres in coca than ever before.
But officials say that in the Chapare, farmers have voluntarily dug up more than 8,000 acres of coca plants this year - more than was eliminated in all of 1989 and more than the Government, in an agreement with the United States, promised to eradicate in all of this year. The Chapare was estimated to have 100,000 acres of coca last year.
Some Government officials say they fear that the mass retreat from coca by Bolivian farmers will gather steam faster than economic development programs can find ways to replace the $500 million to $600 million that coca is thought to represent in hard-currency income.
 
A Switch to Rice and Corn
It is the lost income that worries Mr. Lazo and about 40,000 other farmers producing coca in the Chapare. Despite the big money associated with cocaine, their place at the bottom of the ladder earned them an income only slightly above subsistence level. But it was better than most Bolivians had.
Now, the coca farmers say they fear that they and their families will have nothing to eat and and that there will be nowhere to sell the other products that agronomists and extension agents are persuading them to grow.
Down the road from Mr. Lazo, Guillermo Grandon lighted an oil lamp, filled his guests' glasses from a half-gallon bottle of Coca-Cola, and said his ''only hope'' lay in the 750 young plants growing in his greenhouse, including citrus, macadamia, coconut and black pepper. He said he planned to mix them with subsistence crops like rice and corn.
Like his friend Hilario Claros, Mr. Grandon eradicated part of his coca for a one-time payment of $2,000 per 2.5 acres and joined a United States-financed crop-substitution program that helped them start the perennials that they hope will pay off in the future.
 
Limited 'Export Mentality'
Both men traveled to Costa Rica in the last two years under the substitution program to see how small farmers there were succeeding with tropical crops. They returned enthusiastic and have signed on as promoters of the subsitution program to spread the word to others.
''The Costa Rican trip convinced us that this can work,'' said Mr. Claros. ''But it won't work if we don't get some agro-industry in here to process and sell what we produce.''
Jose Decker, who directs the substitution program from offices in Cochabamba, the departmental capital, said his biggest worry was finding markets for the products - citrus, pineapple, macadamia, ginger, pepper, exotic fruits and flowers, and more - that will be pouring out of the Chapare in the next few years.
''The problem is that private national firms in Bolivia have no experience in international marketing,'' he said. ''Except concerning tin and coca, this country has never had an export mentality. Coca, in fact, is the only product that Bolivians have ever exported with value added.''
 
Plan for Macadamia Nuts
Joe Lopez, a New Mexico-born tropical agriculture specialist who serves as a consultant to the crop substitution program, is less worried. He is convinced that as the crops come into production, the markets and processing plants will appear. He said several foreign companies had expressed interest in buying from the Chapare.
Among other things, Mr. Lopez was instrumental in bringing in the macadamia nuts from Costa Rica that are now sprouting into tiny trees in makeshift greenhouses across the Chapare. Although they will not begin to produce for about seven years, he said that world demand for the nuts was strong and growing and that he was convinced that Bolivia can join Hawaii and Costa Rica as major producers. Many farmers are putting their faith in that possibility.
Joaquin Valderrama, head of a local growers' group, complained bitterly about the lack of roads and electricity in the area and the Government's failure to keep promises of help in the past. Then he said he had eradicated half his coca and planned to plant macadamia trees, among other things.
Told that a small container of macadamia nuts costs several dollars in the United States, he said he hoped the price remained high ''because we're going to produce a lot of those nuts.''

Text of Statement by Baker

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 19

 BODY:
Following is the text of the statement today by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d after talks with Soviet leaders:
 
Four Days of Talks
We have just finished four days of long and detailed talks with President Gorbachev, Foreign Minister Shevardnadze and their colleagues. These have been some of the most intensive discussions we have had with our Soviet counterparts during this Administration. In the end game of negotiations, it is reasonable to expect both the intensity and difficulty of the work to increase. In short, we have been engaged in some heavy lifting to lock in agreements by the summit between President Bush and President Gorbachev. 
I think our discussions have resulted in some real accomplishments, and the progress we have made here makes me optimistic that we will have a productive summit in Washington, beginning less than two weeks from now.
In the five hours of meetings with President Gorbachev, we covered a number of issues, including some arms control, Baltic, and in particular, Lithuanian, desires for independence; German unification; and the Soviet economy. We had a full exchange of views on these issues.
I might just say that in the discussions I had here on Lithuania, the parties expressed a desire to find a way to peaceful dialogue. I can't say at this point that the Soviets and Lithuanians have yet arrived at a common basis on which to proceed. I think they are now more actively seeking to develop that basis, but they are not there yet.
 
Discussions on Start
Let me briefly cover the results of our talks and where our relationship stands as we get ready for the summit.
On Start, our goal has been to reach agreement on the major substantive issues by the summit, and we are now in a position to do so. While some issues remain, we have now reached agreement at this ministerial on what have been two of the most vexing problems we have faced in Start: air-launched cruise missiles and sea-launched cruise missiles. On A.L.C.M.'s, we have agreed to a complicated formula which equitably meets the needs of both sides.
On S.L.C.M.'s, we have agreed to a politically binding declaration which will stand outside of the Start treaty itself. The declaration will enhance both strategic stability and predictability without creating verification difficulties for either side.
We resolved a number of other Start issues and also agreed to begin to work on the objectives for follow-on negotiations on Start.
 
Chemical Arms Accord
On chemical weapons, we have reached agreement on a precedent-setting accord. I believe that this agreement is very significant, particularly as it provides a real pathway toward a global ban on horrific weapons that we already know from bitter experience actually get used.
Very simply put, this U.S.-Soviet accord is a trailblazing agreement that implements the President's initiative on C.W.
On nuclear testing, we have completed work on the protocols to the nuclear testing treaties. These are now ready for signing at the summit.
We also have agreed to a summit joint statement on nuclear, chemical and missile nonproliferation.
The one area where we made less progress in arms control than we had hoped for is C.F.E. We had come with ideas designed to push this process forward, but our counterparts apparently weren't able to respond meaningfully at this time.
On regional issues, we had a full discussion on Afghanistan. I believe we are close to developing a common basis on which to move to free and fair elections - the surest path to reconciliation, peace and legitimacy in that war-torn country.
On Central America, our discussions reaffirmed the importance of continued adherence to Esquipulas and the need to end the insurgency in El Salvador and promote a political dialogue.
On human rights and democratization, we stressed our continuing concern over the remaining refusenik cases in the Soviet Union and the need to resolve all of them as soon as possible. I also raised my concerns about anti-Semitism and the vital need for the Soviet leadership to speak out strongly against it.
We had exchanges on economics, transnational and bilateral issues. We have finalized for signing at the summit several U.S.-Soviet agreements in the commercial area, including the Long-Term Grains Agreement and the Maritime Transportation Agreement.
In terms of transnational and bilateral issues, we are ready to sign a maritime boundary agreement, an agreement on oceans study, an accord to open cultural and information centers in Moscow and Washington, and perhaps others. We also will be able to sign the Thousand-Thousand Agreement - an exchange of a thousand undergraduate students between our countries.
In closing, we have worked to prepare the ground so that our Presidents can lock in and institutionalize mutual points of advantage in our relationship.

HEADLINE: How the Politics Shifted on AIDS Funds

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
The politics of AIDS has fundamentally shifted in Congress, turning lawmakers who once cringed at voting for money to combat the epidemic or assist its victims into vocal supporters of more Federal aid.
Like other political turnarounds, this one reflects a combination of forces: constituent pressures, finely tuned lobbying efforts and a health care crisis too overwhelming to be ignored.
But lawmakers and AIDS lobbying groups say the most powerful factor has been the personal experiences that members of Congress have had with those who suffer from the disease, experiences that have allowed them to see it and address it as a public health issue rather than one defined by morality and life style.
''I think more and more members have been sensitized by people in our own districts and neigborhoods who are afflicted,'' said Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who is in some ways a symbol of the changing political equation on AIDS. 
 
A Reluctant Involvement
Mr. Lewis is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He acknowledged that while individual caucus members have long been quietly supportive of AIDS legislation, the caucus as a group has been reluctant to be publicly involved in the issue.
''AIDS is having a tremendous effect on the black community,'' Mr. Lewis said, ''but people didn't want to talk about it. It was not the issue to raised, to be identified with.''
Now, he said, ''there is no way we can go around anymore saying this is an issue just affecting the gay community. In recent days, the life and death of Ryan White brought it home to many, many people.''
Other lawmakers besides Mr. Lewis cited Ryan White, a hemophiliac who contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion several years ago and died recently at 18. The lawmakers mentioned him as a politically safe symbol of the disease's devastation, a symbol that compelled changing the terms of the debate on providing funds to deal with AIDS.
In comments on the Senate floor last week during debate on an AIDS funding measure, Senator Daniel R. Coats, a conservative Republican from Indiana, Ryan's home state, expressed the broad acceptance that such funding now has. ''Every case of HIV infection is a tragedy, regardless of how contracted,'' he said. ''And I trust that everyone agrees that we must provide every victim who is medically and economically eligible with the best possible treatment.''
Although Congress has steadily increased money for research and education programs over the past seven years, the additional money has generally been provided quietly, as part of broader spending bills that did not require a visible vote on AIDS.
 
'Right Thing to Do'
That began to change in 1988, with passage of the first comprehensive AIDS legislation authorizing increases in research personnel. But the most vivid demonstration of the shift came this week with the Senate's 95-to-4 vote approving a measure to funnel $2.9 billion in emergency relief to hospitals, community-based organizations and home-care programs in cities and states that have been hardest hit by AIDS.
''The last vote on an AIDS issue that lopsided was in 1987, when it went in the opposite direction,'' said Jeff Levi, a political consultant on AIDS assistance. ''What we're seeing is a dramatic reversal of what politicians consider the right thing to do.''
The reversal is also the product of more sophisticated lobbying by those who provide care for AIDS patients. They have spent three years carefully building ties to local elected officials, minority groups and health and medical professionals.
Two years ago, such lobbying efforts were primarily defensive, aimed at blunting opposition to AIDS measures from conservative Republicans like Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Representative William E. Dannemeyer of California, who emphasized that the majority of people with AIDS were either homosexuals or intravenous drug abusers.
But this year, advocates of AIDS assistance were able to take the offensive, building persuasive cases that the public hospital system that provides care for the poor was crumbling under the weight of the epidemic.
 
At the Same Table
''We brought people to the table who don't usually like each other,'' said Jean McGuire, executive director of the AIDS Action Council, an umbrella organization representing providers of services to AIDS patients.
''Everyone had something in this bill,'' she said, referring to the provisions that allocate some relief money directly to hospital clinics and community organizations, and some to the states to distribute.
That approach drew support from unexpected quarters, other lobbyists said, citing Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida. as an example.
''It's an issue that has a major impact on a state like Florida, particularly Miami,'' Mr. Mack said, recalling a recent visit to Jackson Memorial Hospital and his shock at seeing room after room filled with newborns suffering from AIDS.
''Jackson Memorial is the only major provider of care for the indigent in South Florida,'' he said. ''It's having severe financial problems.''
Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who has sought money to battle AIDS since the early 1980's, said the change in the political climate was gratifying. But he worries about whether it is enough.
Both the Senate bill and Mr. Waxman's broader companion measure merely authorize the emergency relief money. In the separate legislation needed to actually provide the money, the AIDS programs will be competing with other needs, and at a time when Congress faces new pressures to cut the budget deficit.

HEADLINE: 1 Killed in Second Shooting on Montana Campuses

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HELENA, Mont., May 19

 BODY:
A man who appeared to be drunk walked into a college cafeteria and opened fire with a revolver on Friday, killing one college employee and wounding another, the authorities said.
The attack, at Carroll College here, was the second fatal shooting incident on a Montana campus this week. On Tuesday, two students were killed by shotgun blasts at Montana State University in Bozeman, 100 miles southeast of here. A fellow student was arrested several hours later in that case. 
The shooting at Carroll College, a four-year Roman Catholic school with an enrollment of about 1,200 students, occurred at 3:30 P.M. Half an hour later, a man believed to be an unemployed ranch hand was arrested on the campus for investigation of murder. He was identified as Darrell Randall Stahl, 36 years old.
 
Officials Call Attack Random
Mr. Stahl has no known connection to the college, and officials there said they were certain his attack had been random.
A first court appearance for Mr. Stahl was canceled Friday because he appeared intoxicated, said County Attorney Mike McGrath, who added that the authorities were considering charges of murder and attempted murder.
Russ Ritter, the college's vice president for development, said the assailant had ''entered the east door of the Carroll Commons, walked to a group of Carroll employees who were having a coffee break - food service employees - asked them a question about where he could find somebody, and then proceeded to shoot the two individuals.''
The employee who was killed in the attack was identified as Sharon Hance, 52, a secretary for the college. The wounded employee also was a woman, a food service worker for Marriott Foods, which runs the college's cafeteria. The woman, whose name was being withheld, was reported in stable condition today at St. Peter's Community Hospital.
 
Motive in First Shooting Unclear
In the attack on Tuesday at Montana State, Brett Byers, a 19-year-old student, is accused of killing two freshmen in a dormitory. The authorities say Mr. Byers, who is being held without bond, apparently did not know the victims, and, four days after the shootings, they say they still do not know his motive.
Michael Bloom, assistant police chief in Helena, refused to comment on whether Mr. Stahl had known the two women. He said that no motive had been determined but that the police were interviewing a woman who might have been with Mr. Stahl before the shooting.

Budget in Albany: Cheers and Fears

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 19

 BODY:
When New York's long-overdue budget received final approval at 4:01 A.M. today, state lawmakers congratulated themselves for having found a solution to the worst financial problems that the state has seen in more than a decade. But critics both inside and outside government say they fear that, even though the budget includes the largest tax increase in the state's history, it will not guarantee balanced budgets in coming years.
This year's excruciating budget process produced a political compromise built on taxes that are neither so equitable nor so reliable as many would prefer. By refusing to raise rates on broad-based taxes like the personal income tax and the gasoline tax, which produce vast revenues but pick the pockets of large numbers of voters, state leaders have left themselves open to charges that they chose election-year expediency over fiscal responsibility. 
''They were afraid to do something concrete that a lot of voters would notice,'' said Matthew P. Drennan, a professor of economics at New York University. ''Ever since the Mondale defeat, I think politicians across the country have been wary of any kind of broad taxes and instead have opted for these emergency taxes.''
 
'Huge Structural Imbalance'
An analyst with the Citizens Budget Commission, Cynthia Green, said the $1.4 billion tax bill, which has been dubbed ''The Big Ugly,'' will do little to solve a structural budget gap created by years of overspending, overborrowing and an unwise reliance on nonrecurring revenue sources.
''When you're looking at a huge structural imbalance,'' she said, ''there's only one way to solve the problem and that's with broad-based taxes.''
This year's budget gap ultimately reached $4 billion. But the tax package forged by the Governor and the Legislature left rates untouched on the state's three broadest taxes - the personal income tax, which would raise almost $1 billion with a 1 percentage point increase in the maximum rate; the sales tax, which last year raised almost $1.4 billion for each of its 4 percentage points, and the 8-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, which is worth almost $60 million for each penny.
Instead, they agreed on a hodgepodge package of taxes on alcohol, cigarettes, soda containers, ''900 number'' telephone calls, hotel rooms, car rentals, cleaning services, security services and parking garages, as well as imposing a 15 percent surcharge on the corporate income tax and a slew of fee increases. The package, which is supposed to raise $1.4 billion, was approved by the Assembly on Thursday and by the Senate late Friday night.
 
Concern About Package
It was the second year in a row that lawmakers had enacted more than $1 billion in new taxes without touching the state's broad-based taxes.
Given the dearth of hopeful news about the state economy, many budget analysts predict that those taxes will raise too little to maintain spending next year at current levels plus inflation. They are particularly concerned because the state this year largely depleted its supply of nonrecurring revenue sources, like sales of state property and raids on trust funds.
Many fiscal analysts, including the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, also are not yet convinced that this year's tax package will raise the money it is supposed to, meaning the state may have to borrow or cut spending later in the year.
''Many of these taxes are untested, and we don't know at what point the law of diminishing returns starts to take effect,'' Mr. Regan said on Friday. ''The more you tax an activity, the less of that activity you're likely to get.''
 
Political Bombshell
The saga of this year's tax bill opened on Jan. 16, when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo presented his budget for the 1991 fiscal year, which was to begin on April 1. That document projected a $2 billion gap between predicted tax revenues and the spending needed to maintain existing programs at current levels.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed closing the gap with about $1 billion in new taxes, with the rest of the hole filled through spending cuts and nonrecurring revenues. His proposal hinged on a political bombshell that ultimately drove more than four months of budget talks - the deferral of the last year of a four-year cut in the personal income tax.
The Republicans who control the State Senate seized on the proposal as a ready-made campaign issue in a year when Mr. Cuomo and all 211 legislators face re-election.
''The tax cut was a Republican initiative, and we weren't easily going to give it up,'' said the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay, L.I. ''As Republicans, we have to make a difference or why would people vote for us?''
As the Republicans waged a public relations war to keep the tax cut, the state's fiscal condition began to deteriorate. By the middle of March, Mr. Regan had concluded that the budget gap for the coming year would be $1.5 billion wider than Mr. Cuomo had predicted.
 
'We Made Our Case'
Only after New York's credit rating was dropped to the lowest level in state history did the Republicans concede that the budget gap had grown. Even then, they said the tax cut, which would cost the state $400 million this year and $1.4 billion next year, was sacrosanct.
On April 5, with budget negotiations stalled, Mr. Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Mel Miller gave Mr. Marino the political cover that he wanted by agreeing to phase in the tax cut. To compensate for the lost revenue, the leaders imposed a three-year surcharge on corporate income taxes.
''We made our case and lost,'' said Mr. Cuomo, adding that the Democrats compromised to accommodate ''political expediency'' by the Republicans.
The tax cut agreement, and the growth of the budget gap by an additional $500 million, forced the leaders to look for more taxes and fees.
Mr. Cuomo pushed, although not very hard, for raising the gasoline tax, which is one of the lowest in the country. But higher gasoline taxes were opposed as inequitable by Republicans from upstate New York and Long Island, where driving is closer to a necessity than in the Democratic stronghold of New York City.
Meanwhile, a proposal to place sales taxes on services like consulting and public relations ignited a furor in New York City, where the service sector is the healthiest segment of an otherwise bleak economy. It, too, was scrapped.
Critics said the taxes finally approved were politically palatable because they afford consumers the option of incurring them. Many blasted state leaders for not having the political will to support more farsighted taxes.
''There's going to have to be a restructuring of the budget,'' said Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, ''probably by three leaders who have decided not to seek re-election.''

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
A Loner With a Strong Emotional Center

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. PINCUS; Andrew L. Pincus is the music critic of The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, Mass.

 BODY:
Eduard Tubin is one of music's loners. Estonian by birth, the composer spent the last half of his life in Sweden. He followed no fashions, belonged to no school. When he died in 1982, he left a legacy of 10 symphonies, two operas, two ballets and a variety of concertos, cantatas and works in smaller forms. Virtually none of this music is widely known in the United States.
The release of the 10 symphonies and seven other works on seven Bis compact disks shows that the loss has been ours. In harmonic and expressive range, Tubin's nearest kin are Bartok and Prokofiev. But Tubin speaks with his own voice, which - like Bartok's and Prokofiev's - is that of a 20th-century European uprooted by war, persecution and flight from his homeland. The works on these disks are not merely well crafted; they move strongly and surely toward emotional centers. 
Born in 1905, Tubin studied composition in Estonia and Budapest, where he learned the music of Kodaly and Bartok. Though primarily a composer, he became the conductor of a theater orchestra in Tartu, Estonia, and later married one of the theater's dancers.
Tubin remained in Tartu through the successive Soviet and German occupations of Estonia in World War II. When Soviet forces advanced on the country again in 1944, he and his family fled across the Baltic to Sweden. He spent the rest of his life in Stockholm, but without allegiance to the prevailing avant-garde. Anthony Hodgson's 1984 ''Scandinavian Music,'' one of the few studies in English to deal with Tubin, allots him only one paragraph, which places him outside the ''Swedish line of 20th-century development'' because of his Estonian roots.
It took an Estonian-born conductor, Neeme Jarvi, and a Swedish label, Bis, to bring the music to a wider audience through the recorded cycle. The project was a lengthy one, beginning in the early 1980's, reaching fruition this year and involving four Scandinavian and German orchestras. Bis is issuing the series only as CD's (CD-227, CD-297, CD-304, CD-306, CD-342, CD-351 and CD-401), but LP versions of some of the earlier releases may still be available.
Tautness is the music's most striking quality. The symphonies last about a half-hour each, typically in three movements. Themes reappear from movement to movement in changing contexts and guises, providing a unifying force. Unexpected overlays and juxtapositions of ideas - a kaleidoscope of dance rhythms in the Sixth Symphony, for instance - heighten the drama. Restless energy and a strong rhythmic drive find release in arching melodies, distant fanfares and horn calls, and brooding or spectral touches.
Like Bartok, Tubin draws on his folk heritage, which saturates the music with a resiliency that transcends mere nationalism. Like Prokofiev and Shostakovich, he celebrates the endurance of the human spirit amid the hardships of war.
Especially in the early works, the music is strongly contrapuntal; that and a predilection for surging timpani, trombones and basses sometimes create a bottom-heavy web of sound, as in Hindemith. Some melodramatic and tawdry touches also intrude. Yet there is a clear progression from extroversion and profusion of ideas to introspection and economy of means, with the wartime Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 as the dividing line. While the First and Second (the ''Legendary'') symphonies suggest Carl Nielsen's ''Sinfonia espansiva'' in sheer exuberance of event, the later works grow sparer and darker, seemingly shadowed by tragedy.
Together with the 1946 Fifth Symphony, the Third and Fourth form a powerful war trilogy. Composed in 1940-42, the Third has the ominous repetitions and epic sweep of Shostakovich's wartime symphonies, though it ends with a march of triumph that recalls the Roman legions' thunderous tread in Respighi's ''Pines of Rome.''
The Fourth was completed in 1943. In a Soviet air raid just before the 1944 premiere in Tallinn, the manuscript was singed when the safe containing it fell into the cellar of the burning theater. The performance went on, but the score finally crumbled and Tubin had to redo it in condensed form in Sweden.
Lyrical and reflective, the Fourth carries only distant echoes of war. Olav Roots, who conducted the Tallinn premiere, said that after the Third's heroic struggles, in the Fourth the Nordic night seems to have ''spread a soft light over the countryside of the homeland, whose features had lost their sharpness in the gloom.'' To end the trilogy, the Fifth Symphony, which draws its lyricism from Estonian folk melody, bursts into exultation.
In the subsequent symphonies Tubin continued to refine his craft. The anguished, restless Seventh is almost a chamber symphony; the Eighth and Ninth look more deeply inward. The Tenth, in one movement like Sibelius's final symphony, is the most concise and introspective of the series.
The shorter works that fill out the disks are equally varied and striking. The suite from the ballet ''Kratt,'' in which a peasant sells his soul to the devil, is colorful and folklike, in the vein of Stravinsky's and Falla's ballets on folk subjects; the Piano Concertino has the brilliance and driving energy of the Prokofiev concertos.
Most remarkable - and atypical - of all is the 1979 ''Requiem for Fallen Soldiers,'' scored for mezzo-soprano soloist, male chorus, organ, drums and trumpet. Recalling Estonia's defeat in a 1919 war of independence, it is at once a dirge and an expression of patriotism. A Swedish student choir sings it radiantly.
The Swedish Radio Symphony, Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, Bergen Philharmonic Society and Bamberg Symphony do not always have the seamless finish and blend of the best European and American orchestras, but under Mr. Jarvi's direction they have something more important - fire and conviction. The Bergen performance of the Fourth Symphony is outstanding. It is the 1981 premiere of Tubin's revision, recorded live, and the playing pours out of the speakers like molten lava.
The recorded sound loses focus on some disks, but never enough to interfere with listening. The records whet the appetite to hear our American orchestras play these absorbing works.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
AFTER OPULENCE, A NEW 'LITE' ARCHITECTURE

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

 BODY:
This is not an age with any consensus about style: for all that certain ideologues may claim otherwise, the 90's are starting out to be as eclectic as the 80's. There is still plenty of post-modernism, there is still plenty of late-modernism, and there is still every possible thing in between. But one thing is coming to stand out, and it is less a style than a sense that architecture is going to be asking less of us, whatever form it takes.
If the Reagan years were symbolized by a kind of opulence, by a grandiose classicism that masqueraded as the latest thing but was in fact not much more than a wallowing in traditional forms of luxury, the Bush years are going to be characterized by pulling back. Architecture and design won't be reversing course so much as pulling in their reins, moving back to a kind of undemanding ease. Stripped down, simplified, basic and, above all, easy: after a generation of architecture that, whatever its style, has been consistently intense, we are going to see a lot more things that are not intense at all, but laid back and comfortable. In an age of ''lite'' beer, ''lite'' cuisine, lightweight laptop computers and lite-FM, does it not make sense that it should all culminate in lite architecture? 
Almost everything built today in the commercial landscape looks, feels, and often is, light in weight. Traditionally, architecture has been associated with bulk, with a feeling of great weight and substance. But buildings now almost never have a sense of heft: like cars, clothes, telephones, electronics and everything else, they have quite literally been becoming lighter, smaller and more compact for more than a generation. Compare the sleek metal facade of Citicorp Center in New York to the limestone walls of Rockefeller Center: Citicorp, finished in the late 1970's, seems so light it could float up to the sky, while Rockefeller Center, built in the 1930's, seems anchored to the ground.
It's not merely a matter of building materials. Metal and glass, which are inherently lighter in weight and feel than stone, are hardly new to the last few years. Indeed, in the last decade the trend in architecture has moved away from these materials and back to stone and masonry. But even where we do build in stone, we build lightly. Stone today isn't the same as stone a generation or two ago. It's a thin veneer, a lightweight wafer applied to the surface, sometimes barely thicker than the polished metal it so often resembles. Technology now permits stone to be cut nearly as thin as salami, which dramatically changes our perceptions of what this material - once the very embodiment of architectural solidity - can mean.
Lite architecture is happening everywhere, from cities to small towns to sprawling developments beside the freeways. But a few New York skyscrapers can start to show what all this thinness can do to our traditional perceptions of architecture. One, Worldwide Plaza by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, finished in 1989, is a classical tower topped by a copper-clad pyramid, a frank attempt to replicate the spirit of the great romantic skyscrapers of the 1920's. But where many of the great buildings of the 1920's seemed almost to have been carved out of solid stone, Worldwide Plaza's granite lower floors are more like stone wallpaper. It looks almost as if it could be peeled off.
Worldwide Plaza is to architecture what ''lite classical'' is to music: easy listening, comfortable, lacking in either heft or challenge. (Here it's worth excepting the building's splendid elliptical arcade, the one place where Worldwide Plaza soars to genuine monumentality and true architectural strength.) There's another side to lite architecture in the I.B.M. tower by Edward Larrabee Barnes, finished in 1983, where thin slabs of green granite have been polished finely and applied to the structure to create a sleek, smooth surface that looks for all the world like metal. The building has a cantilevered corner, so the whole skyscraper is rather like a ballet dancer balanced on point. Here, there is no attempt to try to make old-style classicism out of new-style thin stone veneer. Instead, everything in this tower, from the stone trying to look like metal to the building trying to look as if it were leaping in the air, is all directed toward making it look and feel light.
And there are plenty of less ambitious versions of these buildings, architecture that is lighter still, so to speak. Similar to Worldwide Plaza, but lacking its strengths, is the Americas Tower by Swanke, Hayden & Connell, now under construction, where thin slices of granite have been assembled in a skyscraper that tries to echo the mood of the setback towers of the 1930's - buildings that had a visual weight to them that this one can only pathetically yearn for. And a block away from that building's site at 45th Street and Avenue of the Americas is a new tower of mirrored glass on Fifth Avenue that shows the other aspect of lite architecture; it is so weightless in appearance that you wonder whether it should be tied down.
Where did lite architecture come from? The roots would seem, at first, to lie in modern architecture, which since the 1920's has sought a kind of visual lightness, sometimes even to the point of transparency, as a way of celebrating 20th-century technology and of breaking away from the heavy, dark architecture of the Edwardian age. Le Corbusier lifted his buildings off the ground on ''pilotis,'' or columns, to prove their lightness; Mies van der Rohe struggled to make many of his buildings appear almost to float.
But all that is light architecture, not lite architecture. What we are seeing now is less a continuation of modernism's long march toward lightness of form and structure than a move toward lightness of image. Modernism was light in appearance and often light in weight, but it was quite the opposite of lightweight: it was among the most intellectual of architectures, its esthetic among the most demanding in terms of the relationship of form to idea.
 
Light in Weight And Lightweight
 Today's light, or lite, architecture isn't like that. Its goal is to reduce intellectual demand, not increase it. Its real parent is not modernism at all, but the stage set, the idea that architecture is a matter of facades crafted primarily for quick and easy pleasure. Take the ever greater ability of modern technology to make almost everything lighter and lighter, thinner and thinner, and cross it with the hedonistic sensibility of the stage set, and it's no wonder that architecture now is light in weight and lightweight: light visually, light physically and light intellectually.
Lite architecture couldn't have come without both conditions: new technologies, which make materials so light and thin they have ever less substance to them, and the image-conscious culture of the last few years, which has sought a kind of continuous easy visual fix. Together they make a potent combination. We look at architecture now almost the way we look at television - demanding new images, new pictures, new scenes, all the time. Image is not only more important than reality: in a sense image is reality in our culture, a reality that comes faster and faster, in ever more facile form.
The idea that there is merit to a building possessing substance - physical or intellectual substance - seems to be fading rapidly. How long has it been since a critic has praised a building by calling it solid, by thinking of it in terms of gravity and permanence, by saying something like Louis Sullivan's wonderful comment about Henry Hobson Richardson's Marshall Field store, that it ''stood like a man, a virile force''? Architecture, like the movies, is entertainment, and it is increasingly judged by the same standard.
And that, in the end, is the real problem. It's not that all architecture must be Serious, Important and Intellectually Demanding. Given that we must live with architecture in a way that we do not have to live in constant exposure to serious art, literature or music, it's perfectly reasonable that it not challenge us intellectually at every turn. But if the architecture that surrounds us does not exist primarily to make the intellectual demands upon us that great art does, neither is it merely a passing piece of entertainment, there to play on our emotions and then be forgotten. At its best architecture is a nurturing and civilizing force, and it is with us not for a passing moment, but forever.
 
Modern, But Not Modernist
 It should be said that the most creative late modern architecture, the high-tech buildings of Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, or the so-called deconstructivist work of architects like Peter Eisenman and Bernard Tschumi, is not what I am talking about here. This work - buildings like Mr. Rogers's Lloyds headquarters in London or Mr. Eisenman's Wexner Center in Columbus, Ohio - possesses great intellectual ambition, whatever its sense of physical lightness, and a lot of it can be justified as an attempt to evolve a demanding and serious esthetic out of the technological capabilities of our time: to show that there can be great architectural power in light, tensile structure. At the very least, the brilliance of architects like Mr. Foster and Mr. Rogers stands as a stunning reproof to those who would automatically equate a sense of physical lightness with intellectual lightness.
No, the real lite architecture is rarely modernist, and more often it is quite the opposite: those post-modernist or traditionally styled buildings that try to convey the sense of gravity and substance of older kinds of architecture without possessing any of their weight. We now make classical moldings out of Fiberglas, and facades out of synthetic materials intended - from a distance - to look like stone or wood or precast concrete (which is itself, of course, a kind of imitation stone). From close up it's another matter.
Take, for example, the Home Savings Bank headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, designed by Tim Vreeland of the firm of A. C. Martin. This office building bears a more than casual resemblance to the Plaza Hotel in New York. But unlike the Plaza, whose facade of brick and stone has a magnificent, sumptuous presence, the Home Savings building is sheathed in a cheap precast concrete material, its very thinness completely at odds with the image the architect is hoping to convey. It's not so much the Plaza as a quick and facile attempt to evoke the aura of the Plaza.
 
Architecture As Aura
 Architecture as aura: maybe that's what lite architecture is. Graham Gund, like Tim Vreeland an architect of considerable sophistication, has been seduced into playing the same game in several projects in New England, like the Golden Eagle Lodge and Waterville Valley Town Square in Waterville Valley, N.H., an amiable, rambling, vaguely Victorian resort hotel with an adjacent set of clapboard, dormered buildings housing retail stores, or his Village Commons at South Hadley, Mass., an even more blatantly picturesque cluster of evocative, old-style wooden retail buildings.
It's hard not to like these buildings: they are gracious, welcoming, friendly, and full of the traditional spirit of a New England town. Compared to the city-destroying malls out on the highway, projects like Graham Gund's represent all the right values. But it's equally hard not to think of all of this as a bit too easy, a bit too right - a bit too much like Disneyland. Like Robert A. M. Stern, whose shingle-style houses, eclectic academic buildings and commercial structures have made him at this point probably the American master of evocative architecture, Mr. Gund is smart enough to know how to mix his details well, and include a modicum of eccentricity to make the whole place feel a little more real and a little less pat. But it is still lite architecture however you cut it: the built world's equivalent of easy-listening music.
I keep coming back to Disney, not to disparage this work but to place it in its proper category. The Walt Disney Company is perhaps our most brilliant packager of architectural experience today, creating remarkable environments that, like Mr. Gund's town squares and Mr. Stern's houses and hotels, evoke the aura of a comfortable, idyllic world. We wallow in Disney architecture; it is often more satisfying than the real thing that inspired it. But part of the satisfaction comes from knowing that it's all a game, an amusing frolic through a vast architectural folly. Walt Disney World and Disneyland have to be lite architecture: if they were not, the whole spirit of these places would evaporate. Buildings like Mr. Stern's exuberant casting center for Disney in Orlando, half cartoon, half Venetian palazzo, make perfect sense.
But real life isn't the same as the world inside Disney's gates. It demands to be more - well, real. That doesn't mean its architecture has to be harsh or shrill, and it doesn't mean it has to be inaccessible to the average person who uses it. This is not an argument against using historical styles, or against making buildings inviting and friendly. But there is a point, hard to pin down but very real, at which architecture can become so soft, so inviting, so intensely eager to be liked that it comes off as cute more than anything else, and loses a sense of credibility in the real world. To be picturesque is one thing; to be cuddly is quite another.
The landscape these days is full of things that cross the line from the picturesque to the cute, as architecture everywhere becomes more and more like Disney's. (The Walt Disney Company itself has become a major architectural patron, hiring architects like Michael Graves and Robert Stern to do its buildings - a program that has succeeded not only because Disney has reached out to the world of architecture but because the world of architecture had been becoming so much more Disney-like anyway.) And thus we have instant classical office buildings with pasted-on pediments, mirror-glass Gothic, and Georgian houses in the suburbs masquerading as major architectural statements that are little different, in the end, from the builders' colonials that are still mass-produced all over the place. It's the glibness of it all that is so disturbing, and the implicit belief underlying it that our age has no greater mission than to get a quick fix from the past. There's always been plenty of facile historicism in ordinary roadside architecture, but never has architecture with serious ambitions been so close in spirit to it.
 
Sweetness That Passes for Profundity
 What's the answer to all this? It's worth remembering that the best architecture produced today - the work of architects like Robert Venturi, Frank Gehry and James Stirling, to name but three - follows no precise models. It is consistently energetic visually, but it is also consistently challenging; Mr. Venturi in particular has evolved an approach that accepts the thinness and lightness that are endemic to our age, and uses them brilliantly as the basis for ironic and often profound architectural gestures. But all these architects, when they use historical form, do so inventively, and almost never descend to the sentimental. That, I think, is the problem with lite architecture - like the music on a lite-FM station, it appeals mainly to sentiment. It is less Mozart than Henry Mancini, oozing sweetness that passes for profundity. Not every building can or should be a challenging foreground object, of course, and fitting into an existing urban fabric can be a noble goal for a work of architecture. But lite architecture doesn't even give us a very satisfying background, for the very reason that it can often be glib, even cloying. It isn't the truly discreet background architecture that we need, since it's too eager to have us love it. Lite architecture may pretend to neutrality, but it's a disingenuous act: this is architecture that wants to leap to the foreground.
It's obvious that we're not going to turn back the clock so far as technology is concerned: once we can slice stone like salami, economics will never again permit us to think of it as a slab 10 inches thick. We will have to accommodate to a new sense of what integrity of this material means. Similarly, Fiberglas is not going to go away, and we are going to see more and more traditional details crafted in it. As the 19th century accommodated itself to the shocking idea of classical columns made out of cast iron, so will we have to integrate certain technological developments into our basic architectural perceptions.
The cast-iron buildings, of course, turned out to be among the architectural triumphs of the 19th century. They created a powerful new urban landscape that still holds sway over us today. Will we be able to do as well with the technology of today? We are struggling toward a light architecture - but so far, what we have mainly produced is its sentimental sibling, lite architecture.

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:

Dealing With the Deficit - Sort Of
 
If the suit doesn't fit, why lose weight when you can let out the pants instead? Budget negotiators appear likely to loosen the Gramm-Rudman deficit strictures and disregard the cost of the savings-and-loan bailout. They agreed on Thursday that cutting the budget more than $60 billion would risk a recession. But White House and Congressional leaders quarreled over just how wide a budget gap they have to close. James R. Jones, the American Stock Exchange chairman and former House Budget Committee chairman, says that despite all the posturing, Democratic lawmakers and a Republican President can compromise on taxes and spending as readily as they did in 1982. With a presidential election in 1992, he warns, ''If they don't put together a major package this year, they probably won't be able to until 1993.'' 
 
 
Those Crazy Inflation Figures
 
Last Wednesday's inflation report caused more joy on Wall Street than in Washington. Consumer prices in April rose just two-tenths of 1 percent, after rising at an 8.5 percent annual rate for the first three months. The April results, said Albert T. Sommers, a senior fellow at The Conference Board, ''correct a misappraisal of the inflation condition that arose from those crazy figures during the first quarter.'' Traders said they had already bid bonds up in anticipation of favorable news. But the Federal Reserve Board entered the financial markets on Thursday to signal that it is not about to ease credit, and a board member said the Fed's policies have been unchanged for six months.
 
 
Trade Worsens, Markets Shrug
 
United States exports set a record in March, but imports went higher still. The result was an $8.4 billion trade deficit, up $2.3 billion from February. March exports reached $33.3 billion even though aircraft shipments, a strong category of late, were lower. News of higher trade deficits used to convulse the financial markets, but no longer. Economists had expected a better report, but they noticed that the March figure was still an improvement over the trend last year. Said Richard S. Peterson, chief economist at Continental Bank, ''Overall, we're doing pretty well.''
 
 
Give Me Your Poor
 
Nathan Glazer said last week that, in ''Beyond the Melting Pot,'' he and Daniel P. Moynihan failed 30 years ago to anticipate a new wave of American immigration. The latest figures from the United Nations Population Fund suggest that immigration from poorer nations is likely to intensify. Last week, the agency raised its growth projections, estimating the world's population at 5.3 billion now, with 6.25 billion expected by the end of the century and more than 10 billion in 2025. And while the numbers in wealthier nations level off, poorer nations will expand to 80 percent of the world's people in the year 2000 - causing more residents of these nations to leave. Said Nafis Sadik, the report's author and the fund's executive director, ''The push from the southern countries to the northern countries will increase dramatically.''
 
 
In Brief
 
A bill drafted by the House Commerce Committee - and said to reflect the wishes of its chairman, John D. Dingell - would weaken local cable television monopolies and allow the Government to limit rates.
 
 
Another Leveraged van Gogh
 
Another van Gogh, another auction record, and maybe this time the painting won't have to be repossessed. Van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' was sold for $82.5 million at Christie's last Tuesday, reportedly to a Japanese paper executive, Ryoei Saito. The last record, $53.9 million for van Gogh's ''Irises,'' in 1987, was set when Sotheby's agreed to provide 50 percent financing for Alan Bond of Australia. When Mr. Bond failed to come up with enough cash, the painting had to be resold. Mr. Saito told a Japanese newspaper that he, too, needed to borrow. No wonder, because on Thursday he bought a Renoir for $78.1 million. But his loan is secured by more than the paintings, probably because the lender is a bank. The problem with leveraged buyouts of paintings is, you can't sell off pieces to pay debts.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
German Unification: Who Pays?
 
A dowry of $70 billion will help pay for German matrimony. West Germany agreed last week to raise this much to rebuild East Germany's economy. On Friday, the two nations signed a treaty to form a single economic entity on July 2. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has hinted that the first all-German elections could take place Dec. 2. West German leaders say that selling bonds and raising equal amounts from the federal and state governments will avert the need for higher taxes. Nonsense, say Mr. Kohl's opponents, who accuse him of understating costs and hiding a tax plan. Charles Gati, a professor at Union College, told American business leaders at a symposium last week that East Germany will achieve an ''economic miracle,'' but ''whether West Germany can afford this is another question,'' he said. ''I'm very bullish on East Germany and very bearish on West Germany.''
 
 
Soviet Foot Is Inside the Door
 
The Soviet Union has won a trial membership in the international capitalist club. On Wednesday, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreed to grant the Soviet Union observer status. The Soviets can attend meetings, but not vote or enjoy reduced tariffs on their exports. For them to achieve full membership, they need to get the hang of free trade and open markets. It might take years, says Herbert S. Levine, a Soviet specialist at the University of Pennsylvania. But the Soviets seem willing to wait. They have been lobbying to enter GATT and the International Monetary Fund since 1986 - even before a faltering economy made their case more desperate. ''When they started talking about involvement in I.M.F., they would have been a lender,'' Prof. Levine said. ''Now they would probably qualify as a borrower.''
 
 
 
CONPANIES
 
Chips Ahoy
 
The technology to make the world's most sophisticated computer chips will remain under United States ownership. The Perkin-Elmer Corporation announced on Tuesday that it was selling its chip-making machine division to the Silicon Valley Group. Perkin-Elmer had held talks with the Nikon Corporation, raising fears that the United States would depend on Japan for equipment to make advanced semiconductors. The International Business Machines Corporation, the division's major customer, orchestrated the sale.
 
 
Debt Traps
 
Circle K crashes, Charter Medicalloses altitude. Analysts say both companies owe many of their woes to the craze for restructuring and debt. Circle K filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday. Acquisitions financed by ''junk bonds'' made it the nation's second-largest chain of convenience stores. Management tried to increase profits amid growing competition by raising prices and hoping customers wouldn't notice. The junk bond prices went in the opposite direction, to less than 20 cents on the dollar last week.
 
*
 
The Charter Medical Corporation lost $53.7 million in the first quarter, causing some analysts to ask whether it could keep paying its debts. The company, which runs psychiatric hospitals, went private in a leveraged buyout in 1988.
 
 
Dressing Up a Stock
 
Playboy Enterprises Inc. wants men with an eye for women to buy its magazines, not necessarily its shares. The company said last week that the nude form of Willy Rey, the February 1971 Playmate, will no longer appear on its stock certificates. Of Playboy's 28,000 stockholders, 14,000 had bought just one share. ''We were spending about $100,000 annually servicing those shareholders,'' said Terri Tomcisin, the manager of corporate communications. The company plans to cash all the single-share owners out. In a recapitalization plan, other investors will be issued new certificates with a female figure - clothed - that looks more statue-like than statuesque.
 
 
Car Campaign Gets Real
 
Nissan called it ''building up brand awareness.'' Madison Avenue called it a spaced-out joke. The ''Nature'' campaign for Nissan's Infiniti luxury cars has ended, with rocks and waves and buds finally being replaced by advertisements that feature cars. Not to worry about the Zen-like quiet and tranquility in the showrooms, say executives of the Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc. advertising agency. Toyota's rival Lexus might be selling many more cars, but Infiniti, they say, has penetrated more deeply into consumer consciousness.
 
 
Philips Meets Japan
 
American companies aren't the only ones rattled by competition from the Japanese. Cornelis J. van der Klugt was forced out as chairman of Philips N.V. on Monday, about two weeks after the company announced a 97.3 drop in operating earnings for the first quarter. Mr. van der Klugt, who had predicted earnings would rise, has said that his company has trouble matching Japan's labor costs. Analysts say that the Dutch company also has been slower than the Japanese to transform its inventions - the videocassette recorder, the compact disc - into popular consumer products. Mr. van der Klugt is being replaced by Jan D. Timmer, the director of the consumer-electronics division and a respected cost-cutter.
 
 
In Brief
The Pan Am Shuttle is for sale. The Pan Am Corporation plans to sell the shuttle and some German operations to help compensate for continuing losses.
 
*
 
S. Parker Gilbert announced his retirement as chairman of Morgan Stanley & Company on Thursday. He led the firm through Wall Street's boom in the 1980's while avoiding the industry's recent bust. He has picked Richard B. Fisher, the company's president, to succeed him.

Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is considering whether to revive the Lehman Brothers name for its investment banking business. The company would keep the Shearson name for its brokerage.

Poland's 'Big Bang': Too Much Too Fast?

BYLINE: By JEFF MADRICK; Jeff Madrick, a correspondent for NBC Television, recently returned from Poland.

 BODY:
I have just returned from Poland where I met with many of its leading economists and politicians. From the vantage point of the United States, it may look like that country's commitment to a quick transition to a market economy, which some call the ''big bang,'' is universal. But my discussion with economists and politicans in Warsaw, revealed that some Polish leaders think the pendulum has swung too far too fast.
While there are sharp divisions among the economic and political leadership of Poland, their backgrounds and training are remarkably similar.
Poland has a long tradition of academic dissent and Warsaw University professors have long provided the impetus behind the partial reforms that began in Poland as far back as 1956. This tradition still holds. Virtually every high-level official in the Government holds a doctoral degree in economics from either Warsaw University's economics department or its School of Planning and Statistics. The latter was the academic home of one of Europe's most prominent economists, Michael Kalecki, Eastern Europe's equivalent of John Maynard Keynes: an ardent critic of capitalism and a supporter of government planning. 
There are few precedents for making the transition from a planned economy to a market economy. But some economists say the course which the Government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Leszek Balcerowicz, the Minister of Finance, have been pursuing is too harsh.
As a result of the program put into place by Mr. Balcerowicz in the first three months of this year, Poland's industrial production sank a stunning 30 percent from the previous year's levels. Incomes after inflation are down even more and unemployment, once unheard of, is rising rapidly.
''This kind of shock therapy has typically only worked under authoritarian governments,'' said Andras Blaho, a United Nations specialist on Poland.''
The pain, members of the new Government told me, is the price that must be paid for transforming Poland's economy into a market economy.
In the face of a tenfold increase in prices, the 43-year-old Mr. Balcerowicz, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, slashed the budget deficit, clamped down on money and credit, set prices almost completely free to float to market levels, restricted wages and sharply devalued the Polish currency, the zloty. Why the abrupt policy? ''I know of no example of any country in the world that stopped hyperinflation gradually,'' he said.
Because of these harsh measures, the leadership in Warsaw and the Polish people are asking two questions: Will sweeping free-market reforms work? And more important, how long will they take?
Mr. Balcerowicz long ago departed from the Kalecki tradition of economics at Warsaw University. As an academic, he was able to speak out in favor of a market economy even when the Communists ruled in Warsaw.
''Professors like Balcerowicz could talk about a free market in the classroom, in discussion groups, at conferences, quite openly, as long as it was all hypothetical,'' said Andrzej Wroblewski, a Balcerowicz supporter and editor of Gazeta Bankowa, a leading financial publication in Warsaw.
Academic dissent remains as strong as ever, however, and Mr. Balcerowicz has many vocal critics inside Poland, even among supporters of free markets. Grzegorz Kolodko is the head of the Finance Institute, a Polish think tank, and he says Mr. Balcerowicz's claim that the new measures were necessary to combat hyperinflation were an exaggeration. ''What hyperinflation? We only had hyperinflation for a few months,'' he says. ''Israel and Vietnam had it for years.''
Zdzislaw Sadowski, president of the Polish Economic Society, an influential professional association, and Ryszard Bugaj, a member of Solidarity, the Polish trade union movement, and head of the budget committee in Parliament, worry that the severity of the economic program will only make matters worse later on. ''The Government promised too much,'' said Mr. Bugaj. ''Inflation could come back even stronger,'' said Mr. Sadowski.
Mr. Balcerowicz's critics trace his conversion to the big-bang to the influence of the Harvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs, who advised the Bolivian Government to apply a similar all-or-nothing solution and later became a key adviser to Solidarity.
Mr. Sachs predicted that if the Polish experiment fails, free markets are in danger throughout Eastern Europe.
''Some Government economists have fallen too much under the influence of Western economists,'' said Mr. Sadowski, who was once a deputy prime minister and is now the leader of the older economic guard.
Mr. Balcerowicz's critics see in him the dangers of a romantic ideologue, and in the program merely a highly fashionable equal-and-opposite reaction to what preceded it.
Many of the economists I talked with believe the greatest gift the Government could have given the Polish people would have been to learn patience. It is necessary, they say, for the Polish people to understand that economic reform will take time.
The following people are Poland's leading economic thinkers.
 
Leszek Balcerowicz
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Mr. Balcerowicz, 43, received his doctorate from the Central School of Planning and Statistics in Warsaw and an M.B.A. from St. John's University in Queens, New York. Long a proponent of free markets as a Warsaw University professor, Mr. Balcerowicz is the chief architect of Poland's stringent new economic program. He is considered by many an extremist whose main priority is the control of inflation, and whose economic heroes include the monetarist economist Milton Friedman and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Some of his critics think this is a sign of his naivete. But Mr. Balcerowicz insists his is the only practical way to move towards serious reforms. His current concern is that the Polish Government will make concessions too quickly, end the restrictions on wages and Government spending and create another round of hyperinflation. He says there are signs this spring that the Polish economy is stabilizing, and he believes the level of pain is exaggerated. In a society that once had shortages, a fall in real income is not a fair measure of consumer welfare, he says.
Mr. Balcerowicz's current posts are his first formal positions in government; he has been active in past reform movements. He maintains his philosophy is self-taught, but he is a close associate of Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard. Although he was not the first choice of Mr. Mazowiecki, he now enjoys the Prime Minister's support. Most believe Mr. Balcerowicz has no more than an additional six months to turn the economy back toward growth. He has made one concession to critics, adopting what Westerners call an industrial policy. He has recently set up two agencies to help corporations ''with good prospects'' avoid bankruptcy caused by current tight credit policies. Some think this will inevitably pave the path towards considerable government intervention. For Mr. Balcerowicz, the next big step is to manage the privatization of industry.
 
Wladyslaw Baka
President of the National Bank of Poland
The National Bank of Poland is the country's central bank, and Mr. Baka, 53, is its president. He is a former member of the Politburo with a doctorate from Warsaw University in economics. A participant in economic reforms throughout the 1980's who once lost a Government post for his outspokenness, Mr. Baka is a strong proponent of the new reforms, though not as extreme as Mr. Balcerowicz. ''I have passed from the middle,'' he said about his position on reform, ''to somewhere between the middle and the extreme.'' He said the German Bundesbank's strong anti-inflationary policies are now the model for Poland's central bank.
Mr. Baka says his principal objective is to defend the currency. It is a goal with which Mr. Balcerowicz agrees. Mr. Baka also insists it is important to maintain ''real positive interest rates,'' another key part of Mr. Balcerowicz's reforms.
Mr. Baka is working to develop a banking infrastructure suitable for foreign investors. The lack of such a structure at the present time is a frequent complaint among foreign investors otherwise interested in Poland. He believes strongly in Government support for companies on the verge of bankruptcy. He does not believe the Polish economic reforms can succeed without compromise on repaying Poland's onerous foreign debt. He notes that West Germany is the principal creditor, which adds a political dimension to the issue of debt reduction.
 
Zdzislaw Sadowski
President of the Polish Economic Society
Mr. Sadowski, 65, is head of the Polish Economic Society, a leading professional association where Mr. Balcerowicz once held a high post. Mr. Sadowski is a former deputy prime minister with a doctorate from the Central School of Planning and Statistics, where he worked with the economist Michael Kalecki.
Mr. Sadowski is a leader of the older guard who supports free markets but favors a far more gradual pace of reform. He thinks the Government will eventually compromise on wages and credit policies, and proposes that they do it sooner than later.
But Mr. Sadowski worries that the current measures are so punishing that inflation will come back stronger once these measures are lifted. His principal theoretical argument is that Poland has no free enterprise structure to fall back on and no experienced level of business management that knows how to adjust to market forces. Just because the currency is stabilized and the costs of business are reduced, he says, does not mean that business will be restored. ''We don't know what the floor is for the Polish economy,'' he said. ''Paul Volcker came here with a group, and he said of course you must go through a recession. That is very naive about our economy. We won't just bounce right back.'' Mr. Sadowski added: ''The economy cannot fall by 30 percent for the entire year; there will have to be changes.''
 
Ryszard Bugaj
Chairman of the Budget Committee of Parliament
A member of Solidarity, Mr. Bugaj, 45, is the head of the finance and budget committee in Parliament. He holds a doctorate from Warsaw University's economics department. Mr. Bugaj is the leading Parliamentary critic of the new economic reforms and favors a more gradual appoach to change.
He said the Government's promise that economic pain will be short-lived is too optimistic. He is concerned with the ultimate reaction of the Polish people to change if the reforms are not successful. However, he acknowledges that the reforms have produced two successes: the currency is now stable and people work harder.
''Worker productivity was a big problem in Poland,'' he said. He says he is not impressed by the cuts in interest rates and inflation so far, and contends they are still too high. He is an important figure in the debate on privatizing the economy. He says he believes the Polish people can learn to become entrepreneurs, but says the principal problem with privatization is the scarcity of capital. ''Who is going to buy the businesses?'' he asked. He is among Poland's most popular politicians, more for his intelligence and sincerity than for his oratory. His political speeches are generally considered dull.
 
Grzegorz Kolodko
Polish Finance Institute
At 40, Mr. Kolodko is Poland's young Turk. He is head of the Finance Institute, Poland's economic think tank. He has a doctorate from the Central School of Planning and Statistics in Warsaw.
Mr. Kolodko largely believes in the same free-market objectives as Mr. Balcerowicz. However, he says the program is moving too quickly and mistakes are being made. ''They raised interest rates for borrowers,'' he said angrily, ''but they did not raise rates nearly as much for savers.''
Mr. Kolodko does not subscribe to Mr. Balcerowicz's view that hyperinflation can only be stopped abruptly. He has visited Vietnam and Israel, where he says progress against soaring inflation has been made more gradually. He is also concerned that the Government's implicit promises have been too optimistic.
''Privatization will take years, not months,'' he said. He points out that similar reforms in Chile took nine years of strong measures, unequal distribution of income and the force of an autocratic government.
Mr. Kolodko is a critic of Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs, saying his success in Bolivia does not apply to Poland. ''In Bolivia the industrial sector is far less important than it is in Poland,'' he said. Mr. Sachs response is that he proposes different solutions for different economies, and he does not think Vietnam's reforms have been all that gradual.
 
Jerzy Osiatynski
Minister of the Central Office of Planning
A disciple of Michael Kalecki, Mr. Osiatynski, 46, is Minister of the Central Office of Planning. He worked toward a doctorate in economics at the Central School of Planning and Statistics but was deprived of his Ph.D. in a 1968 ''revisionist'' purge that some claim was also anti-Semitic.
Mr. Osiatynski is a proponent of the new economic principles of free markets and entrepreneurialism, but he believes the state's role will remain important; he is a stronger proponent of government intervention than Mr. Balcerowicz and is considered among the more traditional of the cabinet ministers concerning the role of government planning.
Mr Osiatynski is editor of the collected works of Michael Kalecki, to be published by Oxford University Press later this year.
''Kalecki's ideas about central planning were very progressive for his times,'' he said, ''but we no longer believe this. Now, entrepreneurs are the key.''
But Mr. Osiatynski does not think free markets are the complete answer. ''Labor was not regulated by completely free markets in Japan and it worked very well,'' he said. He favors privatization but also notes that private capital to purchase companies will be scarce ''Ninety percent of employment is still in the Government,'' he pointed out. He said some industries should remain in Government hands: ''the infrastructure, railway transportation, electric power and maybe some part of telecommunications should be controlled by Government.'' Unlike Mr. Bugaj, he believes changing the attitude of the people towards doing business will be difficult and is the key to success.
 
Marcin Swiecicki
Minister of Foreign Economic Relations
Another graduate of Warsaw University, with a Ph.D. in economics, Mr. Swiecicki, 42, is Minister of Foreign Economic Relations. He was a Fulbright scholar at Harvard where he studied market deregulation. He strongly believes in free markets.
Mr. Swiecicki is almost as strong a proponent of economic reforms as Mr. Balcerowicz, who also studied in the United States. He says he was strongly influenced by his studies here.
As the minister in charge of attracting foreign investment, he believes privatization is going too slowly. He contends American companies are waiting too long to invest in Poland, pointing out that there have been 1,200 joint ventures since 1988 - 500 with Germany and only 80 with the United States. Mr. Swiecicki also says foreign debt must be reduced and wants to see new debt reduction schemes.
''The debt was not wisely taken,'' he acknowledged. ''But nor was it wisely given.''
Mr. Swiecicki said even under Balcerowicz reform will not be as pure as Westerners hope: ''We have inherited a deeply rooted respect for social responsibility which we will not abandon.'' He would like to relax credit policies for Poland's companies more than the Government has.

HEADLINE: Rousing a Sleeping Industrial Giant

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: NAGOYA, Japan

 BODY:
Not long after he became president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries last year, Kentaro Aikawa took a tour of the company's sprawling aerospace works here. Mr. Aikawa spent most of his career as a shipbuilder and turbine engineer for the company in Nagasaki, so he was something of a stranger to the rows of F-15 fighters, Boeing 767 fuselages and Japanese rockets under construction. But he knew that while Mitsubishi's capabilities in aerospace are much feared in Washington, they are poor business in Japan.
Mr. Aikawa, according to accounts in the Japanese press, gathered the aerospace workers and told them they produced smaller profits per person than a ''mama-san,'' the legendary women who ply Japan's tired office workers with drinks and conversation at bars. Mr. Aikawa says the newspapers got it wrong.
''I told them that they make less than sweet-potato vendors on the street,'' he said recently in his office in Tokyo. ''If they earned as much as a mama-san, I'd be quite happy.'' 
It is still an open question whether Mr. Aikawa will succeed in shaking the Nagoya works out of its post-World War II sleepiness - and with it the rest of a 120-year-old company that is the centerpiece of the Mitsubishi empire, Japan's largest corporate group.
 
Deals and Compromises
 But if the Nagoya works is still having trouble generating profits for Mitsubishi, it has had no trouble engendering political controversy. After 45 years of postwar obscurity, it has over the last 18 months become Washington's symbol - some say its nightmare - of Japan's industrial ambitions for the 1990's, particularly in aerospace. Whether or not those fears are well-founded, the Nagoya works has been the central stage for a series of international political compromises, deals and rumored deals - among them the FSX project, a new relationship with the Boeing Corporation, a potential one with Daimler-Benz A.G. of West Germany and a curious new effort in space.
Indeed, enough Americans have become jittery about Mitsubishi that Mr. Aikawa feels the need to play down the company's recent stirrings. ''We harbor this dream'' to build big planes, he says, but it is only a dream, and a distant one at that. ''There will never be the day when the Japanese aircraft industry will catch up with the American aircraft industry.''
''Maybe so,'' said a ranking Republican senator on a recent visit. ''But 20 years ago, Toyota would have said it could never catch up to G.M.''
While the 62-year-old Mr. Aikawa will likely be measured from abroad by how well he navigates Mitsubishi Heavy out of this growing vortex of tensions between the United States and Japan, the job he is facing in Tokyo is even more complex. For reasons that have as much to do with Japanese politics as with business, Mitsubishi remains one of the Western allies' most inefficient producers of arms and aircraft.
Mr. Aikawa's job is to fix that, while pushing Mitsubishi into new and far more profitable businesses. He has already done it once, at the company's enormous shipyard in Nagasaki. The most visible sign of his success there will make its maiden voyage next month: the Crystal Harmony, Japan's first giant luxury liner.
But these days, Mr. Aikawa spends as much time mollifying the Americans as engineering the company's economic revival. Mitsubishi's political troubles started with the FSX, what should have been a run-of-the-mill joint effort with the United States to develop a next-generation jet fighter for Japan's Air Self-Defense Forces. The Japanese fighter, based on the F-16 built by the General Dynamics Corporation, quickly sparked a bitter battle in Congress last year.
At issue was whether the United States was naive in continuing to put its military alliance with Japan ahead of commercial concerns - and specifically whether the FSX would teach Japan the basic skills needed to assault America's commanding position in commercial aviation. The deal was narrowly approved, but only after six months of debate that surprised Tokyo by revealing a deep American distrust of Japan.
The FSX proved only the beginning. Over the past few months the same fears arose again - twice. The first surrounded Japanese participation in Boeing's yet-to-be-developed 777, what may be one of the biggest efforts of the 90's to produce a new commercial aircraft. Early on, Boeing hoped that Japan - meaning Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Fuji Heavy Industries - would invest heavily in the project, financing up to 25 percent of the $4 billion project. That would have been a major step up from subcontractor status; for 10 years Mitsubishi has been building the rear fuselage of the 767.
 
Glorified Subcontractor
 The prospect of giving Japan an inside view of how the 777 is created and marketed, however, was the source of ''a lot of back-channel phone calls from Washington,'' said one American Government official involved. In the end, Japan took a role as a glorified subcontractor, building 20 percent of the plane but gaining less of a voice and inside look at the development process it coveted. Mitsubishi says that it is happy with the arrangement; Boeing says the Japanese balked at the $1 billion price tag.
Just as the Boeing deal was under negotiation, rumors began to circulate about an alliance between Mitsubishi Heavy and Daimler-Benz, the auto and aerospace conglomerate.
The rumors hardly came out of the blue: at a meeting in Singapore held in secret earlier this year and revealed a few weeks later, the heads of several Mitsubishi companies and the hard-driving leadership of Daimler agreed to explore a variety of joint ventures and technology-sharing arrangements. So far, there is no formal deal, and there may never be one, but the rumors involve everything from aircraft to gas turbines. Again there are political objections, particularly because the prospect of a German-Japanese alliance sets many in Washington on edge.
Mr. Aikawa has been trying to smooth the waters. ''Our meeting with Daimler might have seemed provocative,'' he said. ''But our American friends should watch it calmly.''
And then there is space. Mitsubishi Heavy makes Japan's biggest rockets, but until now its only customer has been the Government. Now, it is helping to organize a consortium of companies that will try to sell launch services using Japan's next-generation rocket, the H-II, due out in 1993. Though the companies deny they are trying to compete with France's Ariane or similar services in the United States, the Soviet Union and China, that seems inevitable.
If all this has made Mitsubishi seem fearsome in the United States, it is a different story back home.
Not long ago, Yotaro Iida, Mr. Aikawa's predecessor and now the company's chairman, complained that Mitsubishi Heavy is still regarded as a ''fifth-rate company,'' something it decidedly was not when he and Mr. Aikawa started toiling in the hulls of half-completed warships during World War II.
In part, Mitsubishi suffers by comparison with its brethren companies in the Mitsubishi Group and with its own history. Once Japan's biggest industrial enterprise, Mitsubishi Heavy has been surpassed - financially and technologically - by glitzier, faster-growing companies. Mitsubishi Motors, which spun out from Mitsubishi Heavy 20 years ago, is now bigger than its parent.
Moreover, Mitsubishi Heavy's near-monopoly status as arms-maker to the Japanese Government is also its burden. Ever since the Meiji Emperor began industrializing Japan in the late 1800's, Mitsubishi Heavy has been a national resource. As a result, it has often been under the Government's thumb. Today it is Japan's most important arms contractor - even though military aircraft, ships and tanks represent only 15 to 20 percent of its revenues. But the Government business yields tiny profits, in the neighborhood of 3 percent.
''I have been a good child, and obedient,'' says Mr. Iida. ''I never talk back. If the Government says, 'Build this, carry out this R.&D.,' I simply say, 'Thank you very much.' ''
Government officials say Mr. Iida is unduly modest about his influence - Mitsubishi's ties to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are enormously strong, and the company plays a larger role in Japanese defense strategy than its executives care to admit.
In any event, under Mr. Aikawa the company is beginning a drive to diversify its businesses into high-growth areas where the Government has little interest - air-conditioning systems, refrigeration, printing presses, industrial machinery, snow blowers, even pleasure boats and sports stadiums. Mitsubishi's leadership has set a goal of raising sales by 40 to 50 percent by the end of 1993, from about $15 billion now.
In most of the new targeted areas, ''competition in Japan is very keen,'' conceded Koichi Danno, a board member and one of Mr. Aikawa's key aides. For the first time, Mitsubishi Heavy will have to face off against giant electronics companies like Matsushita. ''We have to better them with innovation,'' said Mr. Danno. The company is coy about its exact plans, however.
But in Nagasaki, one gets a glimpse of how the company has managed to turn itself around in businesses other than arms and aerospace. After the war, it learned the turbine business from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, where Mr. Iida spent three years. He calls Westinghouse ''my mentor,'' but today Westinghouse is often turning to Mitsubishi for turbine technology.
 
Shipbuilding Pays Off
 What has revived Mitsubishi's profits, however, is shipbuilding - a business that seemed dead since the early 70's. Faced with Korean competition, Mr. Aikawa slashed costs to get Mitsubishi back into the tanker and transport business.
But Mitsubishi's World War II history still haunts its effort to get its aerospace business back into shape.
Not long after Mitsubishi began building knockoffs of Ford's early cars in the 20's, it learned enough about engines and aerodynamics to become Asia's biggest aircraft manufacturer. In the two decades ending with Japan's surrender in 1945, 18,000 planes rolled out of the factory here, including the famous Zero.
But since the war, Mitsubishi has only produced 1,232 fixed-wing planes and that explains many of its problems today.
Under Japan's ''peace principles,'' companies are forbidden to export weapons systems, including military aircraft. As a result, planes come out of Nagoya these days at a trickle, often one or two a month. Almost all, like the F-15 and F-4 fighters that Japan uses to defend its shores, have been built under license from American companies. Because of the small volumes, they cost 30 to 100 percent more than building them in the United States. Like many countries, Japan pays that price because it wants to produce its own weapons.
The FSX debate shifted the focus from whether Japan should make its own military aircraft to how that expertise might bolster its efforts to produce commercial planes.
The Congressional argument against the FSX was that Mitsubishi engineers would learn the art of ''system integration'' for aircraft - and quickly transfer the skill to civilian projects. They would not have to walk far to do so. On the shop floor in Nagoya, the FSX assembly room is under construction only steps from where parts are assembled for the Boeing 767.
But building small fighter planes, Mitsubishi says, has nothing to do with learning how to build big commercial jets.
''Some people say it is just too late for us to be a major manufacturer'' of commercial aircraft, said Takaaki Yamada, the head of Mitsubishi's aerospace ventures. ''The only way is to join hands with the strongest player, Boeing, and to take charge of certain parts of the aircraft.''
As a result, Mr. Yamada says, Mitsubishi must survive as a parts maker or ''in the small commercial aircraft area, where Boeing pays no attention at all.'' So for the next few years, Mitsubishi is likely to be a partner - watching and learning, as it did in turbines.
But Mr. Iida, the chairman, says Mitsubishi is nothing for Americans to worry about. ''In Japan, to show respect to a mentor, you should stay seven steps behind and never step on shadows,'' he said. ''So I make sure I am seven or 10 steps behind, and never step on the United States.''
Mitsubishi likely will not be a major aerospace threat to the United States for the next decade, maybe two. But it will stay seven steps behind only as long as the American aircraft industry remains on the technological forefront. Otherwise, the Americans are bound to hear Japan's footsteps, both as a partner and a competitor, get louder.

THE TIES THAT BIND IN JAPAN
On the second Friday of every month, a parade of limousines pulls up in front of a nondescript building in downtown Tokyo, and one by one the leaders of the main companies of the Mitsubishi Group emerge for a lunch.
That lunch, a long tradition, is only one of the many ties that bind Japan's largest keiretsu, or business group. Technically, the links between the keiretsu members are often a bit remote: some Mitsubishi companies hold minority stakes in other Mitsubishi companies, and they occasionally share board members.
But as is often the case in Japan, the relationship is far more important than the formality. At a Mitsubishi party, you will be served only Kirin beer - the brewery is part of the group - and the official photographer uses cameras made by Nikon, also a member.
It is those ironclad, intragroup deals that Americans claim are Japan's biggest remaining trade barrier. Such arrangements also exclude many Japanese companies and Japan has just now reluctantly agreed to collect data on intragroup transactions.
The Mitsubishi Group's history is inextricably entwined with the history of modern Japan. Its first president, Yataro Iwasaki, was an aggressive samurai who started a shipping business in the 1870's.
In the 1890's, the company bought 80 acres of land that is now most of downtown Tokyo, much of it belonging to Mitsubishi Real Estate, which last year bought a controlling interest in Rockefeller Center. By the time World War II broke out, the Mitsubishi empire embraced steel, oil, chemicals, a trading company and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and more. But after the war, Gen. Douglas MacArthur forced the Iwasaki family out of management and broke up the central control of the Mitsubishi headquarters.
For much of the postwar period, the group's businesses grew slowly. But in recent years that has changed dramatically, and the Mitsubishi Group has overtaken Japan's three other giant keiretsu: Mitsui, Sumitomo and Fuyo. Companies are still splitting apart - as Mitsubishi Motors did from Mitsubishi Heavy - or merging when their businesses sour, as Mitsubishi Mining and Cement and Mitsubishi Metal announced last month.
 
 
 
TURBINES TO POLITICS
Kentaro Aikawa discovered his calling in the same place he discovered his wife: inside the hull of a warship in the midst of World War II.
Mr. Aikawa was born in Nagasaki, and he, his wife, Haruko, and most other students in the city were pressed into service as the Allies began to close in. It was his first taste of the giant Nagasaki Shipyard and Machinery Works. Starting in the early 1950's, he spent his career there, until he became president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in June 1989.
Like his predecessor, Yotaro Iida, Mr. Aikawa comes from Mitsubishi Heavy's traditional discipline: both men are steam-turbine engineers. Mr. Aikawa later turned to geothermal power plants, and today Mitsubishi uses technology he helped develop to draw power from volcanic rumblings.
But in Nagasaki, Mr. Aikawa gained a reputation as a cost-cutter, and it was his success there that brought him to Tokyo. His aides say there is no question that he brings a new emphasis on the bottom line. ''He wants to make this a first-class company again,'' said Koichi Danno, a senior executive, and that means ''he wants to make money.''
What Mr. Aikawa lacks, as do many Japanese businessmen, is much international political experience, and confesses that is increasingly what his job requires.

HEADLINE: Teetering on the High Wire in Brazil

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
Two months after taking office, President Fernando Collor de Mello is fast approaching the moment of truth for his plan to integrate Brazil into the world economy.
At stake is a radical economic blueprint to end hyperinflation, remove barriers to imports and encourage foreign investment. Among other things, the plan would open Latin America's largest economy to private ownership in highway construction, telephone service and electric power generation, sectors that are now tightly controlled by the state.
Two crucial elements of the plan will soon come into play. By June 18, Brazil's ministers are to submit plans to cut payrolls by 20 to 25 percent - a total cut of up to 400,000 state workers. And by August, Mr. Collor, a staunch free-marketeer, is to start a quick-march privatization that is designed to put two-thirds of Brazil's 190 state companies into investor hands by 1995. 
The goal is to attack the root cause of Brazil's chronic inflation - a Government deficit papered over during the 1980's by printing money. By trimming administrative costs and selling off companies - and by raising taxes and cracking down on tax cheats - Mr. Collor hopes to convert Brazil's 1989 budget deficit of $28 billion into a 1990 surplus of $7 billion.
A lot is on the line, not only for domestic companies but also for Americans and other foreigners who do business here - or hope to.
''If they get 70 to 80 percent of it right, Brazil is going to be a fabulous place for private investment in the 1990's,'' said J. Dolph Johnson, an American executive-search consultant in Sao Paulo who has worked in Brazil for 20 years. ''If they blow it, it's going to be a disaster.''
An American banker in Sao Paulo agreed. ''The tension level is quite high,'' said the banker, who asked not to be identified. ''Either Collor will be able to reduce the public sector, or you will see Brazil dragged into an Argentina-type situation,'' in which inflation surges once more.
Whatever its ultimate fate, the Collor program began with a paradox: in the name of a free-market revolution, Brazil experienced the greatest state intervention in decades when the Government sought to stop inflation literally overnight by freezing most of the money in circulation. For those doing business here, that set off a period of chaos that they are only now emerging from.
The ''shock therapy'' started on March 16, a day after the 40-year-old Mr. Collor was inaugurated as Brazil's first freely elected President in three decades. On that day, the Government froze for 18 months roughly 80 percent of savings and money market funds - about $90 billion - including the cash balances of businesses. It also imposed across-the-board wage and price controls.
And, to push its program to sell off state-owned companies, it announced that banks, insurers and pension plans would be required to buy ''privatization certificates'' that would be used to purchase shares in state companies. Last week, the Government issued guidelines under which banks would be forced to buy certificates equal to 3 percent of their circulating assets. The figure for insurance companies is 10 percent and for pension plans between 15 and 25 percent.
''The great paradox is that to get to the free-market paradise, we have to go through the inferno of more intervention, more control and more bureaucracy,'' said Carlos Langoni, a financial consultant who was central bank president in the early 1980's.
Indeed, during the first two months of the Collor Administration, Brazilians have seen a lot of inferno and little paradise.
The sharp, unexpected liquidity freeze snapped this nation of 140 million people into the sharpest recession in a decade.
But the hard times have already begun to ease a bit. For example, in Sao Paulo, the nation's economic powerhouse, energy use is up and so are retail sales. Polls of business leaders indicate that the economy is recovering to a no-growth level.
The squeeze on money is at the heart of the economy's volatility. Liquidity was reduced March 16 from 40 percent of Brazil's $350 billion gross national product to 9 percent, according to Zelia Cardoso de Mello, the new economy minister. But today it is back up to 14 percent - partly through Government infusions to various sectors and partly through the knack that Brazilians have for knocking illegal loopholes in barriers.
By paying taxes and past bills, most large companies legally emptied their frozen accounts, which held the old currency, the cruzado novo. In addition, the Government says that about $480 million of blocked money was illegally converted into the new currency, the cruzeiro.
For the moment, at least, the Government is enjoying a budget surplus - largely due to a 50 percent increase in tax collection and a series of new, one-time taxes on ownership of stocks, gold and savings accounts.
Tax collection has also been spurred by a series of arrests on tax-evasion charges of prominent business executives in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The crackdown cut into Brazil's underground economy, estimated to be $100 billion a year.
The money squeeze, the wage and price freeze and the tax hikes allowed Mr. Collor to crow victory last month as Brazil's official monthly inflation rate plummeted to 3 percent, from 84 percent in March.
But Mr. Collor inherited massive governmental obligations from his predecessor, obligations that could greedily - and quickly - devour the new tax collections.
''It's a two-month surplus - April and May,'' Roberto Campos, a Congressman and former Government minister, said in an interview here. ''If spending is not cut and the deficit comes back, everything goes down the drain.''
To shrink the state sector, Mr. Collor is relying on pruning the Government work force and selling state companies.
But Brazil's civil servants are tenacious about holding on to their jobs, a tenacity enshrined in the country's 1988 Constitution, which gives job security to Federal employees after five years.
The major cut in the Federal payroll for 1.6 million workers will probably come through privatization. By the end of the year, officials hope to earn $7 billion through the sale of four steel companies, one petrochemical company and one bus manufacturer.
To spur the sales, Brazil's foreign creditors will be allowed to convert their debt holdings into privatization certificates. Brazil's foreign debt is $115 billion, the largest in the third world. Foreigners will be limited to purchasing 40 percent of a company's voting capital.
''They could make this the world's fastest privatization,'' said Mr. Campos, the Congressman, referring to the desire of many foreign creditors to convert Brazil debt into equity.
But skeptics note that in Argentina, the Government that came to power last July also promised widespread privatization. It will probably celebrate its first anniversary with only two sales, both of television stations.
In Brazil, as in Argentina, the left is expected to mobilize a nationalist campaign against privatization and civil service layoffs.
If Mr. Collor succeeds in curbing the deficit and hence inflation it would give him the political power to continue with the long-term goal of opening Brazil to more foreign investment and imports.
Sending up a signal flare to Brazil's highly protected industry, Mr. Collor this month abolished a list of 1,500 banned import items - ranging from cars to ceiling fans. High import duties, up to 105 percent, were immediately placed on the items, to cushion the shock for domestic competitors. But in June, officials plan to announce a three-year schedule for gradually reducing the duties. Brazilian supermarket and department-store chains have already sent buyers to the United States, Europe and Asia to look for high-quality consumer goods.
On two trade issues of long-term concern to Washington, the new Government has said it wants to negotiate a gradual recognition of pharmaceutical patents and a gradual opening to computer imports.
Encouraged by the moves, Carla Hills, the United States Trade Representative, removed Brazil this month from a list of countries facing retaliatory tariffs for protectionism. Mrs. Hills is to visit Brazil in June.
Support for Brazil's new direction has also come from the nation's multilateral creditors. A team from the International Monetary Fund is to come here next month to start negotiations that could lead to a reduction of Brazil's service load on its debt.
But everything depends on the deficit, experts agree. ''Either Collor does away with the deficit or the deficit does away with his plan,'' Antonio Delfim Netto, a Congressman, recently told a newspaper here. ''Everything else is 'economese.' ''
 
 
 
A NEW LOOK AT THE MINISTRY
 
BRASILIA
The top-floor, corner office of what is now the Economy Ministry has typically been occupied by a balding bureaucrat in a business suit.
In a change of gender and of generation, Brazil's top economic official is now Zelia Cardoso de Mello, a 36-year-old economist known simply as Zelia.
Miss Mello is scheduled to arrive tomorrow in Washington to meet with American bankers in preliminary talks over restructuring Brazil's foreign debt.
No relation to the country's new President, Fernando Collor de Mello, Miss Mello has emerged from a cabinet restructuring as the most powerful economic official in Brazilian history, at least on paper.
As economy minister, she oversees the former ministries of Finance, Industry and Commerce, the Central Bank, the Government Savings Bank, the National Bank for Economic and Social Development and the secretariats of Planning and Treasury.
With her most recent Government experience as a mid-level Treasury analyst, some critics here say that Miss Mello lacks the background to manage such an enormous bureaucratic empire. Criticism increased last week as the new Government reversed itself on the latest of a series of economic decrees that opponents have called unconstitutional.
On her way to a doctorate in economics at the University of Sao Paulo, Miss Mello briefly passed through the ranks of the Brazilian Communist Party. More recently, she has embraced the free-market economics espoused by Mr. Collor.
Asked in an interview in her office here why she wants to privatize more state companies in five years than Margaret Thatcher has privatized in 11, Miss Mello replied: ''Mrs. Thatcher did not have the urgency we have.''

HEADLINE: The Minority Community's Shopping-Mall Hard Sell

BYLINE: By GREG KRIKORIAN; Greg Krikorian, who has been a freelance writer, recently joined the staff of The Los Angeles Times.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
For some time now, business has been bleak at the Radiance Boutique. And it's starting to wear on owner Ruby Golden, who for 18 years made a good living in the competitive world of retailing. ''I'm not doing well at all. I hate you to print that. But it's the truth,'' Ms. Golden said. ''And I'm not doing well because there aren't enough stores here.''
Here is the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, an 800,000-square-foot mall in southwest Los Angeles that is finding, like many retail centers in minority communities, that the hardest sell is to retailers. Indeed, from Los Angeles to New York, Atlanta to Chicago, retail centers in predominantly minority communities are often struggling more than they think they should to attract tenants.
''A lot of big retailers are being squeezed right now. But a lot of them also don't see minority communities as having buying power, which is totally fallacious,'' said Alan L. Carsrud, a visiting economics professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''A good hunk of it is racist and a good hunk of it is perception. And the irritating thing is that it is totally wrong.'' Experts in the field warn as well that retailers' wariness of locating in minority neighborhoods poses a problem for the entire retail industry as well as ethnic communities. 
''We can no longer shut our eyes to these emerging ethnic groups. Each market has to be weighed on its own merits. But it hurts me to think we might be color blind to opportunities,'' said Jody Martin, vice president of marketing for Stillerman Jones & Company, an Indianapolis-based consulting firm for shopping-center developers and retailers. ''We just have to open our eyes and realize that if retailing is in trouble, maybe we need to look at new markets.''
Indeed, minority shoppers already account for 20 percent of the nation's sales at regional shopping centers even though most of the centers are still located in the suburbs, inconvenient to the inner-cities, according to Stillerman Jones, which has surveyed some 40,000 shoppers nationwide. The firm's research also indicates that that blacks are America's most frequent shoppers, Hispanic people the biggest spenders - that is, they spend the most per shopper per excursion - and Asians the most affluent. Combined, these three minority groups were found to represent a purchasing power of more than $400 billion annually, with blacks accounting for half that amount.
So the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw center - whose $120 million renovation was completed little more than a year ago - might be expected to draw like a magnet. There are more than 1.1 million residents, predominantly black, in a five-mile radius, with an average family income of $38,522. Yet only half the center's 100 shop sites are open, and it has been unable to lure major national retailers to serve as anchor stores. Now the joint developers, the Alexander Haagen Company and the city of Los Angeles, are ready to spend another $5.5 million to attract tenants by helping with their construction costs.
''Many retailers just say they're not interested,'' said Andrew J. Natker, project developer for the Alexander Haagen, Southern California's largest shopping-center developer. ''Either they're afraid of the community, which they shouldn't be, or there's something else going on. I just don't know.'' He said the center has talked to more than 650 national chains and smaller stores but has commitments from only 60. Among those who have declined, he said, are the Nordstrom, Bullock's and Robinson's department stores, and The Brown Group, a St. Louis chain with 4,000 stores and 20 subsidiaries, and the U.S. Shoe Corporation, with 807 stores under 15 different names including Casual Corner and Lens Crafters. Such specialty stores as Oshman's Sporting Goods Inc., See's Candy Shops Inc., The Pottery Barn East Inc., Crabtree & Evelyn, and The Walt Disney Company stores have similarly resisted, said Mr. Natker, who described the standard response as: ''No thanks. It's not our market.''
Tim Doke, Nordstrom's public-relations consultant, said its decision against locating in Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza was driven by economics. ''We have stores in Oakland and other cities with large minority populations. So obviously Nordstrom's decision on Baldwin Hills had nothing to do with race. It was purely a business decision,'' Mr. Doke said. His statement generally reflected the comments or views of the other major retailers, who stayed out.
Sears, Roebuck & Co. did move in, after closing down another outlet a few miles away; and the May Company and Broadway Hardware Inc., which moved in before the renovation, have remained. But the center says these companies are not enough to anchor a mall.
At the Greenbriar Mall, outside Atlanta, which two years ago completed a $20 million renovation, the experience with retailers was similar. John Gerdes, its general manager, said, ''We've been trying for several years to attract a third anchor store. But we just haven't had any success. If this was a predominantly white community, we'd be turning people away every day for leasing space.'' The mall is in an area where the average income is $32,555, 15 percent above the average for Atlanta. ''A few years ago, if you had asked me about the problem, I would have been a lot less direct because it's a sensitive matter,'' Mr. Gerdes said, ''but having been here since the renovation and having tried to make various retail deals, I don't pull too many punches anymore. There are just a lot of retailers who are not doing business in this community for the wrong reasons.''
''It's a frustrating problem,'' said Charlotte Ellis, a vice-president of the Lehndorff Group of Dallas, which owns Greenbriar. ''Frankly, I thought we'd fought this battle for equity in minority communities a long time ago. But it's still a battle,'' she said.
Not all centers in minority communities are struggling. In fact, the Haagen firm has developed three smaller malls in Los Angeles, one in predominantly black Watts, that are doing well. It proves ''you can do business in the inner city,'' said Robert O'Neill, editor-in-chief of Monitor, an industry magazine. And the first phase of Chicago's Grand Boulevard Plaza, a 200,000-square-foot center across from the Robert Taylor Homes housing project, has been highly successful, according to Mike Harris, sales manager for the center, owned by the Matanky Realty Group: ''We have some major national tenants, some local businesses and we're over 85 percent leased for some time now.'' But if the center were a low-income white area, he said, retailers would make their decisions ''a lot quicker and easier - the prejudice is still real.''
In an environment of modest real growth, ''many chains are looking for reasons not to locate in new areas. The screening process is much greater today than it was 15 or 20 years ago,'' said Allan D. Kotin of Kotin, Regan and Mouchly, real-estate consultants. And the changing nature of neighborhoods unsettles retailers. ''The perception of transition is a perception of uncertainty and independent of any racial stereotypes, transition means change. So there is a real concern that racial shifts are a harbinger of economic decline,'' he said.
Such concern appears to have frightened away retailers, even in areas that soon thereafter proved their worth. Bruce D. Phillips, head of research for the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, which functions as an in-house lobbyist for small businesses, said that Washington, D.C.'s Georgetown - today one of the nation's most fashionable retail addresses - once had severe problems in securing businesses. ''Most people don't realize that it was a very economically distressed area some years ago and if a retailer was asked to open a business there, they might well have said 'no.' So the timing may not be right for retailers when they look at an area and try to decide if it fits into their marketing strategy. They may want to wait a little longer in the cycle,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''Is that de facto discrimination? Or it is not seeing enough of a market?''
There is concern, too, about city crime. Harriet Zocks, a marketing consultant, said, ''The hesitancy is in what we face in any city environment: There is the fear of more crime, and because retailing is in tough times, the risk of going to a center may be magnified by the general fears of the city environment.'' To arrest those fears, many inner-city centers have put a premium on security. ''One thing what's unique about our center is that it was built with the secure mall concept,'' said Mr. Harris of Grand Boulevard. The Chicago center's security measures range from its basic design, with only two entrances and wrought-iron fencing, to its staffing by officers who patrol and monitor its parking lot from a tower staffed around the clock. High-profile security has also been a mainstay of Haagen's centers in Los Angeles.
Notwithstanding the complications, inner cities clearly have new appeal to some business people. Bernard J. Rosenshein, who believes his $100 million Concourse Plaza Shopping Center, opening next year, will bring new vitality and commerce to New York City's South Bronx, said: ''There are great opportunities in these areas because most of them are under-stored. Some retailers are astute enough to realize there is a market that has great potential. They understand and are not frightened away from opportunity.''
Then there are other retailers who over time have adjusted their businesses to the changing demographics of big cities. ''When you look at inner-city markets, people are intimidated by the environment. But because we have always been in inner-city markets, we have learned how to grow and we are still making money,'' said Bob Lynn, president of F.W. Woolworth Company. With about 450 of Woolworth's 1,000 stores located in predominantly minority neighborhoods, Mr. Lynn said experience has shown that they hold their own against outlets situated in more suburban settings. ''The rest of the retailing world is fighting it out in the suburbs and has neglected, to some degree, these inner-city markets. Yet we do a tremendous business,'' Mr. Lynn said. Are other retail chains ignoring opportunities? ''Yes, and I hope they keep missing the boat.''
 
THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE
Despite the problems, there does seem to be opportunity for retailers in inner-city shopping centers - at the right place and at the right time.
That is suggested by Alexander Haagen's development or rebuilding of three modest-size shopping centers in inner-city neighborhoods of Los Angeles.
A decade ago, Mr. Haagen realized that residents who lived near such centers were traveling elsewhere to shop, and he saw potential in one that had long been neglected. In a joint venture with a city-formed nonprofit corporation, he set out to upgrade it and recapture its customers.
Today, the Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center - the first of three such centers rebuilt by the Alexander Haagen Company in cooperation with the city and county of Los Angeles - is flourishing. ''Unbelievable business,'' says Andrew J. Natker of the Haagen firm. ''In excess of $300 per square foot in sales.'' The mall has succeeded because, to borrow one of Mr. Haagen's favorite expressions, it provides area residents with ''equal shopping opportunities.''
Similarly, the Martin Luther King Jr. Center in Watts, a project whose profits now go to the city of Los Angeles, is highly profitable.
Finally, the Kenneth Hahn Plaza in Willowbrook is doing ''good, not fantastic'' business, Mr. Natker says. ''We opened a year too soon.''
But he adds that once a light-rail commuter line and a new freeway open nearby, ''that place will be solid gold.''

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Bracing for Tougher Times

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Once upon a time - more than 120 years ago - a small East Texas river town called Jefferson was thriving as steamships carried cotton and timber down the Red River to the Mississippi and thence to New Orleans. Then one day, the railroad magnate Jay Gould (no relation to this writer) came to Jefferson. He wanted to bring his railroad through town, but local leaders scoffed and Jay Gould took his railroad plans somewhere else. Not long afterward, the Red River around Jefferson became unnavigable and the once-booming town boomed no more.
Historians say this is not just a tall tale, although they can't confirm all the details. But when Thomas R. Powers, chairman of the Investment Company Institute's board of governors, told it at the industry's recent convention, it left an uneasy stillness in a room crowded with hundreds of fund executives. One man who has attended seven of these annual gatherings said he had never heard a speech that left the audience so quiet. 
Mr. Powers clearly wasn't the only one who saw this as an apocryphal tale about the industry's struggle to keep up with changing times. Such sobering fare is not the usual stuff of the industry's conventions. Sure, there was some of the back-slapping and self-congratulation so prevalent in earlier years. Yet for an industry that just broke the $1 trillion mark, the tone was oddly subdued. ''I'm not hearing a lot of 'atta-boys' this year,'' one executive said.
For some, the pessimism was subsumed in anger. ''The industry had better sit up and start paying attention,'' said Palomba Weingarten, chairman of the Los Angeles-based Pilgrim Group, who believes that most executives underestimate the competitive impact of banks, especially foreign ones.
There were plenty of other reasons for pinched faces. There has been a clear shift away from the easy money of the 1980's. The industry's explosive growth during the past decade cannot be sustained and its increasingly important role in financial markets makes it fair game for competitors and regulators alike. Funds will be forced to struggle just to keep the money they already manage. Clearly, boom times are over.
''Today's friendly competition will probably turn ugly,'' said Heidi S. Fiske, a New York City consultant on financial services and marketing, who was commissioned by the institute to look at industry conditions in the coming decade. A preview of her report, scheduled for release to institute members this summer, shows what's behind the industry's pessimism.
She forecasts industry growth as ''healthy but probably slower,'' with yearly growth in assets of about 12 percent, almost two-thirds less than the annual rate recorded during the 80's. There are two reasons for the slowdown: Funds will have to compete against each other, and they will begin to lose market share to banks and other outside competitors. The investment pie is expected to reach $3 trillion by the end of the decade, said Alfred P. Johnson, a mutual fund consultant based in McLean, Va. ''Demand will be there, but supply will be there in spades,'' he said.
As a result, fund executives will probably start viewing each other with a more jaundiced eye. At conventions in the past, they could afford to be generous, to swap stories and try to come up with new schemes to split an ever-expanding pool of investors' money.
But price wars are pushing down revenues. For example, two industry giants - Fidelity Investments and the Dreyfus Corporation - are in a battle for investor money, subsidizing expenses to raise yields but shaving profit margins. At the same time, fund expenses - for labor, technology and marketing - are rising. The industry's average expense ratio - funds' expenses as a percentage of average assets - has been up steadily since 1985, said Morningstar Inc., a Chicago mutual fund research firm.
And expenses are likely to rise even faster this decade. The market is saturated with new types of funds, and now fund groups are trying to grab market share with better service. But that will require large capital investments in computers and telecommunications. ''It's a tough act, and expensive, but there's a need for funds to differentiate themselves with service,'' said Brian S. Mattes, a spokesman for the Vanguard Group, a fund company based in Valley Forge, Pa.
The resulting margin squeeze is expected to shrink some fund group's profits badly by mid-decade. One likely consequence is industry consolidation. Smaller groups unable to compete on price or carve out a niche may fail. It is already more economical to buy existing funds than create new ones. There were 15 mergers last year and six so far this year, and in coming years, merging funds ''will be the thing to do,'' said Wayne S. Huff, a research associate with Charles E. Simon & Company, a Washington research firm.
The industry is clearly at a crossroads and the memory of Jefferson is fresh in the minds of fund executives. But one beneficiary of all the turmoil may be you: According to Mr. Johnson, investors are likely to reap the rewards of lower fees and charges as competition accelerates.
 
 
 
THE TOO-HIGH RETURNS
Traditionally, stock market investments return about 10 percent and bonds return about 7 percent. But the raging bull market of the 1980's knocked that standard out of kilter, and only recently have bonds moved back to their traditional levels.
Stocks have not followed suit. The accompanying chart shows just far stocks have to fall to return to levels that market analysts consider normal.
Right now, the return on stock funds is about 30 percent higher than the historic norm. Although bond fund returns were clearly higher than usual for the five-year period, they dropped to a more traditional level in the last year.
Market experts say investors who were spoiled by the fat gains in the stock market during the 1980's will have to adjust their expectations of gains in coming years. Indeed, they should expect returns to go back to the norm - that is, for the market to drop 30 percent. But nobody is willing to say when that could happen.

Ending the Week on an Up Note

 BODY:
It was an up week, but just a little, for the dollar. After falling against the Japanese yen in the beginning of the week, the dollar inched back Thursday and Friday. It also rose those two days against other major currencies, except for the British pound. It is not clear if the rally is just a correction after the sharp drop of the week before or rather the start of a new trend. But the overall outlook for the dollar is still bearish because of the expectation that interest rates in the United States will remain stable or even decline. Meanwhile, the British pound got its lift from new signals that the Conservative Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would move into the European Monetary System soon. Such a move would add some stability to the pound.

HEADLINE: Many Jobs Clean Up on the Environment

BYLINE: By Claudia H. Deutsch

 BODY:
Item: The Jefferson Group, a Washington, D.C.-based government affairs firm, is hiring for a new office that will focus on environmental and workplace safety. Why? ''Many companies will need help n understanding and meeting the new requirements,'' said Mark D. Cowan, Jefferson's chief executive.
Item: B. E. & K. Inc., a construction company in Birmingham, Ala., that specializes in building paper plants, is increasing its staff of environmental specialists by 25 percent. ''We need more process engineers who can work with recycled fiber, and we need more people who can analyze air and water quality,'' explained T. Michael Goodrich, B. E. & K.'s president. 
Item: Kimmins Environmental Service Corporation, a Tampa, Fla., company specializing in hazardous-waste cleanup, has seen its need for environmental experts quadruple. ''The number of jobs going out for bid is 20, 30, 40 times what it was 20 years ago,'' said Charles Baker, a Kimmins vice president.
These days, a good way to clean up on cash is to clean up the earth. The national preoccupation with restoring befouled air, water and soil to health is opening lucrative career doors for lawyers, entrepreneurs, engineers, professors - anyone who is conversant with environmental issues, or at least willing to learn.
There are not nearly enough of them to go around. ''At least four jobs come calling for every one available person,'' said William Alfred, a New York recruiter who specializes in environmental jobs. In university placement offices, the phones are ringing off the hook. ''I get several calls a week from employers looking for environmental engineers,'' said Richard G. Luthy, head of civil engineering at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh.
For now, the most heady demand is for engineers. Recent chemical engineering grads are, for the first time since the early 1970's, being offered higher starting salaries than computer engineers. Engineers with a few years of environmental experience can practically write their own tickets. And executives with both engineering and managerial experience are getting six-figure offers for jobs as corporate vice presidents in charge of environmental affairs.
But the environmental mania sweeping the nation has caught fire in other fields, too. These are boom times for packaging specialists who can reduce trash at the source, for compensation specialists who know how to link managers' bonuses to environmental compliance, for lobbyists and politicians who can persuade localities to accept a landfill in their area, for scientists of all kinds who can prevent pollution at the source.
''Imagine being the person who develops the plant that can protect itself against insects without needing an insecticide - that's the kind of challenge that attracts the best people,'' said Valentino Martinez, manager of professional staffing for the Monsanto Agricultural Company.
Environmental interest is running rampant at business schools too. Lester B. Lave, an economics professor at Carnegie-Mellon's Graduate School of Industrial Administration, says that more than half the school's students are taking his elective course in managing environmental risks. ''They recognize that today's managers have to understand environmental issues,'' he said, ''the same way that the managers of the 1940's had to understand labor relations.''
The business students are up against a problem their engineering colleagues are not, however: most of the high-paying jobs are with small environmental start-ups that will pay top dollar for technological help but see little need to bring in sophisticated business expertise.
''They could use M.B.A.'s in finance or marketing, but they are still resistant to hiring us,'' said Timothy Butler, a graduate student at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. James Beirne, Wharton's director of career development, hears that complaint a lot. ''The companies just haven't figured out how to use M.B.A.'s yet,'' he said, ''and it's a little frustrating for the students.''
Increasingly, business students are taking it upon themselves to ''sell the type of position we are looking for before we start selling ourselves,'' said Benjamin J. Lee, a graduate student at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
Mr. Lee got Kellogg's placement office to ask about 100 environmental-cleanup companies about their staffing needs. Kellogg students have been contacting the companies that responded, persuading them first that they need business expertise, then offering their services. Mr. Lee says that one company asked him to develop a sales plan and form a marketing group; another is looking for someone to deal with community boards and write sales presentations.
Mr. Lee and other business students are asking high salaries, but there is more going on than greed. ''The environment is both a good career opportunity and a chance to repair some of the damage that's been done,'' said Justin Rogers, a first-year graduate student at Kellogg.
In a sense, Mr. Rogers and many other students of the 1990's are sociological hybrids. They are a cross between the anti-establishment students of the 1960's, many of whom cared deeply about the environment but did not want to work within the system, and the ''me generation'' of the 1980's, which used the industrial establishment to foster their own materialistic goals.
''The students are excited about environmental careers, partly because they like to work for small firms, but just as much because they want to help,'' said Robert K. Weatherall, head of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Office of Career Services.
Of course, there is always the risk that environmentalism is a passing fad. When the Clean Air Act was first passed in 1970, followed by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act in 1972, environmentalists were certain that the nation's consciousness had been permanently raised. Yet environmentalism all but died away in the 1980's. Amid all the hoopla over the 20th anniversary of Earth Day this year, few people thought to mention that Earth Day's 10th anniversary had passed all but unnoticed.
''There is a history of boom and bust in environmental issues, and it remains to be seen whether solid waste or any other trendy issue will have the staying power to sustain careers,'' warned Lewis Erwin, a mechanical engineering professor at Northwestern.
Other specialists say there is a quantitative difference this time around. ''People finally realize that the threats will not go away,'' said Mr. Weatherall of M.I.T. ''Railroad cars carrying noxious chemicals will still get tipped over, oil tankers will leak, smokestacks will emit things. All these will make environmentalism, and the jobs it creates, a fact of modern industrial life.''

HEADLINE: THE JOB MARKET;
EASTERN EUROPE SEEKS THE SKILLED

BYLINE: By John Holusha

 BODY:
As a young girl in Detroit, Carolyn A. Kley often listened to her grandmother's tales of what life was like in Poland before she immigrated to America. This summer, Caroline, now a student at the University of Michigan School of Business Administration, is going to Poland to help its Government manage the difficult transition from a planned to a capitalist economy.
Ms. Kley is one of seven students at the business school who will spend this summer as interns at private and state-owned businesses in Poland, sharing some of the management techniques they have been taught and learning the customs and business realities of a country that has spent more than 40 years under Communism. ''These people know they are going to be dealing in a global economy and they hope the summer will help give them a global insight,'' said Edwin L. Miller, an associate dean at the school, which set up the internship program and is financing it for this summer. ''Some of them may even be thinking about setting up companies in Eastern Europe.''
Ms. Kley, who will spend the summer working with a computer software concern in Cracow, said the experience may well shape her career. ''I'm already set on a career in the international sphere,'' she said. ''This should be a fascinating experiment.'' 
The radical changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe in the last few years - the rise to power of Solidarity in Poland, perestroika in the Soviet Union and the displacement of Communist governments in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary and Romania - are providing career opportunities for people with energy, a sense of adventure and needed skills.
Last year, for instance, Michelle Siren was a consultant with Price Waterhouse's Washington office working with the World Bank. Today she is based in the firm's London office and travels regularly to East bloc countries to help transform state-owned enterprises into self-sustaining businesses.
''We are here because the market is heating up in the East,'' said Ms. Siren, who has an M.B.A. with a specialty in international marketing. ''We help commercialize enterprises that are not commercial now. And we advise clients on entry strategy.''
Eastern Europe represents a vast, largely untapped market for Western goods and expertise. The population of the region, including the Soviet Union, totals about 430 million, compared with 325 million in the European Community. There are drawbacks, such as outdated production facilities, unconvertible currencies and widespread pollution. But that has not stopped hundreds of American companies from setting up joint ventures.
Executive recruiters are chiefly looking for experienced people, generally in their late 40's or early 50's, whose children are grown and who can relocate without much difficulty. Most assignments will be temporary, they say, with Americans and West Europeans returning home as East bloc nationals learn Western business skills.
For younger people, internships, like the Michigan project, and less formal contacts can lead to opportunities. ''They should not be afraid of taking a flier and going there to visit during summer breaks,'' said Stuart Anderson, editor of Bloc magazine, which reports on economic developments in Eastern Europe. ''I know of one person who did that and now works for Citibank in Budapest.''
Said Ron Weber, president of Weber Executive Search, a management-recruiting concern in Huntington, L.I.: ''For the large multinationals, Eastern Europe is where the action is. There is a huge pent-up demand there for consumer goods.''
Mr. Weber said the skills most in demand were sales, marketing and distribution. Familiarity with operating procedures in countries still dominated by government bureaucracies is important as well. ''People who know Western consumerism and also know how to work with government agencies in these countries are really in demand,'' Mr. Weber said.
Since most of the Eastern countries have currencies that are worthless outside their own borders, demand often cannot be immediately translated into cash sales. To get paid, Western companies often have to construct elaborate barter or counter-trade arrangements in which they accept payment in goods that can be resold on world markets.
The best-known of these arrangements is the one in which Pepsico sells its soft drinks in the Soviet Union for rubles, then uses the rubles to purchase Stolichnaya vodka and tanker ships for resale in the West. ''It is an exciting time, but selling goods to people with no money is not fun,'' observed Jeffrey K. Smith, who represented the General Electric Company in Moscow and is now director of the center for Soviet management development at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. ''The real need is for people who can successfully put together deals,'' said Peter Schmidt, managing director of Boyden International Inc. ''They have to find markets for products that are relatively unsophisticated in nature.''
Language skills are critical, authorities on the region say, both as a means of communication and to help understand the cultural peculiarities of each country. Americans are often at a disadvantage in this regard, compared with Western Europeans, since most European executives are proficient in more than one tongue.
Rather than trying to learn all the languages of the region, many veterans of the East say it's smarter to learn German or Russian, which are the most common second languages in those countries. ''Russian may not be the language of choice these days in Eastern Europe, but when things get difficult my Russian usually gets me through,'' Ms. Siren said.
There may be other applications for the multilingual as well. ''The clearest opportunity is going to be teaching English as a second language,'' said Deborah Milenkovitch, director of the Institute on East Central Europe at Columbia University. The number of students seeking certification from the institute doubled in a year, she noted.
Following the multinational corporations and entrepreneurs to Eastern Europe are accountants, who have the daunting task of rearranging the books for enterprises that had no profit motive for four decades, and establishing a valuation for companies being converted to private ownership.
Bruce Edwards, head of Price Waterhouse's London office, said the number of people in the office his firm maintains in Budapest increased from 2 to 54 in a year and a half. He said most East bloc enterprises had good records on production, but that information on costs and revenues was scanty to nonexistent because profit was not an object. Indeed, Mr. Edwards said profit was an uncomfortable topic with some Eastern European managers, particularly older ones long immersed in Socialism. These misgivings sometimes slow the pace of deal-making. ''They have the notion that interest is wrong and that if someone makes a profit, someone else loses,'' he said.
Western investment in the East appears to be following a predictable pattern, according to Paul R. Ray Jr., the head of a management-recruiting firm based in Fort Worth, Tex., that bears his name. The first wave was in the tourist industry, with the Marriott hotel in Warsaw and the McDonald's fast-food restaurant in Moscow among the most prominent examples. But since both companies plan to staff these enterprises almost completely with nationals, opportunities for Westerners are limited.
Still largely in the negotiating stage are investments in advanced-technology fields like biotechnology, chemistry and scientific research, where Western companies will attempt to develop research that has been stalled in Eastern European laboratories. Another wave of investment, Mr. Ray said, will come as the Eastern countries attempt to improve their links to the rest of the world through better telecommunications and information-processing capability.
Further in the future are investments in heavy-manufacturing industries that are expected to seek to utilize the inexpensive and generally well-educated labor forces of Eastern Europe. ''We may see a demand for people with Detroit-type mass assembly skills, but that will wait until they are ready to export,'' Mr. Ray said. ''That may be 5 to 10 years away.'' The badly ravaged environment of the East, where much of the ground water is too polluted for industrial processes and air pollution is eating away at stone statues that lasted hundreds of years relatively unscathed, may provide other opportunities. Scott Stricoff, a vice president of Arthur D. Little, a consulting company in Cambridge, Mass., said more inquiries about environmental remediation were coming from the East. But he acknowledged that the feeble economies of the region would be hard pressed to pay cleanup costs.
''They are going to have to do something, because Western companies are reluctant to go in there unless these problems start getting solved,'' Mr. Stricoff said. ''So I think something will start in the next few years, but the pace of progress is uncertain.''

HEADLINE: Engineering Fields Fertile For the Rest of the Century

BYLINE: By Calvin Sims

 BODY:
Bolstered by mounting demands from industry and a national shortage of technical students, career opportunities for science and engineering graduates are making a strong comeback after recently experiencing a slump.
Only three years ago, demand for technical graduates had slowed considerably, as many high-technology industries like computers, electronics and autos, feeling the pressure of foreign competition, imposed hiring freezes to restructure their operations and increase productivity. Although engineering and computer science positions were available then, offers of employment were substantially lower than in previous years, and jobs were not so plentiful as they are expected to be in the 1990's.
The Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the number of employed engineers in the United States will reach 1.72 million by the year 2000, a 25 percent increase from the 1.38 million engineers employed in 1988. Demand will be strongest for electrical, industrial, mechanical, civil, petroleum and chemical engineers and computer scientists, as a bigger role in government and business is assumed by the environment, infrastructure, computers, telecommunications and manufacturing. 
Meanwhile, the number of students studying science and engineering is expected to decline as the college-age population shrinks. Meanwhile, competition for technical graduates should expand rapidly as financial-services companies and other sectors seek engineers and computer scientists to help utilize computer and communications technologies in managing their affairs.
''Short of a major depression or recession, there will be a plethora of jobs available throughout this decade for students who study math and science,'' said Betty Vetter, executive director of the Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C., financed by technology-oriented industries. ''Even if we hire every engineering graduate in the coming years, it is unlikely there will be enough technical talent to meet skyrocketing demand because there are so few students in the pipeline.''
The Census Bureau has projected a 25 percent decline in the college-age population, from which most new engineers and scientists are drawn, over the next 10 years. Between 1986 and 1989 the number of engineering graduates nationwide dropped 12 percent, to 68,824, and is expected to fall another 12 percent, to 60,500, by 1992.
To attract the shrinking number of technical graduates, companies are increasing starting salaries. The College Placement Council, an employment-research group that conducts a yearly survey of career placement offices at colleges and universities around the nation, reports that the average salary offer for petroleum engineering majors increased 10 percent in the last year, to $36,120. Average starting salaries for chemical engineering rose 6.8 percent, to $35,204; 5.1 percent, to $31,800, for chemical engineering, and 5.2 percent, to $32,083, for mechanical engineering.
Employment opportunities are expected to be even stronger for women and minority members, who are grossly underrepresented in the science and engineering fields. ''If you are a woman or member of a minority group, there is no better time to go into engineering,'' said Dr. George Campbell Jr., president of the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering. ''We can almost promise that you will find a job when you finish school.''
The council, a nonprofit group based in New York City and financed by industry, recently reported a 28.4 percent increase in the number of minority-group freshmen engineering students from 1986 to 1989.
Bell Laboratories, the research and development arm of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, plans to hire 500 to 600 new scientists and engineers this year. According to Jeannette Galvanek, Bell Labs' executive director of human resources, applicants should understand the changing telecommunications market. ''The prospects are extremely good for engineers and people who have a strong technology base and want to work in the business environment where there is an emphasis on quality,'' Ms. Galvanek said.
Elsewhere, Gary Dixon, a recent industrial-engineering graduate of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, now works as a marketing representative for the insurance branch of the International Business Machines Corporation in Hartford. Mr. Dixon, who hopes to become a corporate officer, said his engineering background ''has provided me with a strong basis for management and solving the customer's problems.''
Eleanor Baum, dean of engineering at Cooper Union, in New York City, described engineering as ''one of the few professions that after only four years of college allows people to solve real problems and move directly into the middle class in terms of salary.''
''The problem is that we in the profession have not done a good job of selling engineering to our young people,'' said Dean Baum. ''It's engineers who design solutions to our environmental problems, build new highways and develop new surgical equipment. I can't think of a more rewarding undertaking.''

HEADLINE: Good Grief, It's Glasgow!

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY; CRAIG R. WHITNEY is head of the London bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
GLASGOW, the 1990 European City of Culture, after such choices as Athens, Florence, Amsterdam, West Berlin and Paris? People who think of Glasgow as it was in the 1960's, a place of sooty slums and idle shipyards along the River Clyde, will shake their heads in disbelief.
''Auld Reekie'' still has plenty of problems, and looks a little ragged around the edges of the huge high-rise housing projects that replaced neighborhoods like the Gorbals after they were razed in the 1970's. But the city also has a gritty sense of community pride in triumphing over the odds, a splendid architectural heritage from its Victorian heyday, and some of the most distinctive art collections in all of Europe. ''Raw, rich, Glasgow,'' the German art critic Hermann Muthesius called it at the beginning of this century, a description still fully apposite now that it's ending.
Community spirit suffuses the distinctive sandstone ''tenement'' neighborhoods, now being restored and gentrified like the brownstones of Brooklyn, from the east end of the city, dominated by the medieval spire of St. Mungo's Cathedral, to the Victorian Gothic tower of Glasgow University in the west end. 
Glasgow is an acquired taste, perhaps, with all the character, complexity and pungency of fine single-malt Scotch whisky. It became a crowded industrial city in the 19th century, its tenements swelling to slums as Irish immigrants and descendants of Scottish Highlanders driven out of the mountains by savage English resettlement measures poured in. Politically and culturally, many people in Glasgow today still feel a sense of grievance, and not at all a part of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's free-enterprise take-it-if-you-can-get-it Britain. Glasgow votes for the Labor Party, or even (in the old shipbuilding neighborhood of Govan) for the Scottish Nationalist Party.
It's the kind of city where people take strangers asking for directions on the streets under their wing with friendly answers that often start with ''Well, dearie, you take the next right . . .''
This year the city authorities are determined to show that unlike Edinburgh, the other place 44 miles down the road with the annual three-week festival in August, Glasgow has one that never stops. The European Community underscored its confidence by designating the city as the 1990 European City of Culture. Fortuitously, the city on the Clyde has just become a particuarly convenient destination for Americans, since the British Government has given up its futile insistence on making trans-Atlantic flights to Scotland go through remote Prestwick Airport and now allows nonstop scheduled flights to Glasgow Airport, 15 minutes from the center of town, from Boston, Chicago and New York (beginning Aug. 3), with direct connections to other American cities in the south and midwest.
The summer season has been under way since this month, with the annual Mayfest for theater, dance and music. Besides what is permanently on show - and more of that in a minute - the special artistic attractions later this year include the Bolshoi Opera, which is coming to the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Center in August before it goes to the Edinburgh Festival, the first time it has ever visited Britain. The program keeps changing, but the latest is Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Mlada'' Aug. 3 to 6 and Tchaikovsky's '' Maid of Orleans'' Aug. 10 to 12. A new international concert hall will open Oct. 8, with a dazzling schedule that begins with the Scottish National Orchestra and continues with the Berlin Philharmonic (Oct. 9 and 10), the Bolshoi Symphony Orchestra (Oct. 12), the London Philharmonic (Oct. 30), the Leipziger Gewandhaus Orchestra with Kurt Masur conducting on Oct. 31 and Peter Donohoe and Alfred Brendel playing the Brahms piano concertos successively on Nov. 1 and 2.
Other guest orchestras, for which there has been no suitable concert hall since St. Andrews Halls burned down 27 years ago, include the Israel Philharmonic (Nov. 21) with Zubin Mehta and the Orchestre de Paris with Semyon Bychkov (Dec. 16). Tickets for all these and other major performances can be ordered in the United States through Show Line, 800-962-9246.
But you don't need to wait until August or October to feast on the arts in Glasgow, which is also home to the Scottish Ballet, the Scottish Orchestra, 17 museums, 25 art galleries and 9 theaters. Two classically Scots characters, Sir William Burrell and Charles Rennie Mackintosh, have seen to that.
What sort of character Sir William was can be deduced from the Burrell collection in Pollok Park on the southern outskirts of the city, in a stunning modern building displaying Egyptian, Greek and Roman pottery, medieval stained glass, oriental carpets and French Impressionist paintings, to name just a few of the categories of the many objets d'art he assembled. Sir William was a shipowner who got out of that business at the right time and then used his money to do what he enjoyed best, which was collecting art from around the world. With Scottish shrewdness and thrift, he got his money's worth.
BUT in 1944, when he decided to donate the collection to the people of Glasgow, the air was so thick with pollution that most of the pink sandstone of the city had turned pitch black - so black that 19th-century repairers of the cathedral used black stone to plug up holes. Sandblasting and cleaning the cathedral today would leave it looking as if it had polka dots. Seeking to prevent any such depredations to his collection, Sir William stipulated that the Burrell collection be displayed far away from all the corruption, not less than 16 miles from the center of Glasgow.
He died in 1958 and no suitable place was found to display it until 1967, when Anne Maxwell MacDonald donated her Pollok Estate, about five miles out of town, to the city. By that time, antipollution regulations had led to considerable progress in cleaning up the air, and the Burrell trustees altered the terms of the gift to allow it to be housed in the splendid museum building constructed for it by private, municipal and government donations on the Pollok grounds. The building opened in 1983 to critical and popular acclaim. This summer the open lawn that surrounds it is graced by a special exhibit of nine of Henry Moore's largest works, which you may want to visit as part of a picnic lunchafter you've paid homage to Sir William.
Solidarity between the rich and the poor seems to be typically Glaswegian. In the splendid Kelvingrove museum and art gallery closer to town, for example, is one of the finest collections of medieval armor in the world, assembled by R. L. Scott, a shipbuilder whose company was later absorbed by the famous John Brown works until it and the rest of the industry died in the 1980's. Scott, the museum tells us, loved armor but, as a man with a social conscience, more or less gave up collecting in the 1930's because he thought it unseemly to be spending money that way with so many shipyard workers out of work. He gave in to temptation only once after that, when a unique suit of 15th-century Italian field armor came on the market in 1938.
The ships of Scott's and Sir William Burrell's day live on today in the Glasgow Transport Museum, across Argyle Street from the Kelvingrove, in one of the world's greatest collections of scale models. Most of the actual vessels, from the Queen Mary to the battleship Howe, were built right here. The museum is also a paradise for steam locomotive buffs, antique automobile fanatics and even admirers of fine prams.
The other principal character who left his artistic imprint on Glasgow was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, not only a true eccentric but also a brilliant architect, artist and designer of furniture. He and his wife, Margaret Macdonald, together with her sister Frances and her husband Herbert Macnair created the Art Deco movement known as the Glasgow Style.
Examples of Mackintosh's work abound today. The Glasgow School of Art building, up the hill on Renfrew Street, still serves the purpose for which it was designed in 1896. The extraordinary wrought-iron window brackets, which both brace the huge studio windows and provide a place for window cleaners to put their ladders, are worth a visit all by themselves, but from the beginning of June to the end of August, the School of Art will also house an exhibition called ''Mackintosh in Context.''
If you want to find out more about Mackintosh and the rest of the ''Glasgow Boys,'' who included the painters E. A. Walton, James Guthrie, George Henry and E. A. Hornel, there are plenty of other places to go.
The best, after a stroll through the magnificent Victorian campus of Glasgow University (not to be confused with the modern high-rises of Strathclyde University at the other end of town, near the cathedral) is the Hunterian art gallery, where Mackintosh's three-story home at 78 Southpark Avenue, has been lovingly reconstructed as the Mackintosh Wing, fitted out with all the high-backed Chinese chairs, teardrop lamps and mirror cases and white-painted furniture that it had when he lived in it.
After you finish immersing yourself in Mackintosh's designs, go straight to the James McNeill Whistler room, with one of the world's most extensive collections of this eccentric American painter's work. The Glasgow Boys much admired Whistler, who spent most of the last part of his life working in a studio in Glasgow. Its contents were given by his wife's sister, Whistler's heir, Rosalind Birnie Philip, to the university when he died, and it is fascinating to imagine how perfectly his somber studies of Miss Birnie Philip, ''harmonies'' in various dark colors, would have fitted right into Mackintosh's Art Deco rooms if he had had the money to put them there. Whistler's mother isn't here, but she was the daughter of a McNeill from Scotland who emigrated to the United States in 1746.
Mackintosh's design for a House for an Art Lover, set to paper in 1901, will finally be realized in August in Bellahouston Park; the Kelvingrove also has a fine collection of Mackintosh furniture.
Kelvingrove Museum (which, like all of Glasgow's public museums, has no admission fees, but asks visitors to make donations), is host to the first half of a two-week festival of choral music that begins June 22 and moves on June 30 to Glasgow Cathedral.
THE museum, which has a magnificent central court with resonant acoustics, also has a 1901 three-manual, 46-stop pipe organ built by Lewis & Co. of Brixton, England, in absolutely mint condition after an extensive restoration.
A few years ago, after German bombardments and years of dirty air, it wasn't even playable. ''The organ sort of sums Glasgow up at the moment,'' said Robert C. Woosnam-Savage, curator of the arms collection, who looks after the musical instruments as a sideline.
The instrument in the cathedral, a splendid example of 13th-century Gothic architecture, is by the legendary 19th-century English builder Henry Willis; the choral works sung there in August by the Cappella Nova will feature all five masses of Robert Carver, the Scottish Renaissance composer. Other amusements include Glasgow's Glasgow, an exhibition in 22 brick-vaulted arches recently rediscovered beneath the Victorian splendor of Central Station, displaying thousands of objects associated with the city.
Like the massive and opulent Glasgow City Chambers on George Square, or the insurance companies and stock market buildings along Buchanan Street, the exhibition, with videos, films and live workshops and performances, will remind visitors how Glasgow was once the richest city in the world, the place where money was made and banked from the cotton and tobacco trade with the colonies in Asia and the New World.
Proud Glaswegians point out that their city, with its trading tradition, has always been more ''European'' than much of the rest of the British Isles. A visitor walking down Queen Street might also be pardoned for thinking that the pure vowels and guttural glottal-stops of the native speech sound more German or Dutch than English.
''The decline of shipbuilding on Clydeside was not the first economic crisis we've been through,'' said Eddie Friel, head of the Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and Convention Bureau. ''It was 1776,'' he said, ''when almost overnight after the American declaration of independence the tobacco trade collapsed. After that it was the textile industry that rose, and fell.''
What Glaswegians have to see them through is a tradition, culture and heritage that is also manifested in their commitment to education.
For a city that has often felt itself on the periphery of Europe, vulnerable to decisions taken far away, designation as the European City of Culture is a chance to remind the world that it has never lost sight of its better days, even in the worst of times.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Condos Surging As Resort Choice

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
RENTALS of resort condominium are booming. What is propelling them is the need of families with two or three children to economize on food by having some meals in and to get enough space while spending a week skiing or visiting Disney World. Anyone who has crowded a family with two children into a motel room needs no hard sell to know why renting a place with two rooms for sleeping, two baths, two television sets and a kitchen is a step forward.
Resort condominiums, which are concentrated in popular vacation areas like the Colorado Rockies, Hawaii, Florida and the Caribbean, cannot easily be defined. The individual units, which may be suites in a high-rise building, side-by-side units or cottages - known usually as ''villas'' - may be privately owned, usually as a second home, or may have several owners who use it at different times. Sometimes units are rented when they have not been sold yet. A central managing company operates and maintains the condominium, sometimes in conjunction with a convention center or a hotel. 
According to a survey made by John Dalton, a consultant to the travel industry, condo rental is growing faster than another hot vacation option, ship cruises. In 1988, 17 million people stayed in the 2.5 million resort condominiums in North America, compared with 3.1 million people who took cruises. In 1989, his figures showed, condo rentals rose 13 percent while the figures for cruising rose 5 percent.
Condominiums are used mainly by people who drive rather than fly. And United States Travel Data Center figures for 1988 show that 80 percent of leisure travelers moved on their own wheels, while 16 percent used planes.
Richard H. Fisher, head of a new network for travel agents, Condominium Travel Associates, says that 60 percent of the renters of condos are young families, who do not travel by plane because of the cost of individual tickets for children. The other big blocks of customers, Mr. Fisher says, are older travelers, extended families or couples traveling together, and golfers.
When you peruse catalogues and surveys, it is quickly apparent that the majority of resort condominiums include units with two bedrooms, providing a common room and privacy.
 
Saving on Breakfasts
Lower costs are as important as space. Mr. Dalton analyzed figures gathered by state tourism bureaus and found that the biggest portion of travelers' budgets went for food and that lodging costs were second. An equipped kitchen with a refrigerator for milk, juice, fruit and cereal eliminates the need for expensive breakfasts out. Other meals in are possible if the cooks in the family are agreeable.
You can presume that since this resort condominium is someone's home, it will be a place where you can be self-sustaining, as you cannot in a bed-and-breakfast or a motel. You may presume that there will be a kitchen, fully equipped and that parking comes with the rental. You will be told the name and number of someone to summon if things are not right, which may be a front desk clerk or a real estate agent several miles down the road. In the preponderance of two-bedroom units, there is a bath for each bedroom, but ask about this. Swimming pools are almost standard, and hot tubs are common.
A prospective renter should begin by asking the travel agent, real estate agent or managing company about the size and equipment of the facilities and what will be in the kitchen.
If you have children, you may be less interested in elegance than in durability. At Amelia Island in Florida, the beds were large and comfortable and the decoration ran to cabbage roses, but the china was neat stacks of Pyroceram.
Price is the good news. Catalogues and surveys indicate that you can get a condo suite for the price of a hotel room, or cheaper, in many popular areas, although obviously Florida is going to cost more in the winter, and Vail will be higher in ski season. Clinton Burr of Chicago, president of a group called Resort Property Owners Association, recently surveyed members who owned time-share condos. They were concentrated in the big resort condo areas, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii and Mexico. Answers from 1,123 owners showed that 32 percent of weekly rentals were in the $501 to $750 bracket and 27 percent in the $251 to $500 range. Weekly rental prices went as low as $100 (0.5 percent) and up to $1,300 (0.9 percent).
One organization, for example, Endless Vacation Travel (Post Office Box 80014, Indianapolis, Ind. 46280; 800-447-8004) is offering two-bedroom condos in Orlando for $806 a week to Sept. 7 and $662 to $806 Sept. 7 to mid-November.
The bad news seems to be heard from time-share condos: heavy sales pitches to the renting tenants to buy a time-share, or a unit. Mr. Burr, a lawyer, began to organize his owners' association after a sales person with a prospective buyer and a super-hard sell disrupted him and his family at the pool at the condo they own in Hawaii. Alan Coffin, president of Fair Winds Tours in Stoneham, Mass., says he will not offer condominium stays to his clients any more because of sales pressures. One client at a condo in the Orlando are was awakened at 7 A.M., he said, by a summons to a sales breakfast.
The best way to rent a condominium, most experts say, is to use a travel agent in your hometown where you have some leverage if things turn out to be not as you were led to believe, since you will probably pay in advance and thus you cannot use the threat of withholding payment.
 
Specialists and Directories
Mr. Fisher's organization, now a year old, is in touch with condo-specialist travel agents in 70 areas; names and numbers are available from Condominium Travel Associates, 2001 West Main Street, Suite 140, Stamford, Conn. 06902; 203-975-7714.
Mr. Burr and his wife, Ellen, have visited 2,000 condos in recent years and have published two regional guides in which they rate 500 of them. Mr. Burr, who formed his owners' association in 1987, acknowledges that their early ratings are more generous than they would be today; some ''highly recommended'' 8's, on a scale of 10, would be ''average'' 7's or ''adequate'' 6's. He estimates that of the 2,000 condos, 700 rank 6 or better.
''Resort Property Owners Association Travel Guide Southeast,'' published in 1989, rates 260 places. The guide to the Southwest, also 1989, rates 240. Either book is $12.95 from Resort Property Owners Association, 175 West Jackson Boulevard, Suite 1901, Chicago, Ill. 60604; 312-939-0141. Later this year Pequot Press will publish the Burrs' book rating 600 top places, ''Condo Critic.'' It will be in bookstores.
Pamela Lanier has compiled a directory of 2,000 vacation condominiums in the United States, including Hawaii, and the Caribbean. This paperback, ''Condo Vacations,'' is now in its second edition. She charges condominiums $125 for a full entry, which includes a promotional paragraph provided by the condo, along with price range, location, phone numbers and other data. Simple listings are free. Ms. Lanier says she drops places about which she receives complaints. The 1990 edition, distributed to bookstores by Ten Speed Press, Box 7123, Berkeley, Calif. 94707, costs $14.95.

HEADLINE: READ HIS LIPS: MORE TAXES

BYLINE: By Peter Kerr: Peter Kerr is chief of the New Jersey bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
OUTSIDERS FIRST SUSPECTED THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS AFOOT in Trenton, the sleepy capital on the bank of the Delaware River, several hours before Jim Florio took the oath of office as the 49th Governor of New Jersey.
His press office issued a 25-page plan for the Governor's first day, replete with details of each moment and movement, including the number of the state parking lot from which howitzers would fire a 19-gun salute.
''8:25 P.M. Photo Opportunity: Governor and Mrs. Florio to proceed to a designated table to stage right for an appetizer,'' the release promised. A reporter jokingly asked Florio's press secretary, Jon Shure, how long his boss planned to keep up such a frenetic and metronomically perfect schedule. ''Eight years,'' Shure replied. Seven days later, the Governor announced his plan to bring down automobile-insurance rates, a drastically pro-consumer move that would cost the insurance industry $1.4 billion over seven years. Then Florio assailed the Exxon Corporation as environmentally irresponsible, dismissed the powerful head of the State Police and endorsed a ban on assault rifles. Meanwhile, his band of policy experts, quickly dubbed Floriocrats, worked on plans to solve the state's health-care crisis, and debated how New Jersey could save the children of its inner cities. 
Florio explained his initiatives in a voice salted by the tough accent of a childhood in Brooklyn, where his father painted ships on the Red Hook waterfront. Florio is a former amateur boxer; his left cheekbone remains sunken from a punch. The whole tone of politics has been transformed from that of Florio's predecessor, an affable patrician named Thomas H. Kean.
''They call themselves 'the good hands people,' '' Florio said the day after the Allstate Insurance Company announced it would sue to block the new Governor's auto-insurance plan. ''The question is which part of our anatomy do they have their good hands around?''
It wasn't until Day 58 that it became clear what Jim Florio was up to: he was determined to pronounce the age of Ronald Reagan dead in New Jersey.
Faced with a yawning deficit, Florio declared in his first budget address that he planned to raise more than $2.6 billion in new taxes, including a doubling of income taxes for the state's most affluent residents; he would also cut more than a billion dollars in popular programs. Wall Street approved. Florio's fellow Democrats were stunned.
The Governor believed that the worst thing a Democrat could do at a time of budget deficit was act like a Reagan Republican, his aides explained. Florio argued that Trenton and Washington had grown flabby and muddleheaded over the last decade. They had eschewed sound public policy for communications-media politics. New Jersey was now receiving a dose of old-fashioned efficiency, administered by a lean, mean liberal. Florio's strategy, political experts say, is a high-risk experiment that assumes that the Governor will be able to explain why tax increases and service cuts are necessary. Unlike other governors in the Northeast, Florio did not wait until he was forced to raise taxes; he took the initiative and taxed and cut more than anyone had expected.
Because public-policy debates in Washington have been dominated for the last 18 months by George Bush's 1988 campaign pledge not to raise taxes, the Florio experiment is being watched particularly closely in Washington now that President Bush is finding it harder and harder to hold the line as the deficit rises. New Jersey is also being closely scrutinized by national Democratic leaders, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who attempted to delay higher taxes even as Wall Street was losing faith in New York's fiscal management. And Florio is being eyed by his former colleagues in Congress, who have long believed that Democrats caught advocating tax increases were doomed.
''What Jim Florio has done is set up a test case for the Democratic Party,'' said Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat from suburban Bergen County. ''For a decade, Democrats have been intimidated from offering substantive alternatives to the politics and rhetoric of Ronald Reagan. Now they are watching Jim Florio because he represents either the last defeat of a terrible decade, or our first success story in a new time when politics in America can be redefined.''
Already Florio's Democratic allies in the State Legislature are hearing howls about budget cuts from everyone from school-board activists to local arts groups. Republicans predict that Florio will soon be seen by voters as a stiff-necked ideologue, a Robespierre-like figure seeking purity of government at the expense of real people.
But Florio, who as a Congressman wrote the nation's ''superfund'' law to clean up toxic wastes, and who developed a passionate constituency among the blue-collar workers in Camden County, the very voters who were otherwise abandoning the Democratic Party for Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, says he senses that people in the 1990's are ready to accept temporary hardship if they believe they are getting good government in return.
''Reagan's choice between more government and less government is no longer the relevant question,'' Florio said. ''It is a now a choice between dumb government and smart government. ''
ON TUESDAYS at 8:15 A.M., JIM Florio gathers a half-dozen top Floriocrats into a cavernous paneled room, which Gov. Woodrow Wilson once used as his office. This morning, Florio's forehead is scrunched into wrinkles. His finger is pointed like a pistol. He is imitating the elderly man he met last night at a seder for Russian emigres.
''He's the uncle you've got in every family, lecturing everyone, telling everybody how you do it right,'' Florio says. ''And the kid's great. Seven years old, he's already reading from the Haggadah. Then he wants to talk a little public policy.''
The Floriocrats are laughing. This is the loose Florio, the man the public rarely sees. When not among friends, he can appear formal and rigid. But among his closest assistants, rational workaholics weighted with Ivy League degrees, his humor is breezy.
Florio rattles through disputes at agencies that his people are still trying to take control of. His aides describe the gathering storm: gun owners are irate; groups of the disabled plan a demonstration; Assembly Republicans have compared him to a dictator; Floyd Abrams, the New York constitutional lawyer hired by Allstate, filed suit in Federal District Court - demanding, in effect, that Florio refrain from acting like a tyrant. Florio is confident that the suit will go nowhere.
''There is a real good example of lawyer entrepreneurship,'' Florio says with a contemptuous chuckle.
A few minutes later, Florio enters his small corner study. The walls are adorned with a painting of Franklin D. Roosevelt; another, of a bald eagle, and two photographs of heavyweight fights.
''Ronald Reagan used the right rhetoric for the wrong policies,'' says Florio, who served nearly 15 years as a United States Representative before coming to Trenton. ''There is no such thing as a free lunch. But I sense there is now a tremendous desire out there to have somebody make some hard decisions.''
At first glance, New Jersey seems an unlikely place to launch an assault on the Reagan Revolution. During the 1980's, its economy blossomed, attracting high-technology industries and creating nearly 650,000 new jobs. Like Reagan, Kean used the press to instill confidence in a dispirited public and generate enormous popularity for himself. The scion of a wealthy family that traces its roots to the state's first Governor, Kean promoted New Jersey's strengths, from its shoreline to its tax advantages for businesses. Also like Reagan, Kean was re-elected by a landslide.
But there was a dark side to the Kean years. Along highways like Route 1, a once-bucolic road from New Brunswick to Trenton, the boom produced mile after mile of uncontrolled sprawl. At rush hours, traffic was choked. New Jersey ran out of space to dump its garbage. Automobile-insurance premiums rose to become among the highest in the nation, and local property taxes skyrocketed. In the state's aging cities, where 12 percent of the population lived, the economic boom never happened at all. Jersey City's HIV infection rate - RATE TK - rivals that of parts of Africa; Camden's children were the poorest of any city in the nation. Despite Reaganite rhetoric, the state's government doubled in size under Kean, and although the roaring suburban economy gave it surpluses of up to $1 billion during the boom years, New Jersey put little aside for lean years.
Critics charged that Governor Kean had waited for a public consensus to develop, and thus avoided making unpopular decisions. Often, they say, he let public policy wander and problems languish. ''Tom Kean was a wonderful communicator and a decent man,'' said Richard W. Roper, the director of the Program for New Jersey Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, at Princeton University. ''But regarding many of the state's most profound problems, he was not prepared to lead.''
Only hours after Jim Florio took office, on Jan. 16, he began to centralize the power that (Continued on Page 51) had been dispersed across a bureaucracy. Among the first of the heads to roll was that of Col. Clinton L. Pagano, the much-feared Superintendent of State Police, who had run an independent fiefdom for 14 years. Among his questionable priorities was a two-year undercover crusade against homosexuals in the men's room of the Vince Lombardi rest stop, on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Just as quickly, Florio acted on policies he had been studying for more than a decade. Florio's automobile-insurance proposal, based on months of hearings before a House subcommittee that he headed, concluded that insurance companies had taken advantage of New Jersey's no-fault insurance system.
Foremost in the Governor's plan was getting rid of the Joint Underwriting Association, a body that, under Kean, began in 1984 to insure high-risk drivers. The law permitted insurers to make money by selling J.U.A. policies, but they were not responsible for any losses of the association, nor of J.U.A.-insured drivers. The J.U.A. eventually insured half the state's drivers and paid out the majority of claims. As the insurer of poor drivers, it ran a deficit of more than $3.1 billion. To keep the association afloat, a car owner in New Jersey by last year was paying $222 per car each year just to keep the association afloat.
Florio made his explanation of the problem clear: the insurance companies pillaged the public, and it was time for them to pay the people back. The Governor's plan would impose taxes and assessments of $1.4 billion against insurance companies over seven years to pay off the association debt. Florio's strategy was to bring down the average premium in the state from $1,112 a year to about $860. It whipped through the Legislature and Florio signed it into law.
Spokesmen for the industry said Florio had made insurance companies scapegoats for a complex problem with no quick solutions. Taking an unusual legal tack, Floyd Abrams, the lawyer hired by Allstate, the largest insurer of automobiles in the state, asked the court in Newark not only to declare the new law unconstitutional but to issue an injunction to stop Florio from what Abrams describes as an attempt to intimidate Allstate.
''We need an injunction against him personally,'' Abrams said. ''Anyone who disagrees with him is morally tainted and worthy of punishment. He is, in short, treating this like a crusade.''
It was with the budget that Florio took his biggest political risks. By January, New Jersey's budget, like those of states throughout the Northeast, was falling into a tailspin. If no major changes were made in Kean's budget proposals, Florio aides said, the shortfall would reach into the billions.
Consequently, in the first year Florio's cuts would devastate school boards and gut programs in the environment, health care, education and just about every other field but welfare and prisons. Florio's cuts included programs he himself endorsed and they angered interest groups that support Democrats; it was necessary, his aides said, to show that he must first bring government under control before he can achieve any other goals. It put him in an unusual position for a Democrat: Florio could be accused of being heartless, but not of being a slave to special interests.
Together with a 1 percent rise in the sales tax, the Florio plan, with a bit of luck from the economy, could generate a sizable surplus by the end of his first term. Florio also proposed a legal cap on state spending and a rainy-day fund, to save surpluses and avoid crises in the future.
But his proposal went even further than balancing the budget; he proposed restructuring the tax system, one of the most ideologically charged subjects in New Jersey politics. His income-tax increase would raise $1.25 billion, with most of the burden falling on people making more than $100,000. And it would aid poor school districts and help lift the cost of welfare and social services from cities and counties.
Although Florio described his fiscal package as aid to the middle classes, others called it liberal social engineering. A Bergen Record reporter labeled him Robin Hood. Conservative economists and others predicted that raising the income tax would chase away corporate leaders and destroy the business climate with which Kean had lured companies and jobs from New York.
Already, daily demonstrations by groups protesting cuts have become the norm in front of the Trenton State House. The talk in shopping malls is about a strange new Governor and the taxes he has wrought. But as the Democratic-controlled Legislature faces a June 30 deadline to approve the new budget, most legislators are saying, at least for now, that they expect to follow Florio on a white-knuckled trip into an uncharted future.
JIM FLORIO SPENT HIS adult life preparing to become Governor of New Jersey. From his early years, people recall a drive in the man, a relentless and lonely struggle for self-perfection that even his friends find difficult to fathom. Often he took on people more powerful than himself. Perhaps his greatest strength, they say, was that he was not afraid to lose.
''I can't imagine anyone with more discipline or ability to concentrate on a goal,'' said a former aide and close friend, Joseph C. Salema. ''Some people find it a little inhuman. Those of us who like him find it inspiring.''
James Joseph Florio was born on Aug. 29, 1937, to parents who lived in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn. His father was the son of an emigre from Bari, Italy. His mother, a Protestant of Irish, Scottish and German descent, was the daughter of another shipyard worker, a master pipe fitter.
After World War II, work became scarce for the senior Florio. The Governor clearly recalls accompanying his father one day to find a job along the docks. Men stood in line as union officials walked by. Each man was desperate to be picked for a day's employment.
''People were trying to stick their chins out or their chests out to be noticed,'' Florio said. ''It was like a damn slave market. Nobody should have to be that dependent for their life and their livelihood.''
At age 12, Florio began to hold two jobs at a time, delivering The Brooklyn Eagle and kosher meat for Louis Balitsky, a nearby butcher. At times, his mother served oatmeal for dinner. He often spent Saturdays alone, reading, at the Brooklyn Public Library.
Florio dropped out of high school in his senior year, to join the Navy; he served as a weather specialist in Florida and Alaska.
As a boxer, after running up a string of knockouts as a light middleweight, one day he stepped into the ring with a Sea Bee who outweighed him by 16 pounds. Each blow he took broke something, Florio recalls. He staggered away with a broken jaw, a broken nose, a split lip and a crushed cheekbone. His mouth was wired shut for six weeks.
Florio earned his equivalency diploma in the Navy and, after his discharge, entered Trenton State College. After a half-ring of his alarm clock at 5:30 A.M., a former roommate recalls, he would slide out of bed, study until 7, then go to breakfast, a meal he rarely missed, because it was included in his room and board.
Florio won election as president of the student body, earned top grades, to become among the first Trenton State students to win a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to Columbia University. He married another top Trenton student, Maryanne Spaeth, who dropped out of college to give birth to their first son, Christopher, in 1961. In the following three years, they had a second son, Gregory, and a daughter, Catherine.
In 1963, Florio arrived in Camden with a pregnant wife, two babies, a beat-up station wagon and plans to run for public office. He worked as a laborer, a nightwatchman, a government clerk. While attending law school, he began his ascent in the Democratic Party, attracting attention as a highly efficient district leader who beefed up registration by knocking on doors with a small notebook in hand.
By the late 1960's, Florio was a practicing lawyer and president of the Camden Young Democrats. Val Raugas, a fellow student at Trenton State, recalls seeing Florio at a party in 1969 and hearing him say he wanted to be Governor.
Over the next 21 years, Florio ran in 15 races. In 1969, he was elected to the State Assembly. Three years later, he ran and nearly beat a conservative Republican incumbent Congressman, Representative John Hunt, even though the district included rural Republican towns and blue-collar suburbs filled with refugees from riot-torn Camden. Many of the Florio voters split the ticket that year, and voted for Richard Nixon against George McGovern.
Hunt was the first Republican to find that accusations of liberalism didn't shake voters' attraction to Florio. Hunt accused Florio of supporting ''the white flag sellout of our prisoners of war, legalization of marijuana, lawful prostitution, public drunkenness and sexual activities between persons of the same sex.'' But Florio spoke the language of blue-collar voters. He talked tough on crime. He addressed everyday concerns. And for many anxious ethnic voters, Florio personified the ideal of a young man who achieves success through hard work. In a 1974 rematch against Hunt, Florio won.
Camden County's new Congressman was the consummate retail politician. His district offices were known for excellent constituent services. Almost every moment Florio was not in Washington, he was in his district, appearing at veterans halls, senior centers, yard sales, wherever voters gathered.
''There was a running joke in Washington; if someone in the district needed a fourth for bridge, he would be there,'' said Daniel J. Dalton, a former aide who is now the State Senate majority leader. ''He was non-stop. He would get into the office at 7 A.M. He would leave at 7 at night, with a file under his arm. That was four days a week. On Friday afternoons, I'd take him to the train station. He had events in the district Friday night, all day Saturday, all day Sunday.''
Florio became enormously popular in the district, and after a failed race for the gubernatorial nomination in 1977, he led a slate of dissident Democrats in a challenge to the Democratic power structure, including the old-style urban machine of Camden. The Florio team won, establishing him as the dominant Democratic figure in Southern New Jersey.
Florio also broke from the Democratic establishment in 1978 by backing the senatorial candidacy of a former basketball star named Bill Bradley, against a candidate backed by the Democratic Governor, Brendan Byrne. Ever since then, the Bradley-Florio relationship has been like those with other politicians Florio respects: cordial, professional, but not close personally.
IN WASHINGTON, FLORIO had no time for the social swirl; he spent most evenings at home, in a spartan apartment over a liquor store, reading. Florio was known as a brilliant, hardworking, and not terribly warm master of policy. He was a bitter antagonist of the Reagan Administration. Many fellow Democrats were put off by his refusal to compromise.
Other Congressmen were unimpressed with Florio's public speaking style, which was as clear and moving as a guide to industrial software. One former campaign aide, Fred Hillmann, called it ''bureaucratese, no, fractured bureaucratese.''
''He tended to add words to sentences to make them more complicated, as if people who speak with lots of big words were smarter,'' a former administrative assistant, Bill Roberts, said. ''Maybe it was the lower-class kid's idea of what a Congressman should sound like. He never went to Ivy League schools, and showed trepidation around those people who did.''
The demeanor that Florio considered appropriate for the serious work of government, other Congressmen sometimes perceived as formal, almost robotic. His dress was meticulous. Photographers usually found him in a jacket and tie. Florio's public persona allowed little room for emotion, none for frivolity. But colleagues agreed that Florio excelled on issues. After two terms, he jumped over six Democrats with more seniority to gain chairmanship of a subcommittee on transportation and commerce. There he engineered deregulation of the railroad freight industry, successfully fighting a Reagan Administration proposal to have the Government sell off Conrail before it could reorganize into a more-profitable venture. Florio also fought to save funds for Amtrak and helped force the dismissal of the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Anne Gorsuch Burford, after charges of mismanagement of the superfund.
The Superfund Bill of 1980 was designed to shift the cost of cleaning up waste sites to polluters, and allowed the Federal Government and the states to charge polluters up to three times the cost of cleanups.
Almost all of the issues Florio took on over a decade and a half were also New Jersey issues. In addition to making laws, he was also preparing himself to be Governor. In 1981, many politicians expected Jim Florio to breeze to victory over his opponent, Tom Kean. But with too many stops on his campaign schedule, he often arrived late and left brusquely. On television, he appeared cold. Kean, meanwhile, campaigned with lackadaisical ease, charming the press and public alike with a folksy optimism. The irony of the 1981 race was this: The son of a ship painter, cursed by a rigid formality, was seen by the voters as arrogant. The son of American aristocrats, blessed with a fluid self-confidence, campaigned as Everyman.
Florio's lead dwindled away, and on Election Day he lost by 1,797 votes. After a month of recounts, Florio, ill and exhausted, conceded defeat.
''WHEN I MET JAMES, HE lived in an apartment that was all borrowed things, odds and ends, really,'' said Lucinda Florio, the Governor's second wife. ''He would invite his own children over for dinner and say, 'Bring your own silverware.' ''
Florio had been legally separated from his wife, Maryanne, in 1978. His life had been so dominated by work that he had spent little time with his family, and on the campaign trail he rarely showed off his wife or children. After the divorce, friends say he dated in Washington, but most of his life was still work. He owned one pair of shoes. He drove a Ford Escort.
Following the 1981 defeat, Florio had moved to a small apartment in Pine Hill, a suburb of Camden. One day the attractive blond third-grade teacher who lived on the floor above received a note from ''Jim downstairs,'' asking her out to dinner. She accepted.
Lucinda Coleman, also divorced, a former high school dropout, and also the daughter of a shipyard worker, found Florio delightfully unpretentious. Together, they read books, viewed videos at home, went bird-watching. Occasionally, they spent weekends at the Shore. He admitted to a weakness he never could master: Haagen-Dazs coffee ice cream. They were married on Valentine's Day in 1988.
The love affair with Lucinda, friends say, brought a dramatic change in Florio, in the way he viewed the world and the way the world viewed him. Over time, he became more relaxed, talked about emotions, and began making jokes at his own expense.
''At about that time, I went out with Jim to a restaurant,'' said Benjamin Palumbo, a friend. ''He was humming. I said, 'Jim, I've never heard you hum.' He just smiled and kept on humming.''
Florio prepared for his 1989 run for Governor the way he did for everything else, methodically trying to rectify his past mistakes. For five years, he met with the state's politicians, journalists, business and religious leaders. Florio hired a top Washington media consultant, Carter Eskew, and sucked up information on modern media campaigns like a sponge.
Lucinda, it turned out, was a political godsend. She had all the human qualities he appeared to lack in 1981. Florio now stood in public, radiating warmth as he held her hand. Florio now chirped on about his new grandson, Matthew, as he never had about his own children. Lucinda also provided quick, lively quotes. ''My husband is the only man I know who can talk passionately about sludge,'' Lucinda told a reporter, interrupting one of her husband's discourses on recycling.
But the Florio campaign faced a new problem. Republicans in Camden were charging that since Florio's allies had taken control of Camden County government, they had created an unsavory political machine that used government jobs and contracts to reward friends.
In one case, Joseph C. Salema, Florio's chief of staff, and Nicholas Rudi, a campaign aide who became the County Administrator and Treasurer, left their jobs to form a consulting concern that then received hundreds of thousands of dollars in contracts from the county. In another, Salema, Rudi and Florio, with other investors, bought the land and building of the faltering Continental Bank of New Jersey with promissory notes that would be paid off in rent from the bank's future profits. After newspapers raised questions of impropriety, Florio sold his interest in the bank and donated the profits to Trenton State College.
Florio, in fact, had been distant from the day-to-day workings of the county, and he later pressed for reforms after the practices had been outlined in a local newspaper series. But he pointed out that there was never any evidence of corruption among his former aides and that their practices were no different from those in most other counties in the state.
Florio's opponent, a conservative from the northwestern corner of the state, Representative Jim Courter, had arranged to hire Roger Stone and Roger Ailes, two media consultants who helped maul Michael Dukakis in 1988. From Republican literature and statements to the press, Democrats believed their opponents would portray Florio as a corrupt boss, a liberal, and, taking advantage of his Italian name and sunken cheek, a politician with links to the Mafia.
Florio decided his campaign would avoid the mistakes of Democratic disasters past, particularly those of Dukakis. He agreed to seize the low ground first, by hitting the Republicans harder, sooner and nastier than they hit him. Also, he planned to say he saw no need for new taxes, even as the state's fiscal situation turned grim. Finally, the Florio of 1989, unlike the Florio of 1981, boiled his policies down to simple phrases, such as ''clean water,'' ''lower auto-insurance rates'' and ''opportunity.''
Courter opened with: ''If you liked Michael Dukakis, you'll love Jim Florio.'' It was the same mistake Hunt had made 15 years earlier.
When the Republicans questioned why Florio had failed to vote for a state bill establishing penalties for desecrating the flag, Florio held a news conference the next day at the Trenton War Memorial. He surrounded himself with fellow veterans and a former prisoner of war.
''If you are challenging my patriotism,'' Florio said to Courter, ''come out and say it like a man.'' Courter had never served in the military.
Florio labeled Courter ''toxic polluter,'' because of a small spill of fuel oil that took place on one of Courter's properties. He questioned how Courter had ''grown rich in Congress'' (Courter's mother had died while he was in office, leaving him a substantial inheritance). By October, Courter was reeling from each new Florio blow. The day after Florio defeated Courter, 61.2 to 37.2 percent, sweeping a Democratic majority into the Legislature, a reporter asked the Governor-elect what other Democrats around the nation could learn from the campaign.
''Don't be a patsy,'' Florio said.
DAY. Florio sits wearing earphones in the studio of radio station WHWH, in Princeton. It is a tiny, cramped space. Florio is practicing the retail politics he learned in Camden, but now he's attempting to reach 7.5 million constituents. Some are enraged. Others are confused.
''It's like your own budget, Jean,'' Florio says to a caller from Ewing who asks the Governor not to raise the sales tax. ''If you have got more expenditures than you have money, you have to cut down on your expenditures. So we are making the cuts. But that is not even enough. We have got to raise some money, just to get ourselves even.'' ''What about my property taxes?'' says a resident of Colonia. ''Can you confirm rumors you are hiring 1,000 new police to confiscate guns?'' asks a constituent from Summit.
Florio answers patiently, sometimes providing more details than his listeners can follow. The lines are backed up with hundreds of calls. Who knows if Jean feels any better, having heard the Governor's words? Who knows if his message is working at all?
But Florio is already thinking about the next appearance tonight and the long drive ahead before he and Lucinda can rest. There won't be time for dinner, he tells his wife, who has been waiting outside the studio. Just time to pick up a quart of coffee ice cream at a grocery. In his pocket, he has packed a spoon. ''You brought your own spoon,'' says Lucinda. ''I'll share,'' says the Governor. ''But you control the spoon,'' says Lucinda.
In matters he cares about, Lucinda says later, Jim Florio always remains in control.

HEADLINE: BOMBAY: OLD AND NEW GATEWAY TO INDIA

BYLINE: By GILLIAN TINDALL; Gillian Tindall is the author of ''Journey of a Lifetime and Other Stories,'' forthcoming from Hutchinson.

 BODY:

By Pa and Ma I'm daily told
To marry now's my time,
For though I'm very far from old,
I'm rather in my prime.
They say while we have any sun
We ought to make our hay -
And India has so hot a one,
I'm going to Bombay!
 
 
 
Thomas Hood's famous ditty, ''I'm Going to Bombay,'' embodies just one aspect of the great 19th-century saga of British imperialism. The hopeful young woman making the Victorian journey on one of the new steam vessels - complete with a tropical outfit, camphor, smelling salts, letters of introduction and a Bible - confidently expected to catch a husband among the homesick British Army officers, administrators and businessmen congregated on Indian soil. 
 
My cousin writes from Hyderapot,
 My only chance to snatch,
And says the Climate is so hot,
 It's sure to light a match . . .
 
 From the time that the Pilgrim Fathers set sail westward, Englishmen have been making forays eastward, ''going to Bombay'' and to what were to become Calcutta and Madras, seeking their fortunes in the future Indian empire. The would-be traders in silk, spices, ivory and jute formed themselves into the British East India Company and opened up other trades between India and China. In the late 18th century, around the time of the American Declaration of Independence, the British Government turned its attention more seriously to the East and by degrees took over the Company, transforming it from ''a ramshackle company trading in tea and opium'' into a vast enterprise of imperial administration that was to endure till 1947. Once the journey out had become shorter and less hazardous than it had been in the days of sail, the native women who had satisfied the early settlers were supplanted by Nice Girls from Home who, in turn, added their own demands and habits to the rich mixture of daily life in the Indian Presidency cities.
One way and another, people of both sexes have been going to Bombay for centuries, but this traffic has not been solely, or even mainly, British. The British founded Bombay on the site of a Portuguese trading station, but right from the start people of other European and Middle Eastern nations, as well as very many from other parts of India, were drawn to the place. The huge city is a melting pot of different cultures, races and political and social affiliations. At a roughly estimated 10 million people, it is second only in size to Calcutta and is more prosperous, in its chaotic way, than Calcutta has been for decades. It is one of India's major ports - indeed a major world port. It is also a major manufacturing center, though the traditional textile mills in the heart of Bombay are at last giving way to more diversified manufactory on the edges and in adjacent cities; the triangle of land formed by Bombay, Poona and Nasik is now one of the largest industrialized areas on mainland Asia.
Although downtown Bombay has some splendid 19th-century Indo-Gothic buildings that remind the traveler of London, the vista of docks and mill chimneys has traditionally been called ''Manchester and Liverpool rolled into one.'' For Americans, San Francisco is sometimes invoked, for Bombay is an oceanside city, and the fashionable postcard view of curving Marine Drive may kid the air-conditioned visitor that he or she has arrived in California - a notion that exposure to Bombay's humid, salt-swamp airs will rapidly dispel. New Orleans (one of Bombay's old-time competitors in the cotton trade) would be nearer the mark. Bombay never, ever gets cold. The natural vegetation - where it is still allowed to push up between the densely massed buildings - is subtropical: coconut palms, date palms and mangoes. It is, however, true that, like an Eastern Hollywood, Bombay is the center of Indian film making, that intensive industry for the production of luscious song-and-dance epics that are exported to Indian communities around the world. Bombay holds glamour as well as promise for all who have arrived there through the decades to seek their fortunes - or, at the very least, to scrape some sort of living in a land where so many are poor.
''Ah, Bombay! You can almost smell the money in the streets there!'' an Indian businessman far from home once said to me nostalgically. And although this remark may seem unfeeling to the Western visitor who sees the poverty all around at ground level - in the families of street hawkers, scavengers, laborers and beggars living on the sidewalks and on the polluted beaches - my Indian friend had a point. At the higher social levels (literally higher, in the grand high-rise apartments on Malabar Hill), there is a lot of money in Bombay, and money at the top means jobs, handouts and pickings further down the scale. The barefoot man on the street from whom you buy a soft drink, a handkerchief or a couple of bananas sleeps on his handcart or in some plastic-and-matting hovel, because here in the city he can make some sort of a living. There are slums, certainly, in Bombay, indescribable agglomerations of shacks, sometimes nestling under the very walls of prestige office blocks or in the shade of gaudy billboards advertising films, but economists call them ''slums of hope.''
Like Manhattan, with its cosmopolitan, money-oriented atmosphere, Bombay is on a long narrow island, with the dockside facing the mainland and the other side facing onto a great sea. But Bombay developed near the tip of its island - or rather, on the largest of the seven islands that were once there and which have now been turned by reclamation and landfill into one. Today the city proper occupies this entire consolidated island. The northern creek separating it from the mainland has been bridged, and greater Bombay has continued to expand in that direction, the only way it can - mile after unplanned mile of mingled industry and suburb. It is this that greets the modern visitor on his way in from the airport. But the city proper is contained between two shorelines. Inevitably but sadly, the old, beautiful bungalows in their individual gardens are being progressively torn down to create space for more intensive development; while on the newest piece of land claimed from the sea (Nariman Point) the winking glass skyscrapers rise, towering over the solid, intricately magnificent older buildings three blocks to the east that have lost their ocean view. At least these old buildings are now appreciated again, some even floodlighted at night.
Travelers in the past were luckier than present-day ones. They arrived, not via the backdoor urban sprawl, but at Apollo Bunder, the downtown harbor where the fantasy Mogul Gateway of India stands, opposite the splendid Taj Hotel. Ships have been docking at this jetty, or at earlier ones on the site, for centuries: troopships landing men during World War II, 19th-century ironclads of the P & O Steamship Lines, the slim clippers that used to race before the prevailing winds, pot-bellied 18th-century ''East Indiamen'' that had taken seven months or more on the voyage. The passengers on these saw a small, walled town on the shore: white houses with red-tiled roofs and, beyond them, coconut plantations stretching away to the beautiful hills.
In those early days, many ships tied up a few hundred yards north in Bombay's small, original natural harbor, Mody Bay, under the walls of the old castle. But the casual visitor today will seek in vain for this bay and the castle itself, for both have long been corralled off as part of the naval dockyard and are inaccessible except by special permission. If you should be so lucky as to visit the spot, the Indian naval officers who proudly maintain the crenelated battlements may tell you these walls are Portuguese remains; in fact, except for a couple of carved stones, they are British-built. But the place is the site of the original Portuguese stockade, which the British wrested from the reluctant local traders when Bombay was made part of the dowry of Charles II's Portuguese queen in 1661. Seldom can a marriage of convenience have had such far-reaching consequences.
On the eastern foreshore of Bombay island, from the castle northward for about seven miles, lie Bombay's dockyards, where much of the city's 19th-century wealth and prestige was founded; today they are still an important part of her economy, handling 35 percent of India's maritime trade. The export of cotton continues. Grown on the Deccan and processed in Bombay's mills, raw cotton used to be the city's staple product, but today much more of it goes out as ready-made garments. India has become a world source of cheap shirts and pants.
Bombay's shipyards still do refitting for ships of other countries whose own skilled labor is more expensive, but it has recently lost its premier position in this to Singapore, Malaysia and Korea. The city's tradition of shipbuilding is an ancient one. In the late 17th century, after the East India Company had acquired the insignificant, fever-ridden island of Bombay from the British Crown but did not know quite what to do with it, the company invited Parsee shipwrights to come down from Surat to get the Bombay shipyards going. The Parsees (the descendants of Persian immigrants to India) came, stayed and displayed talents for which they became famous. Ships built in Bombay of Indian teak fought at the Battle of Trafalgar. Parsees later diversified into other occupations and became not only the richest but also the most respected members of the local community. They are still to be found in positions of influence, but many of them have left for England, Canada or the United States. Their only near rivals in Bombay were the immensely successful Sassoons, all descended from the David Sassoon who came from Mesopotamia in the 1830's to set up business in India. Today there are no Sassoons left in Bombay, but two fine synagogues testify to their influence, as does the Sassoon Dock, on Calaba Causeway, whose fishy smell proclaims its presence from afar.
If you want an impression of the way the demands of a great port have transformed Bombay's contours, go uptown to Mazagaon, an old Portuguese-Christian district that still has a few ancient, gingerbread-carved bungalows. Follow Dockyard Road round to the flight of steps leading up a miniature mountain to Joseph Baptista Park. This garden stands like an oasis of the past on the remains of a rocky outcrop, the rest of which has been demolished to create the land below. Today, you look out east over an electricity-generating station, a railway track, a new container-truck road and a vista of wharves, but once the sea lapped the foot of this hill. Two hundred years ago a house standing here was occupied by a British merchant called Draper and his young wife, Eliza, one of the many who were sent out to find husbands. Eliza, however, became dissatisfied with Mr. Draper (who was not himself a model marriage partner) and staged a romantic elopement, descending by a rope into the arms of her lover waiting in a boat below. The lover proved unfaithful also, and Eliza, having returned to England and encountered various other gentlemen, came to a Bad End. Her ghost was long said to haunt the place, and in the little park at dusk you could believe she is still there, a wistful wraith far removed from the noise and ceaseless movement of what has become one of the most densely populated cities in the world.
The kind of boat that would have been familiar to Eliza - gaff-rigged wooden sailing vessels - are still built and ply up and down the coast as fishing vessels; they can be seen with their glistening cargoes at Ferry Wharf, off Malet Road. Here, you can enter freely, though you may be assailed with offers of produce including ''Bombay Duck,'' the pungent, sun-dried fish that is a local delicacy. Indeed there is a run of traditional harbors north of here into which the truly interested visitor may penetrate (inconspicuous clothing and an air of quiet busyness are recommended): the bunder where red tiles from Mangalore are landed, Hay Wharf, Lakri Bunder, with its stacks of wood, and Daru Khana (''Fire House''), where old iron ships are broken and the breakers' families keep their goats, their children and a renowned Muslim shrine amid a Dickensian vista of blackened chains.
All this is the underpinning of the commercial prosperity whose outward expression is the huge bazaar area of central Bombay. Here you can buy every kind of textile, from the cheapest man-made fiber and unbleached muslin to the finest silks and gorgeously embroidered and incrusted wedding saris. In the Jhaveri Bazaar acres of silver and diamonds greet you, while around the corner, in Tamba Kata and Gulal Wadi, are streets of copper and tinsmiths. Other lanes specialize in bicycles, electrical goods, shoes, cane furniture and motor parts new and used. Although conspicuous concern for preservation is in short supply in India, inanimate objects seem to acquiesce to the Hindu belief in a series of reincarnated lives: hardly anything is thrown away and, when it is, an army of scavengers work over the tips.
Whatever you want, someone will sell it to you. The innocent scents of fruits, vegetables and flowers brought in from the country perfume the streets each morning, briefly driving out the more enduring Indian smells of hot dust, roasting peanuts and urine, while later in the day girls are for sale in certain small shops known as ''cages.'' A liquor merchant offers Bagpipe (Indian) whiskey; a holy man offers sacred sugar; ragged children wheedle for alms at the windows of cars stuck in traffic jams. Outside one of the big public hospitals laborers queue to sell their blood, while across the road a sign proclaims that Dr. Shah Cures Incurable Diseases with Herbs. No one language predominates in Bombay, so English words are widely used and street signs clamor in four different major scripts.
In the Chor Bazaar, the ''Thieves Market'' around Mutton Street, delicate Mogul paintings testify to another kind of life, but there are many different trace elements also: the place is like an archeological site revealing the varied cultures that have contributed to Bombay. Hindu gods, so nonchalant compared with the yearning saints of Christianity, stand next to jade lions from China and the Staffordshire pottery figures left behind by Englishmen who went home. Indeed, relics of the Raj abound - as if, banished from elsewhere, in the Chor Bazaar they have found their resting place. Sporting prints repose here, and teapots and horned gramophones faintly churning out Irving Berlin melodies above the ringing of bicycle bells. Here are French and Latin Grammars, here a ''Hindustanee Primer.'' Somewhere about must be examples of the very type of Bible, smelling-salt bottle and tropical weight chemises that Thomas Hood's hopeful lady brought out with her on her quest for a husband.

FIGHTING FOR PEACE
Seven Critical Years in the Pentagon.
By Caspar W. Weinberger.
464 pp. New York:
Warner Books. $24.95.
It has been years since a Reagan-era confessional has failed to grace the best-seller list. Within this flourishing literary genre, Caspar W. Weinberger, the former Secretary of Defense and now the publisher of Forbes magazine, has begun a new subgroup: the memoir of the loyalist as national savior. 
While other memoirists, such as Donald Regan (the executive as spin controller) and Peggy Noonan (the ingenue as ventriloquist), have strained to explain the peculiar workings of the Reagan White House (''a ghost ship,'' according to the former Secretary of State Alexander Haig), in ''Fighting for Peace'' Mr. Weinberger offers only a panegyric to Ronald Reagan. He writes of ''the first time I had ever seen the electric and electrifying nature of the President's smile'' and how ''I have never failed to see that magic at work.'' Mr. Reagan made Mr. Weinberger feel good, as he did so many people. It is this warm sensation that Mr. Weinberger submits as the rationale for his own actions. Mr. Reagan's ''personality was so open and friendly, and he was so funny, that he always succeeded in making people around him laugh and feel comfortable and happy at the same time he was inspiring great loyalty.''
When Mr. Weinberger left the Administration, Mr. Reagan, perhaps remembering George Arliss's film portrayal of a British prime minister, called his Secretary of Defense ''my Disraeli.'' Mr. Weinberger's own model, however, was another prime minister, Winston Churchill, whose battle for preparedness in the 1930's Mr. Weinberger says he followed as a Harvard student with a ''deep sense of almost personal involvement.'' Inspired by Churchill's example 40 years later, Mr. Weinberger describes his determination ''to prevent America from continuing down that path of drift and self-disparagement and weakness that I was sure could lead to another war.'' That America's position in the 1970's in relation to the Soviets was equivalent to Britain's in the 1930's in relation to the Nazis, he had no doubt.
Mr. Weinberger's self-image was framed by his notion of Churchill. In his Pentagon office, he hung a Churchill injunction: ''Never give in, never, never, never, never - in things great or small, large or petty.'' He collected Churchilliana and an extensive library of works by and about Churchill. The Munich analogy was wielded as a Weinbergerian theme to intimidate opponents of his views. His private memos to the President frequently brandished the Munich reference to argue for a more hard-line United States policy toward the Soviet Union. As if closing the ring, Mr. Weinberger was honored by the Queen for his gallant bureaucratic assistance in the Falklands war as an Honorary Knight Grand Cross in the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.
Mr. Weinberger devotes more of his book to his adoration of Churchill than to his own personal background. He describes how his father (a ''skillful storyteller and an extraordinarily understanding and effective parent'') brought him to a rally for Herbert Hoover in 1932, but never tells us what his father did for a living or why the Weinbergers had converted to Episcopalianism from Judaism, though he mentions ''my mother's New England ancestry.'' Mr. Weinberger refers to his job as general counsel for the Bechtel Group before becoming Secretary of Defense, but does not remark on his conflicts with the company's president, George Shultz, who became Mr. Reagan's Secretary of State, or the course of their relationship in the Administration. Though Mr. Weinberger, as the director of finance in California under Governor Reagan, worked closely with Edwin Meese, then Mr. Reagan's chief of staff, his most detailed assessment of Mr. Reagan's Presidential counselor and Attorney General is that he ''is affable, very well informed, and effective in argument - as is Jim Baker'' - an absurd comparison of one of the most bumbling members of the Reagan Administration with one of the most polished. Mr. Weinberger does not sully his portrait of Mr. Meese by noting the Wedtech scandal.
When Mr. Weinberger was the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Nixon Administration, he was generally regarded in Washington as a colorless numbers-cruncher, renowned as ''Cap the Knife,'' mainly for his budget cutting. But as the Secretary of Defense he yearned to be a swashbuckling titan so great as to be dubbed Sir Caspar (G.B.E.).
Under Mr. Reagan, he realized his Churchillian longings by presiding over a gigantic increase in the budget of the Defense Department, which lacked for nothing except strategy. Mr. Weinberger, however, does not detail a decisive meeting on Sept. 9, 1981, at which he made his case for arms increases before the President. It was, according to David Stockman, the budget director, ''a masterpiece of obfuscation.'' Mr. Weinberger's presentation, Mr. Stockman said, featured three cartoons: a midget without a rifle, described as the Carter military budget; a bespectacled wimp with a little gun, described as the Stockman budget; and a G.I. Joe look-alike with an imposing M-60, described as the Weinberger budget. ''Did he think the White House was on Sesame Street?'' wrote the disillusioned Mr. Stockman in his memoir, ''The Triumph of Politics.'' (For his part, Mr. Weinberger says here that Mr. Stockman's sniping at his bloated budget was ''quite inconsistent with any loyalty to the President.'') In this contest, Mr. Weinberger emerged the victor. Clearly, in California he had learned a great deal about how to get what he wanted out of Mr. Reagan that had no correlation in Churchill's experience.
Mr. Weinberger's Deputy Secretary, Paul Thayer, who helped oversee the buildup but was imprisoned for obstruction of justice in an insider-trading case, goes unheralded in the memoir. Nor does Mr. Weinberger refer to the F.B.I.'s Operation Ill Wind, which uncovered a vast Pentagon procurement scandal, perhaps invited by the indiscriminate buildup.
Churchill, however, is periodically reintroduced. His description of the British fleet on the eve of World War I is lovingly tendered as a justification for the Strategic Defense Initiative. The defense provided by the Royal Navy, Mr. Weinberger suggests, is the proper analogy for S.D.I. He pursues this logic by arguing, as he did as Pentagon chief, for setting aside the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which prohibits the United States and the Soviet Union from constructing missile defense systems. He cites the review of the treaty made by the State Department's legal adviser, Abraham Sofaer, as the basis for lifting its restrictions. But he does not mention that Mr. Sofaer's case was built on contrived and tendentious evidence, and that when this was exposed, Mr. Sofaer sought to blame the shabby brief on ''young lawyers'' on his staff. Mr. Weinberger also does not record that the impetus and pressure for Mr. Sofaer's review came from the Defense Department itself, specifically from Mr. Weinberger's exceedingly clever neoconservative Assistant Secretary, Richard Perle, who had been a crusader against the ABM Treaty and arms controllers in general since the treaty was first ratified in 1972.
Mr. Perle's indispensable role in the Pentagon as its prime tactician in frustrating moves toward arms control goes uncredited. When Mr. Weinberger came to his post, he had an agenda for arms spending (as much as possible) but not for arms control. Mr. Perle filled this particular vacuum. It was his idea, the so-called ''double zero'' proposal, that helped rupture progress on arms control in the early years of the Reagan Administration, but unexpectedly led to the treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces after its surprise acceptance by the new Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Yet Mr. Weinberger does not discuss the role played by the most interesting man who worked for him.
Mr. Weinberger's loyalty to Mr. Reagan is depicted most dramatically, if somewhat evasively, in his chapter on the Iran-contra scandal. He writes that he opposed the idea of trading arms with the Iranians for hostages when he first heard of it on Aug. 6, 1985. He was subsequently cut out of the cable traffic on the project, but arranged to receive the cables beginning in September 1985. Two months later, the shipment of Israeli Hawk missiles to Iran as part of the deal required protracted negotiations between the Pentagon and the White House on how to replace the Israeli missiles from United States stocks. Mr. Weinberger mentions nothing about this incident. He was the last witness called before the select Congressional committee investigating the scandal, which was rushing to complete its work before its self-imposed deadline. In a deposition he gave in June 1987, Mr. Weinberger claimed that he did not know of the arms shipments in 1985, though his department was directly involved in them.
He fully exonerates Mr. Reagan of knowing about the diversion of funds to the contras, blaming the entire affair on the former national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane, whom he calls ''strange, indrawn, moody.'' But Mr. Weinberger does not address the defense Mr. McFarlane put forward in his Congressional testimony. The reason he did not tell the President that funding the contras was a futile exercise, Mr. McFarlane explained, was because ''Cap Weinberger would have said I was some kind of commie.''
Mr. Weinberger gives great credence to Mr. McFarlane's successor at the National Security Council, John M. Poindexter, who testified that Mr. Reagan was ignorant of the diversion, and who was recently found guilty of five felony counts for his role in the affair. Mr. Weinberger quotes Mr. Reagan as saying ''I don't remember - period,'' and adds, ''I believe the President.''
Earlier in his book, however, in his extended encomium to Mr. Reagan, Mr. Weinberger writes, ''He was easy to brief and his memory was phenomenal.'' Perhaps Mr. Reagan just goes blank in public, as he did in his testimony during the trial of Mr. Poindexter, who also had a reputation for a phenomenal memory. Mr. Poindexter's memory failed him whenever he was asked about details of his role in the Iran-contra scandal. Mr. Weinberger may be inadvertently telling us that Mr. Reagan does indeed have a memory, and that the rest is an act.
For most of the Reagan Presidency, Mr. Weinberger had been successful in thwarting arms control. He had undermined the 1982 ''walk in the woods'' agreement on intermediate nuclear forces tentatively negotiated by Paul Nitze, persuaded the President to stop United States compliance with the provisions of the 1979 arms limitation agreement and threatened the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Mr. Weinberger insists that the military buildup - the ''restoration of the West's security'' - compelled the Soviets to sign the I.N.F. treaty. He does not mention factors within the Soviet Union, such as its economy, or give any credit to Mr. Gorbachev, whom he dismisses as a totalitarian more adept than Soviet leaders of the past at public relations. Mr. Weinberger does not note that at the Reykjavik summit Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev momentarily agreed to the elimination of all nuclear missiles, nor does he refer to the cordial relationship that developed between the two leaders. Mr. Weinberger had won the internal bureaucratic battle only to see his years of maneuvering frustrated by the appearance of a greater outside force. In the end, the Secretary of Defense was outplayed by the General Secretary.
Historians may turn to Mr. Weinberger's book for the banal tone of the period's official orthodoxy, a tone remarkably similar to that found in Andrei Gromyko's recently published memoir. They will find a less self-serving and more informative account of the Reagan Presidency in '' 'What Does Joan Say?' '' by Joan Quigley, Nancy Reagan's astrologer.
The 1990's have begun with chisels slowly being applied to Mr. Weinberger's monument, the defense buildup of the early 1980's. But more than his programmatic legacy is being undone. If Mr. Gorbachev does not resemble Hitler, then it is difficult to see anybody as Churchill. The analogies drawn from the pre-World War II era about appeasement and preparedness, which played such a large part in American politics during the cold war, have only now started to lose their mesmerizing compulsion. This may not be the end of history, but simply of mythology.

I'm guessing, but I'm willing to bet that it's been a long time since two children's books, published in the same month, no less, carried nearly identical dedications to a murdered union leader. But Chico Mendes, who was killed defending the rights of freelance rubber tappers in the Amazon rain forest in December 1988, was no ordinary laborite. He was a martyr waiting to happen, a man assassinated for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but remembered for being in the right place at the right time.
As last month's Earth Day festivities made clear, Americans have seen the environmental light: they are ready to embrace green (particularly when it comes with an outdoor concert or two), to take it into their hearts and homes, to testify that making a difference - whether by using cloth diapers or by separating cans from bottles - has changed their lives. Who could argue? Feeling powerful (and righteous to boot) is a rare and delicious commodity these days; besides, it takes an unseemly streak of perversity to be against the environment.
Also, now that we have been granted some distance from our nuclear nightmares, we can concede that, as slogans, ''Don't bungle the jungle'' and ''Up with green heads! Down with garbage heads!'' (my personal Earth Day favorite) have a jaunty energy that phrases like ''nuclear winter'' and ''psychic numbing'' can't compete with. And unlike the images of the antinuclear movement, say, those of environmentalism - whales graceful in their enormity, landscapes so beautiful they melt your heart, a life of harvesting and gathering and getting your hands dirty - are accessible, appealing, suitable for family viewing, for sitcoms. And, yes, even for children's books.
With his entry into the save-the-endangered-species market, John Burningham, the British author of the hilarious ''Mr. Gumpy's Outing,'' among others, has gone serious. ''Hey! Get Off Our Train'' (an allusion perhaps for those Rolling Stones fans turned parents? Hm, unlikely) tells the story of a little boy who, after being put unaffectionately to bed by a woman one can only hope is not his mother, dreams of escape (who wouldn't?) on his toy train.
Accompanied by his loyal ''pajama-case dog'' (this is an English book, after all), he scouts the world, dreaming of picnics, kites and snowballs, stopping only when various endangered animals plead for sanctuary. This latter-day Noah, not old enough to share his toys or his dreams gladly, orders each to get off his train, until he hears its tale of woe: ''Someone is coming to cut off my tusks,'' or ''They are cutting down the forests where I live.'' He then welcomes each aboard for the night.
Mr. Burningham's drawings are at their best, whimsically abstract and technically accomplished; one collage of the boy and his friends holding up umbrellas against the rain is particularly offbeat and winning. But some of the drawings, while beautiful, are so dark as to be inaccessible to a young child.
But, then, the whole book is inaccessible to young children - not because it's too hard, but quite specifically because no species' problem gets more than a dribble of explanation. A bird, presumably a heron (would naming it be too direct?), gets to say the most: ''I live in the marshes and they are draining the water out of them. I can't live on dry land, and soon there will be none of us left.'' Leaving aside the problem of how this poor bird is going to make it on a train, who are ''they''? One can only assume that ''they'' are adults (or witches or ogres), the kind of people who say good night to children without hugs or kisses.
The problem is that this vaguely xenophobic labeling of an enemy as ''the other'' is potentially dangerous and a silly thing to teach a child. The already converted adult who is up on his endangered-species rap could lead a discussion of, say, the realities of the fur, jewelry and cosmetics industries, but that seems a bit much for even a 7- or 8-year-old, and ridiculous for those younger.
 
* * *
 The jacket for Lynne Cherry's lushly illustrated book, ''The Great Kapok Tree,'' informs us that she traveled to the Amazon to research the illustrations for her save-the-rain-forest entry. It shows. She's drawn the animals and vegetation in great detail and with loads of color; yet the effect is flat and uninviting, somehow stilted.
In the story, a young man - handsomely characterless, an ethnic Ken doll - has been instructed by a ''larger man'' to chop down a Kapok tree. After giving a few whacks, the fellow gets tired, takes a nap, and is visited in his sleep by a string of animals, insects and a young Indian boy who all whisper in his ear how their lives (and his) will be ruined if he chops down the tree. Surprise: when he wakes up, he throws down his ax and walks off into the jungle, perhaps to check out Brazil's unemployment-insurance policy.
The book's peculiar language - ''If you destroy the beauty of the rain forest,'' a three-toed sloth asks, ''on what would you feast your eyes?'' - might at least make sense to an older child, but, then, 8-year-olds abhor preachiness more than little kids.
What is going on here? A cynic might wonder whether publishers have simply decided to tap into a hot market and a profitable us-against-them mentality. A nice person would probably think that these are well-intentioned books that fall short. I find myself somewhere in the middle: incredulous that people who care about the environment - a right-minded issue if ever there was one - have so little faith in their material. To teach children to care about their world is a simple matter: read them books and magazines about animals, show them gentleness, walk with them, swim with them, run with them, teach them by example that waste is bad and that conservation is good.
Children are awfully smart. They get the message, particularly when it's not doctrinaire. But they do get bored. As one 4-year-old I know remarked, midway through Mr. Rogers's own Earth Day extravaganza, ''When is he going to talk about something else besides recycling?'' Maybe she has a future as an environmentalist.

BASEBALL IN APRIL
And Other Stories.
By Gary Soto.
111 pp. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.
$14.95. (Ages 12 and up)
Gary Soto's sensitive and economical short stories center on Mexican-American boys and girls becoming teen-agers. They are set in homogeneous lower-middle-class Hispanic neighborhoods in California. At the same time the young people are turning into adolescents, their milieu is becoming progressively Americanized, largely through the pervasive influence of the media. The overall theme of the book is thus individual and social change being provoked by strong outside forces. The boys and girls are transforming themselves awkwardly into facsimiles of adults; the world of adults is turning into an anxious copy of the Anglo world. 
Mr. Soto, who was born and raised in Fresno, Calif., teaches Chicano studies and English at the University of California, Berkeley. Because he stays within the teen-agers' universe in ''Baseball in April,'' he manages to convey all the social change and stress without bathos or didacticism. In fact, his stories are moving, yet humorous and entertaining. The best are also quite subtle.
In ''Two Dreamers,'' Luis, Hector's grandfather, is inspired by some advertisements to plot a real estate deal that will make him rich, so he can return to the Mexican town of Jalapa in triumph. But to make phone calls, he needs Hector as interpreter - a common situation in immigrants' homes. Hector, both skeptical and embarrassed, demurs. At the same time he is fascinated by Luis's knowledge and his memories of Mexico (''his hometown with its clip-clop of horse and donkey hooves''). As Hector grows older, the situation is reversed. With his command of English, Hector is now a probe into the future, and into the alien yet alluring world that surrounds him. The story is about this swap of roles. It is very revealing that the contrast of generations skips the father, a figure generally absent in this collection. Luis and Hector better embody the generational differences. The grandfather is unwaveringly Mexican; Hector is on his way to becoming something still undefined, but certainly not Mexican anymore.
The title story is a poignant tale about compromise and resignation. Michael and Jesse practice hard to make the Little League. At the tryout, nervously watched by other boys' fathers (obviously Anglo and middle-class), they both fail. But they join an independent team, the Hobos, run by Manuel, a fatherly man who coaches with affection and compassion. The team does not do very well, and neither do Jesse and Michael, who are not very good. The Hobos disband slowly, as the boys lose interest in baseball. April is over. What was a consuming interest is suddenly left behind, like so many other things. Life can and will go on without baseball - a somewhat melancholy lesson.
The same air of resignation prevails in other stories, like ''Barbie,'' where Veronica finally gets the doll she wants, only to have it lose its head. This story has a lurking sexual subtext that gives it a more serious and compelling tone than the others, though everything is very understated. The best by far is ''The Karate Kid,'' which has a quixotic theme. Gilbert Sanchez, who is delicate and sensitive, is overwhelmed by the movie ''The Karate Kid.'' He assumes the persona of his movie hero and challenges his tormentor at school, Pete the Heat, who beats him up unmercifully. Gilbert begs his mother to pay for karate classes. She gives in and he attends a school run by a Mr. Lopez, who is something of an impostor. After a few months, Gilbert feels ready for his second sally. The Heat demolishes him again before all his friends. Gilbert gives up karate gleefully for fiction -that is, for ''super-hero comic books; they were more real than karate. And they didn't hurt.'' ''Baseball in April'' is more than literature for teen-agers. The stories give a bittersweet account of reconciliation to the givens of self and life while growing up that will be recognized as authentic by all.

HEADLINE: About Cars;
Escort Evolves Into Mainstay

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
The 1991 model Ford Escort hatchbacks and station wagons are the most significant new cars from Ford Motor Company in at least two decades. -Thomas J. Wagner
 
That is fairly strong stuff, coming as it does from the general manager of the Ford division, which is generally thought to be wealthy and bullish because of its immense success with the Taurus, not because of Escort.
But when Wagner amplifies, it is to say that the $2 billion that Ford has spent on its replacement for the compact Escort was money aimed at a redefinition of auto making.
There are the new technologies in design and manufacturing, for example, and those have been abetted by a new era, in which the Escort and its twin, the Mercury Tracer, have fulfilled their promise and become world cars in every sense. 
It is hard to believe that Escort has been around for 10 years, but the car that introduced the ''world-car'' theme has indeed populated roads everywhere for the last decade with bodies and powertrains made of iron, glass, plastics and textiles from hither, thither and, in no small way, yon.
Escort, Wagner says, has been the butter that allowed Ford to design and sell those fancier cars that brought in the company's bread.
When it was introduced Sept. 2, 1980, the 1981 Escort was an early bulwark in Detroit's defense against the imports. It didn't hurt that the car was a replacement for the Pinto, which had a reputation for bursting into flames when it was treated rudely in its rear quarters.
In the ensuing years, seven million Escorts have rolled off the line. And the most surprising thing to me is that four million have been running around Europe, most of them in the British Isles.
And all of this has happened with only a minor facelift in spring of 1988.
So it is certainly time for Ford's new mainstay, and the 1991 model offers better aerodynamics, more room, more power and even more mongrelization.
The car is based on the 323 from Ford's Japanese partner, Mazda, and the top of the line GT hatchback gets its spunk from a Mazda engine, while other Escorts carry a homegrown powerplant.
There are three model lines, the two-door Pony, the LX in two- and four-door hatchbacks and a four-door wagon, and the sporty GT. And the new car is far superior to its predecessor. In GT dress, it is quick. It is comfortable, quiet, economical and nicely put together.
Oddly, given its Mazda lineage, the new Escort does look an awful lot like an Acura Integra from Honda.
There is the wedge profile, and the low cowl to provide better visibility. The windows have been made semiflush to improve aerodynamics. The new shape gives the '91 Escort a coefficient of drag of .35, down from last year's .39.
If you opt for the GT, you get blackout trim, but all of the Escorts have an odd asymetrical grille, with eight slanted cutouts on the right and a simple blue-and-chrome Ford emblem on the left.
Inside, the instrument panel blends into the doors, and there are analog gauges, including a 120-m.p.h. speedometer and an 8,000-r.p.m. tachometer. Tinted glass is standard, and the new interior is roomier, both for passengers and for cargo.
Soft plastic makes fit-and-finish the same as that found in most Japanese cars, and there is ample stowage by way of a dashboard shelf, a reasonable glovebox and a console bin with dual cupholders. And, the award for worst ashtray can no longer be awarded to the Escort; it is now useful.
Up front, there are bucket seats, and the hatchback's rear has a bench whose twin seatbacks fold down for toting. The buckets are fairly flat and without much support, but the cloth upholstery does tend to keep you glued in place.
There are all new front and rear suspension components, and the handling is stable and reassuring.
Less expensive models get the 1.9-liter Ford four-cylinder engine that puts out 88 horsepower. The GT has a 127-horse engine with four valves per cylinder and double overhead cams.
Economy with either powerplant is good, and the domestic engine can be expected to get about 30 miles to the gallon. The hotter Japanese engine, hooked to an automatic transmission in the test car, averaged 24 m.p.g.
And economy, of course, is what Escort is about. Ford needs the high-volume gas miser to keep its corporate average fuel economy down so that it can sell more big cars.
But that ledgerdemain will mean little to the average Escort customer. What matters is a sticker that starts at $7,565 for the Pony and doesn't get much beyond $13,000 for the top-of-the-line GT. These days, that's real magic.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Owners Meet to Confront New and Old Issues

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE

 BODY:
The National Football League owners will gather in Dallas on Wednesday and Thursday to address a bushel of items. The agenda includes awarding Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994 to either Atlanta, New Orleans, Tampa, Fla., or Miami; the introduction of the league's new drug advisers, Dr. John Lombardo (steroids) and Dr. Lawrence S. Brown (street drugs), and discussing the merits of allowing corporations to own franchises.
High atop the list, however, is a long look at the collective bargaining status between management and the Players Association.
Presently there is little encouragement that the league will avoid entering a fourth consecutive season without an agreement. The sides are not negotiating and are so far apart that they cannot even agree on whether the Players Association indeed remains a full-fledged union. 
And both sides are entrenched in their positions, with management still seeking to bargain and the association intent on seeking a resolution only through the courts.
 
Panel for Exploring
In March in Orlando, Fla., at the owners' last meeting, Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, named a panel of four club executives to assist Jack Donlan, the Management Council executive director, in exploring new alternatives to reach an agreement with the association.
The group has met at least five times with Donlan, and part of its report in Dallas represents a major shift in management's approach: everything would be on the table in the new negotiations, including free agency.
''We've discussed many free-agency ideas in our meetings along with ideas on benefits and other areas where money can be spent,'' Donlan said. ''But who do we discuss our ideas with? The N.F.L.P.A. is a certified labor organization that won't meet. Players have no one bargaining their share of TV money teams would guarantee as part of a new labor contract.''
Gene Upshaw, executive director of the Players Association, said his goals remain the same: ''For players to receive their fair share of revenues and their freedom to decide who they want to play for.''
 
Similiar Situation
But Upshaw said management's new stance was similar to proposals it made in 1987 but withdrew after initial talks. Last November the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Minneapolis ruled that the free-agency clauses of the last labor agreement in 1982 cannot be challenged as antitrust violations just because negotiations were at an impasse.
After that, Upshaw's group began to decertify so that antitrust laws could apply and so that players could file individual lawsuits. The association changed its tax laws and bylaws and informed players and management that it was no longer a bargaining arm.
''For some reason they believe that if there's a table in front of us, we can get things done,'' Upshaw said. ''If we had just one stick of furniture left in here, they'd still call us a union. But we are never going back to the table to bargain with these people. No way. There is nothing they can say out of Dallas that will get me back at the table. We're not going to bargain and we can't according to our new bylaws. The courts will settle this.''
Management and Tagliabue have called the association a ''union in hiding.'' Both sides have invaded the courts seeking resolutions.
Management's chief court action is a declaratory judgment lawsuit in Minneapolis that asks the judge to examine the record and clarify if the union is still a union. Opening arguments are scheduled for Aug. 12.
 
Cases in Question
The union is hoping three court cases will aid its cause: a petition that the Supreme Court hear its case on whether management should be subject to antitrust laws; a case in Newark filed against the league by eight players including Freeman McNeil of the Jets and Dan Majkowski of the Green Bay Packers that charges collusion by management and argues that they should be free agents because their contracts expired earlier this year while there was no collective bargaining agreement or union in place, and a group of eight developmental players from around the league who charge that the uniform salaries paid to developmental players is unlawful.
Management believes both latter suits will be invalid if it wins the declaratory judgment lawsuit. It has also asked that the McNeil case be moved from Newark to Minneapolis. Arguments for that move are scheduled for June 11 in Newark.
Is the association still a union? That could be the pivotal issue. ''They are still engaging in union activities and admit they have not gone to the National Labor Relations Board to decertify,'' said John Jones, a management council spokesman. ''They continue to certify agents, circulate salary information and effect prices for the entire draft.
''Clearly, they are the union of record.''
 
In the Trade Business
Upshaw now describes his group as a trade association.
''All trade associations support members, give advice and publish facts; they are no different from the Amercian Bar Association, which I am a member of and is certainly not a union,'' said Jeff Kessler, an association attorney. ''The bottom line that the courts will have to decide is what steps are neccessary for a union to decertify.''
A collective bargaining agreement affects many facets of N.F.L. business, including free agency and the Plan B system, drug testing, some owners desire for a rookie wage scale and team salary cap, changes in pensions and benefits and expansion.
Tagliabue wants expansion by 1993. For the first time he and other owners have said that expansion will not be delayed simply because an agreement with the players is not in place.
''I intend to have an affirmative agenda for the league,'' Tagliabue said. ''I do not intend to have the union's policy of confrontation wreck the league's positive agenda and possibly ruin the future of the N.F.L. This is true of expansion and the internationalization of our sport, our drug program and many other issues.''
Norman Braman, the Philadelphia Eagles owner, said: ''Why can't we go on with expansion? What choice do we have? We certainly can't cancel the season or stop growing because of the labor situation.''
 
Diluting the Income
But Art Modell, the Cleveland Browns owner and a member of the league's realignment and expansion committee, said: ''My personal feeling is that expansion cannot go ahead without an agreement. Every two teams you add dilutes by 7.1 percent each team's TV income.
''Before I vote for expansion, I want to know the ground rules of our business. The biggest cost is players. Whatever the end result, through the courts or collective bargaining, everyone needs to know the cost of players and of doing business.''
Gerald Scully, a professor of economics at the University of Texas in Dallas and author of ''The Business of Major League Baseball'' (University of Chicago Press) said the players association's fight over free agency will produce less than it hopes. He questions the association's strategy, and so have others, including the former Miami Dolphins running back, Larry Csonka, who is attempting to form a new union.
The association's course, Scully said, ''helps the union but not the players, and that's not the same thing.''
''I assure you that if 70 percent of the players were actively behind the union, they would be in talks,'' he said. ''But for the last five years fewer than 30 percent of the players have paid union dues largely due to apathy. You're looking at the most ineffective union in professional sports and the most ridiculous labor situation in that arena, too.''

Moving Day for the 1834 Gillette House

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
IN 1834, when Francis Gillette built his country house at what is now 511 Bloomfield Avenue in Hartford, people came by carriage from miles around to admire it. The multicolored stone building in Greek Revival style was a rarity in those days of predominantly wooden construction.
Next Tuesday another gathering is expected to rubber-neck the 4,000-square-foot house in its currently altered state - minus the elegant porches, trussed like a chicken for roasting with its windows and doors boarded up, amputated from its basement - as the house is hoisted onto 140 tons of steel beams.
They will watch the house, mounted on 16 sets of dollies, creep laboriously backward down a grassy slope and over a paved road to 545 Bloomfield Avenue, where it will be lowered onto new footings and refurbished after lying vacant for 17 years. 
When renovations are completed in the fall it will become a group home for six to eight clients of the Oak Hill School, a nonprofit institution for the blind founded in Hartford in 1893. The school currently rents a house from the Cigna Corporation that is scheduled for demolition. The lease will continue in the new location.
''Once we decided to preserve the Gillette house we had a strong bias toward using it for something that had a social purpose,'' said George Trumbull, president of the Cigna Corporation Investment Group.
Cigna, an insurance and financial services company, has owned 655 acres on Bloomfield Avenue and Cottage Grove Road for more than three decades. The Oak Hill and Gillette houses and an additional 29 homes were acquired with the purchase. Three are used for company functions, the rest are rented. Over the years Cigna has built three office buildings for 6,000 employees, a day-care center and two service buildings on the grounds. The Gillette house was nominated by Cigna for listing on the National Register of Historic Places and accepted in 1982 ''based on its significance as an affluent home of the period and the importance of its original owner,'' said Jack Shannahan, director of the Connecticut Historical Commission.
Francis Gillette died in 1879 at the age of 72. He had been a fervent abolitionist, a state senator, a founding member of the Republican Party in Connecticut, an education reformer, founder of The Hartford Evening Press and father of the noted actor William Gillette. During the Civil War, his house was an overnight stop on the underground railroad sheltering escaped slaves enroute from the south to Canada.
Mr. Trumbull said Cigna opted for preservation when the question arose in connection with plans for the company's $300 million mixed-use development called Silver Brook, to be built on land that includes the Gillette property, Oak Hill and three other houses that will be razed.
''Phase one on 75 acres has been approved by the city and we are ready to proceed when the market improves,'' said Mr. Trumbull, referring to a $100 million project with 350,000 square feet of rental office space, 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, a health club and a small hotel.
Oak Hill operates 45 federally and state-supported group homes throughout Connecticut. Visually impaired people of all ages who meet income requirements live in the houses under staff supervision, learning to deal with daily life in an atmosphere resembling a family home. The children go to schools in the community.
''We are very excited at the prospect of moving into the Gillette house,'' said Dr. Lars Guldager, director of Oak Hill. Work on the site began in February. ''It took two weeks to bring in the steel beams, and several weeks more to lower the basement, get the house up on the beams, and grade the back slope down which the house will travel,'' said Brian Payne, who is directing the operation as president of Payne Building Movers of Hampton, N.H. ''The biggest problem was dealing with 22- to 28-inch stone walls where the mortar is a little tender.''
Steel braces were attached to the corners and three lines of cable were run around and through the building, plus diagonal cables across each face. The footprint of the dollies is a few feet larger than the 38- by 67-foot building, and 45 tons of ballast will be added to one side where the house jogs inward.
Pulled by two truck-mounted winches and held back by another winch, the house will travel 2,800 feet. The journey will take five days. The total cost, including moving, landscaping and other site work at both sites, and restoration, will be $1.2 million; no separate cost for the moving alone was made available. Cigna will foot the entire bill.
''The first day we will move 500 feet down the slope and turn right toward the road'' said Mr. Payne. To better negotiate the grassy hill, 100,000 feet of planking will be laid as flooring.
On the second day the house will move along 2,000 feet of level paved road, then stop for two days while the planking is moved to cover a 400-foot grass approach to the excavated site.
The house will be set onto its new footings on the fifth day, after which a contractor will pour the foundation and the steel beams will be extracted.
According to the International Association of Structural Movers, a trade organization based in Elbridge, N.Y., house moving is on the wane, heavily dependent as it is upon upswings of the economic pendulum.
''When the economy is poor and nothing is going on, people don't move houses,'' said Carl Tuxill, executive administrator of the organization.
''When the economy is good and homes are threatened by new highways under construction or industrial plants and big housing developments, we get busy.''
Joseph and James Kazak, brothers who own AA House Movers, based in Euclid, Ohio, estimate that it would cost $20,000 to move a simple, lightweight 3,000-square-foot frame house two miles. This does not include charges by a local utility company to move power lines block after block while the building passes through. That can cost $10,000 or more.
Before hiring Mr. Payne, Cigna contacted 12 companies and considered three bids, learning that most movers operate without insurance and do not have the equipment to handle a 750-ton load such as this.
One of Mr. Payne's employees will manipulate the hydraulically controlled dollies under the house, steering each set over the bumps and adjusting levels to keep the building upright on turns. ''We haven't lost a house yet,'' said Mr. Payne, who has engineered more than 500 such events since 1974.

HEADLINE: The Rising Costs of Closing on a Home

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
WHEN Beth and Timothy Dennis went house hunting on Long Island three years ago, about a year after their marriage, they thought their biggest challenge would be scraping together the down payment and making sure their salaries covered monthly mortgage and tax bills.
That turned out to be the easy part. The shock for the Long Island couple was the amount of cash they discovered they would need for closing costs.
''We were looking for something in the range of $120,000 to $125,000,'' said Mrs. Dennis, who with her husband had accumulated about $25,000 in savings and gift money. ''We had enough for the down payment, but not the closing costs. It was either one or the other, but not both.'' 
In the New York metropolitan area, it is not unusual for closing costs to range from 5 to 7 percent of the purchase price. That means that the cash needed to close a deal on a $200,000 residence - a modest price for a home in this region - can range from $10,000 to $14,000. Added to that is a mortgage down payment of 10 to 20 percent required by most lenders. So just to get in the door, the buyer of a $200,000 residence is looking at a cash outlay of $30,000 to $42,000.
The Dennises deferred their dream of home ownership for nearly two years and moved instead to an apartment with a rent low enough to let them build up their savings. Earlier this month, they were finally able to buy a house, a $110,000 handyman's special in Brentwood, L.I., that they got in a bank foreclosure. They put $23,000 down and their closing costs came to approximately $7,000. Even though Mr. Dennis, who is an electrician, will do much of the work on the house, the couple expect to spend at least $10,000 on renovations before moving in.
''It was hard putting it all together,'' said Mrs. Dennis, who just completed a master's degree in business administration at New York Institute of Technology in Westbury, L.I. ''And we had help from our parents. I can see why most young couples just can't do it, even if they have two incomes.''
More than any other expense associated with buying a home, the cumulative impact of closing costs - loan origination fees, title insurance, charges for credit checks and land surveys, tax escrow money and legal fees - can be the biggest budget-busters for the average home buyer.
''Closing costs come as a shock to many, many people,'' said Stanley Greenstein, vice president of the Mortgage Clearing House, a Long Island mortgage brokerage company. ''This is particularly true for first-time buyers. They know that they need more cash than what they set aside for the down payment, but how much more is usually a surprise.''
For many people buying for the first time, Mr. Greenstein said, the biggest concern is finding a bank that will approve their loan and getting the best deal on a mortgage interest rate.
''The other costs are the last thing on their minds,'' he added, ''so being presented with the complete list for the first time can be almost frightening.''
To help buffer the shock, the Federal Government since 1974 has required lenders to give loan applicants estimates of closing costs. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act provides that within three days of the application the lender must provide in writing a ''good faith'' estimate of the settlement fees.
But the bank's portion of the closing costs can be viewed as the short list of what buyers are likely to have to pay. In addition, there will be state and local taxes, legal fees and other charges.
If it can be said that there are any bargains in closing costs, they go to buyers of cooperative apartments, who buy not real property, but shares in a corporation, thereby escaping such upfront expenses as a title search and insurance and the prepayment of property taxes.
House buyers, on the other hand, pay the highestJU tariff when such expenses as those for property surveys and termite inspections are added to the prepaid property taxes and standard closing costs.
The sellers in any transaction also have closing costs, but they are usually limited to transfer taxes and legal fees and they are rarely as high as those paid by buyers. The biggest expense for sellers is the commission they pay if they sell through a broker. The commission varies, but usually is about six percent of the selling price.
While most closing costs cannot be avoided, there are ways for buyers to ease the financial burden.
''Planning ahead is the key,'' said Joy Borgos, a housing consultant with Westchester Housing Opportunities, a moderate-income home-buying advisory agency in White Plains. ''It is important that buyers know as early as possible exactly what expenses they face so they can start working on making sure that the money will be there when it is time to start writing the checks and so they can shop around for not only the best loan and fee package, but also for ways of reducing the closing costs.'' Mortgage-related closing costs include the loan-origination fee; charges for a title search to insure not only that the owner has the right to sell the house but also that there are no judgments against him or liens against the property; the costs of title insurance, which is the bank's backup for the search; the fee for an appraisal to make sure the loan does not exceed the property's value and, in the case of houses, a land-survey fee.
In addition to the above charges, the bank's costs of processing the loan and a credit check are passed on to the borrower.
ON top of the bank's fees are various property taxes and recording charges imposed by the city and state. Moreover, banks often require that borrowers set up escrow accounts for the prepayment of local property and school taxes.
To these payments the buyer can add legal fees, for his own lawyer and the bank's lawyer, and adjustments owed to the seller for things like heating oil.
Nearly all of these charges are paid at the very end of the transaction when buyer, seller, bankers and lawyers assemble to sign all the papers. The ritual, called a closing, has been known to leave more than a few buyers with check-writer's cramp.
Adding to the financial pressure for buyers these days is the fact that closing costs have risen over the past decade. And the higher price of homes is not the only culprit.
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group based in Washington that represents some 3,300 independently owned mortgage companies and bank mortgage companies, in the mid-70's the settlement fees on the average residential transaction were 3 to 4 percent of the purchase price.
The rise in closing costs can be traced to higher property transfer and mortgage taxes in some places and the volatility of interest rates on home mortgage.
''These days nearly all residential mortgages are sold by the lender to another investor like a pension fund or insurance company,'' said Richard Peach, deputy chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''It used to take three or four years for long-term interest rates to rise just 50 basis points. Now, rates can do that in a day.
''So in order for the original lender to protect his investment from a loss on a drop in the rates before the resale in the secondary mortgage market, points are added to the loan. They are sort of an insurance policy for the lender, and the customer pays for the lender's protection.''
Each point on a mortgage is 1 percent of the loan. The going rate charged by most lenders in the metropolitan area is 2 or 3 points, depending on the type of loan.
Adding to the confusion and uncertainty for some buyers is that closing costs can vary significantly from place to place.
In New York State there is a mortgage recording tax, usually 1 percent of the loan. Of that 1 percent, three-fourths is paid by the buyer and one-fourth by the bank.
IN some cases transfer taxes - usually paid by the seller - are the responsibility of the buyer. In Mount Vernon, for example, a real estate transfer tax of 1 percent of the purchase price, less the first $100,000, is paid by the buyer.
''When it comes to taxes and closings,'' said Vincent D'Andrea, an attorney who practices in Mount Vernon, ''this area is a crazy quilt. Taxes are among the items that can mean a difference of hundreds or thousands of dollars in closing costs for homes that are basically the same price. It all depends on where they are located.''
According to Gary Garrity, a vice president of the American Land Title Association, some regional variations on closing costs have as much to do with local real estate customs as they do with laws or tax policies.
''Take the title search and title insurance for example,'' said Mr. Garrity. ''On the East Coast it is nearly universal for the buyer to pay this charge. But as you move farther west it becomes common for the seller to pay. These differences are not mandated by law but are just the way things are done.''
Another closing cost dictated, in part, by custom is the legal fee. While it is standard for the buyer to pay for the bank's lawyer, there is no legal requirement that he hire an attorney to handle his part of the transaction.
In some parts of the country, like California, while a buyer might have an attorney look over his sales contract and other documents, is not unusual for closings to take place without lawyers in attendance.
Yet in the New York metropolitan area, few buyers or sellers feel comfortable about completing property sales without their lawyers at their side.
In part, this may be the result of rules in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut that prohibit brokers and sales agents from serving as legal advisers. Brokers in this area ususally warn clients that they cannot provide legal advice and this may prompt buyers to seek it from lawyers.
While most closing costs are set, there are ways to whittle them down a bit. One of the first places buyers can look to cut the amount of upfront cash they will need is in choosing a mortgage. Most lenders offer mortgages that allow buyers to trade off points for higher interest rates. But careful consideration of the value of this arrangement is important because the rule of thumb is, the lower the points, the higher the interest rate.
A bank might offer a no-points loan that carries an interest rate of 10.75 percent while a mortgage with the same terms would carry 3 points at a 10.15 rate.
Another option that helps in an initial cash crunch is to add the points and origination fee to the loan amount. The interest rate would not be affected but this plan would add to the overall cost of the loan. Nevertheless, it is an option that some cash-short buyers take to make a purchase possible.
Mrs. Borgos of Westchester Housing Opportunities advises buyers to shop around for some of the services like surveys, appraisals and legal fees, that are not fixed.
She suggested that these days buyers might also be able to use the market's softness as leverage to get sellers to share some closing costs that buyers traditionally take on in order to make a deal.
''This strategy can work for costs that fall into the category of adjustments, like for heating oil left in the tank,'' she said, ''But there is no reason why the buyer should not try for a share arrangement on other expenses like the survey or title search, termite inspection or engineer's report.''
David L. Smith, a partner in the law firm of Rand Rosenzweig Smith & Radley of Manhattan, who practices in both New York and New Jersey, says there are even ways to save on legal fees.
''Hiring a lawyer is like spreading a safety net,'' said Mr. Smith. ''With so much at stake most people just don't want to take the chance that something will go wrong to complicate or ruin a deal. But sometimes lawyers and the people in their office end up doing work that could be done by the client.''
Mr. Smith suggest, for example, that home buyers take on some of the leg work or phone calling required during the transaction.
''Every time I have to make a call to check on a survey or track down a co-op's financial statement or pay a messenger to pick up or deliver a document,'' said Mr. Smith, ''the fee clock is on. At $150 or $200 an hour, the money saved when the buyer does this sort of stuff can add up.''

The Auto Age May Be Exhausted, but What Comes Next?

BYLINE: By Stephen B. Goddard is a lawyer in Hartford.

 BODY:
A CRITIC wrote of Philip II of Spain, who raised political ambition to high art, ''no experience of the failure of his policy could shake his belief in its essential excellence.''
Resonating through time, Philip's moral touched the Hartford area last month, as 125 of the region's powerful gathered to negotiate the terms of what they foresaw as a bitter divorce between its million residents and their gone-to-seed lover, the automobile.
Philip could have conquered all the planets with the money Detroit has spent in this century on marketing. But motorists (that's you and me, folks), who witness the chickens coming home to roost each rush hour, continue their asphalt addiction like one more bad habit. 
When nearly a half-million people commute to work each day, and 80 percent drive alone, it's easy to see why Hartford has a parking and traffic-congestion crisis. So the Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Hartford Transit District have assembled some of the best local minds around to start pulling us out of the quicksand. Their answer: more car pooling, downtown short-hop buses, making downtown employee parking most costly and the use of an abandoned rail line for mass transit.
Now that the cognoscenti are on board, relief cannot be far behind, right? Well, don't bet the farm before considering historical precedent.
In 1957, the most prestigious national transportation conference ever held took place on the Cigna (then Connecticut General) grounds in Bloomfield. Its focus? Traffic congestion. And the Interstate Highway System wasn't even built yet! But the conferees saw it coming. ''We've got a steamroller'' - the Interstates - ''coming our way,'' an economist at the conference said. ''We've got to do something about it or get run over.''
The social critic Lewis Mumford took the podium to excoriate as a phony jingoistic excuse the national defense rationale President Eisenhower had used in championing a public works project that dwarfed the Marshall Plan and the building of the Panama Canal. (The full name of the Interstates is the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways.) Mumford saw the Interstates as ''striking a mortal blow at our railroad system by giving our trucking industry more free roads than they ever had before,'' and he saw as wrongheaded the two-birds-with-one-stone motive of routing the expressways through bulldozed slums.
Few car-related ills that came to pass were not foreseen at that conference, including these:
* The building of the highways through cities rather than around them would intensify congestion.
* The failure of cities and suburbs to plan for the effects of the highways could wreck their financial, social and residential foundations.
* Land-use planning should assert the value that ''highest and best use'' can mean something more than best potential economic return or an ugly sprawl will result.
* Improved arterial highways will be meaningless, unless cities provide adequate parking facilities for increased traffic.
And on that September day when Gov. Orval Faubus of Arkansas was resisting the National Guard's attempt to integrate Little Rock schools, a speaker prophetically addressed these words to the leaders of a metropolitan area that was to become one of the nation's most segregated regions: ''Ten years from now do we want to see cities which are inhabited by low-income white and colored people, while around the city lives a ring of middle and higher-income whites?''
Well, the steamroller did come. We ignored the warning, and while we're not dead yet, we're clearly in intensive care. To their credit, the leaders of the recent transit conference have been working on plans for some time, in the methodical Hartford way, which bring as many diverse factions as possible from private and public sectors under the tent.
Perhaps the most promising plan lies in a commuter link between Union Station in Hartford and Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, along the Griffin Rail Line, heading northwest out of Hartford through Bloomfield. While buses and trolley-style railways were both discussed, most who expressed an opinion weighed in for the perceived long-term efficiencies of light-rail use, patterned after successful ventures in San Diego, Sacramento, Pittsburgh and Baltimore.
When Hitler started at ground zero to build a road, within five years his Autobahnen made up the most sophisticated highway system in the world. But in a pluralistic democracy like ours, clamoring competing needs mandate ladling a dollop on every plate rather than hard-nosed priority setting. To build a Griffin Line mass-transit system appears likely to cost $5 million to $7 million a mile, a hard kernel to crunch in these perilous economic times.
And as long as ''no new taxes'' continues to be the national mantra, don't look for a way out of our deepening transportation dilemma. President Bush served notice in March that states and cities can expect less Federal transportation aid. The news came as New England entered its worst economic slump in a decade.
A despairing President John Adams, who no doubt would be grateful that he was spared the automobile, observed nearly two centuries ago: ''While all other sciences have advanced, government is at a stand; little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago.''

HEADLINE: 11 Vie for Florio and Courter House Seats

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

 BODY:
NOTHING hates a vacuum as much as politics, and the Congressional vacancies created by last year's gubernatorial election are attracting much of the attention in this year's elections.
Jim Florio had served his First Congressional District, in Burlington, Camden and Gloucester Counties, for nearly 16 years when he resigned shortly before taking his oath as Governor in January.
His Republican gubernatorial opponent last November, Representative Jim Courter of Hackettstown, is a 12-year veteran and ranking minority member of the House Armed Services Committee. After initially indicating he would seek re-election to his 12th District seat, Mr. Courter announced that he wanted to spend more time with his family and would leave Congress at the end of this term in January.
Because of the political complexions of the two districts, the winners of the Democratic primary in the First District and the Republican primary in the 12th District on June 5 will be the favorites going into the fall campaign. Each race has attracted four candidates. 
Those running in the First District, in the southern part of the state, are Robert E. Andrews, 32 years old, of Bellmawr, the director of the Camden County Board of Chosen Freeholders: Linda Bowker, 41, of Barrington, the president of the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization for Women; John A. Dramesi, 51, of Blackwood, a Vietnam veteran who served seven years as deputy director of the Office of Veterans' Affairs, until last September, and Joel S. Farley, 35, a Collingswood lawyer.
Mr. Andrews began his political activity by stuffing envelopes in some of Mr. Florio's previous elections. Although Mr. Florio will not endorse anyone in the Democratic primary, his aides say, he might show up for some photo opportunities in his role as Governor and Mr. Andrews's as Freeholder.
 
'The Forgotten Middle Class'
Mr. Andrews said he was running on issues important to ''the forgotten middle class,'' pocketbook issues, crime and the death penalty. He also supports a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. He supports a ban on assault rifles and said the public was being frustrated by New Jersey Supreme Court decisions that have thrown out the first 16 death penalties voted by juries.
He said the district was in need of strategies to create jobs after the recent decision by the Campbell Soup Company to shut down its Camden plant and General Electric's decision to reduce its operations. ''This might sound strange for a Democrat, but I would support President Bush's call for a cut in the capital gains tax on the condition that there be legal assurances that the proceeds of the tax break would be reinvested in the domestic economy,'' he said.
In her bid to win the nomination, Ms. Bowker said she would emphasize her support for abortion rights, for an environmental position that calls for greater recycling efforts and for a national health care program.
She said the nation had a long way to go with its recycling efforts to match the programs in Japan and Europe. ''The Federal Government must develop new markets for recycled material and encourage producers not to package their products with excess material that adds to our disposal problems,'' she said. Ms. Bowker said she was also presenting herself as a change from ''politics as usual.''
Mr. Dramesi ran against Mr. Florio as the Republican Congressional candidate in 1982, but last year came to Mr. Florio's aid when the Democrat's patriotism was attacked during the campaign by Mr. Courter. Mr. Dramesi, who is running this time as a Democrat, said support for veterans' programs was waning both in the state and in Washington. For this reason, he said, groups of veterans circulated nominating petitions for his candidacy without asking him.
 
Trying 'to Be Their Voice'
''I feel a responsibility to them to follow through and try to be their voice in Congress,'' he said.
Mr. Farley is banking on his experience as a staff aide on Capitol Hill, and his experience in winning Democratic committee posts when he was still a teen-ager, to help him win the nomination. He is a former intern in the office of Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri, who died in 1988, and was a staff investigator for the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing.
The Republican nominee will be Daniel J. Mangini, 56, of Turnersville, a Gloucester County Freeholder, who is running unopposed.
The Republican candidates in the 12th District are Dick Zimmer, 45, of Flemington, a member of the State Senate; Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, 44, of Morristown, a State Assemblyman; Phil McConkey, 33, of Flemington, a professional football player, and Joseph F. Shanahan, 76, of Lambertville, the president of the Hunterdon County Citizens and Taxpayers Association.
Mr. Frelinghuysen, whose family has produced four United States Senators and a Representative, is hoping that the family name and his record of service as a Morris County Freeholder and a three-term Assemblyman will help him win the nomination. His chief problem is geographical since his Morris County base makes up only a small part of the Congressional district, which also includes all of Hunterdon County and parts of Somerset, Sussex, Mercer, Middlesex and Warren.
But Mr. Frelinghuysen said the support he was receiving from the Somerset County Republican Party chairman, Jack Penn, former State Senator Raymond H. Bateman and former Representative Millicent Fenwick has broadened his base of support.
''I also have a fairly strong presence in Princeton, which was represented for several years in Congress by my father and where several family members live,'' he said. The economy and the environment, ''especially the disappearance of open space,'' are the chief issues in the campaign, he said.
 
Advisers on Issues Enlisted
Mr. Zimmer, whose Senate district includes parts of four counties in the Congressional district, has been endorsed by the party organizations of Hunterdon, Mercer and Middlesex Counties. He also has enlisted some prominent Republicans, including former State Attorney General Cary Edwards and Senator John Bennett of Monmouth County, as advisers on drugs, the environment and other issues.
Both state legislators are members of the State Joint Appropriations Committee and oppose Governor Florio's proposed tax increases to balance the budget. Mr. Zimmer said he also voted against the last three state budgets ''because I knew we couldn't continue to increase spending at a breakneck pace without hitting a brick wall.'' He was the sponsor of the Farmland Preservation Act, which he said has saved 40,000 acres of farmland from development.
Mr. Courter has not endorsed anyone in the race, although he has agreed to become an adviser for Mr. Zimmer and Mr. McConkey on foreign affairs and defense. Both men supported his gubernatorial campaign last year. Mr. Frelinghuysen backed former Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick of Westfield in the gubernatorial primary, and in 1982 opposed Mr. Courter in the Congressional primary.
Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who is now the president of Drew University, has appeared in campaign videos made for both Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Frelinghuysen. The candidates will mail copies to potential Republican voters in the district.
Mr. McConkey, the former punt returner and receiver for the New York Giants, now plays for the San Diego Chargers. He does not have the name recognition problem of most first-time candidates and has been waging an active campaign tied to top foreign news developments. He recently criticized the White House for what he called ''abandoning the Lithuanian people in their hour of need,'' and for granting the Soviet Union favored nation'' trade status at a time when it was using embargoes against Lithuania to force the Baltic state to abandon its independence movement.
Mr. Shanahan, a former Lambertville Councilman, describes himself as a ''semiretired'' lawyer and an ''independent-minded Republican.'' He argues that he will make the best fiscal watchdog in the race ''because both political parties are committed to spending.''
On the abortion issue, Mr. Frelinghuysen and Mr. Zimmer have long supported a woman's right to choose abortion, while Mr. McConkey and Mr. Shanahan are opposed to abortion.
There is also a contest for the Democratic nomination, between Marguerite Chandler, 46, of Somerville, a businesswoman, and James F. Cleary of Bound Brook, a supporter of Lyndon H. LaRouche, the political extremist who was sentenced last year to 15 years in prison on charges that included mail fraud.

HEADLINE: HOME CLINIC;
Installing a Ceiling Fan

BYLINE: By JOHN WARDE

 BODY:
LARGE-BLADED ceiling fans are more economical to operate than air-conditioners and can add to comfort and energy savings the year round.
In summer, a fan produces a feeling of coolness by creating wind chill - air currents passing over the skin - even though air temperature is not actually reduced. An air-conditioned room in which a fan is operating also will feel cooler, and as a result the air-conditioner's thermostat can be set higher. This saves energy because the air-conditioner is used less. In winter, operating a ceiling fan mixes warm and cool layers of air. By running the fan in reverse (most ceiling fans are reversible), warm air that rises naturally toward the ceiling, where it is wasted, is instead forced toward the floor, where it can be felt. This permits setting the thermostat controlling the home's heating system lower, again saving energy because the system is used less. 
When choosing a fan, consider the characteristics of the room where it is to be installed. Fans provide the greatest benefit when in rooms occupied most frequently. For approximately square rooms that measure no more than 12 feet on a side, select a fan with a blade-span of about 40 inches. For rooms measuring up to 12 by 18 feet, select a fan with a blade-span of about 50 inches.
Fans spanning as much as 60 inches are also available. These work well in large entry halls or in stairwells. However, for large rooms longer than 18 feet, two or more medium-size fans will produce better results.
Hang a single fan in the center of a room. Hang multiple fans at equal distances from each other at intervals recommended by the manufacturer. To prevent a fan from wobbling because of uneven air flow, the tips of the blades must be at least 24 inches from walls, sloping ceilings and tall furniture. With tall furniture, be sure to allow room for opening cabinet doors.
To improve air circulation where it is needed most, fans should be hung so that the blades are no higher than nine feet above the floor. For safety, blades must not be lower than seven feet. The minimum space between the blades and the ceiling should be about 12 inches, else the fan will lose considerable effectiveness.
Most fans meet these requirements when attached to a standard eight-foot-high ceiling. For higher ceilings, extension rods are available from fan manufacturers. For lower ceilings or where lights attached beneath a fan will interfere with headroom, low-ceiling adapter kits can be obtained. Adapter kits are also available for hanging fans from slanted ceilings.
The easiest method for installing a ceiling fan is to attach it in place of an existing ceiling light. Before starting, check with a local building inspector to ascertain whether amateurs are allowed to do the work and what procedures must be followed.
Begin by shutting off all power to the ceiling circuit by removing the fuse or tripping the circuit-breaker at the service panel. Then remove the ceiling light and examine the outlet box above it.
Fans weighing up to 35 pounds can usually be mounted to a standard 4-inch-wide octagonal metal outlet box, provided the box is attached to a metal bar or sturdy wooden support fastened between two of the ceiling joists. Instructions included with the fan should specifiy mounting requirements. Plastic outlet boxes cannot be used.
If the box is not attached this way, or is plastic, or if no ceiling light is present, obtain a hanger kit (available from most fan manufacturers). The kit usually consists of telescoping metal bars that can be extended between a pair of joists after being inserted through an opening cut in the ceiling with a keyhole saw or saber saw.
Where no wiring is present, surface wiring, available at home centers, can be used to bring current to the fan from another location and for installing a wall switch.
After the outlet box is securely anchored, attach the fan's mounting bracket to it with screws. A common style of bracket is slotted, and designed to accept the ball-shaped end of the fan's hanger pole.
Next, slip the decorative canopy that covers the mounting bracket over the end of the pole. Then lift the hanger pole, to which the fan motor is attached at the other end, into place on the bracket.
Connect the wires from the motor to those of the ceiling circuit, following the fan manufacturer's instructions. The procedure is usually simple. It involves joining wires of similar colors with threaded plastic caps called wire nuts, which are generally included.
Inspect your work when finished, then tuck the wiring inside the mounting bracket. Slide the canopy over the bracket and attach it with the screws provided.
Lay the fan blades flat on a table and check for warping. If any are warped, obtain replacements from the manufacturer. Blades are usually attached with bolts and nuts to brackets; these, in turn, are attached to the motor. When attaching a blade to a bracket, tighten the bolts in stages to prevent warping.
Bolt the brackets to the fan motor after all the blades are attached. Make sure the brackets are right side up so that the angle of the blades is correct. If the fan is equipped with a light fixture, install the bulbs.
Test the fan when it is completely assembled. If it wobbles, stop the motor and measure the distance between the tip of each blade and the ceiling by holding a ruler or yardstick vertically against the ceiling and revolving the fan blades by hand against it.
If different measurements are obtained, gently bend the blade brackets where they join the motor until all are equal. During this test, be sure the fan hangs level.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
After a Pause, A Prospect Of New Growth

BYLINE: By Stephen J. Kukan; Stephen J. Kukan is general manager of area development for the Public Service Electric and Gas Company in Newark.

 BODY:
THE New Jersey economy softened considerably in 1989. But the existing inventory of office space was reduced, since new construction was minimal. There are many economic-development professionals who have said that this moderation in the level of development activity has been for the better. 
Planning toward a goal of balanced and practical development is given the opportunity to take place as we pause to catch our collective breath after a period of unprecedented growth. Infrastructure improvements are being made, through joint public and private-sector efforts.
The true development professional is awaiting the absorption of available building inventory before constructing new speculative buildings. This absorption is becoming apparent. Vacancy rates as high as 30 percent or above in certain areas are being replaced with a much improved average of 20 percent or below. Some areas, like the Metro Park section of Woodbridge, have virtually no available space.
It is important that we remember that the commercial and industrial construction business is one of peaks and valleys; high demand and low inventory create the valleys of available space, and low demand and high inventory levels create the peaks. As the present inventory stays relatively constant, the demand for space will reduce the inventory and serve to encourage developers to begin new construction.
As in recent years, commercial users of space will represent the bulk of this new business activity. In particular, the finance, insurance and real-estate industries will be well represented. Traditional operating and occupancy costs savings in New Jersey are attractive to back-office operations for these types of companies.
Also, telecommunications capabilities offered in New Jersey are state of the art. These benefits will continue to play an important part in making the state attractive for corporate investment.
Similarly, locations with exceptional accessibility to markets like northeastern New Jersey (Bergen, Hudson, Essex and Passaic Counties) and southwestern New Jersey (Burlington and Camden Counties) promise to do well. Northwestern and southeastern New Jersey should enjoy a continuation of high levels of residential and smaller-scale commercial and industrial activity.
Speaking of industrial activity, certain market-oriented industrial-type companies have been showing surprising locational strength. For instance, companies involved in printing, software and apparel continue to seek New Jersey locations to be near the markets for their goods. Certain of these market-oriented companies have been seeking urban location opportunities in an effort to reduce facility costs by occupying older tenant mill-type space.
At the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, we feel that New Jersey's urban areas represent new redevelopment efforts. The cities typically are well located with underutilized infrastructure (albeit in need of upgrading). Unemployment levels in New Jersey average under 4 percent while the cities offer a labor resource at three or four times that level.
Fortunately, New Jersey's cities have begun to experience growing corporate and developer interest. Given public-sector assistance programs aimed at creating urban redevelopment opportunities (the state's Urban Enterprise Zone program, Urban Development Corporation, etc.) and a growing awareness of the cities (perhaps helped by Public Service's Urban Initiative Campaign), the future economic outlook of our cities should mirror the positive trend of the total state economy.

Disciplinary Acts Raise Questions On Free Speech

DATELINE: WHEATON, Ill.

 BODY:
The right to free speech clashed with Christianideals of ''responsible freedom'' at Wheaton College last week as nine students were disciplined for pieces printed in a student-run alternative newspaper.
All students at Wheaton, a Christian-run liberal arts college of 2,500 in the west Chicago suburb of the same name and alma mater of the evangelist Billy Graham, are required to sign a ''statement of responsibilities'' at the start of freshman year. The statement enumerates Biblical principles of ''Christian character and behavior'' and outlines a Christian life style that excludes jealousy, lust, drinking and profanity, among other things.
Administrators and some students feel that a poem and a stream of consciousness article published in the last two issues of the paper, called The Ice-Cream Socialist, broke the principles of the statement, known as ''the Pledge.'' 
David Vanderveen, a political science major with one semester left before graduation from Spring Lake, Mich., was given a choice of withdrawing from the college at the end of the semester or facing expulsion proceedings. He published the poem in the March 30 issue of The Socialist drawing implicit analogies between surfing and sex.
 
A Dream Sequence
Mr. Vanderveen chose to withdraw. Administration officials say that the publication of the poem ends a two-year-long record of pledge infractions, which they declined to specify.
Two other students, Stephen Smith, a junior business and economics major from Buckland, Mass., and Robert Bruce, a communications major from Wheaton, face suspension during the fall semester for publishing the stream of consciousness piece, signed with a pseudonym. The piece, printed in the April 20 issue, included a dream sequence in which the author defecates on a stack of religious books on the desk of the dean of students.
Mr. Smith and Mr. Bruce were among eight editors of the newspaper. They accepted responsibility for publishing the article, but say it was the result of miscommunication among the editors. Those who decided which articles to print were not present when the paper was laid out.
The other six student editors involved face lesser penalties. They had to write letters to the administration explaining why the piece's publication was inappropriate and why they wanted to remain at the school. They were placed on disciplinary probation and will spend the summer writing papers, due in the fall, about ''being Christians in the world.''
Many students in the college believe the penalties levied on all nine students were too harsh, and 200 turned out for a rally on Tuesday afternoon, in the middle of final examinations week, charging that the college was stifling their First Amendment rights of free speech.
J. Richard Chase, president of the college, vigorously defended his administration's policy after the rally. ''Our students have the right to disagree with the faculty,'' he said. But he added that they must not do so in ''language we believe is unbecoming to a Christian community.''
Students involved with the paper maintain that the penalties were unreasonable. Jean Philips, a freshman literature and philosophy major from Glen Ellyn, Ill., said she thought that the administration's stance was not made clear until it was too late.
After the April 20 issue, she said, ''We were called in and told to use more discretion.'' Some time passed, no more issues ran and disciplinary decisions had not yet been handed down. Then, Ms. Philips said, ''We were told not to print anything else for the rest of the year.''
The students started the paper in September as an ''alternative, open forum newspaper,'' Ms. Philips said. They saw the paper as a way around the administration's control of the school's official newspaper, yearbook and literary magazine. Both students and administrators report that the newspaper was well received until the appearance of Mr. Vanderveen's poem.
Ms. Philips said they had been taking their editorial cues from a casual conversation she had earlier in the year with Mr. Chase. ''He said he didn't mind it as long as it didn't have an agenda to attack Christianity or higher education,'' she reported.
Wheaton officials stressed that two different issues are involved in the disciplinary procedures. Mr. Vanderveen was punished as an individual with pledge offenses, while the others were punished for allowing the offensive work of another individual to be published.

A Different Kind Of Education: Going on Patrol

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
While other students are completing problem sets and studying for exams, some college students here are putting their fears aside, donning red berets and, as Guardian Angels, patrolling this city in an effort to combat crime.
Two of the roughly 75 members of the group's Chicago chapter - Gabriel Irono and Steve Mandis - are sophomores at the University of Chicago.
''There is so much violence here, especially close to the school,'' Mr. Mandis, an economics major from Grand Rapids, Mich., said. ''This is a solution.'' 
It is also a learning experience for him and Mr. Irono, a Japanese history major from Park Forest, a nearby suburb. ''There's a whole different set of values people get from living on the street,'' Mr. Mandis said. ''They struggle to survive from day to day. It's an education for me. I didn't grow up in that; I didn't even lock my door.''
 
'We're All the Same'
Founded in New York City by Curtis Sliwa in 1979, the Alliance of Guardian Angels now has chapters in 60 American cities as well as in Europe and Canada. Known for their red berets, the Guardian Angels are trained in the martial arts but do not carry weapons. Although their relations with the police are mixed, they frequently make citizens' arrests.
The makeup of the chapter here ranges from students like Mr. Irono and Mr. Mandis to former gang members, but Mr. Mandis and others insist that the different backgrounds matter little when they are on the job. ''On the street, we're all the same,'' Mr. Mandis said. About a third of the group's members are college students in the Chicago area, said Sergio Terrazas, the leader of the city chapter. ''They're a lot more mature and a lot more responsible than high school students,'' Mr. Terrazas said. ''They know it's important to be on time.''
A recent patrol was made up entirely of college students. Joining Mr. Mandis and Mr. Irono was Walter Kappel, who studies at the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. They were led by Kyle Stanford, a junior from Indianapolis majoring in philosophy at Northwestern University.
 
'No Smiling or Talking'
Mr. Stanford's patrol began at the group's headquarters in the Wicker Park neighborhood on the north side of the city. Walking to a nearby elevated train station, Mr. Irono and Mr. Stanford stayed ahead while Mr. Kappel and Mr. Mandis lagged 10 paces behind them to avoid clumping up if they were attacked. In the last three years in Chicago, several Guardian Angels have been shot at but none have been wounded or killed, Mr. Terrazas said.
After boarding the train, the four spread out, moving from car to car. ''There's no smiling or talking,'' Mr. Irono said. ''You've got to look menacing to thugs but helpful to citizens.''
Mr. Mandis added, ''I just look at people's hands and make sure nothing happens.''
While on patrol, the Guardian Angels use what they call code names. Mr. Mandis, who plans to spend next year at the London School of Economics and serve as a Guardian Angel in London, is known as Professor. Mr. Irono chose the name Kaze, which means the wind in Japanese.
The patrol leader, Mr. Stanford, is called Phoenix. Each patrol leader has a two-way radio and checks in regularly with headquarters, known as ''The Cage.''
On this patrol, which proves to be uneventful, the four spend about two hours on the trains, riding between the north and south sides of the city. They switch trains frequently. Prayer Before Each Patrol Since joining the Guardian Angels nine weeks ago, Mr. Mandis and his patrol have stopped a mugging and disarmed a gang member who had a gun. ''There hasn't been much crime,'' he said. ''The best thing is for it not to happen. It's just a matter of presence.''
Both he and Mr. Irono said that fear comes with the job. ''I say a prayer before every patrol,'' Mr. Mandis said. Mr. Irono, who has been a Guardian Angel for almost four months, said: ''I'm always scared. The idea is to control it and not to let it show.''
After an hour and a half, Mr. Stanford heads home to Evanston and Mr. Irono radios ''Kaze to Cage, Mr. Phoenix has turned the patrol over to me.'' As patrol leader, Mr. Irono must keep an eye on his fellow Guardian Angels as well as the train's passengers.
Later, after returning to headquarters, Mr. Irono gives up his uniform and then makes his way back to Hyde Park and the life of a college student. ''It's good to take this weight off your shoulders,'' he said. ''You're not responsible for four people's lives anymore.''

First a Newsletter, Soon a Newspaper On Muslim Issues

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Special-interest newspapers abound at the University of California at Los Angeles: Nommo, for black students; La Gente, for Hispanic students; Ha'Am, for Jewish students; Together, for feminists; Pacties, for Asians and Pacific Islanders, and TenPercent, for homosexuals.
Now add Al-Talib, first published as a newsletter several months ago to cover Islamic issues and culture.
Al-Talib - the name means ''the student'' - will be transformed from a newsletter into a newspaper through the Associated Students of the University of California at Los Angeles. Working through the association means Al-Talib can use its office space, advisers and equipment, including a computer system. 
Scheduled to appear six times a year beginning next fall, Al-Talib will be written and edited by students.
The Student Publications Board has selected Mansur Khan, a senior biology major from Monterey Park, Calif., as the paper's editor.
''Al-Talib is filling the void of a Muslim voice on campus,'' Mr. Khan said.
Maha Youness, a junior political science major from Glendale, Calif., who is Muslim, said that through Al-Talib, ''Maybe some Muslims won't feel so detached from our society.''
The president of the Muslim Student Association, Rushdi Cader, a senior biology major from Los Angeles, estimated that about 300 Muslim students are enrolled at UCLA.
''There has been a stereotype that Muslims are violent and thrive on terrorism,'' said Rumi Abdul Cader, a recent graduate from Torrance, Calif., who edited Al-Talib as a newsletter. ''But that really isn't true. We would like to use Al-Talib to dispel those myths by representing Islam as it is.''
Mr. Khan said the publication will try to reach a broad readership, including political science majors, would-be scientists and researchers or anyone else who expects to work with Muslims or in Muslim countries.
''It won't be the spokesman of a religious organization,'' said a publications board member, Sumit Chadha, a graduate student in economics from New Delhi.

Culture Shock in Hwang's 'F.O.B.'

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW

 BODY:
At the end of the first act of David Henry Hwang's ''F.O.B.,'' there is a mirthful eating scene that summarizes the conflict between an American-born young man of Chinese descent and a newly landed immigrant, fresh off the boat (F.O.B.) from China. The newcomer, played by Dennis Dun, pours a jar of fiery hot sauce over his dinner and eats it as if it were the most savory of delights. The American (Stan Egi) feels forced to compete, but his tastebuds have become accustomed to the blandness of fast food and he is soon gasping for breath. He continues the competition while the F.O.B. smiles - dare one say it? - inscrutably.
Mr. Hwang's play, first produced in New York in 1980, has been revived by the Pan Asian Repertory Theater at Playhouse 46, in a production directed by the author. While the play is not as poetic as his subsequent ''Dance and the Railroad,'' it offers a clear indication of Mr. Hwang's nascent talent and his social concern. In contrast to some of his subsequent work, it is free of pretension, even as it enters the world of myth. 
''F.O.B.'' begins as a comedy about the possibilities and perils of assimilation, but it aspires to a deeper metaphorical level. The F.O.B. regards himself as an incarnation of Gwan Gung, a legendary Chinese warrior. In response to his acting-out of a Gwan Gung story, his American friend (Ann M. Tsuji) assumes the air of a warrior queen.
Mixing ritual and music, the play enlarges the portrait of a people trying to determine its place in an alien environment. Each of the three characters has a disparate response. Mr. Egi, already racing on the fast track to economic success, has become overly Americanized. He is determined to remove himself from the ''yellow ghosts'' of his past. Ms. Tsuji seeks to combine ancient and modern traditions while going to college and working in her father's restaurant. Mr. Dun, as the mysterious F.O.B., is clownishly deceptive, pretending to be the rawest of greenhorns while actually being a man of intellectual mettle.
While one misses the balletic grace of John Lone, who played the title role in the original New York production, the author has given his play a stylish, highly professional production. Mr. Egi, as a man climbing up from the upper middle class, is an amusing picture of sleek American consumerism. His opposite, Mr. Dun - familiar to television audiences for his role on ''Midnight Caller'' - slips neatly out of his assumed naivete to his mission as cool master of martial arts.
In the pivotal role, Ms. Tsuji is charming. She is a born peacemaker trying to referee the conflict (over ethnicity as well as hot sauce) without discouraging the attention she receives from both young men. In common with Mr. Dun, she is agile in her stage movements, as choreographed by Jamie H. J. Guan. Alex Polner's scenic design for the back room of a family restaurant adds a necessary note of reality, but it is almost too detailed for a small stage. On opening night, the preponderance of properties turned the setting into an obstacle course for the actors.
Mr. Hwang, who also wrote ''M. Butterfly,'' has said that one of his inspirations for ''F.O.B.'' was Maxine Hong Kingston's book ''The Woman Warrior.'' Ms. Kingston returned the compliment in her foreword to a collection of Mr. Hwang's plays, expressing her wonder that through his work ''our private Chinese lives and secret language can be communally understood.''
In ''F.O.B.,'' the playwright entreats theatergoers to leave all preconceptions behind and to open their minds to the warring subdivisions in what would appear to be a homogeneous community. The fact of these differences within the Asian-American culture is itself a moving commentary, especially during a time of increased tension between races.

Stamps

BYLINE: By Barth Healey

 BODY:
An important focus of do-it-yourself stamp collecting is the maximum card, which straddles the intersection of philately and deltiology - the study of postcards.
The definition of a maximum card is as vague as the definition of a ''stamp,'' and forces yet another repetition of the hobbyist's first rule: collect whatever interests you, and let the self-styled purist stew.
In general, a maximum card is a picture postcard bearing a stamp or a cancellation, or preferably both, that is closely related to the subject of the card's design.
The first such cards date to the early years of this century, and typically show the portrait of a monarch, embellished with a stamp bearing a similar portrait, and canceled on a date important to the ruler, e.g., a coronation anniversary. 
As more countries began to issue pictorial stamps in the 1920's and 30's, collectors sought out postcards of the churches and castles that appeared on the stamps and had them canceled in the cities where the buildings were located. Such collections became an interesting way for travelers to mark their journeys with souvenirs and acquire a name: maximaphily.
In modern times, this sector has taken an entrepreneurial twist: commercial dealers now print postcards with designs or portraits similar to those on new stamps and then have the stamps affixed and canceled on the first day of issue. One of the largest such distributors is the Unicover Corporation, 1 Unicover Center, Cheyenne, Wyo. 82008.
Traditionalists will say that having a special card made for a stamp is cheating: much of the challenge of maximaphily is in finding existing cards to match the stamp. But the Unicover cards, though a bit pricey at $1.25 each, are of high quality and might interest younger or older collectors who cannot get around to flea markets and other sources of postcards. The cards, which are available by subscription, include historical notes on the back.
Several United States issues this year offer a chance to get started in maximaphily. The Classic Movies set, for example, can be used on old postcards showing Judy Garland, John Wayne, Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh or Gary Cooper. Try combining an appropriate card with its stamp, then send the card to the postmaster of the star's birthplace and have it canceled on the birthdate.
More difficult to find would be postcards showing the five lighthouses in the current booklet of 25-cent stamps. Add the stamps, then send the cards to the towns where the lighthouses are located and ask the postmaster to hand-cancel the cards.
Another issue this year that lends itself to maximaphily will be the five Olympians on a July 6 issue. (Only one has been named so far: Jesse Owens.) In each case, a hobbyist can take advantage of the 30-day grace period in requesting first-day cancels on cards franked with the new stamps. Hobbyists seeking more information about this area can write to the Maximum Card Study Unit, 1437 Maryland Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45230.
 
Model A Scholarship
An attractive replica of the 1929 Model A Ford postal truck is being sold through post offices and by mail to raise scholarship funds for children of postal employees. The toy would make an interesting gift for a youngster or decoration in a stamp den.
The replica, 6 1/2 inches long, has been produced by the Yorkshire Company, Glen Ellyn, Ill., and is priced at $29.95. Those ordering by mail can send a check or money order to the Hallbeck Scholarship Fund, 1300 L Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005. Add $3.50 for shipping and handling.
Two footnotes: This ''issue'' is described as the beginning of an annual series and collecting such models has become a mini-hobby in itself. When the last of the real Model A trucks was taken out of service in the 1950's, some were sold as scrap for as little as $8, about one-quarter the price of today's toy. Somewhere in there is a message about inflation.
 
INCH BY INCH: VAN GOGH VS. JENNY
Well, yes, van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' was sold this week for $82.5 million, a record for a piece of art. The price was well above the previous record of $53.9 million, which was paid for van Gogh's ''Irises'' in November 1987. At this rate, the value of art may well catch up with the value of United States stamps.
''Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' is 28 3/8 by 22 inches, or 580 1/4 square inches. So the $82.5 million works out to only $142,180 a square inch. But if we're talking real money, what about the plate block from the sheet of airmail stamps known as the ''Inverted Jenny,'' with the upside-down biplane in the center? This block went for $1.1 million last fall. It is 2 5/8 by 2 5/8 inches, or about 6.89 square inches, and that works out to $159,652 per square inch.
The most valuable United States stamp is an item most collectors have never heard of: The 15-cent black portrait of Lincoln from the 1860's with a Z grill on the paper, which absorbed cancellation ink to prevent re-use. The last time the 15-cent Z grill was sold, it fetched $418,000. It is only 1 1/4 square inches, so that works out to $334,400 a square inch. Keep plugging, art collectors! You may catch up!

Can Politics Get to the Roots of Racial Strife?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
IF David N. Dinkins was judged more harshly than his white rivals in last year's New York City mayoral campaign, as he repeatedly complained, he also benefited from a double standard: Some voters hoped that the election of a black, particularly in a city of reverberating symbols, might ameliorate racial tensions.
In the half year since Mr. Dinkins was elected, there is little palpable evidence that race relations have improved in the nation's largest city. What seems evident is that neither the persistent roots of racial tension nor its sometimes murderous manifestations are within a politician's power to control. Minority groups already have equal opportunity under the law, but there may be little any mayor can do about some of the causes behind racial conflict, particularly when the city has more good intentions than money. Moreover, as racially charged court cases heightened tension, it remained an open question whether Mr. Dinkins's polite appeals to reason would reach any deeper into the personal resentments of Bensonhurst and East New York than Edward I. Koch's sometimes prickly pronunciamentos.
Thursday, on the 10th full day of deliberatons, a Brooklyn jury convicted a 19-year-old white man from the Bensonhurst section of the racial killing of Yusuf K. Hawkins, a 16-year-old black youth from East New York. The next evening, another jury acquitted the accused ringleader of murder but convicted him of a dozen lesser charges. 
In a curious way, the murder conviction perhaps calmed Mr. Dinkins's uneasy white supporters for the moment even more than his election did and probably more than his subsequent campaign to paper over racial divisions with speeches. Meanwhile, the initial euphoria of Mr. Dinkins's supporters in the black community has been tempered by the harsh reality of austerity, which has further confined the Mayor's personal stamp on municipal priorities to the margins (even false hopes were better than no hope, Mr. Dinkins had suggested during his campaign).
But the pattern of dashed hopes is nothing new. Nathan Glazer, who wrote ''Beyond the Melting Pot'' with Daniel P. Moynihan three decades ago, now acknowledges that he was laboring under a ''New York illusion'' when he predicted that American-born blacks, like other newcomers to the city, would overcome the ghetto. However much ethnic ingredients can be merged in the city's simmering brew, blacks and whites will always be distinguishable. Ethnic identity, Mr. Glazer said, ''is pretty thin gruel compared to race.''
In few other nations than the United States and in few other cities than New York is racial tolerance put to so tough a test. Indeed, in 1947, Gov. Thomas E. Dewey declared that ''New York City is not a melting pot, it's a boiling pot.''
A century after the civil war, the civil rights movement largely succeeded in toppling the most visible forms of officially sanctioned racism. Racism has evolved into what most people consider a pejorative term. Yet most black Americans, as W.E.B. Du Bois once wrote, remain ''a part of the larger whole and yet apart from it.'' And if tense confrontations two or more decades ago represented a collision of institutional forces -the strike by city teachers over community control of schools, for instance - today's conflicts are more likely to be personal - a consequence, in part, of integration that has increased encounters between the races.
If, besides an affirmation of the jury system, any progress can be detected from the Hawkins case, it is that 30 years ago it might never have occurred to Mr. Hawkins to venture into the predominantly white neighborhood at all. Nor would David N. Dinkins have run for mayor, much less have won.
If New York is a latecomer to black political ascendancy in state and local government - Carl Stokes was elected mayor of Cleveland fully two decades earlier -Mr. Dinkins's victory revived a soul-searching debate: Purely from a racial perspective, is a black mayor a panacea or a placebo? Does Mr. Dinkins's election and those of fellow black mayors in Seattle and New Haven, and of L. Douglas Wilder in Virginia as the nation's first elected black governor last year, signal an overdue coming to grips with what Gunnar Myrdal called America's special dilemma? Or are the periodic violent confrontations that in recent years etched the names of two New York City neighborhoods - Bensonhurst and Howard Beach - into the collective memory of wary blacks symptomatic of enduring, if often latent, racism?
Mr. Hawkins's murder, and that of Michael Griffith in the Howard Beach section of Queens in 1986, dramatized how implacable are the unmapped barriers that divide many neighborhoods in the city. Several years ago, responding to a New York Times/WCBS-TV News survey, 7 in 10 white New Yorkers and 6 in 10 blacks said they lived in neighborhoods composed mostly or entirely of members of their own race.
''New Yorkers,'' Andrew Hacker, a professor of political science at Queens College of the City University of New York, once wrote, ''think and feel and act and react as if race was the critical demarcation in their city's life.'' But why? Denigrating others on the basis of race, said Shelby Steele, a professor of English at San Jose State University, has historically represented ''a shortcut to the American dream.'' Moreover, many people associate blacks with poverty and its most threatening consequence, crime. ''If white citizens act according to stereotypes,'' Mr. Hacker wrote, ''it is because they prefer playing it safe to a scholarly pursuit of truth. With respect to everyday decisions, racism may be the most rational response.''
The truth, painfully apparent to black people, is that while most criminals in New York are black, so are most of their victims. In 1984, the undercurrent of racial tension was epitomized when Bernhard H. Goetz, a white man, shot black teen-agers he believed were about to rob him on a subway train. A subsequent Times/ WCBS News poll asked riders whether they would feel unsafe if they saw several loud teen-aged boys on their subway car. Yes, 4 in 10 black respondents said, if the boys were white. What if the boys were black? In that case, 5 in 10 black respondents said they would feel unsafe. (Whites, generally, were more afraid of all unruly teen-agers, black and white.) In a Times/WCBS-TV News survey during last year's mayoral campaign, more than half the respondents said race relations are something a mayor can do a lot about. Only about 1 in 5 said the election of Mr. Dinkins would lead to a decrease in racial tensions. That was before the murder of Mr. Hawkins unsettled the city. Mr. Dinkins, perceived because of his personality and his race as the candidate who could best bring New Yorkers together, unseated Mr. Koch a few weeks later in the Democratic primary. But the general election campaign against Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican candidate, culminated in the city's closest mayoral race since 1905. A voter survey found that 4 in 10 Giuliani voters thought Mr. Dinkins would favor blacks; 4 in 10 Dinkins voters thought Mr. Giuliani would favor whites.
Two-thirds of the whites and 9 in 10 blacks voted for a candidate of their own race, a sharp division, but less severe than the cleavage in Chicago earlier last year, when 9 of 10 voters, whether black or white, voted for a mayoral candidate of their own race. However close the margin, New York had its first black mayor. ''That,'' said Frank J. Barbaro, a Brooklyn Assemblyman who lost resoundingly to Mr. Koch in 1981, ''could not have happened if New York City was a center of hate.''
Or could it? If Mr. Dinkins benefited at all from his fellow New Yorkers' fears and frustration over racial discord, he inherited a special burden in the hometown he frequently hailed as a ''gorgeous mosaic.''
''Along with that goes the obligation to keep the mosaic together,'' said Roscoe C. Brown Jr., president of Bronx Community College.
''There's an unstated white pressure,'' said Mr. Hacker: ''Why can't you control your people?''
It was precisely that pressure that moved Mr. Dinkins this month to denounce all of the disparate voices of racism in the city and to appeal for calm as juries decided the Hawkins case and as blacks continued a boycott of two Flatbush vegetable markets managed by Koreans.
That both Mr. Dinkins and his most visible appointee, Lee P. Brown, the Police Commissioner, are black may indeed have a leavening effect, though the record of black mayors elsewhere is inconclusive. ''By and large I would think they have had a harmonious effect,'' said Linda F. Williams, a fellow at the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. ''Maybe some things that would blow up don't. It would seem, at least, that in those cities the mayor certainly hasn't increased racial problems.''
But what whites want, the Rev. Al Sharpton said last week, is ''quiet, not peace.'' Mr. Sharpton, a provocateur par excellence, has made a career out of making certain that they don't get it. While Mr. Sharpton is, in large part, a creature of the white media, he has nonetheless struck a responsive chord among many blacks who daily suffer indignities ranging from discrimination in housing to taxi service. They resent a society that measures their lives in white terms - as one black professional said last week, commenting on the United States Supreme Court's landmark school desegration decision in 1954, ''it never occurred to anybody that white children separated from blacks would be irreparably harmed.''
There has been no major civil unrest in New York City for more than a decade, but the crime and dropout rates among young blacks constitute a quiet riot. The death rate among blacks under the age of 65 in central Harlem is nearly three times higher than that of American whites. The high school dropout rate among blacks is estimated as upward of 50 percent.
But once Mr. Dinkins exhausts all his legal sanctions against discrimination, how far will civility and good intentions reach into the hearts of bigoted New Yorkers? It is arguable whether the kind of educational effort he has launched can transform behavior more deeply ingrained than the failures of people to buckle seatbelts or pick up after pets.
Nor is it likely that harmony will be achieved before economic disparities - perhaps the root cause of the black boycott of Korean merchants - are bridged. Nor before people candidly address their differences. Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, recently returned from Israel where, she said, Israeli and Palestinian women spoke with more openness and honesty than she recalled hearing at similar discussions between conflicting groups at home.
An emerging recognition that poor blacks and whites share similar problems, the growing black middle class and the evolving integration of the workplace suggest, though, that time and contact might indeed alter attitudes. ''I see white and black kids at Queens college getting on in ways I never thought they would,'' said Mr. Hacker.
But many blacks remain consigned to poverty as a staggering number of new immigrants pass them by. As a result, New York and the nation are becoming more non-white, but not necessarily more black. Blacks are still the ''indelible immigrants,'' as Richard C. Wade, a City University professor, describes them.
The fundamental question is, when will differences of skin color no longer matter as much as class and culture? Does he harbor any such hopes, Dr. Kenneth Clark, the psychologist, was asked last week. ''I used to hope,'' Dr. Clark replied.
Marking 30 years since the completion of ''Beyond the Melting Pot,'' Mr. Glazer sounded an alarm last week against grasping for symbolic substitutes to integration as society becomes more fragmented instead of pulling together. Too much can be made of symbols. But as Mr. Glazer and his fellow panelists assessed how far beyond the melting pot American society has come in three decades, they sat in the trustees room of the New York Public Library before a tapestry that celebrates Africa and gazed upon an audience of more than 150 people that included four blacks.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Arms Talks: Essential, but Less Sexy

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
WHEN Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, began their talks here last week, Soviet television buried its reporting of the event in a 15-second film clip that followed agricultural news and an item about the visiting Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak.
This was no accident. The thrust of the Baker-Shevardnadze talks was an effort to complete a series of arms-control agreements in time for the summit meeting in Washington May 30, and what Soviet television seemed be implying was what many Soviet and American citizens have been asking themselves lately: In the post-cold-war world, why should I care about arms control anymore?
After their talks, Mr. Baker said he and Mr. Shevardnadze had overcome major obstacles to a treaty limiting long-range nuclear missiles and had achieved an agreement to ban production of chemical weapons. President Bush called the developments ''encouraging'' and ''interesting,'' but also said, ''It's a mixed review right now.'' Mr. Baker said differences remained on reducing troops and tanks in Europe. 
Having declared that his meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be the ''arms control summit,'' Mr. Bush has seemed to take the position that its success should be judged by the number of arms-control issues concluded. But that doesn't mean the rest of the world will look at it this way.
Soviet television has it right: Arms control is not the sole barometer any longer of the United States-Soviet relationship, nor is it the key factor in reducing tensions between the superpowers. Said Gregory F. Treverton, an expert on European affairs at the Council on Foreign Relations: ''In many ways, arms control is last year's business.''
To be sure, it could become next year's business if anything happens to Mr. Gorbachev and if, as a result, Soviet policy retreats to the more militaristic approach of the Brezhnev era. American officials are keenly aware of that possibility, and this is why they are so eager to get Mr. Gorbachev to sign treaties now that would lock in wide-ranging arms cuts.
American officials say they feel a bit like businessmen trying to close a deal with an ailing prospect. Just as he is about to sign, he becomes bed-ridden. So the businessmen gather around his bed, saying, ''Please, just sign here.'' In the case of Mr. Gorbachev, every time he seems to be reaching for his pen something stays his hand: His relatives from Lithuania show up and start making demands, his brother in the army complains that he is giving away the store, and he suffers internal pains.
When and if Mr. Gorbachev signs, though, it will probably be of little interest to many of his own citizens, who have become totally absorbed in internal affairs. They care little about whether the summit meeting will slash the number of long-range nuclear missiles to a level that would leave the superpowers capable of obliterating each other merely 50 times over rather than 100 times.
''No one is worried about U.S.-Soviet relations now,'' said Vladimir Kikilo, a foreign affairs expert at the Communist Party newspaper Pravda. ''Now everyone is obsessed with his own business: how to get some food; how to make ends meet; will the Communist Party split? ''I used to read the newspaper backwards,'' he said. ''I would start with the back pages, read the TV listings, sports, some arts, then skip to the front and read the international news. I would not read the domestic news pages in the middle. Now I go right to these pages first.''
Stephen M. Meyer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an expert on the Soviet military, said it is no wonder that arms control has been shoved downward on the Soviet agenda.
''If all major cities in the United States were involved in race riots,'' Mr. Meyer said, ''and people were calling for the impeachment of President Bush every day, and several New England states announced that they were seceding to join Canada, it would not be surprising if President Bush and Secretary Baker were not all that focused on arms control.''
''That is what Gorbachev faces,'' he added. ''Having a strategic arms agreement now or in five years doesn't really matter much if you aren't sure that there is going to be a Soviet Union in five years.''
 
Trade, Please
If Mr. Gorbachev returns from the summit with a trade agreement and trade concessions based on most-favored-nation status, Mr. Kikilo said, Soviet citizens will feel that the meeting has produced tangible results. ''But you can't feel the results of arms reduction agreements,'' he added.
Indeed, each of several Soviet analysts who was asked for this article about what he hoped to see come out of the summit responded: ''Trade.''
The most notable reason for the decrease in attention for arms control negotiations is the shift in the overall character of the United States-Soviet relationship. When East and West were locked in a nose-to-nose nuclear standoff during the cold war, even relatively small arms-control treaties could be felt psychologically and militarily.
Arms-control negotiations accounted for the most conspicuous diplomatic contacts between the two sides, and the ups and downs of these talks were considered synonymous with the ups and downs of the entire relationship.
But now the superpowers have entered an era when their talks are increasingly about areas of cooperation, not confrontation. The prospect of armed conflict in Europe seems remote, and McDonald's is selling Big Meks in Pushkin Square. One Soviet foreign-policy analyst remarked: ''The question people ask today about America is not will there be war, but what can we learn from America?''
The 1987 treaty limiting intermediate-range ballistic missiles, Mr. Kikilo said, ''was kind of a climax for arms control; after that people felt safe.
''Even though it only dealt with 4 percent of the nuclear weapons on each side, it had a great symbolic importance.'' he added. ''The treaty defused the threat of global war.''
So it is not surprising that the relationship is most affected today by those actions and events that could call into question the broad network of cooperative ventures the United States and Soviet Union have begun.
Failure to sign a strategic arms treaty soon might have little impact on the relationship. But a Soviet military crackdown in Lithuania could reverse all of the positive developments of the last few years, by prompting the United States to sever trade or diminish contacts.
As soon as aides to Mr. Baker heard last week that the Kremlin and Lithuanian officials seemed to be starting a dialogue, they sighed in relief that the summit meeting would now go off smoothly, no matter what happened in arms control.
 
Fear of Implosion
Militarily, the most immediate threat to the United States-Soviet relationship is not the possibility of one side's suddenly raining nuclear missiles on the other. The immediate danger seems to stem more from the possibility of a breakup of the Soviet Union from nationalist pressures or economic implosion, and the instability that would spill over into Europe.
That is the kind of situation that the arms-control agreements being negotiated would be powerless to control.
Indeed, the talks over conventional arms levels in Europe have been almost totally overtaken by events. The Soviet Union has had to withdraw tens of thousands of men and large stockpiles of arms from Eastern Europe in the last year simply because of the collapse of Communism there, and without a treaty with the West.
The United States, under pressure from Congress, will soon do the same. Any conventional arms agreement in Europe at this stage would not really be intended to reduce tensions in the traditional sense but simply to manage, and lock in, the withdrawal of Soviet forces.
To be sure, arms control has hardly become irrelevant, said Sergei M. Plekhanov, deputy director of the Soviet Institute for the Study of the U.S.A. and Canada. There are still too many dangerous weapons on the shelf and they will not get safer with age. ''Arms control is still a barometer of the relationship in a way,'' he said, ''but it is like the barometer in your house. You look at it when you expect a storm. When it is sunny, or partly cloudy, you just don't have to look at it every day.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In Search of Capitalism With a Human Face

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
TWO decades ago Communist reformers in Eastern Europe wanted to build a new type of economic system, one that would be a bold mix of Marxism and the free market. Eager to shun Stalinist repression and stagnation as well as to avoid capitalist evils like unemployment, these idealists dreamed of constructing ''socialism with a human face.''
Now that most Eastern European nations have sloughed off Communist rule, talk has turned away from such lofty abstractions to the practical problems of building what the region's economists call ''a regular economy,'' like those in Western Europe and the United States.
But decades of socialism have left an indelible mark. Even as Hungarians, Poles, Czechoslovaks and East Germans shun experimentation in favor of creating Western-style market economies, many hope to avoid the unhappiest aspects of capitalism. They want the growth, dynamism and flexibility of the free market without the ugly side, which often includes large-scale unemployment, homelessness and extremes in wealth and poverty. 
''We are almost in capitalism, but mentally we are still in socialism,'' said Andrzej Wroblewski, editor of Gazeta Bankowa, a Polish financial newspaper.
 
Clinging to Socialism
Though fervently anti-Communist, many Eastern Europeans still cling to socialist ideals about equality and jobs for all, and in the region's fledgling democracies, these keepers of the flame are making themselves heard. In Hungary, several newly homeless families camped out in front of Parliament to protest some all-too-capitalist rent increases. In Poland, Solidarity members complained that the Solidarity-led Government's free-market-inspired price increases and layoffs were causing too much pain. In East Germany, farmers blockaded border crossings, demanding protection for their subsidies and land.
Some reform efforts have already been bogged down because of worries about the negatives of capitalism. In Hungary, a program to privatize industry was overhauled because of public outrage that some investors had bought state-owned companies at bargain prices. In Warsaw, the Government's privatization bill is snagged partly because workers, who had a powerful voice in running their companies under Communism, are angry that they would no longer have a large say.
Just as it was hard to impose Communism upon capitalist Eastern Europe after World War II, so, too, will it be tough to install a smoothly running market economy after four decades of Communism. These nations cannot in one quick stroke scrap central planning, remove all price controls, end generous subsidies to businesses and consumers, and sell all state-owned industry to private investors; the pain and tumult would be unbearable.
It took Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a perfervid free-marketeer, a decade to privatize less than 10 percent of British industry. No one says that Eastern European nations, where more than 90 percent of industry is state-owned, can sell off an appreciable chunk of the state sector overnight.
Government officials say it is important to privatize some enterprises immediately to create competition and force companies to worry about profits and efficiency. But Eastern Europeans have little in the way of savings to invest in shares.
''Here we have to privatize six times as much in three years'' as Britain did in a decade, said Marton Tardos, a leading Hungarian economist. ''If we do not privatize a significant amount in three years, we fear the Hungarian economy will collapse.''
To help their private sector grow, Eastern European nations will need a stock market, but Hungary has already discovered the difficulties of starting one. Communist teachings about capitalist exploitation have left many Hungarians ignorant and unenthusiastic about stocks and bonds. Even though the exchange is two and a half years old, less than $30,000 in stock changes hands in each day's trading.
''The most difficult obstacle is there hasn't been a stock exchange in 40 years,'' said Ilona Hardy, the exchange's executive director. ''People did not learn about it at school, and they do not understand what it's all about. What is more, a lot of people say a stock exchange is wrong and capitalistic.'' Privatization is also running into resistance because Eastern Europeans have been taught to reject private ownership. ''People in Hungary are scared of ownership,'' said Bela Kadar, director of the Institute of Economic Planning in Hungary. ''Many consider it immoral, un-Marxist.''
 
Too Much Capitalism
It seems that whenever a company is privatized, someone asserts that capitalist buyers are getting too good a price. The catch, of course, is that investors are usually unwilling to make an investment unless they believe they are getting a good deal.
It will also take years for Eastern Europe to develop an accurate accounting system because prices remain deeply distorted as a result of controls and subsidies. The crude state of banking is also holding back business development. Few individuals have checking accounts, business checks can take two months to clear. Little wonder that Polish executives travel with large satchels of money.
Another daunting prospect is to rebuild - or, in many cases, build - a modern infrastructure of roads, trains, airports and telecommunication networks. Anyone who has spent hours trying to make a phone call from Warsaw to the Polish countryside knows how crippled the region's infrastructure is.
''You cannot develop a market economy and attract foreign investors if you can't get a telephone call through or receive a fax,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Dlouhy of Czechoslovakia. Economists estimate that it will cost East Germany more than $500 billion to upgrade its infrastructure to West German levels. Next to this amount, the $12 billion that the new Bank for European Reconstruction and Development plans to lend Eastern Europe seems paltry, as does the much-heralded $3 billion in aid that the West has pledged to Poland.
Equally painful will be dealing with Hungary's and Poland's huge debt burdens.
 
Fear of Unemployment
Another difficult task will be to push obsolete, inefficient companies into bankruptcy after decades during which enterprises were not allowed to go under and layoffs were all but prohibited. A C.I.A. report estimated that unemployment could hit 9 percent in Poland, up to 20 percent in Yugoslavia and East Germany and 5 percent or more in Bulgaria.
Eastern Europeans are so gung-ho about building a Western-style economy that they hardly bother to fuss what brand of capitalism to buy. At the moment, Eastern Europe's social democrats and Thatcherites are in agreement about the basic steps needed. Only after the region has planted the seeds for a solid market economy, they say, need they fight over which variant of capitalism should be their ultimate goal: the wilder variety espoused by Ronald Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher or the tamer versions of Sweden and West Germany.
Where the economic policies of Eastern European nations differ most is in their pace of reform. Confronting the region's worst economic crisis, Poland's Finance Minister, Leszek Balcerowicz, is using shock therapy to wipe out his country's 1,000 percent inflation rate and jolt the economy out of its Communist stupor. In his view, experiencing deep pain for a short time is the best way for Poland's enfeebled economy to regain its strength. In contrast, the Government in Czechoslovakia, where store shelves are full and where many people own summer homes, is moving more deliberately. Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus wants to first break up state monopolies and create competition before he scraps price controls.
To get from here to there while minimizing the pain, the nations of Eastern Europe have built elaborate safety nets and demanded debt relief from their Western creditors. In addition, these countries are clamoring for Western investment because they know Western money, management skills and technology will speed their economic revival.
Eastern European officials say they have learned from Hungary's experiment, which involved of modest reforms, beginning in 1968, that aimed to create a system between Communism and capitalism. The reforms either were sabotaged or backfired, and Hungary still finds itself in baleful economic shape.
''We see,'' said Ivan Berend, an economic historian and president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, ''that half measures are not enough to create an efficient economy.''

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
For the Politicians, The Prize in 1990 Is Really 1992

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE rap on politicians is that they can't seem to think about anything but the next election. Not fair. This year they are focusing on the election after the next one.
In state after state, the 1990 midterm elections have emerged as a gigantic battle for political position going into the 1992 elections. The campaign themes have not been overwhelming, but the stakes are. 
Who will control governorships and statehouses as congressional and legislative lines are redrawn after the census? Will the Republicans pick up enough seats in the Senate to give them a running start on taking it back in 1992? Can the Democrats reinforce their stronghold in the House to protect them when new districts will be created, dozens of members will retire, and George Bush will no doubt be at the top of the Republican ticket?
Howard Schloss, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, described 1990 as ''the calm before the reapportionment storm.'' And indeed, except for a general antagonism toward politicians, there are few national themes - the sort that might develop in an economic tailspin or a foreign crisis.
Abortion and taxes are compelling issues. But the way they are being contested seems to be revealing as much about the strains within the Republican Party as about where the politicians or the nation stand.
Sensing a decided shift in the public mood in favor of abortion rights, Republican Party leaders encouraged pro-choice candidates. But several have had problems on their right, most notably Barbara Hafer, the party's favorite for Governor of Pennsylvania, who last week very nearly lost her primary race to an underfinanced opponent who came out of the anti-abortion movement. Politically wounded, Ms. Hafer will face Gov. Robert P. Casey, who opposes abortion, in the fall.
Opposition to taxes, a staple of the G.O.P.'s campaigns, is also producing internal problems. The sputtering economy has left state coffers short and forced governors and candidates for governor to accept, or at least to avoid ruling out, new taxes.
President Bush seemed to imply that he was ready to do the same thing, for the same reasons, when he summoned Congressional leaders for budget talks. Republican candidates for the Senate panicked, fearing that Mr. Bush was giving away their best issue. Last week, eight of them fired off a letter to him that said: ''The Republican Party stands for the working men and women of this country and has consistently opposed efforts to raise taxes. We respectfully urge you to reject any budget agreement which violates your pledge of no new taxes.''
So with national themes creating as much confusion as clarity, all politics are even more local than usual. Here are some of the more important contests:
 
The Stakes In the States
With population, and thus political power, migrating from north and east to south and west, great importance is placed in who controls redistricting in states that will gain seats (Florida, Texas, California) or lose them (New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois). Business and labor contributors are pouring millions of dollars into state races this year. Members of the House of Representatives have spent almost as much time raising money to give to state legislators as they have for themselves.
Democrats seem to be in command in New York and Pennsylvania. But in Illinois a tough race is under way between Jim Edgar, the Republican Secretary of State, and Neil Hartigan, the Democratic Attorney General.
Republicans control all three governorships in the states that are expected to gain the most Congressional seats, but they are vulnerable in Florida. Gov. Bob Martinez is expecting a stiff challenge from the winner of the Democratic primary, who at the moment seems almost certain to be former United States Senator Lawton Chiles. Mr. Chiles's acknowledgement that he took antidepressant medication does not seem to have done him nearly the political damage that Mr. Martinez's ill-fated effort to curb abortion did him. Republicans harbor hopes of capturing the State Senate, where they are now four votes short. If they did, it would be the first time since Reconstruction that the Republicans have controlled a Southern state legislative house.
A bruising primary gave Ann Richards the Democratic nomination for Governor of Texas, but gave Clayton Williams, her Republican opponent, the early advantage to succeed Gov. William P. Clements Jr. Some wonder whether Mr. Williams's down-home appeal can go the distance to November.
In the California Governor's race, Senator Pete Wilson, the Republican candidate, will face either Dianne Feinstein, the former Mayor of San Francisco, or John Van de Kamp, the state Attorney General. Mr. Wilson seems to favor a Van de Kamp victory; he has crossed party lines to attack Ms. Feinstein. As the June 5 primary approaches, the race is close.
 
Fighting Over The Senate
Republicans sense a big opportunity to close the 55-to-45 advantage that the Democrats hold in the Senate. Eight Republican House members have given up safe seats to run for the Senate. Five of them are challenging incumbents, in Illinois, Iowa, Rhode Island, Hawaii and Michigan. While there are a few vulnerable Republicans, including Dan Coats, Vice President Quayle's appointed successor in Indiana, and Jesse Helms, conservative warrior in a changing North Carolina, more Democrats than Republicans are at risk. A gain of even two seats would give Republicans a good base for 1992.
 
Opportunities In the House
Both sides say they expect a swing of only a few seats, at most, although a gathering anti-incumbent mood could upset these predictions.
In 1992, almost all incumbents will have to run in partially redrawn districts, and are doing what they can this year to remind constituents who they are. Many challengers, too, are approaching this fall as a dry run for 1992, when a rush of retirements is expected. Some incumbents' districts will be wiped out. Others won't want to run in the new districts they are handed, and a few older members will probably step down.
All told, there could be 100 districts without an incumbent in 1992. That compares with 27 in 1988. And given the way voters are talking about politicians, it seems like a trend that would not bother them much.

Unwelcome, Partner

BYLINE: By Laura Mansnerus

 BODY:
Last week, Ann B. Hopkins was celebrating, smoking cigarettes, drinking beer, making jokes and otherwise acting thick-skinned, the way she has through seven years of litigation over her right to be a partner in a big accounting firm. It was just that unfeminine posture that had led the firm to reject her, a Federal judge had found, and because of that the firm would have to take her back.
Ms. Hopkins had already won at every turn in her case against Price Waterhouse, which she said passed her over because they judged her to be masculine, abrasive and in need of ''a course at charm school.'' But the decision ordering the firm to make her a partner was the prize. It was apparently the first time a court had awarded a partnership as a remedy for race or sex discrimination. 
The award can be appealed, and Ms. Hopkins, who now works for the World Bank in Washington as a budget planner, said she thought the case was not over yet.
Ms. Hopkins was among 88 candidates for partnership in 1983, and had brought in more business than any of the others. But she also received more negative comments from partners, including some who said she should wear makeup and jewelry and walk, talk and dress ''more femininely.''
When an individual brings a discrimination suit, the issue is usually the employer's intent. Generally, employers can dismiss or reject someone for any reason or no reason, so long as it is not the wrong reason, such as race or sex. But when Ms. Hopkins brought suit, accounting firms, law firms and other professional partnerships were arguing that they were not subject to the same rules.
The Supreme Court rejected that contention in the 1984 case of Elizabeth A. Hishon, a lawyer passed over for partnership at the Atlanta firm of King & Spalding, although the justices made no finding as to whether Ms. Hishon had been wrongfully rejected. Ms. Hishon reached a settlement with the firm and never returned.
For Ms. Hopkins, there remained the question of whether Price Waterhouse would have to prove in a trial that it based its decision on legitimate and not discriminatory reasons. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the firm did have that burden.
Finally, after trial, Judge Gerhard A. Gesell of Federal District Court in Washington found that Price Waterhouse had not met its burden and that it would be pointless to simply ask the firm to reconsider Ms. Hopkins. He acknowledged that ''it is indeed a strained partnership relationship that lies ahead.''

HEADLINE: New Germany; Old Fears

 BODY:
By formal agreement concluded Friday, the two Germanys will become one on July 1, barely eight months after the wall's fall. To most people, what was unthinkable then seems unremarkable now. Polls indicate that Americans are less concerned about German unification than are the Germans themselves. 
But that calm is not universal. People who remember World War II, and the unlearned lessons of World War I, remain queasy about the breakneck movement toward unification. And if there is unease in this country, think how people must feel in the Soviet Union, on whose soil so many millions died.
Those who fought, suffered and learned the hard way are entitled to harbor doubts. Their question is entitled to be heard, and answered: are they right to fear that Germany will revert to militarism, fascism or expansionism, once its unity and sovereignty is fully restored?
Some Americans, fearing a revival of militarism, want Germany to disarm. And no one thinks Germany should have nuclear weapons. But a wholly disarmed Germany would sooner or later be an insecure Germany. And it would resent being denied, alone among its neighbors, the sovereign right of self-defense.
Indeed, many Germans, especially on the left, are wary of a professional army and are thus loath to end conscription. To assure that the draft continues to operate fairly, citizens in the eastern part of a united Germany will be eligible for military service.
But with the reduced Soviet threat, force cuts are fully warranted, and Bonn has already announced plans to shrink the Bundeswehr. It is also prepared to accept constraints on its armed forces as part of a 23-nation treaty soon to be concluded on conventional forces.
Beyond explicit arms arrangements, concerned observers can find reassurance in Bonn's well-developed political arrangements. Democratic traditions have taken hold in West Germany after nearly half a century. Traces of right-wing extremism and anti-Semitism persist on the fringe in West Germany, but they're much less of a concern than in, say, France.
It is the East Germans who, after two generations of totalitarian rule, may prove more susceptible to extremist excess. That's why Germany's friends have been especially concerned that unification arrangements respond to the deep-seated wishes and anxieties of the East German people.
The more plausible danger is that, if care is not taken, the Soviet Union of tomorrow may resemble the Germany of 1930. That's why Bonn and Washington, as they join in restoring full sovereignty to a unified Germany, will have to go out of their way to satisfy understandable Soviet desires for security, prestige and prosperity.
The Germany of 60 years ago was a deeply dissatisfied society, embittered by what many people felt was an unjust settlement of World War I, battered by depression and disdainful of a then-fragile democratic tradition. But not today.
Self-confident, Germany is more likely to flex its muscle in the economic realm. Such assertiveness may breed resentment, but it will contribute to, not threaten, the long peace in Europe.

HEADLINE: How to Police Future Stock Futures

 BODY:
The staid Securities and Exchange Commission and the upstart Commodity Futures Trading Commission have gone to war. The issue is important, and heated: which agency should regulate the market in stock index futures.
Some experts look to a consolidation of the two agencies as a way to achieve regulatory consistency. Others would preserve regulatory competition as a way to keep both agencies on their toes. At the moment, the S.E.C. is winning the battle, having persuaded the Bush Administration to strip the C.F.T.C. of jurisdiction over stock index futures. But for all the hot contention, there's no need to choose between consistency and competition. With legislative tinkering, both can be achieved. 
The S.E.C. regulates the cash market for stocks, which is centered in New York. The C.F.T.C. regulates the market for futures - contracts to buy and sell assets at a future time and price - which is primarily located in Chicago.
Most futures contracts are for agriculture products like soybeans and pork bellies. But in recent years, the C.F.T.C. has approved futures for financial assets. One such product, the stock index future, is a contract to buy or sell the value of an index of stocks on a future date, thereby combining features of both stocks and futures.
These futures are used by some investors as an inexpensive way to offset the risk of owning stocks and by others as a way to bet on the movement of stock prices. The contracts are controversial because some observers think they worsened the 1987 and 1989 stock market crashes.
The S.E.C. contends that the markets for stocks and stock index futures are closely linked and should therefore be regulated by a single authority. Until they are, traders can evade the rules of one market by switching to the other. That, says the S.E.C., crimps its ability to weed out fraud and set margin requirements, which limit how much investors can borrow. And split regulation can limit the usefulness of ''circuit breakers,'' which halt trading when prices plummet. Another danger is a temptation to lower standards, to attract business from the other market.
But the C.F.T.C. has good arguments for split authority. The brash C.F.T.C. has innovated many products that energize capital markets. Yet studies fail to show that unequal margin requirements contributed to the 1987 debacle or cause instability generally. Besides, futures traders believe that the S.E.C., if it gained additional authority, would issue rules biased toward the cash markets it has historically regulated.
There is a way to have both regulatory consistency and competition. Two years ago, after the 1987 crash, a four-person Presidential Working Group on Financial Markets was created to oversee regulation. It was given only advisory power. But Congress could authorize such a group to impose coordinated margin requirements and other regulations if cooperation between the S.E.C. and C.F.T.C. should break down. And the group could provide a single regulatory voice when required, as in negotiating with foreign governments.
If Congress could start from scratch, perhaps it would be best to create a single regulatory agency that owed allegiance to neither New York nor Chicago. But history cannot be easily undone. Until a better solution emerges, a small oversight group is the best way to avoid petty turf wars.

HEADLINE: Care-Giving at Home Should Not Cost You Your Job;
A Path to Destitution

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Parental Leave: Leave It at That'' misses the mark when it suggests that the job guarantee contained in the Family and Medical Leave Act is a luxury useful only to middle-class workers. On the contrary, the least privileged, most vulnerable workers are also most likely to be without employer-provided, job-protected leave. 
Workers of all incomes need time to be with their infants during the first weeks of life, to care for immediate family members in times of medical crisis and to recover from their own serious illnesses. For poor families and families supported by single parents, losing a job because of such family and medical emergencies may well lead to debt, destitution and homelessness.
Furthermore, your recommendation that the legislation be limited to leave to care for the newborn fails to respond adequately to the needs of American workers and their families. Yes, families need to be together when a child is born or adopted. But families also need the care and support of their working members when a spouse, parent or child becomes seriously ill.
The aging of the American population underscores this need as people increasingly rely on their spouses and adult children for care-giving. And workers who are themselves temporarily unable to work because of serious health conditions need job security in order to ensure their families' economic survival.
As the House of Representatives recognized in passing this legislation by a wide margin, the Family and Medical Leave Act balances competing work and family responsibilities in a sensible and sensitive fashion. We hope that the Senate and President Bush will similarly act to ensure that American workers are not forced to choose between their jobs and their families.

A Changing World

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
These are dark days for the boys of Bensonhurst. Their world is fading as fast as the summer sun over the city some of their fathers and grandfathers helped build. They are angry the way people are angry when they see a sure thing slipping through their fingers.
Life was easier a generation ago. They graduated from high school, or maybe they didn't. It didn't really matter, because someone from the family or the neighborhood could get them into the union or the civil service, could find them a job working construction or picking up trash. 
A couple blocks away would be the girl, pretty, with hair and eyes as dark as the subway tunnels, and then there would be the wedding, and later the kids. She would serve dinner on a tray table in front of the television if the game was on, or keep it warm if the boys wanted to get together to play a little ball. She did shirts just right. Looking good was the thing when the day's grime was scrubbed away.
That has not changed. Looking good is still important. Keith Mondello never had a hair out of place during his trial. Just looking at him you could hear the blow dryer going. Joey Fama was found guilty of murder. Keith Mondello beat the big charges but was convicted of being part of a riot. When the riot was over, a black kid named Yusuf Hawkins was dead on the Bensonhurst sidewalk. They said afterward that it ruined the Feast of Santa Rosalia.
The people of Bensonhurst will tell you the boys were protecting the neighborhood. Common sense will tell you that it doesn't take 40 guys with baseball bats to protect a city street from four teen-agers looking to buy a used car. It doesn't take a gun.
Maybe what they were after wasn't Yusuf Hawkins at all, but everything he represented. The lives the boys of Bensonhurst were banking on are as dead as Drexel Burnham Lambert, and for some of the same reasons. They liked to think they were tops in their neighborhood, and their neighborhood was tops in the city, and the city was the greatest in America, and America was the leader of the world. All ashes. America limps along, a superpower that, like a star high-school athlete grown middle-aged, ate too much but didn't exercise. It carries a paunch of second-ratedness. The girls that were once compliant talk back. They go out to work, and some of them even like it. The jobs aren't there anymore. The boys don't like to talk of slow housing starts, or municipal cutbacks. They talk of how the jobs were all given away to blacks and Hispanics. This week in Bensonhurst one of the delis put a picture of a watermelon in the window.
While the trial was going on, a study was released showing that, after blacks and Hispanics, Italian kids are most likely to drop out of school in New York. This came as a surprise to academia, but not to Bensonhurst. The kids who go to college move away, from the neighborhood and from their families, and that's no good. There's an Italian saying: It's a stupid man who makes his son better than he is.
When you say these things people will say you are anti-Italian, but ethnicity is beside the point. The boys of Bensonhurst have cousins all over America, from Irish-American boys in parts of Boston to good old boys in small towns down South. They were given to understand that they were better, not because they were smart or capable, but just because they were white men in a world that hated anyone who wasn't.
And then the world changed. But they didn't.
A black kid died in Bensonhurst, and someone killed him. You could argue that the whole block did it, although Mayor Dinkins refused to countenance group guilt. But these are places where people keep watch on the street, and as surely as someone is going to give my kids hell if they step off the curb on my block, someone watched that mob and they've kept quiet about it all this time. And they always will. This is the code of the boys, wherever they live: Take care of your own. No matter what.
Keeping the code, and the illusion of superiority, becomes harder every day. The economy is in the toilet, buying a house seems forever out of reach, and even when you get a job, you turn around and the guy next to you is black.
Yusuf Hawkins died fast on the pavement. The world of the boys of Bensonhurst, the world they try to protect by any means possible, will waste away and die more slowly. But it will not survive to convince another generation of its own superiority, an illusory arrogance that someone thought worth killing for.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
A Drug For Cows That Churns Up Opposition

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, John Kinsman stood outside his barn in Lime Ridge, Wis., and vowed to halt a new advance in farm technology, a genetically engineered drug to increase milk production in cows, that he believed would sweep small dairy farmers like himself from the land.
Last month, in a singular decision prompted by the political opposition generated by Mr. Kinsman, Wisconsin's Governor, Tommy G. Thompson, signed a law banning the sale or use of the drug in the nation's largest milk-producing state for more than a year.
The new law is the first in United States history to bar an advance in farm technology before it reached the market. Though largely a symbolic act, the law is the most vivid evidence yet of a widening view in rural America, and the political clout associated with it, that some technological advances have done more to hurt farmers and rural communities than to help them. It is a trend that frightens biotechnology industry executives but gives hope to small family farmers. 
''We're looking at technology in a different way,'' said Mr. Kinsman, who at age 64 milks 35 Holsteins twice daily on his 150-acre farm 70 miles northwest of Madison, Wisconsin's capital. ''We're asking whether this technology is another that could haunt us and cause problems, as some of the pesticides and drugs we used have. We're asking whether this is another expensive technology that's going to make its manufacturers rich but won't make us any more money.''
The drug, bovine somatotropin, has been touted by its manufacturers as the first economically important product of genetic engineering in agriculture. Produced from genetically engineered bacteria, artificial bovine somatotropin is a nearly identical copy of a natural hormone that controls milk production in dairy cows. When injected, it raises the levels of the growth hormone in the cow's blood and causes an increase of milk production by 10 to 25 percent - or 1 to 3 extra gallons to the 12 to 15 gallons a high-producing cow yields daily. Some analysts predict sales of $1 billion annually for the drug.
The Food and Drug Administration, which is considering the drug for approval next year, said the drug is harmless to people. And the four chemical and drug companies that hope to bring it to market - Monsanto, Eli Lilly, American Cyanamid and Upjohn - say the drug is a tool for increasing production and lowering costs that favors neither small nor large producers. It will be readily affordable to each, they say, although prices are as yet unknown.
Unlike Mr. Kinsman, some of Wisconsin's dairy farmers have said they are eager to buy the drug. ''It is an effective tool for improving efficiency in the dairy industry,'' said Judith A. Klusman, a dairy farmer from Oshkosh and a Republican state representative who opposed the ban. ''To compete globally, we can't afford to be cut out from using such an effective tool.''
But judging from several polls, Mr. Kinsman and others in Wisconsin were successful in turning bovine somatotropin into a crisp symbol of the technological determinism in modern farming that has sought ever-greater production and efficiency virtually at the expense of all other values. The costs of the system, he argued, have been enormous. Agriculture has become dominated by expensive technology that pollutes, causes toxic threats to the food supply and encourages enormous corporate farms.
 
A Return to Milk Surpluses
Bovine somatotropin represented a sublime technical achievement, Mr. Kinsman argued, but it was also the last thing dairy farmers needed. Consumers had indicated in polls that they were not anxious to buy milk containing an artificial hormone. Farmers were worried that if the drug were widely used, it would mean the return of the milk surpluses that had cost the Government more than $16 billion in the 1980's and driven tens of thousands out of business. Rural bankers and businesspeople were anxious about more bankruptcies caused by failed farms.
For nearly as long as Americans have farmed, rural communities have shown a persistent skepticism about new agricultural inventions - from steel plows to barbed wire - that has blossomed periodically in active protests. In the 1940's, Southern sharecroppers raised objections to the mechanical cotton picker, accurately predicting that its use would help to drive millions of farmers and field workers from the Deep South and shift cotton production to the West.
 
A Beneficial Trend
But not until the conflict over bovine somatotropin had concerns about new agricultural tools been translated into law. The Wisconsin law barring the drug led to enactment of a similar law in neighboring Minnesota. Legislators in Pennsylvania, New York and New England also are considering bills.
Executives at Monsanto said they are concerned about the laws, but expressed hope that the protest has peaked. On Tuesday, the Vermont legislature rejected a proposal that would have temporarily barred sales of the drug.
Other experts, though, view the new laws as a political trend that could benefit agriculture and the rest of American society.
''It represents a point in our history when people are questioning what progress is,'' said Pete Daniel, a curator at the National Museum of American History in Washington and author of ''Breaking the Land,'' a 1985 book on how technology transformed cotton, tobacco and rice farming. ''There is a conception in this country that science always produces something new and better. But is it progress if a new bovine hormone produces more milk that's not needed and puts people out of business?''

European Opportunities Beckoning Developers

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
DURING the boom years of the 80's the United States was a land of opportunity for real estate developers and investors the world over. Now, with an ambitious plan to lift bureaucratic, legal and trade barriers among the 12 countries of the European Economic Community inching toward a 1992 start, and the political thaw in the Eastern Bloc raising hopes for an economic rejuvenation in those countries, many American real estate entreprenuers are looking to Europe for the next wave of opportunity.
Tishman Speyer Properties of New York, in partnership with Citibank and Kajima Corporation, a Japanese construction company, is building a 70-story office tower in Frankfurt, West Germany.
American Continental Properties Group, which owns commercial properties throughout the United States, has teamed with IMI, one of the largest banks in Italy, to convert the former Peroni brewery in Rome to a mixed-use development with office space, apartment and shops.
Emery Roth & Sons, a Manhattan-based architectural firm, is designing 10 hotel complexes for the Hungarian Ministry for Commerce and the Hungarian Hotel Association. 
Senie Kerschner International Housing Limited of Westport, Conn., signed an agreement last month to build a 528-unit rental residential complex on land owned by a farm collective on the outskirts of Moscow. The complex will serve both foreign and Soviet employees of American and European companies with operations in the Soviet Union.
In February, the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Jones Lang Wootton, an international commercial real estate brokerage and consulting company with 58 offices world wide, announced the creation of an international real estate investment fund. It is known as the Prudential Global Real Estate Investment Program and Jones Lang Wootton will serve as its adviser for the acquisition of properties in major cities around the globe, among them Frankfurt, London and Paris. So far, eight companies have committed a total of $2 billion to the investment program. Many more American entities are testing the waters. Security Pacific Bank, JMB Realty and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Lincoln Properties, Tishman West Management and Beyer, Blinder, Belle were among 50 American companies and agencies to send representatives to Cannes in March for the first international real estate trade fair. The conference, which drew 800 participants and exhibitors, was billed as a forum for trading information and making contacts.
''Participation exceeded our expectations,'' said Barney Benard, president of International Exhibition Organization, the event's organizer. ''After being sort of late to pick up on what is going on overseas, more Americans are taking the initative.''
Some American entreprenuers seem to be taking their cue from Olympia & York, a Canadian company with large holdings in the United States, which is building a $5 billion, 12 million-square-foot mixed-use project in London known as Canary Wharf.
But as enticing as Europe now appears, some economists and real estate professionals familiar with the scene there are offering some sobering observations on the barriers that American entrepreneurs face in pursuing European ventures.
''There is little question that Europe holds the potential of being the economic story of the 1990's,'' said Karl Casagrande, an executive vice president of Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation in charge of real estate investments. ''And obviously real estate development and investment are going to be significant parts of any change.''
''But I think the problem is that many foreigners, particularly American developers, see Europe after 1992 as being some sort of free-for-all in which all things are possible,'' he continued, referring to the date the European Economic Community plans to lift trade and commercial barriers. ''Yes, there will be opportunities, but there are also certain aspects of the real estate business in Europe that will probably not change for a long, long time - if ever.''
AMONG the barriers, some observers see a paucity of developable sites in major cities, zoning rules that severly limit new construction and a reluctance among both individuals and institutions to sell off their real estate holdings. In addition, rising expectations for Europe's economic future have pumped up prices of commercial properties.
Yet despite this tempered outlook for speculative real estate ventures, many, including Mr. Casagrande believe that Americans and other foreigners can and will benefit from the economic and political integration of Western Europe and from the new economic freedoms taking hold in the East.
Joint venturing has been the path that most American interests have followed to Europe. But others have gone overseas as the construction companies, architects or space planners for American companies building or taking space in Europe.
And many observers see opportunities in the future for American companies or individuals with expertise in fast-track construction technology.
''The landscape is changing so fast that every day brings a whole new backdrop against which decisions are made,'' said Anthony P. D. Edgley, managing director of Jones Lang Wootton's investment and corporate real estate services. ''So it is still too early to make a sensible prognosis for what sorts of opportunities will exist, and for whom.
''But because the new trade rules will involve special enterprise zones, there will be new growth regions. When that happens there is going to be a premium on the skills needed for the sort of fast track construction methods that Americans employ as a matter of course, but which do not exist in Europe.''
It was, in the main, its experience with high-rise construction that provided Tishman Speyer Properties with the opportunity to join Citibank and Kajima Corporation in the Frankfurt office tower project. The 920,000-square-foot tower, designed by Helmut Jahn of Murphy/Jahn, the Chicago architectural firm, will be the tallest office building in Europe.
Daniele D. Bodini, the Italian-born president of American Continental Properties, believes his $120 million plan to redevelop the brewery in Rome would not have stood a chance without an Italian partner.
''As far as development and ownership in Europe are concerned,'' said Mr. Bodini, who acquired the vacant brewery in 1985 when Italy's economy was in a slump, ''America by comparison is very open. In Italy you must have the right contacts - professional, financial and political.''
Even with those contacts it took nearly five years for the project to work its way through the approval process. It is not unusual, Mr. Bodini said, for some projects to be on hold for 10 or 20 years.
The brewery, in the heart of Rome's financial district, will have 80,000 square feet of office space, 60,000 square feet of retail space and 90 apartments. Mr. Bodini hopes to start construction later this year and finish the project in three years.
Some American companies have used their work for other American companies as their springboards into the development arena overseas.
Swanke Hayden Connell went to London in the early 80's as the architect and design consultant to Chemical Bank, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrett and Shearson American Express when those companies were expanding overseas with the internationalization of the financial markets.
''WE had done work for these companies before,'' said Richard S. Hayden, a partner in the firm who now travels regularly to its London office, where it has 60 employees. ''When they decided to expand operations in London they had us do the work because we were familiar with their needs and how their operations worked. Hiring local designers and architects there would have been like starting from square one.''
Swanke Hayden Connell decided to open its London office after it won a design competition there and had been invited to submit other designs.
''We hit a building boom there,'' said Mr. Hayden. ''And at the same time development was slowing down at home. With economic unity approaching, it became clear that we should pursue opportunities in London and the rest of Europe.''
Mr. Hayden said his firm has found, as other American firms have, that familiarity with large-scale design has given it an edge.
''The projects now being built are a big jump for the local designers,'' he said. ''What we consider to be state of the art office design takes a certain discipline that you just do not see on a large scale overseas.''
While its largest volume of work is in London or its outskirts, Swanke Hayden Connell also has design assignments in France, Turkey and Germany.
One of its largest and most visible assignments is a new office development at 100 Old Broad Street in the Financial District, which recently won local planning approval.
The eight-story building, a joint venture of Wates City and Friends Provident Life, both of London, will hold 300,000 square feet of space. The new structure will have 40,000-square-foot floors, unusually large for London office buildings.
Involvement by American real estate professionals will probably not be limited to development and design work.
Cushman & Wakefield, an national commercial real estate brokerage and consulting company, announced a plan to form a joint venture with Healey & Baker, a London-based real estate concern with offices throughout the United Kingdom and Europe.
Stephen F. Anfang, for example, is a Manhattan-based investor who is currently negotiating to buy an interest in an real estate brokering company in London. Mr. Anfang is convinced that, despite the worldwide reach of international brokerage concerns like Jones Lang Wootton and Richard Ellis, there is room for expansion in the service end of the industry.
''I have spent time and money trying to find something that made sense,'' said Mr. Anfang. ''From what I have seen, the best opportunities are at the service end. We see potential clients in American companies that will be going abroad and for London-based companies that need real estate consultants in this country.''

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Amenities No Longer Just a Seductive Option

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
''WE don't try to make money on amenities,'' said Eric Eicher, president of Sabal Park, a big office campus outside Tampa, Florida, ''but in the long run, they pay for themselves.''
The developer, a past president of the National Association of Industrial and Office Parks, has become an expert on one of the fastest-growing sidelines of office development, the provision of special services, from the ubiquitous day care center to the exotic private limousine service.
Those services help to retain tenants and a happy work force while giving a sense of distinction in a market where one suburban office building often looks much like the next one.
When the first modern office towers were being built in American cities, tenants did not expect much from their landlords beyond elevator operators and a night watchman. Everything else employers and their employees needed - newsstands, coffee shops, transportation, banks and housing - were either just around the corner or nearby. 
But when American offices started moving out to the suburbs where more and more of their workers lived, developers and the companies that rented space from them found that more than just the scenery was different.
Particularly after the suburbs became crowded with office parks, the competition for an able - and stable - workforce awakened employers to the need to provide services and amenities they had taken for granted in the city, and to house these services right in the office park, next to the workplace.
Along with the parking lot and the cafeteria, employers have come to expect developers to provide day-care centers, health clubs, jogging trails, tennis courts, shuttle buses and even training centers.
Beset by high suburban housing costs, some employers have even moved the care of employees beyond the office building by starting programs to help them buy housing within a reasonable commuting distance of work.
These services and conveniences now have become part of the office culture. They cost money, but builders justify the costs as a kind of loss leader that is made up for in greater space rentals.
For in a post-industrial service economy where one glass box with an artificial pond in front looks much like the next one, and where one office job closely resembles another, both builders and employers are finding that a few extra amenities help distinguish their enterprises from the competitions'.
''It's true that amenities have costs associated with them, but so do high employee turnover rates or an inability to attract the people you need,'' said Mr. Eicher, whose Sabal Park is a 1,000-acre office campus.
The 3 million-square-foot Sabal complex includes amenities that have become almost standard in many big suburban complexes - tennis courts, a day care center, meeting rooms, a three-mile outdoor jogging path, a helicopter landing pad and more.
But Mr. Eicher also lured branches of the Hillsboro County Community College and the Irwin Technical High School to his complex, which offer on-site training in computers, accounting, management and other office skills for his tenants.
''They don't have to set up their own training program this way,'' Mr. Eicher said of his tenants, which include Coca-Cola, Boise Cascade and Snap-On Tools.
''If they want an employee to be able to use d-Base or Lotus 1-2-3, they don't have to assign someone to do the training, they can just send him to school for a while, almost right next door.''
Some companies, in fact, offer their employees amenities that reach even farther beyond the daily workplace.
The high cost of living within sensible commuting distance of the office has prompted several concerns to include help with employee housing, either by offering below-market mortgages, like the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company of Newark, or by supporting nonprofit housing development programs, as the the Giant Food Corporation of suburban Washington does, to expand the supply of housing for its employees.
Sill other companies are creating equity-sharing housing programs with employees, with the company paying a part of the price, and owning a share of the worker's house, as the Regional Health Maintenance Organization of Los Angeles does.
In all cases, the reach of corporate services beyond the office involves keeping workers loyal and on the job.
''There are many companies that would like tomove to certain areas but they know they couldn't find the workers,'' Mr. Eicher said. ''With 5 percent unemployment, you can move out to some parts of Connecticut and run an ad for 500 employees, and nobody shows up.''
One of the most unusual amenities to be added to an office complex is the public ampitheater, built into the side of a hill, that Childress/Klein Properties included in the Galleria, a highly successful office campus in Atlanta.
The developers turn the outdoor stage over to local musicians, who serenade picknicking employees at lunch time, and also make the theater available to community groups after working hours.
No element of the growth in corporate concern for the care and convenience of office workers has received more interest than office day-care centers, which seem to have become nearly as universal as potted palms in the lobby. ''Mr. or Mrs. Executive may not care as much about day care as the staff who works for them,'' said Melanie Circle, a vice president of Galbreath-Huff Companies, an office park developer in the Columbus, Ohio, area.
''BUT the office workers have come to expect that service and the executive may start having trouble getting people to work every morning if parents feel their kids aren't being property cared for.'' Galbreath-Huff has just completed the 1.1 million-square-foot Community Corporate Center, located just outside the northernmost stretch of the I-270 beltway.
Three years ago, Ms. Circle said, the hot item on the amenities list was the multistory atrium lobby with sunken seating spaces. Among other things, the big lobbies have become popular for parties, and civic groups like to use them for meetings on weekends.
Nowadays, transportation in the suburbs being what it is, Community Corporate Center has added an enormous Lincoln limousine with a driver at the tenant's beck and call, available 24 hours a day for $20 per hour - less than the cost of renting a common cab by the hour.
''They love to pick their clients up at the airport in it,'' she said.
But the year's most popular amenity, at least with the management class, is underground, controlled access parking, she said. Being able to park under cover and near the elevators, especially in bad weather, is an executive thrill.
''You can't build enough underground parking,'' Ms. Circle said.
OFFICE amenities have become so widespread in suburbia that they have begun to spread back to the city. The new $150 million Federal office building being built in downtown Chicago by Stein & Company, a local develpment and management firm, not only will have a health club and a employee medical services office, but it will also have the first downtown day-care center.
To get the day-care center, the developer had to win the repeal of a Chicago law prohibiting such child-care facilities within 4,000 feet of a licensed liquor outlet, which had effectively kept day-care centers out of the hotel- and restaurant-rich business district.
In addition, Illinois law reqires day-care-center entrances to be at grade level, usually the most valuable retail space in an urban setting, and to offer an outdoors playing area.
Stein & Compay solved this problem of child care by putting the children's center in a low-rise annex and the playground on a second-floor roof.
''We never expected the politics of office development to be so interesting,'' said Mark Appell, the project manager.

Debts Spur Land Auction

BYLINE: By FRANK BRIDGEWATER

 BODY:
THE Hamakua Sugar Company, one of Hawaii's biggest sugar companies, is hoping to sell 8,000 acres - almost all of it zoned for agriculture - to help pay off its debts. It will begin by offering 5,000 acres at two auctions here, on June 28 and Aug. 16, at which it expects to raise $65 million.
Hamakua was formed by consolidating seven smaller companies that date to the 1870's and 80's. Francis S. Morgan bought the company in 1984 from Theo. H. Davies & Company, where he was a vice president, and has been struggling to make it a success. He has modernized the sugar operations and diversified by developing a small retail cane syrup business and a beef operation that does everything from raising the cattle to slaughtering and packaging the meat. In addition, there have been layoffs and salary cuts, but the company is still being squeezed, in particular by what Mr. Morgan calls ''killer'' interest bills. 
He will use proceeds of the land sales to pay part of Hamakua's debt of about $98 million, $10 million of which is an emergency loan it got in 1988 from the Hawaii Department of Agriculture. Although Mr. Morgan, 71 years old, has been discussing land sales for some time, he was spurred on by two consecutive poor growing seasons. Bad weather, mostly heavy rains, and haze from the Kilauea volcano, resulted in low-quality crops.
The land being offered is primarily at the ends of the plantation. Mr. Morgan believes he will end up with a more economical plantation of about 23,000 acres on the island of Hawaii, which will continue to be the state's second-largest sugar plantation, behind Alexander & Baldwin, with nearly35,000 acres on Maui.
In the two sealed-bid auctions, Hamakua will sell 28 properties. The June offering is for smaller parcels at which bids are expected to be between $30,000 and $675,000, although Mr. Morgan said that 12 properties will be sold regardless of what the bids are.
The August offering will require minimum bids of $250,000 to $30 million. The properties range from two-acre homestead lots to a 2,640-acre parcel overlooking the Waipio Valley, with views of the Hiilawe Waterfall.
Also up for sale is the Kukuihaele plantation home, a turn-of-the-century 6,000-square-foot home built for the manager of the old Pacific Sugar Mill on a 14-acre site. It is priced at $2.5 million.
Among other parcels offered are ones suitable for golf courses or other tourist-related developments.

Winfield vs. the Yankees: A Case of Life and Law

BYLINE: By NORMAN DORSEN; Norman Dorsen is Stokes Professor of Law at New York University, and president of the American Civil Liberties Union. He is also a Mets fan.

 BODY:
Should it matter to us where a talented and rich and aging baseball player plies his trade? Should it matter whether a rich and controversial owner is leveling with the public when he says he opposed the player's trade despite a decade of rancorous disputes with that player? Should it matter whether the owner's aide insulted the player or merely showed insensitivity typical of employers who are ditching a once-valued employee?
The answer, apparently, is yes, at least for a large number of baseball fans. But why?
Race does not appear to be involved in this matter, although one cannot be sure that the Yankees would have treated an aging Don Mattingly or Dave Righetti the way they treated Dave Winfield. The principal owner, George Steinbrenner, conceded: ''It was handled about as poorly as we could handle it. It should have been handled differently.'' Amen. 
Does the controversy therefore reduce to the usual bottom line of what is best for the clubs - and players -involved? On a baseball level, maybe it does. The Yankees will be wondering whether Mike Witt will be the savior of an unsavory season. And the Angels, who are backing their judgment with big bucks, will be wondering whether Winfield has run out of gas. (He surely has charisma even if he isn't Reggie).
Even so, baseball isn't the whole story here. There was a hint of this in something Winfield said last Tuesday: ''In one sense I'm representing the rest of the players.'' There it is: Union solidarity. Keep the bosses in line. Another example of baseball players showing muscle after all those years as peons under the reserve clause.
Winfield also said, ''At this stage of my career I'm not going to let them walk all over me.''
These are the words of a proud man. The same man who didn't hesitate to stand up to Steinbrenner in the past and exact what he thought was due to him or to the David M. Winfield Foundation. A man who values dignity as well as dollars. A man like Curt Flood and Andy Messersmith, the sort who tries to change the world a little.
This is not merely a baseball phenomenon. History reveals many stiff-necked people who have provoked change. Rebellious auto workers chained themselves to their machines in the 1930's to force recognition of their union. And Rosa Parks, by refusing to sit in the back of the bus, helped ignite a movement that has altered race relations throughout the United States.
Baseball is not an isolated pursuit, but part of and a reflection of currents in the general society. When ballplayers say no, they continue a long tradition in which strong men and women refuse to allow others to rule their lives. The demands of workers for economic security, or racial or sexual equality, have always been personified by unyielding personalities.
We know that Winfield has long been unhappy with his treatment by Steinbrenner and the Yankee organization. What a heavenly result to be paid extra, even if by the Angels, to do what he may have wanted to do anyway: leave New York. And the Yankees had to pay him the full $100,000 in potential bonuses under his 1990 contract.
What about the law? By settling the case, and not going to arbitration, did Winfield and the Yankees cheat the public from a big decision, the sort that Flood and Messersmith provoked? Not likely.
The legal point at issue is narrow, whether baseball's basic labor agreement took precedence over Winfield's personal contract with the Yankees.
Under the basic agreement, only players with 10 years of major league experience and 5 years with the same team have the right to refuse a trade. We can assume that few of these veterans have a contract like Winfield's, which specifies teams to which he would accept a trade. While an arbitrator's decision in favor of the basic agreement or Winfield's contract would have clarified the legal situation, it would have affected only a small group of players.
So in the end it was life, not law, that decided Dave Winfield vs. the Yankees.

HEADLINE: Biotechnology Benefits From Glasnost

BYLINE: By CAROL STRICKLAND

 BODY:
AFTER communicating by satellite for 18 months, two high school students - one on Long Island and the other in Moscow - are about to realize their dream of establishing a center for biotechnology education in Moscow.
The goal of the New York State-Moscow School Telecommunications Project linking 13 schools in Moscow with high schools in New York was to foster cultural understanding and promote joint programs geared to solving problems shared by both countries.
Having an actual project as a focal point was crucial to the success of the program, according to David Egan, chairman of the Department of Social Studies at Cold Spring Harbor High School. Cold Spring is one of the two participating schools on Long Island; the other is Northport.
The students communicated about matters more important than, say, ''What music do you like?'' 
''That wears thin pretty fast,'' Dr. Egan said. ''Their friendships were also tested and strengthened by solving tough problems together.''
 
Electronic Pen Pals
The electronic pen pals and project partners - Steven Malloy, 17 years old, of Cold Spring Harbor and Nikita Skryabin, 15, of Moscow School No. 4 - had many problems to solve on their way to establishing a molecular biology ''exploratorium'' patterned after Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's DNA Learning Center.
''I've always been extremely interested in both biotechnology and the Soviet Union,'' said Steven in describing the origin of his idea for the project. ''I was reluctant to give up either interest, and when people advised me to focus on one field, I revolted and said, 'No, I'll do both.' ''
Having worked as an intern for two summers at the DNA Learning Center, the only institution devoted entirely to biotechnology education, Steven was already familiar with the activities of a program like the one he envisioned.
In the five years since its inception, the Cold Spring Harbor center has educated 1,400 high school teachers and 5,800 students in recombinant-DNA technology. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the basic hereditary material in chromosomes of all living organisms.
Steven soon discovered that his Soviet counterparts' level of gene literacy was much lower than in the States.
''There is not a lot of understanding of DNA in the U.S.S.R.,'' said Nikita, the son of three generations of Soviet biologists, on a visit to this country last December.
''The Soviet Union is particularly behind in this area,'' said Mark V. Bloom, assistant director of the Learning Center. ''It's logical for them to look to us for leadership, since the U.S. has played a pioneering role in genetic research.''
 
A Lag in Biological Sciences
Although Soviet science has produced breakthroughs in theoretical physics and mathematics, the biological sciences there have lagged far behind because of what David Micklos, director of the Learning Center, called ''a tragedy in the history of modern science.''
For about 30 years, until the mid-1960's, the Communist Party, under the influence of Trofim D. Lysenko, a plant breeder, officially approved the beliefs of the Frenchman Jean Baptiste Lamarck.
Lamarck (1744-1829) believed that traits acquired during one's lifetime could be inherited by offspring, a concept completely opposed to modern theories of heredity. Soviet geneticists who disputed this party doctrine were jailed or banished.
As a result, scientific investigation during the Stalin and Krushchev regimes was stifled. Although the ''green revolution'' of the 1950's and 60's produced ''miracle'' rice in the Far East and high-yielding strains of corn and wheat elsewhere in the world, plant and animal yields in the Soviet Union declined.
''Exactly at the critical period of the golden years in molecular biology,'' said Grigori Enikolopov, a visiting Russian scientist at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, ''we were kept from the mainstream and even from real science.''
The resulting loss of generations of geneticists, combined with a lack of information flow - Soviet scientists rarely attend international conferences and receive scientific journals a year late -are said to be chiefly accountable for the country's continued biotech backwardness.
 
What Everyone Said at First
Steven and Nikita were determined to remedy this deficiency in Soviet society, but initial reaction was skeptical.
''Everyone said, 'Nice idea, but are you really going to be able to do that?' '' Steve recalled. Even Dr. Egan believed originally that the project was too ambitious. ''It was very unlikely it could come to pass, but Steve just plugged away,'' he said.
Everyone involved in the project acknowledged the indispensable support of Nikita's father, Prof. Konstantin Skryabin, the influential director of the Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology.
Yet it was the Malloy youth who, in a series of April meetings in Moscow with high-level Soviet scientists and businessmen, hammered out the details of what will become the U.S.A.-U.S.S.R. Education Program for DNA and Biotechnology. Said Dr. Egan, who attended the negotiations: ''I tried not to take any leading role. My motive in this project is to have students realize they are more powerful and brighter than others give them credit for.''
 
Space in Institute Assured
Through Steven's efforts, a staff, a yearly budget of 30,000 rubles (the equivalent of $5,000) from the Soviet Ministry of Science and Technology and working space in the well-equipped, modern Shemyakin Institute in Moscow are now assured.
Evgeny Velikhov, Mikhail Gorbachev's personal science adviser, a Central Committee Member and vice president of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., has sanctioned the proposal. In a letter to Dr. Bloom about the new center, he wrote:
''This would allow us to achieve a new level of education in the field of biology; it would open new opportunities to popularize this advanced direction among the widest circle of [the] community and to get rid of myths connected with DNA research.''
''One thing is clear,'' said Mr. Micklos. ''There is a level in the Soviet Government that has now come to think that educating young people about DNA is an important objective.''
Mr. Micklos and Dr. Bloom left for Moscow May 5 to spend 10 days consulting on how the Learning Center model may best be adapted to teach Soviet high school students.
This initiative represents as much of a departure for the Soviet system of education as, say, substituting a Big Mac for borscht. Soviet students are typically described as passive learners, being required to master rote memorization of facts more than problem-solving or critical thinking.
''Every Soviet school child has to learn exactly the same thing,'' said Mart Ustav, a visiting Estonian scientist who has three children attending Long Island schools. ''Here you have a more differentiated approach.''
 
'Kids Are Constantly Pushed'
Dr. Enikolopov, with two children in American schools, agreed.
''The most surprising thing about your system,'' he said, ''is that here kids are constantly pushed to do something on their own - to have an idea and try to implement it.''
His own children, he said, were at first ''shy, not believing in their own strength, compared to the kids here. But now they have more self-assurance and confidence in what they can do, which I attribute to the school system and the environment.''
Steven Malloy's self-reliance proved invaluable in overcoming obstacles presented by the Soviet system.
''I think the Russian word for 'deadline' is 'tomorrow,' '' he said. ''Soviets are very encouraging when you speak to them, but they're not action-oriented, and the work ethic is not so good yet.''
Everyone involved with the project attests to numerous frustrations caused by inefficiency, bureaucracy and the maddeningly slow pace of the Soviet mentality.
''Nothing goes smoothly when working with the Soviets,'' Dr. Egan said. ''You got about a week?'' he joked when a visitor asked him to specify the frustrations that he and Steven encountered.
Despite cultural differences and an ingrained aversion to risk-taking in the Soviet Union, the U.S.A.-U.S.S.R. Education Program for DNA and Biotechnology, patterned on the Long Island model, is scheduled to start instructing Moscow high school students this fall.
 
A Study in Contrasts
The hands-on, folksy, low-key approach of the Learning Center, which attempts to make science experimentation fun and exciting for students, will be in sharp contrast to the regimented, lecture-oriented Soviet system of pedagogy.
''We advocate letting young people get their hands dirty with the technology,'' said Mr. Micklos.
The fact that the Soviets are willing to learn from the theories and practice of former arch-enemies, and that such an international endeavor was conceived and promulgated by two high school students, reflects what Dr. Bloom termed ''glasnost, DNA- style.''
''Five years ago,'' Dr. Egan said, ''I would have said this was absolutely 100 percent impossible.''
One event that gave the American participants pause was the retention of a Cold Spring Harbor High School teacher's wife, a Soviet native, in Moscow when the American high school contingent left to return home.
''There are still remnants of the old closed society,'' Steve said of the incident, ''no matter how much you speak of glasnost.''
Mr. Ustav, a supporter of independence for the Baltic states and critic of the Soviet system, also cautioned about the transfer of technology to Moscow. ''How can you be certain it won't be used against you?'' he asked. ''I'm not optimistic about the Soviet economy in the future,'' Steven Malloy responded, ''but I don't think there will be a closure to western society. They can't turn back now.''

HEADLINE: Faded Glory of Syracuse

BYLINE: By MARY TAYLOR SIMETI; MARY TAYLOR SIMETI'S most recent book is ''Pomp and Sustenance: Twenty-Five Centuries of Sicilian Food''(Knopf).

 BODY:
ONE can never be sure how people will react to Syracuse, a city that appears hesitant, uncertain of its magnitude and its identity, belonging neither with the big Sicilian ports of Palermo, Catania and Messina nor with the smaller and sleepier provincial capitals like Agrigento and Enna. Some visitors to Syracuse are fascinated by the evocative atmosphere of faded glory in what was once the greatest and perhaps most beautiful of the Greek cities in the western Mediterranean. Others are put off by the ugliness of the new city, and by the decay and neglect that deface the old.
When I confided to Dr. Curcio, the vice director of the city's splendid new archeological museum, my doubts as to how to communicate my own enthusiasm for Syracuse without creating false expectations, she gave an answer that moved me: ''Only those whose eyes are veiled by history can understand Syracuse.'' In other, more prosaic words, it is only the awareness of what Syracuse has been (and of what, God and Sicilian politicians willing, it could become) that allows one to fully savor its present charms. 
The heart of Syracuse lies on Ortygia, a small island little more than a mile long and half again as wide, connected by bridge to the southeastern shore of Sicily and embraced by a large natural harbor and a wide and fertile plain. The advantages of such a site have attracted settlers since the beginning of the Stone Age and must have been readily obvious to the Greek colonists from Corinth who landed here in 733 B.C. and put the native Sicel population to flight.
Ideally situated for commerce and with a rich agriculture behind it, the colony thrived and expanded to the mainland, building bridges and causeways and extending its walls to incorporate each new neighborhood as it was settled, a first golden age of growth and power that culminated in an epic victory over Athens in 413 B.C. The passage of time has preserved the monuments of Ortygia from this period in an unusual fashion: the Fountain of Arethusa, a freshwater spring at the sea's edge, which the Greeks believed was connected to their homeland by an underground river, is still a favorite meeting place for the youth of Syracuse, who hang over the railings as they chat and throw bread (and, occasionally, garbage) to the ducks swimming among the papyrus. The process of history is most strikingly evident in the cathedral a few blocks away. Once past the graceful 18th-century Baroque facade, visitors find themselves inside the severe simplicity of an early Christian church, which, as closer inspection reveals, has evolved from the Temple of Athena, its peristyle filled in to form outer walls in which the Doric columns are still visible, and its inner walls, the former cella, pierced by arches. Subsequent transformations have done little to disturb the harmonious proportions of the ancient temple, the gifts of each age melding gracefuly with those of its predecessors.
Nature as well as man has worked to transform the monuments in the mainland neighborhoods of Akradina and Neapolis, which twice over, in classical times and after World War II, have seen Syracuse's residential expansion. Scattered throughout their curious mixture of archeological sites and apartment buildings are the Latomie, the quarries that provided first the stones to build Syracuse and then the space to guard its enemies: vines of ivy, capers and bougainvillea curtain the once barren walls, and fig and orange trees grow on the ground where the defeated and imprisoned Athenian soldiers once languished, in what are perhaps the most haunted and haunting sunken gardens in the world.
Syracuse in the fifth century B.C. was not just muscle. The courts of its rulers attracted poets like Pindar and Theocritus; Plato visited and complained of the vice and the overeating (Syracuse boasts the first cookbook and the first cooking school in the Western world, a tradition of good food that continues to the present), and Aeschylus is thought to have produced ''Prometheus Bound'' in the linear theater that was built on the mainland to his specifications.
This theater, still visible in the archeological park of Neapolis, is overshadowed by the neighboring and more spectacular semicircular theater that dates from the third century B.C. Here too successive rebuildings have created an enormously evocative site, which is still used for a biennial festival of classical drama. (This year Sophocles' ''Electra'' and ''The Persians'' by Aeschylus will be produced in Italian translation on alternate evenings from Tuesday to July 1.) It is an extraordinary experience to sit on these stones and watch darkness fall over the players and the full moon rise behind the backdrop of cyprus trees as an ancient tragedy comes to its inexorable close.
Syracuse fell to the Romans in 211 B.C. and lived quietly and happily on the outskirts of the empire for several centuries. It was an important center for early Christianity: St. Paul preached here, St. Lucy was born and martyred here and Syracuse's catacombs are among the most extensive in the world. Those that lead down from the gardens next to the ruined Church of San Giovanni are open to visitors.
DESPITE centuries of Roman domination Syracuse never lost its ties to the Greek language and customs and eventually became an outpost of the Byzantine Empire and then its capital during the reign of the Emperor Constans II. But Constans came to an inglorious end here in 668 (murdered in the imperial baths when struck on the head with a soap dish), and from then on it was downhill all the way. The city fell to the Arabs in 878 and then to the Normans. The population shrank, and those who remained withdrew to Ortygia, leaving the mainland to the sheep and the weeds. A brief period of prosperity came under the Normans in the 12th century, and then again from the 14th to the 16th centuries. Many of Ortygia's buildings date from this latter period, among them the lovely palazzo that houses the Bellomo Museum, where the newly restored Antonello da Messina ''Annunciation,'' Caravaggio's ''Burial of St. Lucy'' and a handsome collection of Sicilian decorative arts are on display.
Real wealth and power never returned, however. Even the wave of rebuilding after the 1693 earthquake, which created Noto and the other magnificent new Baroque cities to the south, only lapped at Ortygia's shores, redesigning in splendid fashion Piazza del Duomo and revamping the aristocratic palazzos with pillared courtyards that line the Via delle Maestranze. And prosperity, when in the 20th century it finally did arrive, almost proved to be Syracuse's undoing. The generalized improvement in economic conditions that accompanied Italy's postwar boom allowed the inhabitants of Syracuse to escape from the tiny and decaying medieval houses of Ortygia, one and two-room apartments with no heating, no sanitation and very little structural stability. In a wave of speculation, new apartment buildings, totally characterless but safe and comfortable, sprang up around the ruins of the temples and the theaters of Neapolis, Akradina and other classical neighborhoods of mainland Syracuse. At the same time the rent-control board declared Ortygia a ''decayed area,'' its rents stabilized at the same levels as the slum areas of the big cities to the north.
Although Italy neglects much of its cultural and artistic heritage, it must be said that the heritage to be cared for is vast. In Syracuse a beginning has been made. The most tangible evidence is that, thanks to the tireless battling of Syracuse's Superintendent of Antiquities, Giuseppe Voza, and after more than 20 years of intermittent planning and building, in January 1988 the new Paolo Orsi Archeological Museum was opened. The huge and splendid collection, which was once on partial display in Piazza Duomo, can be viewed in modern quarters expressly built for it in the gardens of Villa Landolina in Akradina.
The museum is still a work in progress: the upper floor with the Hellenistic and Roman collection is not yet ready, and the English translations of labels and other educational materials have not yet been installed, although they should be in place by the end of the year.
The building is vaguely triangular in floor plan, composed of hexagonal modules radiating from a center pavilion, which houses a general introductory display. The peripheral area is divided into three sections: the first deals with the development of eastern Sicily from the geological formation of the area until the arrival of the Greeks, the second with the establishment of the Greek colonies and the last with the period of Syracuse's expansion into the hinterland in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. Temporal and geographical origins have been severely respected, in order not only to give the most possible information about the context of each piece but also to demonstrate the interconnections and reciprocal influences between the different local cultures and with those, such as the Mycenean, which came from overseas.
The single pieces on display - a Bronze Age portal that once blocked the entrance to a tomb carved in a cliff, with a haunting spiral design thought to be a schematized representation of the act of sexual intercourse; pre-Greek vases of unbelievable grace and elegance; an archaic terra cotta Demeter enthroned; a limestone statue of the Great Mother nursing twins - are so eloquent that they will speak for themselves to those who only want a rapid visit. Non-Italian speakers who wish to take full advantage of what the museum offers should apply to the nearby Provincial Tourist Office, which has a handsome free booklet on the museum, with a bilingual English and Italian text, and can on advance notice arrange for an English-speaking guide.
Things are looking up in Ortygia, too. In 1976 the Sicilian Regional Government passed legislation to protect the historical centers of its cities from speculation, and under the aegis of a commission of archeologists, art historians, architects and urban planners, a zoning plan for Ortygia has been drawn up, which maps out the city room by room and determines which buildings must be demolished and the criteria by which the rest can be restructured. This plan is in the final stages of approval, although problems remain: it is still necessary to decide what sort of development is possible in an area characterized by very small architectural units (hypotheses include the establishment of a university city and the creation of a port specially equipped for tourism) and to find political safeguards against the illegal overnight building that has disfigured so much of Italy.
Most encouraging of all, I found, is the passion for their work and their city that seemed to characterize many of the Syracusans that I talked to, from the chefs like Giovanni Guarneri or Egidio Maiorca, who have inherited Syracuse's ancient culinary tradition, to Dr. Curcio at the museum, who glows when she talks about what the museum is trying to do, or Gigliola Nocera, a young environmental activist, who after having dinner with us stayed up all night working with a lawyer to get a court order to block some illegal building in Ortygia. If the powers that be will stand behind people like this, there is hope that Syracuse can arouse once more the universal admiration bestowed upon her by the ancients.
 
Viewing the revival of a once-proud outpost
 
Where to Stay
Syracuse once had a wealth of beautiful hotels, all of which are now abandoned, bankrupt or in a state of decline. What remains are modern hotels in the new part of the city.
Jolly Hotel, Corso Gelone; telephone, from the United States: 011-39-931-64744. Room for two with bath: $150 (figured at the rate of 1,164 lire to $1). First-class hotel with recently renovated rooms; on the noisy main shopping street.
 
Park Hotel, 80 Via Filisto; 011-39-931-32644. Room for two with shower or bath: $90. Comfortable, recently redecorated second-class hotel with pool and tennis courts. On the outskirts of the city but well connected by bus to the center.
Hotel Bellavista, 4 Via Diodoro Siculo; 011-39-931-36912. Room for two with shower: $58; breakfast: $7.75. Small family-run hotel in picturesque location, easily accessible by bus.
 
Where to Eat
Syracuse has many restaurants, trattorias and pizzerias. The cooking is based mainly on fish, which tends to be expensive, and the bill will soar for lobster or giant shrimp.
Ristorante Don Camillo, 100 Via delle Maestranze 100; telephone, dialed locally, 67133; closed Mondays. Reservations advisable in the evening. An average meal with wine: $30 to $35 a person. A pleasant restaurant with an imaginative menu.
La Foglia, 29 Via Capodieci; 461569; closed Tuesdays. An average meal: $21 to $30. A good place to find the vegetables that Sicily is famous for. The food relies heavily on Sicilian tradition and is attractively served.
Ristorante Pizzeria Al Delfino, Riva Porto Lachio (Sbarcadero S. Lucia); 68229; closed Mondays. An average three-course meal: $17 to $25; a pizza and a beer: $4.25 to $9.50. It was a relief to track down Egidio Maiorca, who used to sell some of the best pizzas in Sicily at his place in Piazza Archimede. Pizza available in the evening only (which is true almost everywhere in Sicily); at noon Egidio serves pasta and fish or meat and if asked will produce typical Sicilian pasta dishes.
Trattoria Il Cenacolo, 9/10 Via del Consiglio Reginale; 65099; closed Wednesdays. An average three-course meal: $17 to $22; pizza and beer or wine: $4.25 to $9.50. A simple but sympathetic trattoria in a pretty court in Ortygia. As you go by, don't miss, farther down the street at No. 13, the lovely medieval arched doorway with St. George and his dragon carved on the keystone.
 
What to Buy
Syracuse is not particularly rich in handicrafts: the most common are small sheets of papyrus made from the plants that grow along the Ciane River and painted or printed with Greek or Egyptian motifs. I have been told that the best choice can be found at the Centro di Papiro next to the entrance to the Archeological Museum. My preferences are gastronomical.
All the typical sweets of eastern Sicily are on display at the Pasticceria L. Marciante (39 Via della Maestranze; 67303; closed Mondays), from cubbaita (sesame brittle of Arab origin) to fig-filled buccellati, plus wonderful works of marzipan. Be sure to step into the room to the right to see the Greek temple and Noah's Ark.
On 24-hour notice and for about $4.50, the Panificio Bianca (42 Via Roma; 65805; closed Sundays and Wednesday afternoons) will bake you a ruota di pane, an intricately woven and decorative wheel of bread two feet in diameter.
 
What to Read
I am very fond of the affectionate if slightly out-of-date descriptions of Syracuse in ''The Travellers' Guide to Sicily'' by Christopher Kininmonth (Jonathan Cape, 1965). The new Blue Guide is good for factual and recent information. Part of ''The Mask of Apollo'' by Mary Renault takes place in fifth century B.C. Syracuse and brings the stones to life, as does, in a more scholarly way, Thucydides' ''Peloponnesian Wars.''
 
Note of Caution
Syracuse is no longer a place devoid of crime. There is a great deal of purse snatching, and, as in other big cities, visitors should leave documents and valuables in their hotels and rely on pockets rather than bags.
 
Information
The Provincial Tourist Agency (Azienda Provinciale Turismo) has two information offices: one at 45 Via S. Sebastiano (67710) in front of the Church of San Giovanni, and the other at the entrance to the archeological park, Largo Teatro Greco (60510). They can, with a little prodding to overcome bureaucratic indolence, supply visitors with a booklet in English on the museum, with information on theater tickets, museum hours and the many sights in Syracuse and the outlying area. They can also arrange for English-speaking guides, preferably on advance notice. M. T. S.

HEADLINE: Focus: California;
Replacing S & L's as Financing Sources

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN SHARP

 BODY:
IRA C. NORRIS, a builder of affordable housing in Southern California, has been in business since 1977 and has never dealt with a savings and loan institution. Instead, his company, Inco Homes, based here, has taken the untraditional route of getting construction loans solely from banks.
Now, with the nation's savings and loan industry in deep trouble, he considers the financing he has done for the last 13 years more a matter of luck than shrewd foresight.
''I'm not brilliant,'' he said. ''I just don't do business with S. & L.'s.'' 
Dozens of California builders have been either lucky or shrewd in avoiding the credit crunch that has squeezed others throughout the country in the last nine months as Federal law has tightened savings-and-loan lending practices. Some have either increased their reliance on banks and mortgage lenders or discovered new sources of capital, such as pension funds and insurers.
''California isn't being hurt as much as other parts of the country,'' said Richard W. Nelson, vice president and chief economist for the the Federal Home Bank of San Francisco, which oversees thrifts in California, Arizona and Nevada. Mr. Nelson added that it is too early to gather statistics on the impact of the harder line taken by savings and loan associations.
Historically, savings and loans and banks have provided 95 percent of the financing for commercial and residential projects. In California, they have provided as much as 100 percent of start-up costs and have lent the bulk of the building funds.
This generous and long-standing practice changed drastically in August, when Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, known as Firrea, which severely limited savings-and-loan lending practices.
The law basically prohibits equity investments by thrifts in real estate projects, said Tom Kelley, a partner in the Irvine, Calif., office of Arthur Andersen & Company, the Big 8 accounting firm.
Another key provision reduced to 15 percent the amount of its core capital that a thrift can lend to any one borrower. This was meant to spread risks so that one thrift does not rely so heavily on the fortunes of one builder. But the effect has been that builders must seek more than one lender for a project. ''Everyone is scrambling for debt money,'' said Mr. Kelley. Smaller developers are scrambling the farthest, say builders. In February, Steve Hopkins of the Hopkins Development Company in Newport Beach was approached by four other developers, whose smaller projects had been canceled because of a lack of financing, he said. Each asked Mr. Hopkins if he would participate, but he refused. ''It's chilling to see what's happening,'' said Mr. Hopkins.
Indeed, many sources of capital no longer exist. Large lenders such as Imperial Savings in San Diego have been seized by Federal regulators. Others, such as Santa Barbara Savings & Loan, were prohibited from lending months before they were seized.
Compounding the problem is an advisory letter the Comptroller of the Currency sent out in February to national banks warning them to carefully control the amount and type of real estate lending. That further shrank the available pool of capital nationwide. Then, this month, Federal Reserve officials began urging banks not to restrict lending to borrowers they considered sound.
Despite the confusion, most California developers have not stopped building. The state's banks are filling part of the gap, according to Bob Skinkle, an economist with Wells Fargo Bank, based in San Francisco. At the end of the first quarter, real estate lending at California banks had jumped 28 percent from 1989 levels.
Some developers have been wooing other capital sources for years. In 1987, Warmington Homes in Costa Mesa, a builder of single-family homes, obtained equity participations from insurers To spread the builder's sources farther, Skip Beck, vice president of finance, said he has been talking with Japanese lenders, among them Mitsui Manufacturers Bank in Los Angeles and Mitsubishi Corporation's trust division.
''It's not going to be quick and easy introducing the Japanese to developing in California,'' said Mr. Beck. ''But we need to explore the possibility.''
Hopkins Development has made an end run around lenders by successfully forging an equity partnership with a pension fund. After having difficulty getting a loan from its long-time primary lender, a thrift, Mr. Hopkins started searching for another master partner. In 1987, he found the Massachusetts State Retirement System, which has bought a 50 percent stake in the Newport Beach development company.
''If it weren't for that, I'd be in the same boat as a lot of other developers,'' he said.
SOME experts think Firrea will restructure the nation's financial markets by slowly killing thrifts not only as a source of loans for developers, but also for home buyers. In a sample survey of its members, the California Association of Realtors found that 60 percent of the state's newly originated first mortgages to home buyers stemmed from thrifts as recently as 1987. Last year, that number dropped to 40 percent.
''Clearly, the trend is away from thrifts,'' said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of research and economics at the association.
Meanwhile, mortgage bankers have increased their share of first mortgages to account for 44 percent of California home loans to home buyers, compared to 30 percent in 1984. During the same period, the portion of bank mortgage loans doubled to account for 11 percent last year.
The slowdown in thrift lending follows the cooling of California's real estate market. The average number of unsold new houses has more than doubled in the last half of 1989, said Ms. Appleton-Young. ''The transactions sold in the first part of last year were in a very, very hot market,'' she said. ''Now it's a much more normal market.''
Climbing interest rates have also helped to slow the state's real estate market, said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank. In January, the average fixed mortgage rate was 9.9 percent; by April it had climbed to 10.25 percent.
All these factors have prompted analysts to project further slowdowns in California residential and commerical construction this year. Ben Bartolotto, research director of the Construction Industry Research Board, a private organization based in Burbank, Calif., that monitors building permits in the state, forecasts a 12 percent drop in single-family housing this year, a 4 percent dip in multifamily housing and a 9 percent decrease in nonresidential building.
''We've been expecting a slowdown,'' said Mr. Bartolotto. ''But whether it has to do with changes in thrift laws - well, I suspect not.''
A building slowdown, along with tighter lending controls, makes for a healthy correction, according to Richard Peiser, professor of urban regional planning at University of Southern California in Los Angeles. ''I see this as a short-term correction of a market that has been overheated by rapid price increases in the last few years,'' he said.
Small developers may have trouble surviving the days of scarce credit, but Mr. Peiser sees the situation adjusting by 1992. ''There will be opportunities for institutions and investors who are willing to take the equity risks formerly taken by S. & L.'s,'' he said.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION: SANTA BARBARA, CALIF.;
After 22 Years, a Downtown Mall To Fit the City's Low-Key Image

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN SHARP

 BODY:
IN just three months, this city's first downtown mall - the $150 million, 463,000-square-foot Paseo Nuevo, a joint private-municipal venture - is scheduled to open with The Broadway and Nordstrom department stores as its anchors in a total of 304,000 square feet.
So far, no tenants have yet signed for the mall's 60 shops and food outlets in 135,000 square feet, its 14,000 square feet of office space and its 10,000 square feet for an art gallery and a 200-seat theater.
But John H. Reininga Jr., chairman of the Reininga Corporation of San Francisco, the co-developer of the project with the Santa Barbara City Redevelopment Agency, said that he expects to have the mall 60 percent leased when it has its ''grand opening'' in November. The department stores alone will be open for business on Aug. 17. Major financing is being provided by JMB Realty of Chicago, which is also handling the leasing. 
The Spanish-style complex on State Street in the heart of the retail district is spread over two blocks seven blocks east of Route 101, which snakes along California's coast. Its realization is the culmination of a 22-year effort to draw local shoppers, who in 1988 spent about $100 million in retail purchases outside Santa Barbara County, into this city's stores.
The mall will include a system of walkways, interior courtyards, plazas, and fountains. At one corner will sit Nordstrom's 169,000 square-foot-store. At the opposite end will sit The Broadway's 135,000-square-foot-store. Laid out between them is 135,000 square-feet of retail space. Mr. Reininga said he would like to see 20 percent of that space occupied by local tenants, although many merchants have said they cannot afford the rent.
The mall's architect, John Field, has been working with the city's Architectural Review Board to maintain standards set in 1925. The Landmarks Committee also had to approve every structural design to insure that the mall retains the city's Spanish lines. Red-tiled roofs, white stucco walls, palm trees and hand-painted signs are regulated characteristics of this tourist town.
''THE degree and intensity with which Santa Barbara reviews a project's architecture cannot be found in any other part of the country,'' said Prof. David Gebhard, an architectural historian who teaches at the University of California at Santa Barbara. The only other cities in the nation with architectural review boards are Nantucket, Mass., and Santa Fe, N. M., said Professor Gebhard.
Eight other review boards and committees also had to sign off on various phases of development. Said Mr. Reininga: ''When you're developing in a slow-growth enviornment in a town as sensitive as Santa Barbara, it becomes a real challenge.''
For its part, the city has so far spent a total of $42 million on the project, including $411,000 for an archeological dig to make sure no major historical site lay beneath the mall. The excavation unearthed some 19th century medicine bottles and Chinese privies; the development proceeded.
To make room for the mall, the city spent $16.5 million purchasing seven acres of existing retail space; $2 million on relocating 35 small shops and businesses that were on that land and $13 million on two garages with 1,115 parking spaces.
IN return for its investment, the city expects to realize up to $2 million in annual sales and property taxes and 20 percent of any rent increases once the mall is fully leased. After 75 years, the land will revert to the city.
Situated 125 miles up the coast from Los Angeles, this city of 80,000 residents with its predominantly Spanish-style, tile-roofed buildings, is snuggled between the San Ynez Mountains and the Pacific. Its households have the highest levels of discretionary spending power in the state, according to the Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce.
The chamber said county households spent $24,000 on discretionary purchases last year, which was 25 percent more than the California average and 34 percent higher than the national average. Yet only three other large department stores - Sears Roebuck and Robinson's in La Cumbre Plaza three miles north of downtown and Gotschalk's in Santa Maria - serve the 343,000 residents of Santa Barbara County.
Part of the reason for the slow pace of retail rentals in Paseo Nuevo could be the rents. They range from $30 to $72 a square foot, depending on the tenant and the nature of the space, as opposed to about $16.50 for existing downtown space.
This discrepancy has caused downtown landlords to sit on existing empty space, rather than commit to 10-year leases that might not reflect values two years down the road. Because of construction gridlock, noise and confusion caused by the development of Paseo Nuevo over the last two years and extensive road improvement projects downtown, many shops have shut down.
This, said Mark Schniepp, who is a research economist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has helped to create double the available commercial space of a decade ago. Now, said Steve Cushman, president of the local Chamber of Commerce, there is about a 30 percent retail vacancy rate downtown - ''with a lot of big buildings sitting empty.''
But a 3 million-square-foot cap on commercial construction over the next 20 years, plus an open-ended moratorium on water hookups because of severe drought conditions, enhances the value of all commercial buildings, said Mr. Schniepp.
The open-air Pasa Nuevo is the result of the creation in 1968 of the Santa Barbara City Redevelopment Agency, formed to revitalize the downtown area by attracting a major retail center.
In the last 20 years, there have been two unsuccessful efforts to stem the outflow of retail dollars. In the early 70's, a proposal for a 650,000-square-foot shopping center was rejected by the Planning Commission as ''too big, not Santa Barbara scale,'' said John Bridley, assistant community development director for the Redevelopment Agency.
He noted that State Street is lined mostly with one-story boutiques, specialty shops and cafes - in keeping with the city's low profile.
And in the late 70's, voters soundly defeated a city proposal to bring in a 70,000-square-foot free-standing department store. Finally, in 1986, it awarded Reininga the project after considering proposals from a total of 10 developers.

HEADLINE: California Developers Find New Financing Sources

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN SHARP

DATELINE: UPLAND, CALIF.

 BODY:
Ira C. Norris, a builder of affordable housing in Southern California, has been in business since 1977 and has never dealt with a savings and loan institution. Instead, his company, Inco Homes, based here, has taken the untraditional route of getting construction loans solely from banks.
Now, with the nation's savings and loan industry in deep trouble, he considers the financing he has done for the last 13 years more a matter of luck than shrewd foresight.
''I'm not brilliant,'' he said. ''I just don't do business with S. & L.'s.''
Dozens of California commercial and residential builders have been either lucky or shrewd in avoiding the credit crunch that has squeezed other developers throughout the country in the last nine months as Federal law has tightened savings and loan lending practices. Some of those have either increased their reliance on banks and mortgage lenders or discovered new sources of capital, such as pension funds and insurers. 
''California isn't being hurt as much as other parts of the country,'' said Richard W. Nelson, vice president and chief economist for the the Federal Home Bank of San Francisco, which oversees thrifts in California, Arizona and Nevada. Mr. Nelson added that it is too early to gather statistics on the impact of the harder line taken by savings and loan associations.
Historically, savings and loans and banks have provided 95 percent of the money for building houses, commercial projects and other developments. In California, they have provided as much as 100 percent of a development's start-up costs and have lent the bulk of the building funds. This generous and long-standing practice changed drastically in August, when Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, known as Firrea. Designed to help stem the financial problems of the savings and loan industry, it severely limited lending policies.
The law basically prohibits equity investments by thrifts in real estate projects, said Tom Kelley, a partner in the Irvine, Calif., office of Arthur Andersen & Company, the Big 8 accounting firm. ''Now somebody's got to come forward with the down payment for these projects,'' he said.
Another key provision reduced to 15 percent the amount of its core capital that a thrift can lend to any one borrower. This was meant to spread risks so that one thrift does not rely so heavily on the fortunes of one builder. But the effect has been that builders must seek more than one lender for a project. ''Everyone is scrambling for debt money,'' said Mr. Kelley. Smaller developers are scrambling the farthest, say builders. In February, Steve Hopkins of the Hopkins Development Company in Newport Beach was approached by four other developers, whose smaller projects had been canceled because of a lack of financing, he said. Each developer asked Mr. Hopkins if he would participate in the project, which he declined to do. ''It's chilling to see what's happening,'' said Mr. Hopkins. Indeed, many sources of capital no longer exist. Large lenders such as Imperial Savings in San Diego have been seized by Federal regulators. Others, such as Santa Barbara Savings & Loan, were prohibited from making any loans months before they were finally seized.
Compounding the problem is an advisory letter the Comptroller of the Currency sent out in February to national banks warning them to carefully control the amount and type of real estate lending. That further shrank the available pool of capital nationwide. Then, this month, Federal Reserve officials began urging banks not to restrict lending to borrowers they considered sound.
Despite the confusion, most California developers have not stopped building. The state's banks are filling part of the gap, according to Bob Skinkle, an economist with Wells Fargo Bank, based in San Francisco. At the end of the first quarter, real estate lending at California banks had jumped 28 percent from 1989 levels. ''That's quite a pick-up in activity,'' he said.
Some developers have been wooing other capital sources for years. In 1987, Warmington Homes in Costa Mesa, a builder of single-family homes, obtained equity participations from insurers To spread the builder's sources farther, Skip Beck, vice president of finance, said he has been talking with Japanese lenders, among them Mitsui Manufacturers Bank in Los Angeles and Mitsubishi Corporation's trust division. ''It's not going to be quick and easy introducing the Japanese to developing in California,'' said Mr. Beck. ''But we need to explore the possibility.''
Hopkins Development has made an end run around lenders by successfully forging an equity partnership with a pension fund. After having difficulty getting a loan from its long-time primary lender, a thrift, Mr. Hopkins started searching for another master partner. In 1987 he found the Massachusetts State Retirement System, which has bought a 50 percent stake in the Newport Beach development company.
''If it weren't for that, I'd be in the same boat as a lot of other developers,'' he said.
Some experts think Firrea will restructure the nation's financial markets by slowly killing thrifts not only as a source of loans for developers, but also for home buyers. In a sample survey of its members, the California Association of Realtors found that 60 percent of the state's newly originated first mortgages to home buyers stemmed from thrifts as recently as 1987. Last year, that number dropped to 40 percent.
''Clearly, the trend is away from thrifts,'' said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of research and economics at the association.
Meanwhile, mortgage bankers have increased their share of first mortgages to account for 44 percent of California home loans to home buyers, compared to 30 percent in 1984. During the same period, the portion of bank mortgage loans doubled to account for 11 percent last year.
The slowdown in thrift lending follows the cooling of the real estate market in California. The average number of unsold new houses has more than doubled from mid-1989 to year-end 1989, said Ms. Appleton-Young. ''The transactions sold in the first part of last year were in a very, very hot market,'' she said. ''Now it's a much more normal market.''
Climbing interest rates have also helped to slow the state's real estate market, said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank. In January, the average fixed mortgage rate was 9.9 percent; by April it had climbed to 10.25 percent. All these factors have prompted analysts to project further slowdowns in California residential and commerical construction this year. Ben Bartolotto, research director of the Construction Industry Research Board, a private organization based in Burbank, Calif., that monitors building permits in the state, forecasts a 12 percent drop in single-family housing this year, a 4 percent dip in multifamily housing and a 9 percent decrease in nonresidential building.
''We've been expecting a slowdown,'' said Mr. Bartolotto. ''But whether it has to do with changes in thrift laws - well, I suspect not.''
A building slowdown, along with tighter lending controls, makes for a healthy correction, according to Richard Peiser, professor of urban regional planning at University of Southern California in Los Angeles. ''I see this as a short-term correction of a market that has been overheated by rapid price increases in the last few years,'' he said.
Small developers may have trouble surviving the days of scarce credit, but Mr. Peiser sees the situation adjusting by 1992. ''There will be opportunities for institutions and investors who are willing to take the equity risks formerly taken by S. & L.'s,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Children Striving to Cope With the Homeless

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Two or three times a day almost every day, one disheveled person or another lurches in front of Faith Ryder and demands a dime or a quarter.
Faith is 12 years old - and when you are little, and it is an adult's face looming over you, even a request invokes a sense of menace.
''A lot of times I don't have extra money, and they say, 'C'mon, c'mon, it's just a dime,' '' says Faith, a seventh grader at St. Joseph's School on East 87th Street. ''It makes me scared, and then I feel really bad, 'cause I can't help.''
With a puff of schoolyard macho, 13-year-old Michael Brown declares in response to a question, ''Be scared of a homeless person, for what?'' But in the next sentence he says: ''If you say no, some of them might attack you. If I go traveling, I have an adult with me.'' 
Karen Zaidberg, 13, a seventh grader at Russell Sage Junior High School in Forest Hills, Queens, believes her feelings for the homeless are ''distorted.''
''Kids in this school are sheltered,'' she says. ''We're not made to live it and see it every day. I'm angered in the way that I'm not opened to it and I can't feel for these people.''
Countless children in New York City - those fortunate enough to have a home - are continually confronted by the fact that thousands in their midst lead wretched lives.
And if grown-ups wrestle with the emotional contradictions posed by that reality - the urge to care, squelched by the instinct to reject what is forced on one - then how is a child to cope?
''It's awful to think there are people out there who live that way when we just go around and buy meaningless things like magazines or toys or jewelry, 'cause you don't need that stuff,'' says Faith. The confrontations diminish Faith's faith - in adults, in government, even in herself.
''They're not really that worried,'' she says of politicians. ''They just say there's not much we can do because there's so many of them.''
And, she says, ''It goes through my mind that if I don't like finish school or whatever, I could be out there, 'cause it can happen to anyone.''
Children's fears, says Dr. Robert E. Gould, a professor at New York Medical College who specializes in adolescent psychiatry, ''fit into a basic question that kids have of what kind of world are we living in; why doesn't the city, why doesn't America, handle the problem?
''Children, from the beginning, have a fear of abandonment. And this compounds it.''
George McDonald, director of Ready, Willing and Able, an organization that trains homeless people to rehabilitate apartments, sees the problem in terms of a ''social mortgage.''
''People who amass wealth, the government and, indeed, ordinary citizens understand the necessity of an economic mortgage,'' he says. ''But too often they forget that there is a social mortgage that has to be paid.'' Children are paying installments. 'Hurt in the Heart'
Thirty youngsters, interviewed at random in various parts of the city in the last two weeks, spoke of their thoughts and feelings about homelessness with a clarity not blurred by an adult ability to rationalize, to detach. Their responses - sometimes simplistic, often startlingly sophisticated - touch on many of the subtleties surrounding the issue. And, always, they come straight from the heart, ''I feel hurt in the heart,'' says Michael Brown, 13, an eighth grader at Public School 67 in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn.
''If a homeless person asks for change, I just give him some,'' says Michael, seated on a park bench. ''It could be family. Suppose it was one of my uncles or something?''
Nine-year-old Gregory Stern, straggling behind a gaggle of kids streaming out of St. Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights one recent afternoon, says: ''They'll look at you and their eyes are like dim and wrinkled. It makes you feel unhappy and scared when some of them talk to you in this odd voice, kind of old and loud. I think the homeless are just people whose parents didn't like them too much, and they are saying I'm going to get them back by being a failure.''
''It came in my mind,'' Gregory adds, ''that I could be on the streets some day. People get old, and no one wants to see them anymore.''
 
A Limit to Compassion
As it does with adults, the daily barrage affects some children's capacity for compassion.
''I feel ripped off,'' says Tommy Ng, 16, a student at Junior High School 56 in Chinatown. ''I work for my money. Why don't they?''
Then, he adds, resignedly, ''I know unemployment is hard these days.''
Outside her apartment building in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, 12-year-old Velvet Ross says: ''I really don't have any reaction, because you see them so many times. Some of them are just lazy.'' But then Velvet says: ''I feel sorry. Just because you're homeless doesn't mean you're less of a person. You never know, some day you could be in a situation that you have no answer to.''
Velvet's 10-year-old sister, Ebony offers, ''Some of them want to be like that so people will feel sorry for them.'' And her sister, Jasmine, 8, admits that she has lost sleep thinking about those who have no bed: ''I think about them in the night sometimes.''
A sort of cynicism, an unwillingness to trust adults, can be fostered by the confrontations.
''Sometimes they have crutches on and they are lying,'' says Chris Spasov, 13, an eighth grader at Russell Sage Junior High School. ''That makes me mad, because the money you pay to these people can go to real people.''
Lauren Mechling, 12, a seventh grader at St. Ann's in Brooklyn, says: ''It really bothers me when they use children for begging. It's totally unfair, manipulative.''
 
Idealism Prevails
Still, as do most children, Lauren retains her idealism.
''On Earth Day I was walking with my friend and we saw so many homeless people that we bought bagels and juice and we just handed them out,'' she says. ''And it felt really nice for Earth Day and everything.''
Damien Mackie, 13, of Fort Greene says: ''When I go to P.S. 46 to play basketball, it's this homeless lady up there and people be spitting on her and saying, 'You stink.' So I buy her like a bag of potato chips and she says thank you. And I feel proud of myself.''
Eeyore's Bookstores for Children in Manhattan recently ran a contest asking youngsters to write essays on what it would be like to be homeless. About 1,200 entries were submitted, said Eeyore's owner, Joel Fram.
One, written by Kate Wilson, 8, of Morristown, N.J., said: ''Well, time to go begging on the street. Usually no one gives me anything, but it's worth a try anyway. Yesterday I didn't get anything because I was in a bad mood, yelling out all these bad words for no reason. See, no one understands that when you're homeless, you have so many trapped emotions inside that you just explode.''
Out of their idealism, the children offer simple, direct opinions about why homelessness persists and how it should be handled.
''Why don't they just give them work to do?'' asks Denny Wong, 12, of Intermediate School 131 in Chinatown.
 
'We Should Rebuild America'
''Government doesn't care because these people don't vote,'' says Matthew Silver, 14, participating in a round-table discussion of the problem at Russell Sage Junior High in Queens.
Tarik Clarke, 13, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, says: ''There should be more than like 'Comic Relief' for a few nights. The government should focus more on helping the homeless than they do on foreign aid. I'm not like against foreign aid, but we should rebuild America.''
''They should rebuild buildings,'' says 7-year-old Daniel M., who lives with his grandmother on the Lower East Side.
Daniel and his sister, Monica, 12, bring a special concern to the problem. Their mother, a drug addict, exists on the street.
''We see her sometimes,'' Monica says. ''We go up to her and say 'Hi.' We ask her to go to a hospital, but she won't listen.''

It makes me scared, and then I feel really bad, 'cause I can't help.'' (Joyce Dopkeen & Eddie Hausner/The New York Times) (pg. B14)

HEADLINE: States Take Up New Burdens To Pay for 'New Federalism'

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Nearly a decade after Ronald Reagan promised to return powers to the states with his ''New Federalism,'' state and local officials say their authority has instead been whittled away with a new generation of regulations giving them expensive responsibilities when there is less Federal money to help pay for them.
Although the ''New Federalism'' approach was intended to give states and municipalities more flexibility and authority, it was undercut by an avalanche of mandates imposed in Washington, from monitoring pollution to removing asbestos from schools to supervising nursing homes.
While this was going on, Congress made drastic cuts in Federal block grants and revenue sharing, which states and localities had used at their discretion. Revenue sharing had been initiated by former President Richard M. Nixon in the early 1970's as part of his own ''New Federalism'' proposal, which gave the states the money to carry out their new authority. Who Controls What? Simply put, the Reagan Administration relaxed the Federal Government's controls on business, not its controls on state and local government. One paradox of the Reagan years is that while Mr. Reagan cultivated the image of being a ''deregulator,'' his Administration forced state and local governments to assume new regulatory duties - in terms both of new rules to enforce and of responsibility for enforcing old ones. Under Mr. Nixon, Washington gave local governments more funds to exercise their new authority. Under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Washington has given the states new tasks but less money. 
The ''New Federalism'' that Mr. Reagan introduced in his 1981 State of the Union Message simply reflected a conservative philosophy that local government is better equipped than Washington to assess needs and draw up programs on domestic issues. But there was never a specific plan, and in fact there was a sharp cut in Federal funds for states and localities.
From 1978 to 1989, Federal allocations to the states fell by 13 percent after inflation, according to the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations, a Federal agency made up of Federal, state and local officials. In addition, the states had far less discretion in spending, as more of the funds were earmarked for payments to individuals.
The advisory council study was one of three new reports that document the lament of many governors and mayors who contend that Mr. Reagan's New Federalism was illusory. Another study was done by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress.
 
The View From California
A more narrowly focused study was done by Dr. Beryl A. Radin, professor of public administration at the University of Southern California's Public Affairs Center in Washington. It found that more than 70 California governmental units had offices in Washington - and that one-third of them had opened the offices or hired a Washington lobbyist within the past five years.
''The first thing that this tells me is that even in this age of the rhetoric about the New Federalism and returning decisions to local government, Ronald Reagan's own state finds that it needs an increased presence here,'' Dr. Radin said.
Mayor Robert M. Isaac of Colorado Springs, a Republican who will be the next president of the United States Conference of Mayors, said: ''I don't think there was any New Federalism. I don't think there's been any transfer of power. I think it's gone the other way.''
 
A Republican Complains
Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, a Republican, said, ''Instead of giving the power to the states, and giving us the flexibility of addressing the problems of the states, Congress keeps giving us new mandates.''
In recent years, mayors of big cities, especially in the Northeast, have struggled more and more to deliver services to poorer populations while drawing money from a shrinking tax base -and having less money coming from Washington.
Some officials see some good in this; they say the lack of money has forced them to be more innovative in their approaches to governing and raising revenue. Governors and mayors have taken the lead in trying to attract foreign investors, creating their own environmental and health programs, turning to private concerns to deliver public services and raising money through lotteries and new taxes.
Mayor Bill Hudnut of Indianapolis, a Republican, said, ''We've seen the dawn of the entrepreneurial American city, which is forced to be more innovative and creative and self-reliant because of the cuts coming out of Washington.''
 
'Caught in a Squeeze'
Some Democratic governors say the new regulations create a problem for them, because they represent worthy goals while restricting their flexibility.
Indeed, the National Governors Association pressed for the 1988 Federal welfare law, pushed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, that requires states to provide job training for some recipients. And the Southern Governors Conference proposed the 1989 Federal law that requires the states to provide maternal and child health benefits to those whose incomes are less than one-third over the poverty level of $6,314 a year for an individual. This forced some states to increase their payments.
''The states are caught in a squeeze,'' said Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a Democrat. ''People who want good things are imposing their priorities on the governors.''
Gov. James J. Blanchard of Michigan, a Democrat, said the regulations reflected ''good policies that ought to be pursued if you had the money, but wouldn't be among the top four if you didn't have the money.''
 
Bush Pledges to Ease Up
Money is one thing many states do not have. ''At least half the states are in fiscal distress,'' said Gerald Miller, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers.
President Bush pledged last July to observe a request from the National Governors Association for a two-year moratorium on new Federal mandates. ''It's very tough for them,'' said Debra Rae Anderson, deputy assistant to the President for intergovernmental affairs. ''They haven't come in and asked for more money. They've said, 'Don't cut what we're getting, and don't mandate new programs.' ''
The advisory council study found that, in actual dollars, Federal funds to states and localities amounted to $123.6 billion in 1989, as against $77.9 billion in 1978. But in 1982 constant dollars, the funds declined for the same period, to $94.7 billion from $109.77 billion.
At the same time, Federal payments to people on welfare, Medicaid and other programs grew from $35 billion to $50 billion, while discretionary funds from the Federal government to the States and locals were reduced from $50 billion to $25 billion.
 
Two Presidents Compared
Revenue sharing, which gave states and localities $7.3 billion in discretionary funds in 1981, was eliminated. ''Nixon gave us revenue sharing, and Reagan gave us revenue bleeding,'' Governor Blanchard said. In addition, Federal aid to employment programs declined, from $8.4 billion in 1981 to $3.5 billion in fiscal 1990. Community development block grants were reduced from $5.7 billion in 1981 to $2.9 billion in 1990, while mass transit funds were reduced from $5.4 billion in 1981 to $2.9 billion in 1990. Those figures are in real dollars, not adjusted for inflation, so the difference is more pronounced than it appears.
At the same time, Washington has imposed a raft of new regulatory responsibilities on states and localities since 1981. The advisory council study found that more than one quarter of all statutes in which the Federal Government pre-empted state and local laws - setting its own standards and telling the states to enforce them - were enacted in the Reagan years. Of 354 such statutes enacted since 1789, when Congress was created, 95 were enacted from 1981 to 1989. By comparison, 91 pre-emptive statutes were enacted in the preceding dozen years.
''Over all, state and local governments became subject to hundreds of new program standards and administrative requirements,'' the G.A.O. report said.
Most of those requirements dealt with health, safety and education:
* Municipalities were required to monitor pollution from thousands of storm sewers and to test for 77 additional chemicals in municipal water supplies. Local governments were also required to control 83 new drinking water contaminants.
* School districts were required to identify asbestos hazards and remove them from local schools.
* States were required to prepare reports on 152 new endangered species.
* States were required to monitor and enforce actions requiring businesses and industries to establish and maintain programs to protect hearing and guard against exposure to certain dangerous chemicals and asbestos.
* States were required to adopt a minimum drinking age of 21 or face 10 percent reductions in highway aid.
In addition, the Bush Administration has proposed a plan that would shift the financial burden of highway construction toward the states.
''We don't want to be cry babies,'' said Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont, who announced last month that she would not seek a fourth term this fall, in part because of growing frustration with budget problems. ''We recognize that there are lots of innovative ways to do things that don't always require additional funds. But it's frustrating when there's a clear shift in Federal policy, as in highway construction. That's kind of gutless.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Delegation Visiting an India in Political Crisis

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 20

 BODY:
When a high-level American delegation arrives here tonight for talks on Monday on the separatist war in Kashmir, it is likely to find the Government of Prime Minister V. P. Singh preoccupied by its worst domestic political crisis since coming to power in December.
The American team is headed by President Bush's deputy national security adviser, Robert M. Gates. Significantly for India, Mr. Gates is coming here fresh from discussions in Moscow and Islamabad. India, accustomed to playing off American and Soviet interests, confronts for the first time what appears from here to be superpower consensus. 
The Americans are expected to convey Washington's concern about what the White House described as a ''deteriorating situation'' involving mounting human rights abuses in Kashmir, and the consequent threat of war between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory.
But the Indian Government's ability to deal with the Kashmir crisis appears to be falling victim to Prime Minister Singh's worsening internal political problems.
Like the only previous Indian Government not formed by the Congress Party, the Singh administration is being undermined by disputes in the governing coalition. Twelve years ago when that earlier non-Congress Government faltered, there was nothing of the magnitude of the Kashmir rebellion confronting India.
While the Prime Minister's allies on both the pro-Hindu right and Communist left complain that he is not being tough enough on Kashmiri Muslims, thousands of people are being arrested or hounded by Government forces, Indian human rights groups and fleeing Kashmiris say. As a result, no new political initiatives are being proposed. More damaging to Mr. Singh's standing is the growing embarrassment to his administration caused by the activities of Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal and his son, Om Prakash Chautala.
Mr. Lal, a powerful leader in the northern farm belt, has a history of violence and corruption that makes him anathema to the clean-government voters who propelled Mr. Singh to power in December. Mr. Chautala has been linked to vote fraud and poll violence in Haryana state. The violence culminated last week in the killing of a rival candidate in coming state elections in a constituency where Mr. Chautala, an unelected Chief Minister who inherited his position from his father, is seeking a seat.
Mr. Singh's association with Mr. Lal and his son proved costly this weekend, when the Prime Minister suffered two significant blows to his authority: Mr. Lal's candidate, S. R. Bommai, was chosen as president of Mr. Singh's own party, the Janata Dal, and one of his chief economic and social planners, L. C. Jain, resigned.
Mr. Jain, one of Asia's best known development experts and a follower of Mohandas K. Gandhi, resigned to protest Prime Minister Singh's silence on the recent events in Haryana, and his unwillingness to force Mr. Chautala to step down in the face of accusations of criminality.
Leading Indian newspapers are calling on Mr. Singh to live up to his image as a clean politician. Critics say the Prime Minister's pursuit of investigations into allegations of corruption in the administration of the former Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, begin to look like witch-hunting if he refuses to punish criminality within his own Government and party.
When Mr. Singh took office in December, he was expected to bring a fresh approach to the problem of separatism in Kashmir and in Punjab state. In both cases, there was little disagreement among political analysts that shortsighted policies of Mr. Gandhi, framed for partisan purposes, had led to the flourishing of rebel political movements.
But Mr. Singh has chosen not to lay the blame for Kashmiri and Punjabi rebellions on Mr. Gandhi, on the late Indira Gandhi, who preceded him, or on the Congress Party. Instead, Mr. Singh, a skilled politician, has continued to rely on the use of military force.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Gorbachev's Military: A Bigger Role?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
United States officials just back from Moscow said today that while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appeared firmly in charge as Soviet leader in his talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, he also seemed to be giving his armed forces a somewhat greater role in the decision making.
Some analyses in recent weeks have suggested that the Soviet military is becoming dominant in the Kremlin, but one official who accompanied Mr. Baker to Moscow said: ''I'd say from what we saw Gorbachev has the military firmly under control. They are by no means resurgent.'' 
But another American official said that judging from Mr. Gorbachev's behavior at key moments in his five-hour meeting with Mr. Baker on Friday - the most important in the four days of talks the Secretary of State held in Moscow - Mr. Gorbachev ''certainly does not want to alienate the military at a time when he is being criticized for failing to improve the domestic quality of life, for allowing the union to disinegrate and for allowing an erosion of their overall security position''
 
Decisions Are Still Gorbachev's
What this means for the summit meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev scheduled to start on May 30, and for United States-Soviet relations generally, American officials said, is that on arms control Mr. Gorbachev will be able to continue making the big decisions, as he did in Moscow last week when a breakthrough was reached on the treaty limiting long-range nuclear weapons. But those decisions are likely to take longer now, and the negotiations more intense, because of the Soviet leader's need to give his armed forces greater input.
An official who took part in the arms control negotiations in the Kremlin between Mr. Baker and Mr. Gorbachev said one image seemed to sum up the relationship between the Soviet leader and his armed forces. At one point, the official said, Mr. Baker raised a highly technical arms control question and Mr. Gorbachev gestured to Col. Gen. Bronislav Omelichev, First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces, to go over and clarify the point for him.
What was striking, the American official said, was that General Omelichev, probably the second most powerful general in the Soviet military, approached Mr. Gorbachev like a ''little boy coming to his Sunday school teacher.''
''He wasn't even sure if he should sit down or not,'' the official said.
But what was equally striking, the official said, was that General Omelichev was at the meeting at all. Previously Mr. Gorbachev would probably have consulted his personal national security adviser, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, who is now retired, and might not have had any active-duty military officer present. Marshal Akhromeyev was also in the room this time, but the Soviet leader, American officials said, noticeably ignored him and went out of his way to give the representative of the armed forces his say.
 
Military More Assertive
Before leaving for Moscow, some American officials had begun to wonder exactly what was Mr. Gorbachev's relationship with his military. When Mr. Baker was in Moscow in February, he thought he had largely resolved virtually the same two issues that produced Saturday's breakthrough in the strategic arms reduction talks -how to limit air-launched and sea-launched cruise missiles. But when Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister, came to Washington in April, the Americans found the Soviet military taking a more commanding role in the arms control negotiations and reopening issues that the United States thought were closed.
Indeed, after Mr. Shevardnadze's visit in April, General Omelichev came to Washington to follow up on the arms talks, raising the question of whether the Soviet military was not suddenly asserting itself generally.
American officials now believe that as the Soviet military began to take stock of the deteriorating security situation of the Soviet Union in light of the virtual collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the loss of its Eastern European security buffer and the rise of a united Germany, it began to grow extremely nervous about its ability to defend the country, as any military would. The leaders were also apparently unhappy at the way Marshal Akhromeyev was representing the military's point of view.
As a result, officials said, the armed forces demanded an opportunity to squeeze more from the Americans on precisely those arms control issues that affected the immediate security of the Soviet heartland - cruise missiles. These are relatively short-range nuclear weapons fired from planes or naval vessels. The shorter the range allowed by the treaty, the closer an American plane or ship would have to get to the Soviet Union and the easier it would then be to spot early and shoot down.
 
'A Sense of Uncertainty'
Mr. Gorbachev apparently decided that it would be ''politically and militarily prudent to bring in the armed forces more so that they would share more responsibility for key decisions,'' one official said, both because he identified with the concerns of the army and because he felt that when he was being vilified for his economic and political changes he could not allow himself to be accused also of giving away Soviet security.
The official added that in his talks with Mr. Baker, the Soviet President, more than ever, ''conveyed a sense of uncertainty of whether he was going to be able to pull off all his reforms.''
''The old confident optimism was not there,'' the official said. ''He talked openly about how difficult the transition to a market economy was going to be and the risks he faced of greater instability if they don't play it very carefully.''
This helps explain the roller-coaster talks last week. The Soviets insisted that air-launched cruise missiles that could travel 375 miles and up be covered by the strategic arms reduction treaty. But the Americans wanted a longer range - 500 miles and up - to protect a newly developed non-nuclear cruise missile, called Tacit Rainbow, that has a range close to 500 miles.
On Friday morning, Mr. Baker offered to accept Mr. Gorbachev's range limit if he agreed to exempt the Tacit Rainbow from the treaty. ''Gorbachev said, 'You got a deal,' and they shook hands,'' an American official recalled, A similar series of trade-offs produced a compromise package on how to limit sea-launched cruise missiles as well.
 
Soviets Demand Restrictions
On Friday afternoon, however, Soviet and American arms control experts met and the Russians started demanding that restrictions be put on Tacit Rainbow. The Americans insisted that Mr. Gorbachev had exempted Tacit Rainbow unconditionally and as part of a package deal. If the Soviets now wanted conditions, they said, the whole deal was off.
American officials now believe that the Soviet military did just what the United States military would have done under similar circumstances, demanded a chance to further restrict the abilities of the American cruise missile, and that Mr. Gorbachev did what American Presidents often do in such circumstances, gave in.
At noon Saturday, Mr. Baker, apparently feeling that the United States had compromised enough, decided to send Mr. Shevardnadze a letter explaining very generally the limitations and characteristics of Tacit Rainbow. He hoped that if the Soviet Foreign Minister had a letter it would better enable him to calm the Soviet armed forces. But Mr. Baker also made it clear that either the Soviets took the original Gorbachev-Baker package or nothing. Mr. Shevardnadze took it.
''The thing you have to keep in mind is that in the end Gorbachev's original deal was made,'' a senior American official said. ''So you have to make a distinction between the military having a role which gives them a chance to exercise influence and the military being resurgent. They are getting more input now, but they are not resurgent. The Soviet decision-making process may move less quickly now, but it is not likely to stop because the factors driving it in the first place have not changed.''

HEADLINE: You Can't Sell a 'Gorgeous Mosaic' and Denounce Bigotry Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Mayor David Dinkins's stand on racial issues, though well meaning, hides a fatal inner contradiction. Unfortunately, that same illogic infects the discourse of nearly all our politicians these days, at all levels of government.
The sad fact is that one cannot promote a ''gorgeous mosaic'' and denounce bigotry at the same time. A mosaic is a system of tensions in which the place of every tile is strictly demarcated and no tile can be aware of the larger picture. It's because they're part of a ''mosaic'' that the Bensonhursts of the world become dangerous, cut off as they are from other communities and resisting incursion. It's the idea of the mosaic that lies behind ill-thought-out bilingual education programs that segregate Spanish-speakers and keep them from economic advancement. 
It's the idea of the mosaic that has corrupted American higher education over the last 20 years, substituting a free-for-all of special-interest courses in our colleges for the wider scope of ''Western civ,'' which, like it or not, still has more to do with how we live and how we got here than any number of courses on Hopi rituals or great Eskimo poets. In the end, the idea of the mosaic only lies behind the idea of ghettos.
The old ''melting pot'' concept of America, now much out of favor, at least held out an ideal of harmony. But in a society ruled by narcissism, nobody is willing to undergo the kind of melting that's demanded at either the personal or social level. We've been balkanized into groups, and it's seemingly more important to be black, or female, or Jewish, or Italian, or gay, than to be thought of as American, and our ''leaders,'' under pressure from special-interest groups and the cant of the day, help to promote such divisive sentiments.
Small-interest pride is breaking us up from within, and every Greek Day or Polish or Veterans Day parade up Fifth Avenue divides us only further. Why should we be surprised that there have been racist incidents and outbursts on all sides when our own cant sentiments about the sacred value of each individual cultural heritage are promoting factionalism?
''Civilization'' originally referred to the art of living in cities. That art demands active sympathy with one's neighbors, and sympathy doesn't come by emphasizing the specialness of one's corner in a mosaic. Small wonder we're all less civilized these days.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Taking Baker to the Cleaners

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Why do you suppose Secretary of State James Baker's self-congratulations after his magisterial ministerial in Moscow -''real accomplishments,'' some ''heavy lifting'' - was met by a cool comment, ''mixed reviews,'' from President Bush?
More is involved than a President's pique at being cast as a supernumerary at his own summit. Mr. Bush knows that Secretary Baker's claim to have ''split the difference'' with the Soviets is untrue; the vaunted negotiator caved in to basic Gorbachev demands all the way down the line.
Only a few months ago, Mr. Bush was making plain that his primary goal in foreign affairs - that great end for which he was willing to so prudently ignore the economic coercion in the Baltics, and to make valuable trade concessions in advance to the desperate Soviet economy - was to get the Soviet Army out of Eastern Europe, perhaps even demobilized, so as to make perestroika truly ''irreversible'' without a new invasion.
A strictly secondary goal was a new agreement limiting nuclear missiles, an area in which both superpowers spend only one-seventh of their arms budgets. Our central purpose in that was to end the worst destabilizer of all: the Soviet monopoly on land-based, accurate intercontinental SS-18 heavy missiles, over 300 of which are always at the ready 30 minutes from the U.S. 
In contrast, the central Soviet purpose was to delay promised withdrawal from Eastern Europe, including 600,000 troops in East Germany, until Germany could be neutralized.
The other Gorbachev goal was to focus on strategic arms reduction -not, as Mr. Bush hoped, on conventional troop drawdowns - to maintain the Soviet heavy missile advantage, and to stop the improvement of America's potentially countervailing cruise missiles.
On the eve of the Bush formalization of the Baker accords, where does each nation stand?
The U.S., dealing from a position of unprecedented relative strength, has failed to obtain what Mr. Bush used to say was our first priority: the end of the Red Army's occupation of Eastern Europe. Forget about that conventional forces treaty; in the forgiving Baker formulation, ''our counterparts apparently weren't able to respond meaningfully at this time.''
The Soviet Union, having succeeded in changing the subject to nuclear arms, proceeded to take Mr. Baker to the cleaners on that.
Moscow retained the right to test and modernize its SS-18; even after reducing their number by half, the improved SS-18's will be as powerful a threat as today's 308 intercontinental missiles. We had hoped to allow the remaining half to atrophy untested, calling into question their reliability to any first-strike enthusiast; but Mr. Gorbachev told Mr. Baker to get lost. How about banning all land-based Mirved missiles? Don't even suggest it.
Nor would the Soviets then budge on the range of our air-launched cruise missiles. We originally wanted 1,500 kilometers, to be able to penetrate the Soviet Union if the Red Army attacked Europe; they said 600. We dickered downward; they said 600. The Baker ''split difference'': 600.
The negotiating breakthrough claimed by our side - the allowance of our 770-km missile, ''Tacit Rainbow'' - is vitiated by the Bush promise, in a side letter, not to modernize. We're way ahead of the Soviets in cruise technology; space-guided cruises with conventional warheads could knock out tank columns without devastating civilian areas. To give up the right to improve our newest defensive weapon, while giving the Soviets the right to improve their most fearsome offensive weapon, is naive horse-trading.
Having flip-flopped on his priorities, Mr. Bush cannot disavow Mr. Baker's get-a-deal imprudence now; next week, we will hear fanfare about poison gas and ballet-company exchanges to drown out the Bush-Baker failure to press the Soviets to withdraw.
How did Gorby do it? His strategy was daringly Orwellian: weakness is strength. He stressed his political fragility and his economic straits; he pointed in horror to the sinister forces who would take over unless he had a free hand in Europe.
Incredibly, paralyzed by fear of the who-lost-Gorbachev charge, the Bush Administration fell into the trap. Gorbachev gets what he wants on upgrading his SS-18's, freezing our cruises, denying our on-site verification of production facilities, protecting his intercontinental Backfire bomber, and occupying Eastern Europe.
We get to offer trade and aid, to turn a blind eye to repression, and to say the cold war is over.

HEADLINE: Overcoming Violence Is the Call at St. John's

 BODY:
Overcoming violence in New York City - from serial killings of taxi drivers to a shooting of a priest to a sexual assault on a student - was the theme of the Rev. Donald J. Harrington's commencement speech at St. John's University yesterday.
At the 120th Commencement, Father Harrington, the university's president, chose not to ignore recent accusations that had hurt the image of the largest Catholic university in the country.
Last month, six students, several of them members of the lacrosse team, were indicted on charges of sexually assaulting another student at an off-campus house.
As he spoke to the 1,432 graduates and more than 6,000 spectators who filled Alumni Hall, Father Harrington said the charges ''brought home to us very forcefully how fragile and vulnerable we are as individuals and as a community.''
Father Harrington, the only commencement speaker, talked about the shooting of a priest outside a rectory in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and the spate of shootings of taxi drivers in the Bronx and suggested to the graduates that perhaps they could be ''the answer which this city needs at this time.'' 
Yesterday was the second of two undergraduate commencement exercises at the Queens campus. On Saturday, 897 degrees were conferred.The two ceremonies were needed for the large number of graduates.
Honorary degrees were awarded to Estee Lauder, chairman of the Estee Lauder Cosmetics Company; Sister Veronica Greeley, Prioress of the congregation of the Holy Cross, and the Rev. Raymond Brown, a biblical scholar and a professor.
The St. John's University President's medal, which is awarded for outstanding loyalty and devotion to the alma mater, was awarded to two St. John's professors, Dr. John M. Sledz of the College of Business Administration, and Dr. Frank Kunkel of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
 
Adelphi University
Robert H. Bork, the former Federal appeals judge who is now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, addressed the 2,983 members of Adelphi University's Class of 1990 yesterday. Mr. Bork was also one of nine writers, scholars and government figures to be awarded honorary degrees during the ceremonies in Garden City, L.I. The other honorees were: Betty Allen, the executive director of the Harlem School of Arts in New York City; Creighton Eddy Gilbert, an author and professor of art history at Yale University; Dudley Robert Herschbach, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist at Harvard University; Donald Kagan, the dean of Yale College; Fredrick Morgan, the founder of The Hudson Review; Richard D. Parsons, the president and chief operating officer of the Dime Savings Bank of New York; Simon Schama, an author and professor of history at Harvard, and Claire Shulman, a 1946 Adelphi alumna who is the Queens Borough President.
 
Bryn Mawr College
Cokie Roberts, a journalist for National Public Radio and ABC's ''This Week with David Brinkley,'' urged graduates of Bryn Mawr College not to abandon women's traditional role as nurturers.
''When women graduated 20 years ago, they didn't think about careers,'' Ms. Roberts told the graduates yesterday. ''When women graduated 10 years ago, they only thought about careers. All of us learned we have to combine careers and family.''
''You can do it all,'' she said. ''You just don't sleep very much.''
The commencement was the 105th at the college in Bryn Mawr, Penn. During the ceremonies, the college awarded 446 degrees, including 119 master's degrees and 29 doctorates.
 
Fairfield University
John J. Phelan Jr., the chairman and chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange, told 1,114 graduates at Fairfield University's 40th Commencement yesterday that ''materialism alone cannot feed the body and cannot feed the mind.'' Before receiving an honorary doctor of laws degree, Mr. Phelan addressed an audience of more than 9,000 and spoke of a ''contagion of democracy'' sweeping Eastern Europe. He also predicted, ''Europe will build a new and different civilization that we can all be proud of in 15 to 20 years.'' He likened the task to the resurrection of Hiroshima from the devastation of the atomic bomb, and said: ''The will of people will surmount all odds. The human spirit will overcome all obstacles.'' Other recipients of an honorary degree were Fortune R. Pope, former publisher of the newspaper Il Progresso and director and officer of the Pope Foundation, and Willie H. Ruff Jr., a member of the Mitchell-Ruff Duo that took jazz to Russia in 1959 and to China in 1981.

Nearly three months after his death, Malcolm Forbes, the editor of Forbes magazine, was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree by the University of Hartford for the ''imaginative zeal with which he pursued his life and his generosity in supporting philanthropic causes.'' His son, Christopher Forbes, accepted the honor during the school's 33d commencement yesterday, as 1,440 students received undergraduate and graduate degrees. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a civil rights lawyer who headed the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, addressed the recent spate of racist incidents on American campuses, saying, ''The new bigotry must be chased from campus not with rules that mock free expression by denying it, but with outspoken oral and written retorts from every section of the university community.'' Also receiving honorary degrees were: Stillman B. Brown, chairman of the school's Board of Regents from 1983 to 1988; Mark Lamos, artistic director of the Hartford Stage Company, and George McNeil, who teaches at the university's Hartford Art School.
 
Haverford College
Haverford College awarded four honorary degrees at its 157th commencement yesterday and, instead of having a keynote speaker, each recipient was allowed to address the nearly 260 graduates briefly.
Receiving the degrees were Ernest L. Boyer, former United States Commissioner of Education and Chancellor of the State University of New York; Gustavo Gutierrez, a Peruvian priest, theologian and author; Katherine Dunham, the dancer and choreographer who helped form Ballet Negre, the first African-American dance company in Chicago; and Felicia Nahoma Kentridge, a South African lawyer who has helped bring legal aid to the country's poor.
 
Hofstra University
During two days of ceremonies that conclude today, Hofstra University will have awarded degrees to 1,673 men and women in undergraduate and graduate programs. In his message to the graduates yesterday, the school's president, James M. Stuart, challenged them to ''always have a questioning mind.'' Honorary degrees were awarded to four alumni and to Rand V. Araskog, chairman of the ITT Corporation, who was praised as ''something of a management miracle.'' The following alumni were honored: Senator Wyche Fowler Jr., a Democrat from Georgia; George Vecsey, a sports columnist of The New York Times and the author of several books; Patricia Reilly Giff, the author of more than 40 children's books, and Dr. Harold J. Raveche, president of the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J.
 
Morehouse College
Randall Robinson, founder of the human rights organization TransAfrica, and the Rev. Dr. Fred Lofton, president of the Progressive Baptist Convention, spoke at Morehouse College's 106th commencement ceremonies in Atlanta.
Mr. Robinson addressed the 300 graduates of the all-male institution at yesterday's commencement on the campus lawn. He received an honorary doctor of laws degree. Dr. Lofton spoke at the baccalaureate ceremony on Saturday afternoon and received an honorary doctor of divinity degree.
 
University of Notre Dame
Bill Cosby, perhaps best known for his television series ''The Cosby Show'' addressed 1,800 who received bachelor's degrees and 600 who received advanced degrees at the University of Notre Dame's 145th commencement.
Mr. Cosby, who was the recipient of an honorary degree yesterday, has been a major benefactor of traditionally black colleges and universities.
Other honorary degrees were awarded to Rutherford Aris, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota; the Rev. George H. Clements, a civil rights advocate; Jill Ker Conway, the former president of Smith College; Ernst L. Eliel, an author; the dancer Suzanne Farrell, and Emil T. Hofman, retiring dean for freshman studies and professor emeritus of chemistry at Notre Dame.
Others were receiving honorary degrees were Ignacio E. Lozano,Jr., editor of the newspaer ''La Opinion'' in Los Angeles; J. Richard Munro, former excutive of Time-Warner Inc.; Javier Perez de Cuellar, Secretary General of the United Nations; A. Kenneth Pye, president of Southern Methodist University; and Martha R. Seger, a member of the Federal Reserve Board.
A special honorary award was given to the late Sister Thea Bowman, a poet, evangelist and singer.
 
SUNY
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo called for unity, tolerance and the defeat of negativism during Commencement exercises at the State University of New York at Stony Brook yesterday.
Mr. Cuomo told the 2,600 degree candidates and their guests, ''Imagine what we could be if we could realize the full potential of all our people, if we could reaffirm the notion of family and reject - as we always have at our best - the proposition that we can exist and thrive as a house divided or a world divided, fractionalized by sex or nationality, by race or color or religion.''
After discussing the recent rise in racial and ethnic conflict in New York, he suggested that the diversity of the Stony Brook campus held a lesson for all. ''This is a community that draws students not just from Long Island, but from France, Poland, China, Italy, Israel, Peru and Vietnam,'' he said. ''You're showing all of us how we can live together better by learning more about one another.''
Honorary degrees were presented to an economist, Gary S. Becker, and two scientists, Paul C. Lauterbur and John S. Toll, who also was president of Stony Brook from 1965 to 1978.
SUNY campuses in Buffalo, Albany and New Paltz also held graduation ceremonies yesterday.
In Buffalo, Frederic V. Salerno, the new chairman of SUNY's board of trustees, told 1,000 graduating students that ''as Cadillacs are the top of the line of the U.S. auto industry, you graduates are the jewels of the American educational showroom.''
But Mr. Salerno said that ''one of the biggest obstacles to continued economic growth in New York - and throughout the United States - is the lack of basic skills among those seeking to enter the work force.''
Honorary degrees were awarded to Wynton Marsalis, who was called ''one of the country's most talented musicians''; Alonzo Church, a mathematician and philosopher, and Ira Michael Heyman, the chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley.
 
Smith College
Helen Caldicott, a leader of the anti-nuclear movement, told the 722 graduates of Smith College's 112th commencement yesterday she was pleased to be speaking at a women's college because ''the future lies in the hands of women.''
Ms. Caldicott, the former head of Physicians for Social Responsibility, said women make up 53 percent of the world's population and do two-thirds of the world's work, and yet only receive 10 percent of the income and 1 percent of the property in return. ''We have all the babies, and we have no power,'' she said. ''This must change.''
''You, this generation of women, were born for one reason - to save the world. That is your task in life, and that is why you graduated from Smith,'' Ms. Caldicott told the graduates. ''You are the intellectual elite in this country. I hand the torch to you.''
Some students tried to make a change yesterday. During commencement, about one-fourth of the seniors wore green and black ribbons attached to their graduation gowns, to show their opposition to Smith's recent decision to stop admitting students without regard to their ability to pay.
In addition to Ms. Caldicott, who received an honorary doctor of laws degree, other honorary degrees were awarded to Mary Frances Berry, a civil rights advocate, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas; Anna Marie Petrioli Tosani, an art historian and director of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, and Sheila Evans Widnall, an aeronautics engineer and educator.
 
Tufts University
Dr. Robert Coles, a Harvard research psychiatrist, urged more than 2,100 Tufts University graduates yesterday to exercise ''some trust and love and respect so that skin color and origin and class and neighborhood no longer divide us.''
Dr. Coles, who is best known for his studies on the impact of segregation and integration on black schoolchildren, was the featured speaker at the university's 134th commencement ceremonies and received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree.
The president of the Medford, Mass., college, Jean Mayer, praised Dr. Coles for his devotion to the poor and disenfranchised.
Tufts also presented honorary degrees to Yevgeny P. Velikhov, the vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences; H. Dudley Wright, the president of Orbisphere Corporation of Switzerland; Robert D. Ballard, an oceanographer who discovered the wreckage of the Titanic; Shelby Cullom Davis, the former United States Ambassador to Switzerland; Thomas R. Pickering, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations; Elma Lewis, the founder of the National Center of Afro-American Artists, and Weston Howland Jr., a trustee emeritus of the university.

HEADLINE: Stories Keep Coming to a Late-Blooming Writer

BYLINE: By D. J. R. BRUCKNER

 BODY:
William Trevor, who began to write fiction only in his 30's and who has become one of the most productive and honored short-story writers in the English language, will make a rare public appearance tomorrow night, reading from his newest collection, ''Family Sins and Other Stories,'' at the 92d Street Y, at Lexington Avenue.
The 61-year-old author of 10 novels and dozens of plays for stage, radio and television, in addition to the scores of short stories that have won some of Britain's top literary prizes through the years, will share the stage with Edna O'Brien, who will read from her new story collection, ''Lantern Slides,'' in the closing session of the Y's Irish Literature Festival.
Mr. Trevor, who was born in Ireland, has had a home in England through most of his adult life and is often described as an Anglo-Irish writer. But he says he finds the English ''rather strange people'' and thinks an advantage of living in England is that ''it is sometimes easier to write about your own people from a foreign country.'' In fact, he is breaking his usual rule against giving public readings because ''this is an Irish festival, and I thought I would like to do this one.'' 
 
The Writer as Wanderer
His home in rural Devonshire, he said in a telephone interview from there, is an old mill surrounded by 40 acres of land that creates an island of solitude. ''It looks a bit like Ireland, and that is pleasant.''
Not that he is there all that much. When he began to write, he said, he became a ''wanderer,'' and he regularly spends half the year traveling in Italy or in Ticino, the nub of Switzerland that juts down into Italy. And he visits Ireland quite often during the other half of the year. But his house is in Devon. ''I don't have other homes.'' he said. ''I hate owning things. It's easy to rent a place or stay in a hotel. A hotel is a good place for a writer. You can eavesdrop a lot.'' Wandering is his habit in writing as well. ''I am always working on a number of different things at once,'' he said. ''The change is important; you're just a man alone in a room writing.'' He writes ''very rapidly'' and puts things away for a year or two before he returns to them ''to see if they worked.''
''Often I have forgotten a lot about them,'' he said. ''I forget characters' names, things that happen to them.''
When it comes to rewriting stories, he does them over completely, from beginning to end - ''you can't tinker with sentences or paragraphs in a story'' - typing them on colored paper before he sends them to a typist who produces a copy in black and white. ''They look different that way,'' he said. ''You get a different view of them.''
 
A Cinematic Novelist
On novels he works ''like a movie maker, cutting and splicing and pasting things in.'' But novels seem to annoy him. ''I think of myself as a story writer who also writes novels,'' he said. ''My novels just won't be maneuvered into short stories. I start writing away, and sometimes I find myself, to my considerable horror, in the midst of a novel.''
In part, he resents the time a novel takes when stories keep bubbling up. For, even though he insists he is ''a very lazy person,'' the stories are compulsive. ''If one wants to be written, it must be done. They're insistent. I can't make them go away.'' Nor can he stop to think about the course they may take. ''To me, being a writer is like being an athlete. You can't pause to analyze the game while you're in it.''
Where the stories come from he generally does not know, and he is reluctant to tamper with the springs of his imagination to find out. By now he has created many hundreds of vividly realized characters in stories notable for an almost Elizabethan richness of detail. Often it is something he observes or a remark he overhears that will start him off.
But that is only a nudge, ''that first little wrench out of reality that's needed,'' he said. ''That's where observation is useful.'' He has even been wrenched out of reality and into a story by a few of his own dreams. ''It doesn't really matter how a story starts; it's how you cultivate it that counts, like gardening.''
In praising ''Family Sins & Other Stories'' in her review in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote that ''decisive moments define the the lives of almost all of Mr. Trevor's characters, dividing their lives into an after and a before, a now and a then.'' She noted that ''the line of demarcation in a character's life has less to do with the loss of love than with the loss of innocence -something happens to fundamentally change how an individual sees himself or his family or a friend; and in the wake of that revelation, his entire relationship to the world is altered.''
 
Popular Dramatizations
One of the things Mr. Trevor is working on now is a television script of one story in the new collection, a tale of unusual violence called ''Events at Drimaghleen,'' about the deaths of two young people in love who are kept apart. Mr. Trevor's television versions of his stories have become enormously popular in Britain, and he is asked to dramatize many more than he is willing to do.
''But I do like the variety of the techniques,'' he said. ''The big job is to create images; those just suggested in stories are not usually right for television. What you trust your reader to imagine just doesn't work. Sometimes for television I have given the story a twist it doesn't have in the original. As long as the producers are willing to let me deliver when I am ready to, I enjoy this kind of writing. By now they know they'll have to wait a long time.''
He has never turned the process around and made a play or script into a story. But when he writes scripts for radio, he may also write the same story for publication because the script and the story ''can contribute a good deal to one another.'' He explains: ''The listener has to imagine in the same way a reader has to, and I find often that one version will tell me something about the other.''
 
'Still Bewildered'
The force that drives him in all this work is bewilderment. ''I believe in not quite knowing,'' he said. ''A writer needs to be doubtful, questioning. I write out of curiosity and bewilderment.'' After almost 30 years of writing, he adds, ''I am still bewildered about the world.''
Although critics often point out that his narrative technique is the traditional storyteller's, with few of the self-imposed limitations adopted by his contemporaries, he also insists: ''All writing for me is experimental. I never know when I start out whether a story will work. I am entirely an instinctive writer.''
Whether he is at home or traveling, Mr. Trevor writes from ''about 7:20 in the morning until 9, then drink a lot of coffee and gossip with my wife or whoever else is about, and then do another hour and stop altogether for the day.''
''If I don't write, I get melancholy,'' he said, ''and if for some reason I can't do it for a week, I can get very low. It's a kind of tonic.'' He does not mean merely a therapeutic one. ''Writing becomes a fix,'' he said, ''an obsession.''
That is only the manual part of it. ''All the rest of the day, you know, you are imagining people and wondering about them and working on things like disbelief. Your characters have to be believable. I have found it is very difficult for people to lie to me now because I am always dealing with the problem of deception.''
 
Artistic and Moral Vision
Not that readers of his stories would believe he had ever been unskeptical. Some of his stories have sharp humor, but the vision of life they present is often dark, and in them innocent people may be set upon, as one reviewer put it, by remarkably inventive and tenacious moral monsters.
Writing, Mr. Trevor said, has changed his view of the world - ''I've learned a lot I could not have learned if I were not a writer'' - but it has not made him a harsher judge of people. ''Personally I am pessimistic, but there is a kind of optimism in writing itself and it balances the pessimism'' he said. Presumably it is that tension that leads many critics to talk about his moral vision.
He does not talk about that. His original vision was artistic, strictly. As a boy he read thrillers, ''any crime story I could get my hands on, and I thought I would like to write those, too,'' he said. ''But in school I found everyone wanted to write, and why would I do what everyone else wanted to?''
So he became a sculptor and for about 15 years made his living with a chisel. ''But a terrible thing happened. My sculpture became more and more abstract, and finally I did not like it at all. There is hardly a worse thing could happen to an artist.''
Seeking a way out, he found a job writing advertising copy in the early 1960's. ''This was absurd,'' he said. ''They would give me four lines or so to write and four or five days to write it in. It was so boring. But they had given me this typewriter to work on, so I just started writing stories. I sometimes think all the people who were missing in my sculpture gushed out into the stories.''
So, does the uncanny accidental quality of many of his characters' lives belong to his own? If he had been able to determine his own life, he would still be living in County Cork where he was born, he guesses. Economic conditions there were terrible in the early 50's, when he left college. First he went to Northern Ireland to teach art, but his school went bankrupt and he went to England to find work. Once he became a writer, he said, he could have returned to Ireland. ''But by then I had become a wanderer, and one way and another, I just stayed in England,'' he said. ''I hated leaving Ireland. I was very bitter at the time. But, had it not happened, I think I might never have written at all.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
At ABC, Several Motives For Keeping 'Twin Peaks'

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
The future of ''Twin Peaks,'' the most-talked-about new television show this year, will be decided today when ABC announces its schedule for the fall television season.
Industry executives say they expect ABC to order new episodes of the series, an offbeat, stylishly produced story of a small logging town in the Pacific Northwest, where murder and other intrigues lurk amid the dense trees.
Although the show's ratings dropped sharply after the first episode, they have leveled off in recent weeks. Still, the publicity surrounding ''Twin Peaks'' has not abated. It has already been labeled by critics as the show of the 1990's, establishing what all three networks are calling the trend for the next television season: originality in programming. Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, and Jeff Sagansky, president of CBS Entertainment, have said that a main goal for the coming season is to create original programs with new formats. Their statements, made when they announced their program development plans to advertisers, have widely been interpreted in the industry as allusions to the creative originality of ''Twin Peaks.'' 
''Twin Peaks'' brought to weekly television the quality of movie directing, with unusually deliberative pacing, surrealistic themes, bizarre characters and unpredictable humor. It is directed by David Lynch, the director of the film ''Blue Velvet.''
This pursuit of original programming gives ABC an overriding reason for keeping the show on its schedule next fall, or at the least committing to it as a back-up series to replace a weak show from the fall lineup.
But ABC has other motives for holding on to what became the television phenomenon of the year.
''If ABC decides to pass, the Fox Network will pick it up and use it on Sunday night where it will only come back to haunt ABC,'' said Paul Schulman, whose agency, the Paul Schulman Company, buys television time for advertisers.
The series is almost certain to end up somewhere if ABC decides to cancel it because its production company, Worldvision Enterprises, is already making profits from the sale of ''Twin Peaks'' overseas, where it has proved to be enormously popular.
 
Link in Network's Plan
In addition, ''Twin Peaks'' is the last important link in ABC's five-year plan for rebuilding the network.
Ratings for the show indicate that it has found a dependable, if not hit-sized audience, of 18 to 19 percent of the viewers from 9 to 10 Thursday nights, even though it faces stiff competition from the high-rated ''Cheers'' on NBC. And its audience largely consists of younger women viewers, the most desired audience for advertisers because they buy the most consumer products.
''If the audience demographics stay that good,'' Mr. Schulman said, ''ABC may be in a situation where it can charge a premium price for commercials.''
Mr. Schulman cited the example of a former NBC show, ''St. Elsewhere,'' which never had strong overall ratings but attracted a loyal audience of young professionals. NBC made a large profit on it each season.
ABC has moved the final episode of ''Twin Peaks'' to Wednesday at 10 P.M. this week, the last night of the May ratings sweep period. ABC believes a substantial audience will tune in, hoping to see the central murder mystery solved.
 
Stoddard's Philosophy
No matter what its future, ''Twin Peaks'' has validated the programming philosophy of Brandon Stoddard, the former president of ABC Entertainment, who set in motion the plan to remake first the network's image and then its profit column.
Mr. Stoddard's philosophy was executed by Chad Hoffman, the vice president of drama series for ABC until last spring. Mr. Hoffman commissioned ''Twin Peaks'' from Mr. Lynch and the producer Mark Frost.
''We had a strategy to turn the network around by taking shots and being patient,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''It was basically what NBC had done to pull itself up in the early 80's.''
NBC, after years of prime-time failure, adopted a strategy of inviting the best writers and producers in Hollywood to do their best work without the threat of network interference. At the time, ABC had a reputation for tightly controlling each series.
After NBC pushed ABC deep into the ratings basement, Mr. Stoddard was brought in by the network's new owner, Capital Cities Inc., as president of entertainment in 1985. He declared an end to the old style at ABC and said the network would strive for shows that ''stood for something.''
 
Economic Strategy
Mr Hoffman said, ''Underneath it all was an economic strategy: turn the network around and make money.''
That took some time. ''In our first year, we lost about $50 million,'' he said. ''This year ABC will make tens of millions from its prime-time shows. It's like anything else. All you have to do is commit yourself to making a good product.''
By the time that Mr. Lynch and Mr. Frost decided to make a television show, ABC had already accomplished part of its goal: it had put several new and unusual programs on its schedule. The most significant forerunner to ''Twin Peaks'' was a show that Mr. Hoffman had fought to get on the air, ''Thirtysomething.''
Mr. Hoffman met with Mr. Lynch and Mr. Frost and discussed their idea. ''I told them to think of it as 'Peyton Place' for the 90's.'' They first produced an elaborate map of the town, then a newspaper talking about its characters. Finally they turned in a pilot script.''
''I read it in about 45 minutes and said, 'we've got to do this,' '' Mr. Hoffman said.
Mr. Stoddard said the same thing. The deal for the series was made. Last spring, when networks begin to put together their fall schedules, Mr. Stoddard announced that he was leaving programming to take charge of ABC's production unit. Mr. Hoffman left at the same time to start his own production company.
Among the last recommendations Mr. Stoddard made to his successor, Robert A. Iger, was that he put ''Twin Peaks'' on the air. ''We said: 'The ball's in play. Keep it rolling,' '' Mr. Hoffman said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Bigger Bank Role Is Urged On Latin Debt

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, May 20

 BODY:
A report on the Latin American debt crisis by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America recommends that a greater share of the burden for resolving it be borne by commercial creditor banks.
The report says the banks ought to be ''confronted with a system of incentives and sanctions that politely push them collectively into settling their unserviceable claims.''
At the end of 1989, Latin America's combined foreign debt was $422 billion. About 60 percent of that was owed to commercial banks in the United States, Europe and Asia, and the rest to foreign governments and multilateral lending agencies. $90 Billion Is Requested The commission praises the approach of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady of the United States -known as the Brady Plan - as being ''conceptually on the right track.'' But it said the Brady Plan's provisions should be formalized among the industrialized nations. Such an accord, it said, should include a tripling, to $90 billion, of public funds committed to debt reduction and the elimination of regulatory and tax obstacles to debt write-offs in creditor countries, particularly the United States. 
The study also notes that because application of the provisions of the Brady Plan is done on a slow-moving, voluntary basis that depends largely on the will of creditor governments and banks, the individual debtor governments have drawn attention to their situations by unilaterally declaring a moratorium on debt servicing.
The study was presented earlier this month in Caracas, Venezuela, before a ministerial level meeting of delegations from Western Hemisphere nations.
The study is a companion document to another study, which essentially endorses the shift toward free-market economies in most Latin American nations but raises questions about how money will be found to deal with the region's growing poverty and social needs while the economic adjustments are being made.
The debt study, which is not likely to produce any immediate response, says one way to find money to confront poverty is by eliminating that portion of each country's foreign debt that is beyond its servicing ability.
 
Strategy Has Flaws
''We think the international debt strategy is good, but it has flaws,'' Gert Rosenthal, executive secretary of the Economic Commission, said in an interview Friday at the organization's regional headquarters here.
''Voluntary measures are not enough,'' he said. ''Creditor governments have to move quicker and be more militant toward the banks.''
Mr. Rosenthal said the United States delegation at the conference considered the $90 billion cost for debt relief too high.
A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said she could not comment on the report since she had not seen it.
In arguing for the foreign banks to directly assume greater losses in the Latin debt picture, the study asserts that the banks had a shared responsibility for the origin of the crisis through risky lending practices. It said the other causes were poor economic management by the countries accepting the loans and the collapse in the prices of commodities exported by Latin American countries in the early 1980's.
Mr. Rosenthal said there had been ''a lot of finger pointing'' about who was responsible for the crisis but that he thought the responsibility was the result of ''massive miscalculation in the late 70's and early 80's in terms of where the world economy was heading.''
''The multilateral agencies, the banks, and the governments all miscalculated,'' he said.
The study says the excessive lending to Latin America in the late 1970's was a classic case of overexpansion followed by troubles in the credit markets.
Contrary to the assertion that ''the market knows best,'' the report says that in times of plentiful money, lenders and borrowers tend ''to develop myopia concerning the underlying future repayment capacity and default risk.''
Noting that the big banks were then awash in petrodollars and were under pressure from their own governments to recycle them, the study says loans were often made because of a particular bank's desire to expand its market share rather than on the basis of creditworthiness.
Mr. Rosenthal acknowledged that debtor governments choosing to reduce their debt through the present Brady Plan or under the stepped-up provisions advocated in the study would not be able to consider again receiving voluntary credit from private banks for a very long time.
But he said he was not concerned about the possibility that debtor countries accepting debt reduction would be unable to return to private credit markets.
 
Banks for Short-Term Loans
''I think the commercial banks should go back to doing what they do well, which is short-term lending for trade and business,'' he said, ''and that international agencies should do the long-term development lending.''
He also said the lack of availability of credit from commercial banks would have the beneficial effect of forcing Latin American governments to ''marshal local savings'' for investments and development.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Seeking U.S. Aid For Health Care

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
AMERICAN companies have for years opposed national health insurance, and they still bridle at the phrase. But they have a history of falling back on Government aid in difficult moments - the Federal bailouts of the Chrysler Corporation and of various failing banks being prominent examples of this reliance in the 1980's. Now Corporate America is seeking Government help in controlling the cost of health insurance.
The incipient appeal makes many companies gun shy, even as they organize to present their case to Congress. Newspaper headlines in March, for example, proclaimed that a new lobbying group represented major companies seeking ''national health insurance.'' 
''When they saw that headline, a number of the companies almost dropped out,'' said William Ketchum, a vice president at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and a director of the lobbying group.
Nevertheless, a common corporate message is slowly emerging, one that starts with the observation that American business, on its own, cannot control health insurance costs. Government, therefore, has to help with the process. Even Allied-Signal Inc., hailed as perhaps the most innovative company at reducing health-care costs, demurs at continuing at the task without Federal assistance.
''The issue of cost-efficient health care is bigger than any one company, or group of companies, can ever hope to resolve alone,'' said Edward L. Hennessy Jr., Allied-Signal's chairman, in a recent speech. And Allied, with more than 100,000 employees, has trimmed the annual increase in its health insurance costs to less than 10 percent, from more than 25 percent in 1987. (The corporate norm is a rise of 20 percent to 30 percent a year.) Corporations resist being pinned down on proposals for Government help. But in interviews with nearly a dozen executives, union officials and consultants to corporations on health benefits, two themes repeatedly popped up.
One was that Government will probably have to pay for health insurance for certain groups. Retirees, for example, might be shifted entirely off corporate rolls and onto expanded Government health plans, including Medicare. And small companies without private health insurance might get Government subsidies to help pay the premiums for the 16 million workers on their payrolls. Or they might pay reduced rates for coverage through existing Government health plans.
''Once we set up an efficient Medicare-Medicaid program, I would permit any individual or any employer to buy into it at reasonable rates,'' said Walter Maher, who directs Chrysler's lobbying efforts to increase the Government's role in health care.
The second theme involves standards for medical care: the Government would set them for everyone. A youngster having his tonsils out might be required, under any health insurance policy, to have the operation as an outpatient. Another rule might set guidelines for coronary bypass operations. Such a rule might end up increasing the frequency of these operations in Hartford while reducing their number in Boston. Today, Boston doctors are much more likely than Hartford doctors to use the expensive procedure, a study by the Rand Corporation found.
''What a lot of companies are looking for is someone else, specifically government, to make the decisions on rationing health care,'' said Ralph Pollack, chief operating officer of Value Care, an employee health-care plan sponsored by 19 Connecticut companies. If a heart patient were to die and the family were to attribute the death to the failure to authorize a bypass operation, then the blame would fall not on the patient's employer, but on the mandatory government standards. ''That is one of the motivations for the push for government health policy,'' Mr. Pollack said.
For the time being, the big corporate cost-cutting push is ''managed health care.'' Allied-Signal, the Southwestern Bell Corporation and others contract with doctors and hospitals to treat their employees, usually at fixed rates for different procedures. Each employee selects a primary doctor to treat standard ailments and make referrals to specialists in the managed-care network.
The cost-cutting comes in two ways: the discount rates that big companies are able to get and the shifting of part of the cost to employees if they use non-network doctors.
But the pioneers in managed health care say that even with these programs, health-care costs still keep rising at nearly 10 percent a year. The question is whether the various corporate proposals for Government help will finally bring the cost increases into line with the nation's much lower inflation rate - or whether Corporate America will find itself pushing Congress ever closer to a health-care system operated and financed primarily by Government.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Civilian Shift For Chinese Plane Maker

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YANLIANG, China

 BODY:
Half a dozen years ago, the Xian Aircraft Company made military products exclusively, from early-warning systems to bombers.
But last year, only a fifth of the company's production went to the military, and a significant share of the $6.4 million profit came from sales of components to foreign aircraft companies. At the company's headquarters here in the Shaanxi Province in central China, the military production lines in one factory are still and empty. Across the plant floor, the commercial sections are humming and the workers bustling. 
Officials of Xian (pronounced SHEE-ahn) believe that future profits lie in developing products for civilian use. Their dream is to make Xian the first Chinese airplane manufacturer to build a passenger plane the size of a Boeing 737 or an MD-90.
 
Hopes for 'a Chinese Boeing'
''We want the chance to develop a new aircraft,'' Fu Baoxin, vice president of the company, said.
And Hong Chuanyu, a deputy director who spent more than a year training at the Boeing Company in Seattle, said, ''If our technical level and management level improves, I think Xian Aircraft Company will be a Chinese Boeing.'' Mr. Fu added that that prospect was years off.
Xian Aircraft, which employs 18,000 workers, is an example of the growing fascination among China's military producers with the civilian market. The company's record suggests the rewards that Chinese companies can reap in selling civilian products, but it also shows that it can be a very difficult transition.
One lesson the company says it has learned is that producing for the civilian market is much more demanding and requires an extensive marketing and sales staff, which the company did not have before.
''It is much harder to produce for the civilian market than for the military,'' Mr. Fu said. ''Safety is more important for passenger aircraft.''
 
Still Makes Bombers
The company still makes two kinds of bombers for China's military, but orders are rare.
Zeal for the commercial market has been one of the most visible changes in many Chinese military factories, as production has gradually shifted from guns to washing machines, clothing and even the service industry. The People's Liberation Army partly owns the Palace Hotel in Beijing, one of the finest hotels in China.
At Xian Aircraft, handfuls of workers still mill around with little to do, but during the last seven years, overall production has increased sixfold, to $64 million, the company says, and managers pay more attention to efficiency and quality. The company began producing aircraft in 1959, but 1985 was the first time it made a profit.
 
Passenger Plane Since 1987
Since 1987, Xian Aircraft has been making the Yun-7, which seats 45 passengers and is the largest passenger aircraft that China makes on its own. China's airline capacity is strained, but even with the shortage of seats domestic airlines have purchased only 60 of the 45-seat airplanes. Xian has the capacity to make 40 planes a year, but it is making only about 15, for lack of orders.
The plane does not meet international standards, but by the end of this year, the company hopes to have a lighter version, with advanced avionics from Western suppliers, ready for flight testing. Moreover, it is cooperating with Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm of West Germany, to design a 90-seat plane to cover medium distances. It is not clear whether the Chinese Government will finance the manufacturing project.
Transformation of the company, and of other military operations across the country, began in the early to mid-1980's, when the Government cut the nation's military by about one million soldiers and permitted military factories to produce civilian products.
 
Washing Machine Craze
At first, the company went into making washing machines, a craze in the early 1980's, but after a few trial runs and unsuccessful attempts at the consumer market, it returned to the aerospace industry and began to supply parts, under cooperative arrangements, for American and European aircraft companies.
Since March 1988, the company has been producing a vertical fin for Boeing, and now Xian Aircraft plans to make another airplane part, the horizontal stabilizer, under a similar arrangement. It also makes doors for the Airbus A300 and parts for Canadian, French and Italian companies.
''You're overwhelmed by the fact that the facilities are cold and the workers at the lathes wear no safety glasses,'' a foreign executive said. ''It is amazing they can accomplish what they can accomplish. They are very good craftsmen.''
 
Shortcomings and Competition
Xian Aircraft recognizes that its shortcomings put it decades behind foreign aircraft manufacturers and that it also has competition from other domestic makers, particularly those based in the cities of Shanghai and Shenyang. A Shanghai company currently assembles MD-80's in a co-production agreement with the Douglas Aircraft Company, a unit of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
Another aircraft maker in Harbin has already exported its Yun-12, a smaller though more advanced plane, to countries in Southeast Asia.
Mr. Fu, the Xian vice president, noted that Chinese companies had a long way to go to catch up with Western manufacturers. He said that his company was making 3 vertical fins a month, while Boeing was making 14 a month.
''The facilities cost money and the technology takes time to learn,'' he added. ''It will be at least 10 years before we can be like Boeing.''

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Frenchman Head of New Aid Bank

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 20

 BODY:
The 42 member nations that are creating a bank to provide financial aid to Eastern Europe have elected the chief personal adviser of President Francois Mitterrand of France to head the bank and have selected London as its headquarters.
After weeks of intense, sometimes bitter campaigning in which the Netherlands sought to have a former Dutch Finance Minister chosen, Jacques Attali, a 46-year-old Mitterrand aide and longtime Socialist, was elected on Saturday to be the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The head of the Dutch delegation, Cees Maas, said his country would continue to fight the decision on the presidency and location, asserting that Saturday's vote was not legally binding. $12 Billion in Capital Representatives at the meeting said they hoped that the bank, which will have $12 billion in capital, could begin lending money next spring to Eastern European nations to help them build efficient market economies. It will also lend money to fight pollution and for road construction and other public projects. The bank will be one of the largest international aid efforts since World War II. 
On May 29, ministers from the 42 nations, including the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union and the 12 European Community nations, are scheduled to sign a formal agreement in Paris setting up the bank.
The delegates to the meeting on Saturday failed to reach a consensus on who should head the bank, and the matter was put to a vote. Mr. Attali received 32 votes, while Onno Ruding, the former Dutch Finance Minister, received 8. Two nations abstained.
 
Selection Called Fitting
Several delegates said Mr. Attali's selection seemed fitting because it was President Mitterrand who originally proposed the bank last October, based on an idea of Mr. Attali's.
Mr. Attali led the series of meetings at which member nations negotiated the details of setting up the bank. The Netherlands, Belgium and several other small European Community nations objected, saying that the large industrial nations had been trying to impose the choice of Mr. Attali on them.
What is more, the Dutch complained, it was unfair that a Frenchman would head the new bank when the French already had top posts at so many international organizations. Jacques Delors leads the European Community, Michel Camdessus the International Monetary Fund and Jean-Claude Paye the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
 
Never a Banker
Several delegates said they had reservations about Mr. Attali because he never worked as a banker. Mr. Ruding, who long headed the I.M.F.'s policy-making committee, has a reputation as a tough fiscal conservative.
When the bank was initially proposed, some people suggested that it be based in Budapest or Prague, but European Community officials decided that since community members would be putting in a majority of the bank's capital, its headquarters should be in the community.
Delegates said that at the recent I.M.F. meeting in Washington a deal was struck in which Britain agreed to support Mr. Attali as president if France would support London as the headquarters.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Outlook Now Is for Stable Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Interest rates have gyrated wildly for five weeks, but credit market analysts say they are likely to fluctuate within a fairly narrow trading range through the early part of the summer.
If they are right, movements in interest rates would closely resemble developments from February to mid-April - when bond yields were locked in a band that ranged from 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent.
Fearful of inflation and an accelerating economy, traders in the period from mid-April until early May pushed bond yields up more than 40 basis points, or hundredths of a point, to just above 9 percent.
After economic data released over the last few weeks caused those worries to evaporate almost as quickly as they materialized, the Treasury bonds due 2020 were offered at a price to yield 8.69 percent by the end of last week. 
''For the time being, rates should trade within a relatively tight 8 3/8 percent to 8 3/4 percent range that has characterized most of 1990,'' said Mitchell J. Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. The last few weeks, he said, have been ''a short, strange trip.''
 
From Hysteria to Calm
Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities, said that ''we have gone from a few months of hysteria in bond markets around the world to a calmer tone.'' He continued, ''That means we could have a pretty dull summer, which after the recent period might not be so bad.''
The abrupt rate swings were prompted in large part by economic and inflation figures that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, warned in February were apt to be distorted by weather and other special factors. The volatility has left many analysts unsure about how the economy and inflation really are faring.
''We think the economy is growing at a 2 percent to 2.5 percent rate and that the core rate of inflation is at 4.5 percent,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ''But that is just a best guess.''
 
Interpreting Data Is Difficult
Interpreting recent data is almost certainly proving to be as difficult for the Fed as it has been for private analysts and traders. As a result, the Fed, which has not altered its stance on monetary policy since mid-December, will probably remain on hold for some time to come.
''I would side with the view that even after the Fed sees the next set of monthly reports in June it will be cautious,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. ''I can see them holding steady for some time.''
As always, there are potential hazards to a steadier rate outlook.
Even though inflation appears to be receding from its rapid acceleration in the first quarter - a rate of 4.5 percent to 5 percent - it is still higher than the bond market and the Federal Reserve would like.
 
Concern About the Federal Deficit
In addition, concern about the Federal budget deficit, largely absent from the credit markets for the past several years, has suddenly re-emerged as an important but not yet overriding issue.
A revealing test of the market's sensitivity to the deficit may come today, when the Treasury releases its budget report for April.
Traditionally, income tax receipts have generated healthy surpluses in April, and most economists are confident that last month's figures were no exception. A surplus number that comes in under expectations, however, could be a problem.
''Estimates on last month's surplus range from a low of $37 billion to a high of $42 billion,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''A number that is smaller than about $40 billion might be poorly received in the market.''
Bond prices tumbled on April 20 after the Treasury announced that the deficit in March had reached a record $53.3 billion.
''Over the past few years, as the numbers started to improve, the deficit became a positive,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. ''But recently we have started to move in the other direction, and sensitivity about the issue is developing.''
A record $10.8 billion auction of new two-year Treasury notes on Wednesday and continuation of discussions in Washington about ways to cut the 1991 fiscal deficit will also serve as a barometer of the Government's financial problems.
In addition to the record sale of two-year notes on Wednesday, the Treasury will auction $8.5 billion of new five-year notes on Thursday.
The auctions are likely to be the dominant events during a week when few new substantive economic reports are scheduled to be released.
Most analysts anticipate that durable-goods orders, scheduled for release on Wednesday, declined in April after two consecutive monthly gains. And a Commerce Department revision on Thursday of estimated growth in the first quarter is likely to show the gross national product expanded at a somewhat slower pace than the initial estimate of 2.1 percent.

The Armies of Europe

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
President Bush and some of his advisers are deeply concerned about Soviet reluctance to move toward a treaty reducing conventional forces in Europe, which they see as the key to making political change in Eastern Europe irreversible by getting the Soviet Army out.
Although overshadowed in recent days by progress on limiting strategic arms and chemical weapons, the talks on conventional forces that are under way in Vienna have stalled amid signs that Moscow may be rethinking the value of an agreement that would drastically curtail its military presence in Eastern Europe.
In public, President Bush and his colleagues have put the best face on the outcome of discussions in Moscow last week, arguing that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has achieved enough to make probable a successful summit meeting next week. Mr. Bush himself said that what Mr. Baker had achieved on strategic arms meant that ''we'll have a good summit.''
 
Some Public Annoyance
But even in public, some irritation shows about the deadlock over conventional forces, the tanks, armies and non-nuclear air power that both sides have in Europe. Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, said on Saturday that United States-Soviet relations were back on track, but he also accused the Soviets of stonewalling on conventional arms. 
And a senior counselor to the President said ''the deadlock on Europe is really very disturbing at this late date, not because it will disrupt the summit - it won't - but because it may mean that we won't get a conventional arms agreement by the end of this year after all.''
If there is no agreement in the Vienna talks, which involve all the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Orgainzation and the Warsaw Pact, an important meeting of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, tentatively scheduled for December in Paris, would probably be postponed.
 
Centerpiece, in U.S. View
For months, the White House has been arguing that the conventional arms treaty is the centerpiece of plans for a new, safer Europe - a kind of insurance policy, as one official put it, ''against a change of attitude in the Soviet Union.'' Another American strategist said, ''This treaty far exceeds any others in importance.''
What the United States wants to do is get most or all of 585,000 remaining Soviet troops out of Eastern Europe and oblige the Soviets to destroy tens of thousands of tanks and artillery pieces. Success would mean that no serious conventional military threat against Western Europe existed.
And once the Soviet Union pulled back, a White House planner said today, it would become far more difficult, if not in practice impossible, for any harder-line government in Moscow to try to re-establish power in eastern Europe.
On the surface, the issues stalling the talks are disagreements over the maximum number of aircraft to be allowed; limits on forces deployed by individual Western countires, as opposed to the Western alliance as a whole, and differences on the proper definition of tanks.
Some State Department experts argue that the Soviet stonewalling results from the inability of senior Kremlin officials to find enough time in the current chaotic situation in the Soviet Union to focus on the issue. Mr. Baker seemed to reflect that thinking last weekend when he said, ''Our counterparts apparently weren't able to respond meaningfully at this time.''
 
Sticking Point: Germany
But others in the Administration argue quite the opposite: that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his advisers are trying to figure out how to retain at least a modicum of military strength and influence in the former satellite countries along the western border of the Soviet Union, which Moscow has seen for decades as an indispensable buffer against NATO forces.
Another major element in their thinking, United States officials say, is how to deal with the troops that are brought home and to keep them from imposing fresh burdens on an already badly weakened economy. A third consideration, some analysts believe, may be a Soviet desire to keep major troop structures in place as a bargaining counter on a unified Germany.
''The Soviets will move on conventional forces when they think they've done all they can to neutralize Germany, and not a minute before,'' a European ambassador here suggested.
By yielding more on strategic weapons than on conventional forces, the Soviet leaders have in effect forced a reversal in the Bush Administration's priorities. Unable to make progress on their No. 1 goal, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker have had to settle for progress toward a secondary though still critically important accord.
In addition, the Soviets are still holding out on the central question in German reunification. Economic integration is scheduled to take place in less than six weeks, on July 2, but there is still no agreement between the Soviet Union and the Western powers about what politico-military posture the new Germany will take up after unification.
 
'New European Architecture'
The United States and its allies have been insisting that Germany play a full role in NATO, but the Soviet Union insists on German neutrality or membership in both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which is much the same. This difficulty and the related trouble in the conventional arms talks makes the ''new European architecture'' of which Mr. Baker has spoken seem remote.
But it may be that Mr. Gorbachev, who faces a difficult and potentially tumultuous Communist Party Congress only a month or so after returning to Moscow from Washington, wants to postpone any agreements on a new Europe - with the inevitable reminders of the greater Soviet strength in the old one - until after that meeting has ended.

HEADLINE: Young as Candidate: Hard Road, Light Touch

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 20

 BODY:
Andrew Young offers little homilies of hope as he travels around Georgia in his quest for the governorship.
He tells of the 84-year-old man who came up to him in Ben Hill County in south Georgia and identified himself as ''a Talmadge man'' - not Herman Talmadge, the former United States Senator, but his father, Gene, the suspender-snapping 1940's champion of rural values and strict segregation. The old man told Mr. Young, ''I've never voted for a colored before, but I reckon you got my vote.''
 
Defying the Norms
Mr. Young tells these stories to make people believe that a candidate who defies so many of the norms and odds of Georgia politics - as a black man, as a former lieutenant to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as a former Mayor of Atlanta, which has long been considered a troublesome base for a statewide campaign - can make it to the governor's office.
But eight weeks before the Democratic primary here, Mr. Young's optimism is up against some hard political realities. 
He must overcome three major Democratic opponents and make his way through a Democratic primary, a runoff that is widely considered a certainty, and a general election. That is a much harder political task than what confronted L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who became the country's first black elected governor last year. Mr. Wilder had held statewide office and was able to win the gubernatorial nomination at a state party convention. ''I've got three races to run,'' Mr. Young said. ''He only had one.''
 
Assembling the Coalition
As he tries to assemble a winning coalition, Mr. Young is walking a difficult line, trying to energize and reassure his base among blacks, trying to reach out to the younger suburban whites who are considered his best source of white support and trying to demonstrate that in the small towns of south Georgia he can win converts.
''My favorite spiritual is, ''Lord, I don't feel noways tired, 'cause we've come too far from where we started from,'' he told an audience in Macon last week. They were gathered in a setting that bore witness to the song: a restaurant in an antebellum mansion, a retrofitted husk of the Old South built by a farmer whose fortunes were dashed by Sherman's March to the Sea.
Mr. Young's career has long been emblematic of the onrush of history in the New South, from the streets of Birmingham to the halls of Congress, from the United Nations, where he served as chief United States representative under President Jimmy Carter, to the skyline of Atlanta, where he just finished two terms as Mayor.
Today, many politicians here say Mr. Young has a shot at the governorship, but no one underestimates how hard it will be for the 58-year-old Democrat to prevail. A poll last month by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed him neck and neck with Lieut. Gov. Zell Miller in the race for the nomination. He drew strong black support but 16 percent of the participating whites.
Blacks are expected to cast more than a fourth of the Democratic primary votes, so Mr. Young is almost assured a place in any runoff. Runoffs are held in Georgia if no candidate captures more than 50 percent of the vote.
Mr. Young's supporters say they hope he can stay largely above the fray in the first primary as the white candidates struggle for the second slot; Roy Barnes, a State Senator from the Atlanta suburbs, is considered Mr. Miller's strongest rival.
The other candidates include Lauren (Bubba) McDonald, a State Representative, and Lester Maddox, the former Governor and archetype of 1960's resistance to integration, whose support barely registered in the newspaper's poll.
That poll, conducted April 13-24, showed Mr. Young supported by 29 percent, Mr. Miller with 23 percent, Mr. Barnes with 10 percent, Mr. McDonald with 5 percent, Mr. Maddox with 3 percent, and 29 percent undecided. That telephone survey, based on interviews with 652 people considered likely to vote in the primaries, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
 
Young's Base Among Blacks
Even if the white candidate who makes the runoff is battered and bleeding, Mr. Young faces a difficult campaign. There is the factor of race. ''It's very hard to measure,'' said Merle Black, professor of political science at Emory University and a consultant to the Atlanta newspaper poll. ''But it's an underlying factor. It's an underlying factor everywhere, any time you have white and black candidates.''
Mr. Young's base among blacks may protect him from some of the harshest attacks; any Democratic nominee must look for strong black support to prevail in the Georgia general election. But Mr. Young has vulnerabilities. He says he is lagging in fund-raising behind Mr. Miller and Mr. Barnes. His free-wheeling oratorical style, notable in his days at the United Nations, provides rich fodder for 30-second attack ads, although none have been broadcast. And What of the G.O.P.? Moreover, any shortcomings as Mayor of this city of 452,900 people, which is 68 percent black, are expected to get an ample airing; Mr. Miller is already assailing Mr. Young for the rise in crime in Atlanta. James Carville, Mr. Miller's strategist, said of Mr. Young, ''He's not a mind-the-store kind of guy, and people traditionally like their governors to try to pay attention to that.''
Whoever emerges with the Democratic nomination will face a strong and well-financed Republican candidate. The expected nominee is Johnny Isakson, the minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, who has a base in Atlanta's suburbs. Republicans have not held the Georgia governorship since Reconstruction, but they scent a rich opportunity this year.
Much of the campaign debate so far has centered on education, economic development, crime and the environment. Mr. Young has gathered consultants and poll takers, masters of sound bites and targeted messages, but he has never been a tractable politician. His message on the campaign trail is vintage Young: a belief in the redemptive power of business, a buoyant pledge to bring the same economic development that has occurred in Atlanta to the entire state. [An adviser close to Mr. Young and Jimmy Carter said that the former President was staying out of the primary, as is his custom.] Pecans, Carpets, Factories He talks of doubling the exports of pecans and carpets, bringing the Olympics to Georgia in 1996 and bringing jobs to Willacoochee and Hawkinsville. He seeks alliances with small-town white businessmen like the banker from Hawkinsville who rose after a Young speech last week to boast about the former Mayor's international contacts and declare, ''I don't know any Bubbas, any Zells or any Lesters who could open those kind of doors.''
Mr. Young walks carefully on race. He told a small group of blacks at a house party in Macon last week that he had made sure his appearance at the recent convention of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition did not coincide with Governor Wilder's.
''If you had a picture of me, Doug and Jesse, I was convinced we would see that picture on the street the week before the election,'' he said. ''You know, saying, 'They took over Virginia; now they're trying to take over Atlanta.' ''
Mr. Young has distanced himself from a lawsuit filed here this month by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a group of black political and community leaders who are challenging the runoff system as racially discriminatory, a cause pushed hard by Mr. Jackson in his 1984 campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination.
That suit has injected a powerful new element of uncertainty into the Georgia elections. Some of Mr. Young's supporters are worrying that that it will only exacerbate the race issue.
 
'Something I Have to Do'
''I'm interested in winning the general election - that's the only thing that counts for me,'' Mr. Young said in an interview, ''and I think the best chance of winning the general election is to go into it with a majority in the Democratic Party.''
He has long been known as an unflappable, optimistic man; old friends say it is an inevitable byproduct of the life he has lead. As his small plane left Atlanta the other day, left behind the gleaming skyline for the flat fields beyond, Mr. Young was asked if he had a burning desire to be governor.
''I just think it's something I have to do,'' he replied. ''If I don't get elected I think I'd probably say, 'Free at last.' But I have to give it the best shot I possibly can.''
When the flight got bumpy, Mr. Young went to sleep; sometimes, he said with a laugh, you have to ''put it in the hands of the Lord.''

HEADLINE: Montreal Journal;
They Speak French, but Their Language Is Money

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTREAL, May 21

 BODY:
Jacques Menard has a tan, a four-wheel-drive Jeep, a good golf stroke, volunteer duties at Oxfam, gold cuff links, a pool, and a watercolor of the Montreal stock exchange hanging on his office wall. But like any self-respecting executive in New York or Chicago, he bridles at the word yuppie.
''None of us see ourselves as yuppies,'' said Mr. Menard, who became a company director at age 29 and is now, at 44, a vice chairman and managing director of the Canadian brokerage firm Burns Fry Ltd.
He added, delicately: ''We went rather quickly into leadership positions. We didn't have time to engross ourselves in the consumer culture.'' 
The ''we'' that Mr. Menard speaks of is a new generation of French Canadian business leaders. Many of them were catapulted at young ages into high-level jobs left open by English-speaking Canadian executives who fled Quebec when the separatist government of Rene Levesque took power in 1967.
 
Heated Talk of Independence
Their successful rise in professions that were once the exclusive preserve of English-speaking Canadians has captivated Quebec. So much so that the phrase ''newly confident Quebec business class'' is repeated so often as an epithet that it has taken on a sing-song lilt. But the entrepreneurs are of particular interest in Quebec these days as heated talk of independence sweeps the province for the first time in a decade.
It is taken very seriously partly because several prominent Montreal business leaders, men like Michel Gaucher, chairman of the Steinberg supermarket chain, or Claude Beland, president of Mouvement Desjardins, Quebec's largest credit union association, have stated that Quebec is strong enough economically to survive on its own.
''It's the most established, gray-hair-at-the-temple types that are saying we are not afraid,'' Andre Louzon, 31, said admiringly. Mr. Louzon, who wears Italian silk ties and owns his own corporate communications firm, noted, ''If it were just young punks, people would say, 'Who cares what you think.' ''
Mr. Louzon, incidently, did not appear offended when asked whether he was, by any chance, a yuppie. ''Exactly,'' he said, beaming. Then he set the record straight: ''Actually, I'm a dink: dual income, no kids.'' He is also an enthusiastic Quebec nationalist.
Mr. Menard, who is also president of the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, was reluctant to give his personal views on the emotional issue of independence. Though he spoke strongly of French Canadians' rights, he spoke more cautiously about economic separation.
''Quebec would be better served staying part of a larger economic entity.'' he said. ''I don't feel like a raving, foaming-at-the-mouth Marxist-Leninist if I stick up for Quebec business.''
 
Fast Pace of Change
Mr. Menard, who studied business in both Quebec and English-speaking Ontario and who is perfectly bilingual, as are his business cards, is representative of the fast-paced social changes that have transformed Montreal society.
In 1960, a newly elected Liberal Party swept out the entrenched, corrupt government to pave the way for a nationalistic French Canadian resurgence. French Canadians call it ''the quiet revolution,'' but it was also a cultural revolution that among other things saw Quebec's birth rate fall from among the highest in the world to among the lowest.
In a survey conducted in 1967, French Canadian parents were asked what profession they would prefer for their sons. Overwhelmingly, the priesthood was the first choice. When the question is asked today, business is invariably at the top of the list.
There are now more business-school students and more new businesses created per capita in Quebec each year than in English-speaking Canada or the United States.
Jean-Marie Toulouse, a professor of Entrepreneurship and Business Policy at Hautes Etudes Commerciales, explains that Quebec's new fascination with business is inspired by patriotism as much as self-interest.
''Until recently, the collective challenge for Quebecers was to preserve French language and religion, which is why most Quebec students went on to teaching or the priesthood,'' Mr. Toulouse said. ''Now the collective challenge is the Quebec economy.''
 
'American Style,' Gallic Flair
Though newspapers often attach the words ''American style'' to their titles, most Quebec business people reject the notion, taking pride in their Gallic flair.
Snapping his fingers, Daniel Lamothe, 30, a business-school student in Montreal, said: ''We're more emotional, more expressive. We are Latins.'' Yet in his gray business suit, briefcase loaded down with a calculator as big as a toaster-oven, Mr. Lamothe looked anything but emotional.
Wait until you see Toronto, he said. ''I went to a party there once, and it was like something my mother would go to - tea cakes.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about French Canadian business leaders in Montreal misstated the year that the separatist government of Rene Levesque took power in Quebec. It was 1976. In some copies, a picture caption with the article misstated the age of Jacques Menard, a vice chairman and managing director of a brokerage firm. He is 44 years old.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Breaking the Mold

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, May 21

 BODY:
By voting for a party dominated by former Communists in national elections, Romania's voters made their nation unusual in the context of Eastern Europe, where recent free elections have ousted the Communist parties that ruled Poland, Hungary and East Germany for four decades.
Romanian television announced early today that Ion Iliescu and his National Salvation Front, the group that has run the country since the violent revolution overthrew the Communist Ceausescu Government in December, had won a smashing victory in this country's first free national elections in half a century.
While full official results are not yet available, Infas, a West German polling organization that took samples across the country, made refined projections today suggesting that Mr. Iliescu had won 89 percent of the votes for President, plus a commanding 73 percent for his party of former Communists in the next Romanian Parliament.
 
Heirs of Ceausescu
The Romanian electorate of 16 million, which appears to have turned out almost in its entirety, was acutely aware that Mr. Iliescu and virtually all his aides in the front had been Communists who worked for Nicolae Ceausescu, the dictator ousted in the national uprising and executed. 
They were also aware that thousands of their compatriots view the front in general and Mr. Iliescu in particular with suspicion, even hatred, and have shown these feelings, including today on the streets.
The voters were aware, too, that some foreign governments, particularly the Bush Administration, were disdainful of the front.
A number of foreign observers, including members of the United States Congress, gave a preliminary assessment that the elections were generally fair, which may help President Bush change his recently frosty attitude toward Romania.
 
Almost as Outrageous
This vote comes within 10 percentage points of the fraudulent 98 percent majorities proclaimed by Mr. Ceausescu and his Communist predecessors in elections over the last 44 years. The fundamental question now, many scholars of the Eastern European political scene say, is what the Romanians are trying to say with their votes.
Judging from interviews with workers, farmers and intellectuals over the last four days, one of the messages is that Mr. Iliescu acquired genuine popularity in his five months as interim President of Romania - partly by dint of a personality many find winning, and partly because of popular measures he initiated.
''He means stability,'' said a film critic in her 50's who has been a lifelong anti-Communist. ''I almost voted for the National Liberals, the party of my father, but at the last minute I changed my mind.''
Her mother, who is 90 years old and who was a member of Bucharest society six decades earlier, also voted for the front for the same reason.
 
A Way to Stay Employed
For workers and farmers, most of them employed until now by giant Communist enterprises or agricultural cooperatives, the front offers a prospect of gradual transition to a market economy that will safeguard their jobs and wages.
The main opposition forces, the Peasants Party and the National Liberal Party, offer an alternative - swift moves toward a free market economy and privatization of land and industry - that apparently frightened away millions of voters.
The miserable showing of these parties, which trace their origins to the turn of the century, suggest that the prewar parties have no real future in Romanian politics.
In fact, the early returns show that two new parties, the Hungarian Democratic Union and the Ecologists Party, did as well or better than the traditional parties. The Hungarian Democratic Union represents Romania's restive Hungarian minority of more than two million people, most of them living in Transylvania. This party gained more than 6 percent of the vote for Parliament - twice as much as the Peasants Party.
 
Common Market Sales Pitch
In interviews and speeches during the campaign, Mr. Iliescu vowed to lead Romania into the European Community, which would fulfill the ardent desire of nearly every Romanian to have the country accepted as a Western nation whose heritage includes a Romance language.
''We will become a Social Democratic country,'' Constantin Girbea, a Foreign Ministry press official, predicted after the front's triumph became evident.
That may be stretching things a lot; while the Communist Party itself dissolved in the fierce uprising of Dec. 22, the internal structure of the former Communist Party remains intact in Romania's cities, towns and villages and has been incorporated into the National Salvation Front. But social democracy seems at least to be Mr. Iliescu's goal - a Romania that remains left of center.
 
A Land Where Destiny Dictates
There is another dimension to the election, which did not really end until 6 A.M. today - 24 hours after the polls opened and six hours after they were supposed to close according to the election law. A prophetic essay this week in a new Bucharest paper, Anunt, by Adrian Costea captured an aspect of Romania's character in its title: ''The Mioritic fatalism.''
It is a reference to the Miorita, or ''ewe lamb'' - a centuries-old tale of a young shepherd who is warned by the lamb that other jealous shepherds intend to kill him. Instead of trying to escape, the young shepherd calmly accepts his fate.
The Romanian electorate seems to have agreed that its destiny should lie in the hands of Ion Iliescu.

HEADLINE: Auto Union to Seek Job Guarantees

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 21

 BODY:
The United Auto Workers union, meeting today to begin setting its strategy for negotiations on a new contract, is clear about its primary goal: halting the loss of members' jobs.
Union leaders said in a draft of the union's bargaining resolution that they would ask the Big Three auto makers for ironclad job guarantees ''covering every contingency.''
''Fact No. 1 is that we have a more urgent need for job security and a more legitimate claim to job and income security for our members in every sector and every workplace than at any previous time in our history,'' said Owen Bieber, the union's president. He spoke today to about 3,000 delegates, retirees and observers from union locals attending the three-day convention, at which the union is to set an agenda for contract talks that will begin this summer. 
The draft resolution says the only condition under which companies would be allowed to lay off workers is ''if the companies' long-term financial viability is truly at risk as a result of conditions beyond its control.''
 
Closings a Constant Problem
Union leaders acknowledge that this would leave an opening that companies could turn to if they encounter serious economic trouble. And union staff members say privately that more plant closings are likely at the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation, regardless of contract language.
Plant closings have been a constant problem in the 1980's, and the union's membership has dropped by more than a third, from 1.5 million to slightly under a million. The U.A.W.'s contract with the Big Three covers about 450,000 hourly workers; other union members work for other automotive companies or in other areas including the aerospace industry.
The union has made an effort before to be flexible about economic conditions in the industry while trying to achieve job protection. Under the union's 1987 contract with General Motors, the No. 1 automaker was not allowed to close plants unless sales dropped to a level that made it uneconomical to continue producing vehicles.
That provision was meant to deal with temporary drops in sales, but General Motors used the clause to close several plants that probably will not open again. The union, claiming a violation of the contract's provisions on job security, invoked an arbitration clause, but an arbitrator ruled in the company's favor.
Nonetheless, union leaders are going to ask for tight job security provisions, which they believe could force the Big Three to stop buying parts from nonunion companies to cut costs, a growing practice known as outsourcing that has led to layoffs and plant closings.
''Management would have to get real serious real fast about bringing back outsourced work and creating new work opportunities if business should decline in existing product lines,'' said Mr. Bieber.
The companies are expected to argue that they cannot do this and remain competitive with the Japanese auto makers, which have cut deeply into sales by the Big Three since the early 1980's when the Japanese companies began opening plants in this country.
The union, whose contracts with the Big Three expire on Sept. 14, is expected to approve a final bargaining resolution on Wednesday. After a month or so of bargaining separately with each of the Big Three, union negotiators are expected to meet to compare their progress.
 
Chrysler May Seek Concessions
Then in early September the union will choose one company with which it will try to reach a contract, and go on strike against if it cannot. Under industry tradition, the first contract will establish a pattern for agreements with the other automakers.
For the first time since 1982, when a financially troubled Chrysler negotiated a separate contract that included concessions, the U.A.W. will be bargaining with all of the Big Three simultaneously. Union officials said they hoped a return to simultaneous negotiations would increase the union's impact by forcing all three to accept the same contract.
But a Chrysler labor relations executive, Anthony St. John, was quoted in Detroit newspapers this week saying that Chrysler, because it has again been harder hit than the Ford Motor Company or General Motors, needs a separate and less expensive contract.

HEADLINE: Lithuania's Way Out

 BODY:
The Parliament in Vilnius is now debating a momentous issue: whether to suspend its March 11 declaration of independence. By refusing to do so, Lithuanians might well spoil the upcoming summit meeting between Presidents Bush and Gorbachev. But that would not help achieve Lithuania's independence. It would only force Soviet leaders to get tougher and weaken Washington's positive influence. 
As a practical matter, Lithuania cannot attain its legitimate national goal unless the West continues to build its new relationship with the Soviet Union. The Lithuanian Parliament now has the opportunity to knit these two dynamics together along the following lines:
The Parliament can vote a moratorium on its declaration of independence - with qualifications. Such an act would meet Moscow's demand, without invalidating Lithuania's right to statehood. Vilnius also would have to carry out its pledge to suspend laws implementing independence, including those forbidding its citizens from serving in ''foreign'' armies. But in each matter, the operative word would be ''suspend,'' permitting principle to be maintained on both sides.
Moscow will continue to insist that the talks be governed by the Soviet Constitution. But that is a difficult and lengthy process. With suspension voted, the Parliament would have strong grounds for urging the amending of this procedure in the case of a nation forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union. Meantime, Moscow would have to suspend economic sanctions against Lithuania. The Parliament also can call on Western nations to insure that the process proceeds without undue delay. Western leaders can use the moment to reaffirm their support for Lithuanian independence and willingness to use their good offices with Moscow.
Mikhail Gorbachev could not easily reject this approach. To do so would brand as insincere his promise to deal fairly with Baltic independence. It would put him in direct conflict with President Mitterrand of France, Chancellor Kohl of West Germany and Prime Minister Thatcher of Britain, who have proposed a similar approach.
None of this will guarantee Lithuanian independence in a year or two. The bargaining will be hard because the issues are hard. They concern the rights of citizens who want continued union with Moscow, and their rights after independence. And they involve precedents for other Soviet republics.
Lithuanian leaders reportedly devised a new offer yesterday to break the deadlock with the Soviet Union. Though the contents of the new offer remain secret, Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene of Lithuania said they touched on the declaration of independence.
Touching on it will not be enough, as many Lithuanian leaders acknowledge privately. To break the Soviet economic knot that is strangling Lithuania and to start negotiations for actual independence, the Lithuanian Parliament will have to show much more flexibility. To suspend the declaration is the shrewdest way to avoid suspending ultimate independence.

HEADLINE: The Japanese Secret: Low Interest Rates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You may argue as forcefully as you wish for government-sponsored research and development (editorials May 10 and 11) but please don't use my industry as an example of Japanese success in this area.
True, the Japanese dominate the world markets for memory chips, display screens, laser printer engines and optical disc drives. But although these items may seem miraculously high-tech to the uninitiated, they are among the most low-tech in the industry. None of them are as complex as what you will find under the typical car hood. Memory chips in particular are now ubiquitous. 
Japanese companies are successful in these fields for the same reasons they are successful in cars, televisions and cassette tapes. Historically, interest rates, their cost of capital, have been drastically lower than those in the United States. So a Japanese company can afford to invest huge amounts in equipment and receive a rate of return that would mean bankruptcy for a U.S. company.
My own section of the computer industry, microcomputer software, is a splendid illustration of the burden of U.S. interest rates and the strength of U.S. research and development. Software is a business notable for two reasons: there is virtually no capital investment required, so interest rates are irrelevant, and it is one of the few markets absolutely dominated by Americans. You will have a hard time finding imported software for your personal computer.
Your suggestion of spending $4 billion (which you astonishingly assert will not be missed) to improve U.S. research efforts strikes me as a solution to a problem that we do not have. Further, as it would contribute to the national debt and therefore help increase interest rates, it would have the effect of exacerbating the very problem you seem intent on curing.

HEADLINE: California: Giant of the Future. . .

BYLINE: By Bill Bradley; Bill Bradley is author of the forthcoming ''The United States of California.''

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

 BODY:
With California's June 5 primary just two weeks away, national and international attention is turning to America's megastate on the Pacific. California is in the midst of an unprecedented social experiment with vast ramifications.
California, a pre-eminent national power for 25 years, will become far stronger in the 1990's. After the census, the state is likely to gain seven Congressional seats, for a total of 52 - more than any other state in U.S. history. It will have one-fifth of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the Presidency in 1992. 
The old frontier in which continental America reached its geographical limit is now the locus of convergence of several new frontiers - in technology, the global economy and multi-culturalism - that will broaden and better define America's possibilities. Dominating these is the quest for balance between prosperous growth and environmental quality.
Two of the nation's four largest metropolitan areas are in California: the Los Angeles basin and the San Francisco Bay area. The population of the state as a whole grew by more than 20 percent in the past decade, to nearly 30 million; one out of every nine Americans now lives in California. Eighty-one percent of California's new growth was among nonwhites, mostly Latinos and Asians. The state's growth fuels the sixth largest economy in the world.
Contrary to popular myth, California's economy is highly diversified and no longer dependent on military spending. It is 50 percent bigger than New York's and more productive than Japan's.
California leads America in computers, microelectronics, biotechnology, aerospace, diversified manufacturing, entertainment, agriculture and international trade.
The state that pioneered personal computing is accelerating the development and diffusion of advanced technologies. As the information economy grows, California will become even more widely integrated into the borderless global economy as both exporter and partner.
California is already the locus of many effective transnational business alliances. High-profile foreign acquisitions, such as Sony's purchase of Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures, and the purchase of Genentech, the biotechnology leader, by Switzerland's Roche Holdings, have provided billions in capital and, at least in the Sony purchase, increased California control.
The Northeast has traditionally focused on Europe and the Middle East, but the nation's geopolitical orientation must now include a southwestern focus on Latin America and Asia. Yet California is not only an integral part of the fast-rising Pacific Basin; the European Community is its largest trading partner.
But to borrow a line from songwriter Don Henley, ''This ain't no Shangri-la.'' California is a many-splendored land of spectacular sprawl. Environmental challenges have grown and broad educational achievement, once a California hallmark, has declined.
There are increasing concerns about the quality of life, arising primarily from the dynamic but appallingly congested Los Angeles basin. The state's new high-growth area is its burgeoning middle, the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys.
It's no accident that California is a global center of the renewed environmental ethic: witness ''Earth Day 1990,'' organized out of Palo Alto, and the enormously ambitious ''Big Green'' initiative on the November ballot. As California evolves, so does its politics.
The laissez-faire spirit of Ronald Reagan, Gov. George Deukmejian and the tax revolt of ''Proposition 13'' is giving way to a new politics of planning and public investment. Both Democratic gubernatorial candidates - Dianne Feinstein and John Van de Kamp - subscribe to this thesis. And the Republican candidate, Senator Pete Wilson, recently declared, ''We need considerable foresight and planning to balance our awesome growth with the necessary ingredients to secure a continuing quality of life.''
As it rather haltingly attempts to mold an environmentally sound, multiracial society, this vast mosaic with global reach must find the imagination and courage to invest in its people and plan for their future.
If it succeeds, California's influence will be difficult to overstate in a nation groping painfully for a new identity and in a post-cold war world striving for prosperity, cosmopolitanism and ecological balance.

The Military Role

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
One way or another, the role and structure of the military is up for argument in countries around the world as the prospect of war recedes. Argentina is no exception, although its military issues are essentially of the third-world variety.
Still, political change and the impulse to democracy have affected ideas of security here just as they have in the north. A decade ago, the possibility of war with neighbors seemed real. There was the Beagle Channel dispute with Chile, a serious arms race with Brazil that included an attempt for atomic weapons, and other local disputes, not to speak of the disastrous Falklands-Malvinas adventure. 
Now, nobody imagines a regional war, and a global strategic rationale has faded away with the cold war. President Carlos Saul Menem speaks of a ''process of integration with neighbors.'' But he wants to ''modernize'' Argentina's arsenal, so I asked him what the function of the armed forces is now.
The question apparently surprised him. He said: ''The role of the military is the same as in any other country. When it disappears in the U.S., France and so on, it will disappear here too.'' He argues that the military must have up-to-date weapons in the meantime for the safety of the men in uniform. ''The armed forces are an aspect of sovereignty.''
That was not quite the point. Even critical Argentines agree with him that the military here is now subordinated to civilian government. Nobody fears another coup in current circumstances, though the opposition says the key reason is direct participation in government of the financial powers that stimulated coups in the past to protect their interests.
In any case, losing a war cost the military the justification that it alone could protect the country's interest. Losing power after a brutal military dictatorship terrorized the country but achieved nothing else cost it the prestige and respect it cherished. Now it isn't sure of its purpose.
There are a number of traditional functions. Protecting a country against threats short of war remains a valid military role, though it suggests a very different shape of force when neighbors are reliably friendly.
Maintaining internal order has been a customary use of the military in undemocratic countries, but it makes the military the enemy of democracy, and usually assures that it will grow corrupt. Argentines insist they have had more than enough of that, although Mr. Menem is making the legal basis for domestic armed-forces intervention unclear.
In many third-world countries, especially in Latin America, the military has long served as a gateway for social mobility otherwise slammed shut by a dominating oligarchy. Every society needs some kind of ladder for the able, and providing it outside of the profession of arms is obviously an essential factor of development. Argentina relied less on the military for this service in the past than did others, but still, it mattered.
But Argentina relied more than many on the military as political arbiter, imposing power decisions when groups that consider themselves the natural custodians of power were at odds. That too is a role that inevitably undermines democracy.
And finally, a purpose of military forces almost everywhere, regardless of security needs, is to maintain the existence of the military. It is a corporative body that develops its own support systems and, like others only more so, finds it hard to reflect on the whys of its inherent desire to survive.
But if the military-industrial complex achieves weight beyond reason in such countries as the U.S. and France, it tends to provoke counterforces arising from competitive claims on the economy. This has also become true in the Soviet Union. The competition is weakened in countries without solidly based civilian government. The military's claims need determined review.
Ironically, arms reduction in the East-West context risks aggravating military clout in the third world. There will be a temptation to sell off rather than destroy weapons, and keep arms suppliers in business despite shrinking domestic markets. Constraints on this loophole must be included in East-West arms agreements.
More important, though, is to study the rationale of arms in the changing world. I am not against defense. Security is a basic need. But its means need review. Countries like Argentina already show the tremendous impact of shifting attitudes. The role of the military cannot be left out of plans for advancing democracy if a sturdier basis for peace with freedom is to be achieved.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Leveraged Investment

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Six months ago Jiri Dienstbier was shoveling coal into a furnace for the Prague subway system. Now, as Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia, he is putting forward a plan to help the Soviet Union and the countries of Central Europe move to market economies.
Mr. Dienstbier unveiled his idea while visiting Harvard University last week, choosing that locale because the Marshall Plan was born there 43 years ago. This week he is traveling in Europe to describe the proposal to other foreign ministers. 
It is an ingenious idea, with a mix much like the Marshall Plan's: idealism, economic incentive, cooperation. The most developed countries of the world - Japan, the United States, the members of the European Community - would in a sense make a leveraged investment. It would work like this: 1. The developed countries would advance $16 billion over three years to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a new institution being set up now to help the changing economies of Eastern Europe. 2. The money would be credited to the Soviet Union, which could use it to buy industrial products from Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Those three countries of Central Europe would use the hard currency to modernize their industries - ''which means,'' Mr. Dienstbier said, ''that they'll spend it in the countries providing them money.'' 3. The Soviet Union would match the dollar credits in rubles, using the resulting fund for investment in its industry. That is the same approach as in the Marshall Plan, when recipient countries created counterpart funds in local currencies. 4. The European Bank would play an important role in planning use of the funds in both the Soviet Union and the three Central European countries. Mr. Dienstbier said:
''The money would be spent with supervision - that's too strong, people don't like supervision - with the coordination of the bank, which will advise on how best to use it.''
The purpose of his plan, Mr. Dienstbier said, was to give concrete form to what President Vaclav Havel told Congress when he spoke to a joint session in February: ''You can help us most of all if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible but immensely complicated road to democracy.''
Since February economic strains in the Soviet Union have intensified. Mr. Dienstbier said he still thought its movement toward democracy was ''irreversible.'' But there would be a better chance for an orderly transition if the world helped the process of economic change.
In the three Central European countries, too, Mr. Dienstbier said, there would be a period of economic strain. As realistic market pricing takes hold, inefficient factories will close and people will be thrown out of work.
The difficulties will be the greater because the old Comecon system of trade among East European countries and the Soviet Union is being replaced by arm's-length trade at world prices. All of the countries will be looking to get hard currency by exporting to the West - but that will require new plants, and time.
''We need investment,'' Mr. Dienstbier said. ''And we need scholarships, because we have no managerial skills, no expertise in computers and so on.''
He called the $16 billion plan ''modest.'' The Marshall Plan cost the United States about 10 percent of its gross national product, he said. This proposal would cost Japan, the U.S. and the European Community 0.1 percent of their combined G.N.P.
Like his friend President Havel, Mr. Dienstbier made a sudden transition to office last December from the status of dissident outcast. A foreign correspondent of Czechoslovak Radio, he lost his job in 1968 when he would not praise the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He was imprisoned, with Mr. Havel, when he spoke out for human rights.
And like Mr. Havel, he seems somewhat bemused by the turn of fate that has made him a politician. He cannot be sure how long he will be in office, because Czechoslovakia is having elections on June 8. The new Parliament will draft a constitution for what is now formally called the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, with many tricky questions about regional versus central power.
''We have 23 parties now,'' Mr. Dienstbier said. ''But they're all for the free market, pluralism, a free press and so on, even the Communist Party. I think we have only one problem. It will be difficult for people who are not used to choosing to make a choice among 23 lists.''

HEADLINE: New York's Clamor Intrudes on Koreans' Insularity

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
The newest Koreans in New York move uneasily between two worlds - the New York where they work and the Korea they have created in its midst.
Koreans can buy furniture, go to the doctor and get marriage counseling in Korean. Their children can go to one of 400 weekend Korean schools to study their homeland's culture and language. They can join the Korean Bowling Association or the Korean Scuba Diving Club. And for solace after a hard week's work, they can attend one of the hundreds of churches where the sermon will be in Korean.
This is a world where learning English is unnecessary, where the only contact the Koreans newest to the city may have with the American world around them is over a counter at a grocery or dry cleaner. They come to New York from a homogeneous society, where years of occupation, war, political turmoil and forced-march industrialization meant hard work or certain starvation. 
Here, in the poor neighborhoods where the newest Korean settlers set up shop, they see an America remote from the haven they dreamed of, a place of high unemployment, despair and crime. Here the insular society they have created has failed them, and the clash of two worlds sparks conflicts like the boycott by some blacks of two Korean groceries in Brooklyn.
 
'A Very Closed Society'
''We have lived in a homogeneous society with very little contact with outsiders,'' said Kay Lee, editor of the English edition of The Korea Times, one of several Korean newspapers in New York. ''As a result, Americans, especially blacks and Hispanics, are very different for us. A lot of people's minds and bodies are so tied up in managing their stores that they don't want to bother to learn the language or the culture.
''Among Koreans, we cooperate and communicate and give to each other. But we are a very closed society, like a ghetto.''
The world of South Korea in New York may be insular, but it is not monolithic. No one has an exact count of the number of Koreans who live in the metropolitan area, but the Korean Association of New York and The Korea Times estimate between 250,000 and 300,000. And though the number of unregistered immigrants is not known, the official Korean population is growing steadily, by about 2,500 a year.
In many ways, the Korean immigrant experience does not differ appreciably from those of previous groups who came to New York to seek a better life. Jews, Italians, Greeks, Russians, all were suspicious of outsiders, all clung to their own people, until they could gain a foothold in the new world.
Today, within their new world, Koreans observe the strictly ordered hierarchies of education, region and class that divide them almost as much as their fierce drive to succeed and national pride unite them. In New York, natives of the Korean southwest continue to distrust southeasterners and former classmates hold reunions and lend each other money.
Here live women as different as Mung Kim and Young Ja Lee. In the four years since the 39-year-old Mrs. Kim and her husband Jong opened their grocery near Columbia University, she has taken one day off - to visit the Statue of Liberty. They work 16 hours a day, seven days a week, tending to customers as their children ride bicycles outside or do homework behind the counter. In the 19 years since her husband opened his import-export company, Mrs. Lee has not had to work. Instead, she has raised their four children. She has time to make the trip from their Long Island home to the Flushing Y.M.C.A. in Queens, the heart of Korean settlement in New York. There she takes cooking classes and sings in a mothers' choir.
Mrs. Lee is a member of what Grace Lyu-Volckhausen calls the ''invisible'' Koreans, the first wave of immigrants who came to the United States in the 1960's and 70's. Like Mrs. Lyu-Volckhausen, who directs minority program evaluation at the State of New York Mortgage Agency, Mrs. Lee speaks fluent English and counts American politicians as well as Korean businessmen as her friends.
Many older immigrants are established professionals. They moved from selling wigs to selling real estate, from studying English to practicing law or medicine. Their children party at discos in Manhattan and Queens that hold special Korean nights to cater to an affluent crowd. This group may enjoy the comforts of New York's Korean world, but it has crossed over into America.
 
'This Generation Is Struggling'
But the newest wave of immigrants - the grocers, fishmongers and manicurists most New Yorkers see - remains at the periphery. Few speak English; few have time to study. Their children are their interpreters and guides to the new world. Few have non-Korean friends, or much time for friendship, other than church.
''This generation is struggling for adjustment in this strange land,'' said the Rev. Wontae Cha, pastor of the Korean Methodist Church on 115th Street near Riverside Drive. ''When they came over to this country, most of them thought it was the promised land. Soon they found their dreams were not correct. They didn't study this land deeply, and became strangers in the mainstream culture. The church is not only to console them, but to give them courage to live.''
For most Koreans, the early years in the United States are ones of privation. Many leave established businesses in Korea in hopes that the United States would offer wealth and political calm.
 
Raising Capital
First they seek out other Koreans, to learn a trade like running a grocery or a nail salon. To get the capital they need to open shops of their own, many new immigrants borrow from family, friends and college classmates, drawing on a long Korean tradition of mutual savings associations. In savings pools known as ''kye,'' for example, friends contribute a set amount and members can draw the whole pool when they need it.
Many blacks say they believe that banks and the Government are giving the grocers loans that would be denied to black entrepreneurs.
But Ms. Lee said, ''It's hard to get loans from banks here because they have no credit history. But they can get them through Korean connections. School alumni know this person is not going to run away with his $5,000.''
Most are aiming to set up their own shops, and do. A survey conducted by Professor Pyong Gap Min of Queens College in 1988 found that 52 percent of Koreans in New York own their businesses. Typically, Mrs. Lyu-Volckhausen said, they choose labor-intensive fields, where little English is required and where they can employ family members who work without pay, though occasionally local people are hired.
 
Hoping for Sundays Off
In all, there are an estimated 15,000 small Korean-run businesses in New York City, including about 5,000 grocery, vegetable and fish markets.
Jong Kim, who with his wife Mung runs a delicatessen near Columbia, left a job as a textile trader in Seoul. His wife was an accountant for a hospital.
''Now I never have a chance to rest,'' Mr. Kim said. ''The rent is so high, the real-estate taxes and so many stores are closing on Broadway because business is very slow. I wanted to start a trading business. Maybe in 10 years, I'm not even sure. Now my small hope is only to be able to close on Sunday.''
Suk Jong Lee, who runs youth programs at the Flushing Y.M.C.A., says the strains are aggravated by the strict social hierarchy Koreans carry with them to America.
 
Stereotypes Die Hard
''A lot of them have college degrees, and having a small business in Korea is more or less looked down upon,'' she said. ''They have to do this in order to survive, but it's not what they were trained for. I know Ph.D.'s running sneaker stores. A lot of pride has been hurt in the process.''
As Koreans have for generations, Korean parents pin their hopes on their children. But the schools they count on let them down, too, because they teach children heretical ideas like independence that violate Korean values of filial obedience.
All of these strains contribute to the racial tensions that broke out in Flatbush this year and in Harlem five years ago. Many Koreans say they believe that the latest conflict is the work of political opportunists whose aim is to drive Koreans out of black neighborhoods. But many blacks believe that they see a larger problem - rudeness, racism, and a failure to honor the American tradition of successful businesses contributing to the neighborhood.
Professor Min of Queens College, in an article published in The Korea Times, cites a combination of cultural differences between Koreans and Americans, long-held Korean stereotypes of blacks, and bitter personal experience with shoplifting.
Many Americans tend to see Asians as polite, subservient, and reserved, stereotypes absorbed from earlier Chinese and Japanese immigrants. Many Koreans do not fit this mold. ''We are not Japanese - we are more individualistic,'' said Ms. Lee of The Korea Times. ''We are feisty.''
What may seem to blacks and other Americans like rudeness or hostility is often poor English, fatigue, or frustration at long hours of work some see as demeaning. Korean women are taught not to look at people in the eye, smile at them, or touch their hands, Mrs. Lyu-Volckhausen said.
Before coming to New York, many Koreans have no experience of blacks beyond the villains on American police television shows and action movies or the soldiers out drinking and picking up prostitutes in Seoul's Itaewon bar district. Racial stereotypes offensive to blacks are common throughout much of Asia.
These preconceptions, compounded by the new immigrants' isolation from the broader world of New York, have kept many from learning the rules of race relations. Many speak bluntly and in generalizations that Americans stopped voicing out loud years ago.
Many new Korean immigrants work in the poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods in New York and they do not like what they see. ''Most Koreans do not understand the history of the civil rights movement, and think America is a wonderful country where you can achieve your dream,'' said Ms. Lee of The Korea Times. ''They see a lot of blacks on welfare. They don't see them striving very hard to meet the goal of their lives. From a Korean point of view - working 16 hours a day, not spending money, trying to send their kids to the best schools, giving up pleasure - they don't understand that mentality.''
Korean grocers say they are plagued by shoplifting, and the culprits in the neighborhoods they serve are usually black, often teen-agers.
''Too many people steal, especially colored people,'' said John H. Choi, who ran a string of delis in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan. ''They pick up something, I say open your shopping bag, they say no, no. I tell them, I saw you. You are stealing my food. Too much headache, so I sold out.''
Stephen Lynton, the associate director of Columbia University's Center for Korean Research, who grew up in South Korea and works with immigrants at a Korean church, says that theft is more the issue than race. Many Korean shopkeepers, he points out, speak warmly of black customers.
Mr. Cha, the Methodist minister, is one of several more established Korean immigrants who says he must help teach newcomers more about black history and theology, to help prevent misunderstandings. And Mrs. Lyu-Volckhausen is meeting with merchants to suggest a checklist of things they should do when they move into neighborhoods, including shopping at neighborhood stores, visiting local schools and offering donations.
''We have to show everyone we are here to stay,'' Mrs. Lyu-Volckhausen said. ''We are not going to be pushed around anymore. But I tell them, this is an investment. If you don't invest in your neighborhood, there is no peace.''

HEADLINE: City on Seneca Indian Reservation Reaches New Lease With Tribe

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 21

 BODY:
Nine months before its 99-year lease was set to expire, the city of Salamanca, the only city in the nation built on land leased from an Indian reservation, has reached a new rental agreement with the Seneca Indians, officials said today.
The agreement calls for a $60 million payment to the Seneca Nation from the Federal and state governments, and for annual lease payments from the city to the Indian nation to increase about 14 times, to $800,000 a year. The new lease would run for 40 years, with an option to renew for another 40 years. 
The $60 million payment is intended as compensation for the payments under the old agreement, which both sides conceded were unfairly low.
At a news conference today in Salamanca, 60 miles south of Buffalo, officials of the Seneca Nation and the city of Salamanca said they were satisfied with the arrangement.
 
Government Money Not Certain
''It shows that we and the Seneca Nation can work together,'' said Antonio Carbone, Salamanca's Mayor.
But officials here and in Washington cautioned that there was no guarantee that the government money that is built into the agreement would, in fact, be available.
''We haven't signed off on anything,'' Gary G. Fryer, a spokesman for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, said today. The agreement calls for a payment from the state of $25 million.
Thomas Lederer, administrative assistant to Representative Amory Houghton Jr., a Republican whose district includes Salamanca, said that the Federal share of the payment, $35 million, ''is not in the bank.'' But, he added, ''our feeling is if we get a bill in around June 1, it's do-able.''
It is unclear today what will happen if the Federal and state goverments do not make their $60 million payment, the centerpiece of the agreement.
 
Impasse Hurt Town's Economy
The original Salamanca lease was approved by Congress in 1892. It called for annual payments of $17,000 with no provisions for increases, although since then the Seneca nation negotiated new leases that brought the total annual payment to $57,000.
The original lease was to expire in February 1991. Salamanca and Seneca officials began negotiations on a new lease more than a decade ago, but because of disagreements about its terms the negotiations dragged on, creating uncertainty about the town's future that discouraged investment and depressed real-estate prices.
''The real hope here is to revitalize the economy,'' Mr. Lederer said. ''The instability in the lease arrangement has really inhibited that.''
About 90 percent of the property in Salamanca, a city of 6,600, lies on Seneca land, part of the 22,640-acre Allegany Reservation on the Pennsylvania border, the largest Indian reservation in New York. For decades, some tenants have paid as little as $1 a year for the leases on their homes.
Under the agreement announced today, a residential lease would be assessed at 8 percent of the market value of the land, excluding the value of buildings. The price of a non-residential lease would be 10 percent of the land value.
Salamanca officials said today the leases would total about $630,000 annually. The rest of the $800,000 payment they have pledged to the Senecas would be a direct contribution from the city. Salamanca's Mayor, Mr. Carbone, said he did not know how the city would pay for its share.

HEADLINE: Franklin H. Williams Dies at 72; Lawyer and Former Ambassador

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Franklin H. Williams, a lawyer, educator and government official who was active in civil rights causes throughout a long career, died of lung cancer on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 72 years old.
Mr. Williams helped organize the Peace Corps, was a former Ambassador to Ghana and a former vice chairman of the New York City Board of Higher Education. From 1970 until his death he served as president of the Phelps-Stokes Fund, an educational foundation dedicated to advancing opportunities for American minority groups and Africans. 
He was born in Flushing, Queens, and graduated in 1941 from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. After service in World War II in a racially segregated unit of the Army, he passed the New York State bar examination before receiving his law degree from Fordham University in 1945.
He became an assistant to Thurgood Marshall, then special counsel to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and now an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
 
Open Housing and Employment
Mr. Williams, appearing before the Court, won reversals of death sentences for several black youths who had been convicted of capital crimes. In 1950 he was appointed regional director of the N.A.A.C.P. for nine Western states, Alaska and Hawaii.
He held the post for nine years, during which his office conducted drives for legislation on minority employment, open housing and other civil rights issues. Under his direction the N.A.A.C.P. won the first successful judgment in a major case involving school desegregation and the removal of restrictive covenants on real estate in California.
In 1959 Mr. Williams was appointed an assistant attorney general in California. Two years later he joined Sargent Shriver, the first head of the Peace Corps, traveling to nine countries around the world to prepare for the dispatch of American volunteers.
In 1961, as a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, he won passage of a resolution calling for an international version of the Peace Corps under United Nations auspices.
 
'Uses of the University'
Two years later, he became the first black person to be named United States representative to the Economic and Social Council and was later appointed Ambassador to Ghana. Relations between the United States and Ghana had been poor for years. But Mr. Williams was credited with bringing about substantial improvement during the three years he spent in Accra.
On his return from Ghana in 1968 Mr. Williams was chosen to head a new Urban Center at Columbia University, which initiated changes in curriculum and issued a major study, ''The Uses of the University.''
Upon assuming the presidency of the Phelps-Stokes Fund in 1970, Mr. Williams persuaded the organization's board to divest itself of holdings in corporations doing business with South Africa, seven years before the formulation of the Sullivan Principles, which have guided many other American institutions and businesses in such actions.
Phelps-Stokes had been established in 1911 to improve education for American blacks, American Indians and Africans.
Mr. Williams was named to the boards of many corporations, including Borden Inc., Consolidated Edison and the American Stock Exchange.
 
Helped Found Many Groups
He was also a board member of several nonprofit groups, among them the Council on Foreign Relations and the American Civil Liberties Union.
Mr. Williams helped to form a number of professional and cultural groups, including the Association of Black American Ambassadors, the Boys Choir of Harlem, the Caribbean Cultural Center and the Jackie Robinson Foundation.
In 1987, he was chairman of the New York State Judicial Commission on Minorities, which conducted a study of the treatment of members of minority groups in the state's courts.
Mr. Williams is survived by his wife, the former Shirley Broyard; two sons, Franklin Jr., of Manhattan, and Paul Anatole, of Lyme, Conn., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Tapping Ocean's Cold For Crops and Energy

BYLINE: By RICHARD HALLORAN

DATELINE: KEAHOLE POINT, Hawaii

 BODY:
ON a wind-swept point of black lava jutting into the Pacific Ocean, a small band of scientists and entrepreneurs is generating electricity, raising lobsters and growing strawberries using cold water from the depths of the sea.
Eventually, they say they hope the techniques they are devising here may increase food supplies and produce energy without pollution and without the use of fossil fuels.
For now, however, ''cold water is the resource we're selling,'' said Thomas H. Daniel, technical director of the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii, where the projects are under way.
That water, pumped from a depth of 2,000 feet, comes up at a nearly constant temperature of 6 degrees Celsius, or 43 degrees Fahrenheit. It has a high concentration of nutrients like nitrates, phosphates and silicates that foster the growth of plants and algae. And it is pure, having been out of contact with the surface for centuries as it drifted slowly along the bottom, and thus is free of the pathogens that carry diseases. 
When the laboratory began the project about 10 years ago, scientists here were confident it would be possible to put the water to profitable use. While profits have so far been elusive, the researchers have demonstrated the feasibility of several ideas, solved formidable engineering problems and produced a wealth of data.
 
Promise of Growing Lobsters
The lab, which operates on a budget of $1.5 million a year and has a staff of 20, began by seeking to use the differences in temperature between surface and deep sea water to produce electricity in a process called ocean thermal energy conversion.
But it is the other projects developed on this 322-acre site that seem more promising today: growing lobsters in half the time it takes in their natural habitat along the coast of Maine; raising flounder, sea urchins and salmon; distilling fresh water and cooling buildings and industrial plants.
Next to the energy lab is the Hawaii Ocean Science and Technology park, a 547-acre site set aside by the state for commercial development of the laboratory's findings. Once a project developed at the lab becomes profitable, it must move out, either to the park or elsewhere.
Aquaculture Enterprises has already moved to the park. The company has been experimenting since 1987 with lobsters and has begun test sales locally. The lobsters are raised in shallow tanks under green tents that block the heat of the sun. They are kept in separate pans so they will not eat each other.
Joseph Wilson, a partner in the enterprise, said that by mixing cold and warm sea water to maintain a steady temperature of 22 degrees Celsius, researchers have eliminated the near-hibernation of the lobsters in winter. That has cut growing time to less than four years from the seven and a half years it takes in nature. As they learn more about the lobsters' environment, nutrition and genetics, he said, ''we think that could be cut again to 30 months.''
 
Purity of Water Is Important
But even more than the temperature, he said, the purity of the water was essential to raising the lobsters. Other aquaculture efforts have been plagued by diseases carried in surface waters.
He said his company planned to cover 20 acres with the shallow tanks through which the sea water flows constantly. ''We have to produce 500,000 pounds a year to have a viable unit,'' he said. The North American market for lobster is 140 million pounds a year.
Nearby, Gerald R. Cysewski, the scientific director for the Cyanotech Corporation, pointed to raceways in which paddles like small versions of those on Mississippi riverboats kept a green slime moving slowly. The algae, rich in protein and vitamins, are sold for pharmaceuticals and health food, like spirulina. For his operation, which was open to the sun, the temperature of the water made little difference. ''For us,'' he said, ''it's the purity and the nutrients.''
Mr. Cysewski said the company produced 8,000 kilos of spirulina a month and sold it for $17 a kilo. He said the company was also moving into production of beta carotene from the algae, a precursor to vitamin A that may help to prevent cancer.
Ocean Farms of Hawaii is raising hundreds of salmon in its 21 acres of tanks along with abalone that feed on the kelp growing from the bottom. Royal Hawaiian Sea Farms is growing ''nori,'' the spinach of the sea used to wrap sushi rolls. A Japanese company, Uwajima Fisheries is raising hirame, a flounder popular in sushi restaurants.
In early May, Hawaii Seafood Growers Inc. announced it would start a pilot operation to grow mahi-mahi, a favorite fish in Hawaii. Thomas J. Vincent, the company's chief executive, said the fish farm could produce 1.5 million pounds a year, or a third of annual consumption here.
 
Growing Plants That Like the Cool
But the cold water also finds uses on land. Run through pipes the energy laboratory has laid in strawberry, lettuce and flower beds, the cold water keeps the plants at the cool temperature they like and causes fresh water to condense on the pipes. The fresh water drips from the pipes to water the plants.
''When we want the strawberries to think it's winter,'' Mr. Daniel said, standing under a tropical sun, ''we just run the cold water faster.'' Strawberries with five times more sugar than those in nature have been produced.
The chairman of the laboratory, John P. Craven, said cold sea water could have an economic future in air-conditioning and industrial cooling.
Several buildings at the energy laboratory at Keahole circulate cold sea water through their air-conditioning systems. The systems must be carefully maintained so that they are not corroded. Even so, electrical costs for the buildings have been cut by about 75 percent, Mr. Daniel said.
So far, the energy laboratory and the commercial park have not drawn protests from environmentalists who have demonstrated against an experiment on the other side of the island, where scientists are trying to tap a volcano for its heat to produce power. The reason, Mr. Craven and Mr. Daniel said, is that the lab and the enterprises change the sea water little before returning it to the ocean.
 
An Idea a Century Old
The idea of generating electricity from differences in sea water temperatures is the energy laboratory's main goal. A French engineer, Jacques-Arsene d'Arsonval, first proposed the idea in 1881. His student, Georges Claude, built a pilot plant on the north shore of Cuba in 1930.
In the United States, the oil crisis of the mid-1970's set off a search for new forms of energy. The natural energy lab was set up here in 1974 as a joint venture of the State of Hawaii, the University of Hawaii and the Federal Department of Energy. Japanese researchers and engineers have also developed the technology.
The ocean thermal energy conversion process, which the laboratory is using to generate electricity, can be accomplished either with closed or open cycles. In a closed cycle, warm sea water is pumped in from about 40 feet beneath the surface, where it is between 25 and 28 degrees Celsius, or 77 to 83 degrees Fahrenheit.
It is pumped through a heat exchanger containing a fluid like ammonia which vaporizes at low temperature. The vapor expands to drive a turbine that, in turn, drives an electrical generator. The fluid passes through a second heat exchanger in which it is cooled and condensed by cold sea water. Then it is recycled back into the first heat exchanger.
 
Payoff From Bigger Pipeline
In an open cycle, warm sea water is pumped into an evaporator in which the pressure has been lowered to make the water boil. In this case, the water vaporizes to drive the turbine and generator. But when the vapor is condensed, in a condenser cooled by cold sea water, fresh water is siphoned off.
Electricity from the more efficient closed-cycle plants, according to Mr. Daniel, would cost up to 14 cents a kilowatt hour, as against 5.6 cents for electricity generated by burning oil at $20 a barrel.
The laboratory has nine pipelines from 12 inches to 40 inches wide, which can bring up 25,000 gallons of cold sea water a minute. But so far, it has taken more power to pump up sea water than the ensuing process has been able to generate. The laboratory is planning to experiment with a pipe that is eight feet wide to pump up enough cold sea water to produce a net gain in electric power.
Mr. Daniel and Mr. Craven said a breakthrough on heat exchangers, however, may lower the cost. Researchers from the Aluminum Company of Canada and General Electric Company of Britain, have found that heat exchangers can be made for 20 percent the cost now by using aluminum instead of titanium. The exchangers account for about one-third the cost of the plant.
Patrick K. Takahashi, director of the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, a separate research organization at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, said that a combination of power generation and food production might eventually be economical.
''This might be competitive as a package in certain places, such as the Pacific islands, where fossil fuels are expensive,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Pop Concerts, Once Cheap, Now Rival Broadway in Price

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Pop music concerts, which used to be an inexpensive alternative to Broadway shows and other performing arts events in the New York metropolitan area, have been steadily going up in price.
This year, the top ticket prices for selected concerts at Radio City Music Hall have reached $50. That was the top price for Frank Sinatra's engagement last week at the Music Hall, which he postponed until mid-June after one performance. The ticket is only $10 below the $60 top price of the best seats for the most expensive Broadway musical, ''Jerome Robbins's Broadway,'' and only $5 less than a top ticket to any other major Broadway musical.
Mr. Sinatra's five sold-out shows at the 5,800-seat Music Hall are expected to gross more than $1.3 million. By comparison, the highest grossing Broadway show, ''Phantom of the Opera,'' is always sold out and brings in more than $550,000 for a week of eight performances at the 1,600-seat Majestic Theater. 
 
McCartney Hits $32.50
Similarly, the ticket prices for arena concerts by pop superstars have climbed to $30. Though the $30 barrier was cracked earlier by Michael Jackson, the Rolling Stones and a couple of other big acts, it is only now becoming commonplace.
Now all 55,000 tickets for Billy Joel's sold-out concert on June 22 at Yankee Stadium are also $30, and so are all tickets for the eight performances of Madonna's ''Blond Ambition'' tour in mid-June at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., and the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, L.I. Tickets for Paul McCartney's two sold-out concerts at Giants Stadium on July 9 and 11 are $32.50. When the Beatles first performed at Shea Stadium in 1966, the tickets were $5.75.
With some exceptions, the tickets for shows that today cost $30 would have cost $20 to $25 five years ago. During that time top prices have risen from $35 to $50.
The performers stand to make astronomical profits from these shows. Mr. McCartney and Madonna will probably walk away from their New York area concerts with more than $2 million each. And even after they pay their staffs and road crews, they will earn well over a million dollars, The 3 Main Promoters ''There's been a giant jump in prices in the last 12 months and especially in the last three months,'' said John Scher, the president of the Metropolitan Entertainment Company. Mr. Scher, who is based in Montclair, N.J., is one of the New York area's three leading promoters of pop concerts. His two principal competitors are Ron Delsener, who runs Ron Delsener Enterprises, in Manhattan, and Radio City Music Hall Productions.
The rise in ticket prices for pop concerts is part of a national trend that promoters attribute in large part to bidding wars by representatives of competing arenas vying to book concerts by the most popular acts.
''Thirty dollars is going to be the going price now on a lot of shows,'' said Mr. Delsener, who is promoting the Joel, McCartney and Madonna concerts. Mr. Delsener compared the bidding for the top talent to an art auction. He said one consequence may be that concertgoers have less money for other concerts with lesser-known acts.
Mr. Delsener, Mr. Scher and Scott Sanders of Radio City Music Hall Productions said the downturn in the economy in the Northeast has not affected ticket sales at the concerts they are promoting.
 
How Price Is Determined
They said the ticket prices for their concerts are determined by several factors. The most important, they said, is the cost of producing a show, which includes signing the performers, renting the facility and advertising. In negotiating with a promoter, the agents for a top pop act ask for an average of 85 percent of the net receipts of a concert after expenses have been paid.
Costs vary from facility to facility and depend a lot on rental and labor costs. Mr. Scher said the total cost of an average arena concert, including the performers, runs to about $200,000 at Madison Square Garden, $110,000 at the Nassau Coliseum and $120,000 at the Byrne Arena. For shows that do not immediately sell out, advertising costs are $25,000 to $30,000. Rents for the three facilities range from $20,000 to around $30,000 a concert, plus a share of the profits.
Perhaps the biggest variable affecting ticket prices is the guarantee a promoter pays to an act. Some popular acts demand as little as $25,000, but the guarantees can go as high as $100,000 to $200,000. If a show is successful, the promoter earns 10 to 20 percent of the net receipts. Infrequently, a promoter can lose $200,000 to $300,000 from a poorly attended stadium event. Mr. Scher said that 80 to 85 percent of the his company's arena shows were profitable.
 
Other Costs Are Stable
Even while the price of talent has risen, he said, the other costs of promoting concerts in the New York area over the last year have remained steady, rising less than 5 percent at Giants Stadium and the Byrne Arena and decreasing slightly at the Nassau Coliseum.
Like almost everything else in Manhattan, the costs of producing concerts are considerably higher than they are in New Jersey or on Long Island. This summer, the top prices for Shirley Bassey's Carnegie Hall concerts on July 12 to 14 are $50, which is $10 more than her concerts cost last year. Mr. Delsener, who is promoting them, said the rise was a result of living-cost increases for Carnegie's unions.
At Radio City Music Hall, the first solo act to crack the $50 barrier was Ella Fitzgerald last year. For her one-night return engagement last month, the top price was again $50. Both concerts sold out, each grossing more than $250,000.
 
At the Low End
This is the second year that Radio City Music Hall will also promote the Reebok Riverstage series of pop concerts at Pier 84, starting on June 13. At the request of New York City, which leases the site to Radio City, the ticket prices will be markedly lower than at other concert venues. With few exceptions they will be $17 for advance tickets and $19.50 for those bought on the day of the show. The series opens with Rickie Lee Jones and Lyle Lovett. Some of the other performers scheduled to appear include Alice Cooper, Ziggy Marley, Tears for Fears, Bad Company, B. B. King and the Moody Blues.
Other variables also affect the pricing of pop concerts. Performers whose shows involve the aggressive merchandizing of T-shirts and other memorabilia tend to take into account the possibility that a high ticket price might cut into its merchandising revenue. Some artists can gross almost as much in T-shirt sales as in ticket sales. Acts like Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and New Kids on the Block, which have young, loyal audiences, sell as much as $10 in merchandise for each person attending.
 
The Age of the Audience
While the generational divisions in musical taste of the late 1960's and early 70's have blurred in the last two decades, they can be sensed in the ways that audiences of different ages approach pop music entertainment. Thus ticket pricing is strongly influenced by the age of the audience and the type of music being offered.
The standard method by which young rock bands build up audiences is through constant touring, going from clubs to middle-size halls to large arenas. Because those audiences are mostly teen-agers with limited income, new performers use lower-than-average ticket prices to cultivate and then hold a loyal audience. Mr. Scher cited Bruce Springsteen, the Who, the Grateful Dead, U2, Robert Plant and Def Leppard as top acts that have followed this course.
When the Who played Giants Stadium last year, for example, the tickets were only $23.50. Tickets for Depeche Mode, which has sold out its June 16 Giants Stadium engagement, are $22.50. New Kids on the Block's Giants Stadium shows on July 20 and 21 are $25. Depeche Mode and the New Kids both have young, ardent followings.
Successful and durable performers like Mr. Sinatra and Miss Bassey, who bills herself as ''the world's greatest female entertainer,'' cultivate a flashy, ''high rolling'' aura that attracts a ''big spender'' type of audience. By paying a lot for tickets and dressing up to see their shows, audiences partake in the glamour of the event.
Veteran rock acts like the Grateful Dead, however, build their reputations on a populist working class mystique. The Grateful Dead, it is believed, haven't played to an empty seat in a decade. This summer the Dead are embarking on an extended national stadium tour. Depending on the city, the ticket price will range from $22.50 to $25.
 
The Elegant Cabarets
Roughly the same measurements that apply to concerts also apply to clubs. Elegant cabarets like Rainbow and Stars and the Cafe Carlyle have a $35 cover charge for an affluent over-40 crowd that is expected to order lots of food and drink.
Jazz clubs that book big names have a long tradition of being pricey. Depending on the act, the Blue Note, New York's biggest jazz club, in the West Village, charges anywhere from $15 to $35 and a $5 minimum per person at tables.
In rock clubs, which have younger audiences, the prices are a little lower. The Ritz, on the site of the old Studio 54, charges around $20 a show with no minimums. But that also can mean no seating. In New York right now, the club that has held the line on ticket prices is the Bottom Line, a rock showcase club started in the 70's. The average ticket price at the Bottom Line is $13.50 on weeknights and $15 on weekends.
So far, the rise in concert prices has not encountered strong public resistance. But how far can it go?
''There is not a bottomless pit of discretionary income out there,'' Mr. Scher said. ''The public will pay anything to see the superstars. But at what cost to the economic health of the rest of the entertaiment industry?''

Drug Industry Nervous on Prices

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
PHARMACEUTICAL company executives are watching nervously as drug prices come under growing criticism in Congress and states that are scrimping to pay for Medicaid programs for the poor.
Three of the largest pharmaceutical companies - Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Burroughs-Wellcome - have broken with the industry's longstanding policy of refusing to offer discounts on Medicaid drugs. Together, the three companies have at least 15 percent of the $36 billion American pharmaceutical market.
Bristol-Myers and Burroughs-Wellcome are backing a proposal by Merck that would offer the companies' lowest discounts to Medicaid. To get the discounts, Medicaid programs would have to accept all company products, exempting them from restrictions that currently exclude some expensive drugs. 
Most big drug companies oppose giving Medicaid discounts to the states, which spend $3.5 billion on drugs in Medicaid programs. The executive committee of the board of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group, met on May 3 and formally rejected ''proposals to tie the availability of prescription drugs to the willingness or ability of companies to grant discounts or rebates.'' Although that was the substance of Merck's proposal, the company was not named.
But Bristol-Myers and Burroughs, a unit of the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. of Britain, had already taken Merck's side. And Glaxo Inc., the American division of Glaxo Holdings P.L.C. of Britain, also a large company, said it was keeping an open position. ''We will be watching this issue with great interest, as will the entire industry,'' said Robert A. Ingram, a Glaxo executive vice president.
''There is a lot of merit to the Merck proposal,'' said a spokeswoman for another leading drug maker, who asked not to be identified.
''The whole issue of pricing is a very serious one for the companies and their stock price-earnings ratios,'' said Hemant K. Shah, an independent pharmaceutical analyst in Warren, N.J. ''Drug unit sales are declining and about 70 percent of sales growth is coming from price increases.''
Indeed, he added, one advantage for investors of having drug stocks had been that the companies could always raise the prices of their products, even in a recession. ''But if this thing gets out of hand, the companies may have trouble raising prices even in economic boom times,'' he said.
Not surprisingly, Merck's offer plays to its own strengths. Merck has several important new products that it would like to sell in the Medicaid market. And Merck's deepest discounts are smaller than those offered by its competitors.
The Senate Finance Committee is preparing to hold hearings this summer on a Medicaid drug bill. The measure, which was introduced on May 10 by Senator David Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat who heads the Special Committee on Aging, would encourage state Medicaid officials to join in negotiating discounts deals. Both the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans' Affairs as well as many hospitals and large health maintenance organizations already get such discounts.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader, has promised to see that the Pryor bill is given consideration. And the Senate Finance Committee has already asked for comment from the Bush Administration and estimates on financing from the Congressional Budget Office.
Senator Pryor said negotiating discounts would save the states $100 million to $200 million. But the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association disagreed. ''It may even increase costs,'' said Gerald J. Mossinghof, the association's president, adding that patients whose drugs were restricted often required additional care from doctors in hospitals.
The manufacturers are also fighting a provision of the Pryor bill to establish a national committee of physicians and pharmacists to decide which products are ''therapeutically equivalent,'' that is, interchangeable. Makers of such drugs would have to bid against each other. ''Different drugs have different properties and different side effects,'' Mr. Mossinghoff said.
At least 19 states already have some restrictions on Medicaid drugs. Jim Parks, who heads the $570 million Medi-Cal Drug Discount Program in California, said that ''a couple of companies are showing interest'' in discussing discounts. Several Medicaid drug bills, including one that would strengthen Medi-Cal's leverage in bargaining for discounts and one supporting the Merck approach, have been introduced in the Legislature.
John L. Zabriskie, president of Merck Sharp & Dohme, Merck's drug-making unit, said that four states - Arkansas, Delaware, Utah and South Carolina - had indicated that they would accept Merck's offer. He added that there were ''active discussions'' with at least five others. Arkansas is one of 12 states that restrict some Merck products; Delaware, Utah and South Carolina do not.
''I am cautiously optimistic that something positive will happen in California,'' Mr. Zabriskie said. ''We are beginning the dance,'' Medi-Cal's Mr. Parks said.

G.M. to Link Dealers by Satellite

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 21

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that it planned to link 9,700 United States dealers through what it said would be the world's largest private satellite network.
The network is scheduled to be completed in 1992. It will eventually replace the telephone lines linking computers in dealerships with G.M. and with one another, a system that has grown more expensive with increased use. 
Duncan A. Brodie, the G.M. manager in charge of dealer communications, said the current system of data exchange using telephone links could not handle the growing volume of data and electronic communications flowing between the company and its dealers.
Vehicle orders, and warranty and service data now move from dealerships to regional sales offices and to G.M.'s service technical group in Warren, Mich., and back again, by way of conventional high-speed telephone data communications.
Mr. Brodie said that a lack of communications capacity had prevented the company from using technology it had already developed. The network would allow dealers to expand their use of computers when diagnosing vehicle problems and allow them to take advantage of electronic shop manuals and invoicing, he said.
The proposed network would also enable top G.M. executives to address dealers directly through television on matters ranging from sales incentives and advertising campaigns to personnel changes.
Company officials would not disclose the projected cost of the satellite network.
General Motors said it would pay for the satellite dishes and had told dealers the new system would not cost them any more in communications charges than they currently paid.
But an official for the National Automobile Dealers' Association said he expected the costs of installing and operating the satellite network would eventually be passed on to dealers. ''It's overhead and somehow or other it has to be paid for,'' said Jake Kelderman, executive director of industry affairs for the dealer group.
GM Hughes Electronics will provide each dealer with a six-foot satellite dish and electronic support package. Multiple G.M. franchises will receive a satellite dish at each dealership location, the company said. Another G.M. subsidiary, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, will develop and operate the network.
General Motors is not the first auto maker to establish a satellite network for its dealers. The Chrysler Corporation contracted with Hughes in October to build a similar network connecting more than 5,000 Chrysler dealers.

HEADLINE: Economic Growth Seen

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The United States economy will skirt a recession through 1991 and set a postwar record for the longest period of business growth, the nation's top business economists predicted today.
The National Association of Business Economists said 82 percent of the 68 professional forecasters surveyed in April and May said the business expansion would continue slowly through next year. 
If so, the current expansion would top the record of 106 months of economic growth from February 1961 to December 1969. The present expansion began 90 months ago, in November 1982.
The forecast was considerably more optimistic than a similar survey last May, when 63 percent of the economists predicted a recession this year. Ninety-six percent of those questioned for the current survey said the economy would continue growing through this year.
The forecasters said the economy, as measured by the gross national product, would grow 2 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 1991. The G.N.P., the total output of goods and services, rose 3 percent last year.
They also said inflation, which was 8.1 percent in the first quarter, reflecting in part weather-related rises in food and energy prices, would drop to an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the last nine months of the year. That would make the 1990 inflation rate 4.7 percent, down from 4.8 percent in 1989.

HEADLINE: Boom in Made-to-Order Building

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
With the nation's financial institutions curtailing their real estate lending, the commercial building projects with the best chances - and in some cities the only chances - of getting financing these days are those that are made to order for a specific buyer or tenant. These projects, known as build-to-suit developments, are experiencing a boom as the nation's developers, most of which build on speculation, try to compete in the custom market.
''The market in build-to-suits is getting really crowded because speculative development has dried up and companies with development staffs are competing for these opportunities,'' said Robert Williamson, the director of national marketing for the Prudential Property Company, a big national developer.
In build-to-suit projects, developers design and construct buildings to the needs of a primary tenant, which pays the developer a marginal fee for design and construction work and agrees to buy the completed building or occupy all or most of it in exchange for a favorable long-term lease.
 
Clear Numbers for Lenders
The projects are easier for developers to finance than speculative buildings because rental incomes are guaranteed through a contract, allowing lenders to see clearly how their loans will be repaid. 
''The banks will only come into a situation where debt coverage is clear and up front from the beginning, and right now that's in build-to-suits,'' said William Conway, managing director of Jones Lang Wootton, an international real estate concern based in New York.
But these projects are usually less profitable for developers than speculative developments. Custom builders must absorb any overruns themselves, because they are locked into fixed rental rates or selling prices before they complete a project.
By contrast, speculative builders can pass on all of their building expenses to their tenants, and they generally charge higher rental rates for taking on more risks, including the possibility that they will be left holding on to thousands of square feet of vacant office space.
 
Pricing Problem
As a result, many speculative builders are not well versed in the intricacies of build-to-suit pricing, leading to predictions that many will have trouble competing in the market.
Build-to-suit developments were pioneered by a few large developers in the 1970's for designing specialized industrial projects. But office space is increasingly being tailored this way.
The build-to-suit explosion has been going on in Texas for several years. It took hold there after a drop in energy prices pushed the economies of Houston and Dallas into recession and devastated real estate values.
David Shulman, the director of real estate research at Salomon Brothers, said, ''It's been happening in Texas for a long while now and it's not surprising that it's now happening elsewhere in the country.'' Texas Project for I.B.M. Among the most recent custom-made buildings in Texas is the new $150 million office complex in Austin that Dallas-based Prentiss Properties is building for the International Business Machines Corporation. In that deal, NCNB Texas National Bank beat out another large domestic bank and two Japanese banks to provide construction financing. Prentiss, which has generally limited itself to doing build-to-suit projects, prevailed over competition like the Trammell Crow Company to build the 1.1-million-square-foot office space.
''We got the project because we had already established a real good relationship with I.B.M.,'' said Michael Prentiss, president of the developer.
Prentiss had completed six other made-to-order buildings, valued at about $1 billion, for I.B.M.
''They had a tight time schedule and it's an important project, so they needed a partner that could deliver the product on time,'' Mr. Prentiss said.
 
Growth for Trammell Crow
Dallas-based Trammell Crow, the nation's largest developer, has more than doubled its build-to-suit business over the last two years, to 10 million square feet, said Marc Myers, a partner at Trammell Crow who oversees these projects.
''It's always been about a third of our business, and right now it's about 80 percent,'' he said.
''Over the next five years, on a sustained basis, I expect it will be about 60 to 65 percent of our business,'' said Mr. Myers, who added that the number of build-to-suits Trammell Crow is doing has doubled this year, to 10 million square feet. But many developers who excelled at speculative building are discovering what the build-to-suit developers have known all along: the two businesses are radically different.
 
'A Different Business'
''Build-to-suits are going to be the largest share of the business, and everyone is going to be competing for them,'' Mr. Myers said, ''but it is fundamentally a different business because it requires greater technical skills, greater pricing precision and a team approach.''
In the typical build-to-suit project, a prospective tenant approaches a builder with specifications for the type of building it needs. A period of exploration and negotiation between the developer's technical staff and the client follows. During this period, which can last for months, the developer nails down the specific kind of building the client needs.
The development team then offers the client a guaranteed price on the building based on computer-estimated costs of construction. Competition among builders prevents padding of the estimates in case of overruns, and usually if the cost of construction runs up because of rising interest rates after the project has begun, the developer assumes the expense.
 
Challenge of Pricing
''You have to price the rent precisely to fit the project and make a slight return,'' Mr. Myers said.
The developer then works closely with the architects and contractors to deliver the building on time and within costs.
''In order to be a really strong build-to-suit developer,'' said William Alter, president of the Alter Group, a build-to-suit company based in Wilmette, Ill., ''you have to be able to do the numbers properly because you give the client a guaranteed fixed price up front, and you have to have proper asset management ability.''
For instance, an unexpected engineers' strike delayed by six weeks a 1982 project by the Alter Group to build a 350,000-square-foot research center in Naperville, Ill., near Chicago, for A.T.&T.'s Bell Laboratories. Bad weather delayed the project by another three weeks. Nonetheless, the complex still had to be delivered within 17 months of the starting date. Alter not only arranged for nonstriking engineers to keep things going at 60 percent of capacity, but also increased the total hours logged weekly to make up for lost time.
The developer also had to absorb the cost of design changes ordered by the client. These changes doubled the cost of the cafeteria alone.
 
Land Problems
The most frequent source of overruns is problems with the land. Building codes and zoning regulations can change, and increasingly complex environmental issues can add to a developer's expenses.
Build-to-suit projects often require more technical skill because they often are specialized projects like research and development centers, manufacturing plants or distribution warehouses. Some projects combine many of these different functions.
Increasingly, big corporate tenants in such deals are not satisfied with favorable long-term leases or equity positions in the completed project. Many corporate tenants choose to buy the building, several builders said.
 
Lower Profit Margins
In part because they sell or invite tenants to take equity stakes in these buildings, custom developers' profit margins are less than those of speculators, who make much of their money on a property's long-term appreciation. Although it differs with each project, the margin on build-to-suit projects can sometimes be as thin as three-quarters of 1 percent between the rent and the cost of the construction, Mr. Myers said. But generally the industry tries to get closer to 2 percent.
And developers have no guarantee of getting financing even for those build-to-suit projects with large, well-known clients and long leases. The banks are rigorous in their due-diligence reviews and can be very reluctant to finance even these deals.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on Expectation Of Steady Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained ground yesterday in worldwide foreign exchange trading as speculation rose that United States interest rates would be holding steady for the time being.
Gold prices fell after rising in Europe. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $373.30 a troy ounce, off $1.40 from late Friday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold of $372.35 an ounce, down 90 cents. 
Currency dealers said the markets believed that the Federal Reserve would not ease its credit policies anytime soon, and that should keep interest rates at their current levels. Higher rates tend to support a currency.
Also helping the dollar, particularly against the West German mark, were reports of political discord in West Germany over reunification plans with East Germany, dealers said.
But Gabriele Schmitt, a corporate dealer for the Bank of New York, played down the dollar advance, saying trading was so light that any movement in the dollar might have been exaggerated. ''There really is not any liquidity in the market to have a reasonable trading pattern,'' she added.
The dollar rose strongly against the West German currency, ending at 1.66245 marks, up from 1.6483.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar traded in New York at 153.73 yen, up from 153 late Friday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar rose by 0.35 yen, to 153.25 yen, extending its gain to 1.95 yen in four days. And it traded at 153.45 yen in London.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling rose in London to $1.6917 from $1.6910, and fell in New York to $1.6875 from $1.6900.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's quotes, included: 1.4217 Swiss francs, up from 1.4050; 5.6020 French francs, up from 5.5595; 1,222.50 Italian lire, up from 1,212.75, and 1.17715 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17975.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $373.25 an ounce, from $369.75 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to $373.50 an ounce from $370.60.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 22 cents to close at $374.08 an ounce.
Silver prices firmed. Silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.131 a troy ounce, up from $5.122 late Friday. Silver rose in London to $5.14 an ounce from $5.06.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Soybeans Post Sharp Drop And Grains Also Retreat

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Soybean futures prices fell sharply yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade, continuing a recent trend linked to weather conditions and greater availability of South American supplies.
Grain futures also retreated in Chicago. On other commodity markets, energy futures tumbled, while precious metals finished mixed, along with livestock and meat futures. 
Soybean futures settled 10 cents to 11 3/4 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in July at $6.10 1/2 a bushel.
Wheat futures ended 2 1/2 cents to 3 cents lower, with July at $3.37 a bushel; May corn was 4 1/2 cents to 5 1/4 cents lower, with July at $2.77 a bushel, and oats were 2 1/2 cents to 3 1/4 cents lower, with July at $1.51 1/4 a bushel.
All contracts for May deliveries of grains and soybeans expired at noon yesterday. The May soybean contract went off the board at $6.04 1/2 a bushel, May wheat expired at $3.83 1/2, May corn at $2.80 and May oats at $1.44 1/2.
July soybeans have dropped by 50 cents a bushel since May 10, when the Agriculture Department projected a bountiful 1990 harvest of 1.9 billion bushels and an increase in the American soybean stockpile.
Analysts said more South American soybean exports have bolstered perceptions that Brazil and Argentina can handle current global demand and at prices that are generally lower than in the United States.
Weather conditions have undermined soybean prices. The rainy weather that has hampered corn planting in the Midwest has driven speculation that farmers will switch some of their planned corn acres to soybeans, since soybeans can be planted later with no loss of yield.
Yesterday's forecast called for relatively little rain this week in the Midwest.
''We should see some acceleration of planting of corn and soybeans both,'' said Walter Spilka of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
In a weekly report issued after markets closed yesterday, the Agriculture Department said corn planting was 76 percent finished as of Sunday, compared with the norm of 88 percent for that date; soybean planting was 17 percent done, compared with the norm of 43 percent.
The analysts linked additional selling across the board to speculation the Soviet Union might reduce its grain imports because the cost of importing grain is draining the Soviet economy.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, energy futures tumbled amid perceptions of rising American gasoline supplies, said Tom Bentz of United Energy Inc.
He said the traders would be watching today's weekly report from the American Petroleum Institute for an expected increase of about 2 percent in refinery runs, which would verify the market's view that gasoline supplies are increasing.

HEADLINE: U.S. Calls Off Brazil Inquiry

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The United States has ended its investigation of purported unfair trade practices by Brazil, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said today. 
 
Mrs. Hills said she had told
Brazil's Minister of Economy, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, who is visiting the United States, that the investigation had been dropped because Brazil removed the import curbs that had prompted the inquiry.
Brazil had been cited under the 1988 Trade Act for general restrictions and prohibitions that had blocked shipments of foreign goods to Brazil. If it had not removed the curbs, Brazil could have been assessed increased tariffs up to 100 percent on some of its exports to the United States.

HEADLINE: Bush Called Ready to Renew China Trade Status for a Year

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
President Bush has decided to renew China's trade benefits for another year, concluding that the potential harm to American companies and to reform-minded Chinese outweighed a desire to register disapproval of Beijing's human-rights record, Administration officials said today.
There is also a domestic political dimension to Mr. Bush's move to renew most-favored-nation trade status. The President, who has said he agonized over the decision, is calculating that Congress will not react with the outrage that greeted his overtures to China last year, officials said.
The White House has spent weeks laying political groundwork for the decision, and officials said their soundings of Congress indicated opposition would not be strong, although George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, condemned Mr. Bush's decision today as ''contrary to American interests and wrong.'' 
 
Emphasis on District Profits
Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who led Congressional opposition to Mr. Bush's China policy last year, said today that a resolution opposing the extension of the trade benefits would be introduced.
But other Democratic lawmakers and Congressional aides said they could not gather enough votes to block the move as long as Mr. Bush found a way to make it clear that the act did not represent approval of Beijing's policies and that Washington might reconsider the issue next year if the situation in China did not improve.
Administration officials said Mr. Bush, whose decision was first reported in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, was prepared to offer such assurances when he sends his decision on trade with China to Congress. They said he would also point out that other sanctions against China, including suspension of World Bank loans and a ban on military sales, would remain in effect.
 
Sanctions Seen as Ineffective
Supported by intense lobbying from Hong Kong business interests and other groups promoting trade with China, the White House is also counting on its belief that any undecided lawmakers will be swayed by the profits that their home districts reap from $18 billion a year in trade with China.
Under a Federal law known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment, China and other countries with nonmarket economies cannot be granted most-favored-nation status, which gives them the lower tariff rates granted to most American trading partners, unless the White House certifies that they are permitting free emigration.
That certification must be renewed each year and is due for China this year on June 3, the anniversary of the crackdown around Tiananmen Square.
The Administration also made the decision with an eye to future debates over trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. By sticking to the letter of the Jackson-Vanik rules, which address only emigration, the Administration hopes to reduce the impact that other issues, like the conduct of political activity, will have on discussions of trade with Eastern Europe.
Administration officials said that the White House and State Department were still completing formal documents on the trade issue for Mr. Bush to sign, but that the President had reached a decision to extend the trade benefits for another year.
After meeting with Mr. Bush at the White House today, senior Republican lawmakers suggested that Mr. Bush was prepared to approve the extension and said he promised to send his ruling to Congress before it recesses on Friday for the Memorial Day holiday.
Mr. Bush's decision follows an intense debate in the Administration over the political and diplomatic ramifications of extending the trade benefits. Some officials questioned whether the White House wanted to risk the harsh criticism that surfaced over Mr. Bush's decision to send two aides to Beijing on two secret missions last year.
Other officials, especially career diplomats in the State Department who opposed the extension of the trade benefits, argued that canceling most-favored-nation status would send a clear signal of American disapproval of the Chinese human-rights record.
To do otherwise, they said, would fly in the face of Mr. Bush's publicly expressed disappointment that his overtures to China have had little visible effect on Beijing's policies.
In the end, officials said, Mr. Bush, a former envoy to Beijing who runs China policy personally from the Oval Office, followed his own inclination to keep diplomatic and economic channels open to Beijing.
He also heeded arguments that canceling most-favored-nation status for China would cost $8 billion to $10 billion in the first year. The Administration has prepared statistics on how that will affect specific profits in individual lawmakers' districts.

HEADLINE: House Rebuffs Bush on Aid To El Salvador, but Bill Dies

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
In a rebuff to the Bush Administration, the House of Representatives voted tonight to cut military aid to El Salvador by 50 percent. But minutes later the decision was voided when the House defeated the overall bill authorizing funds for El Salvador and other countries.
The back-to-back votes left in temporary disarray President Bush's effort to obtain emergency economic assistance for Nicaragua and Panama. Aid to those countries was included in the same bill as the restrictions on assistance to El Salvador. 
The House will soon have an opportunity to consider aid for Nicaragua and Panama in a separate bill. President Bush has urged Congress to complete action on the aid before the Memorial Day recess.
Representative Joe Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts, sponsor of the amendment, said he was surprised by the sequence of events today. ''I thought it would be very close, but I thought we would win,'' he said. ''Now it looks as if there was a cyclone out there that knocked us off our feet.''
 
Unusual Alliance
He said that the foreign aid bill was voted down by an unusual combination of politicians: Republicans who detested the restrictions on military aid for El Salvador; Democrats who dislike foreign aid in general, and ''liberal purists'' for whom the 50 percent cut for El Salvador did not go far enough.
The Administration, seeing approval of the Moakley amendment as inevitable, concentrated its efforts on trying to secure defeat of the overall foreign aid bill.
It was uncertain tonight in what form and at what time the limits on aid to El Salvador would be proposed again.
Despite the defeat of the bill, supporters of restricting aid to El Salvador said they were encouraged, contending that approval of the amendment to cut aid was an important symbolic victory.
Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, chief deputy whip for House Democrats, said the vote on El Salvador was ''a very big victory.'' He asserted that it ''changed the outlook on aid to El Salvador in a profound way'' and established ''a strong base for future negotiations with the Bush Administration on changing policy toward El Salvador.''
The overall foreign aid bill was defeated by a vote of 244 to 171. Ninety-four Democrats joined 150 Republicans in opposing the bill. Voting in favor of the measure were 155 Democrats and 16 Republicans.
Mr. Moakley led the effort to cut military assistance for El Salvador. His proposal, to halve such aid, was offered as an amendment to the foreign aid bill. The amendment was approved by a vote of 250 to 163, and the vote largely followed party lines.
Two-hundred-and-nineteen Democrats and 31 Republicans voted in favor of slashing military aid to El Salvador. Twenty-eight Democrats and 135 Republicans voted against the amendment.
The White House said Monday that it opposed the 50 percent cut in military aid to El Salvador and warned that President Bush was likely to veto any measure making such a cut.
Supporters of the legislation said it was needed to show United States concern over the failure of El Salvador to prosecute the people who killed six Jesuit priests and two women in San Salvador on Nov. 16.
They said the bill was intended to penalize the Salvadoran Government for not moving more effectively on the Jesuit case while at the same time providing new incentives to the Government and to leftist guerrillas to negotiate an end to the decade-long war. The Government and the guerrillas said this week that they hoped to arrange a cease-fire by mid-September.
The United States has provided more than $3.8 billion in aid to El Salvador since 1980. This year it is providing $315 million, including $85 million in military assistance for weapons and training. The aid issue has long been a contentious one. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in El Salvador in the last 10 years, most of them by death squads associated with the military.
Republicans, in Congress and the Administration, supported an alternative proposal that would have allowed Mr. Bush to suspend up to 25 percent of El Salvador's military aid if the Government there failed to take certain actions, particularly on human rights.
 
Incentives for Aid
The House bill included an elaborate set of incentives and disincentives. Military aid to the Salvadoran Government would have been cut in half, to $42.5 million next year. But it could have been restored to $85 million if the rebels failed to negotiate in good faith, continued to receive significant amounts of arms from outside El Salvador or staged a new military offensive that threatened the survival of the Government of President Alfredo Cristiani. The bill did not define good faith negotiations.
On the other hand, the Salvadoran Government would not have received any military aid from the United States if Mr. Cristiani was deposed in a military coup, if the Government failed to negotiate in good faith with the guerrillas or if it failed to prosecute those responsible for killing the Jesuit priests.
The Salvadoran authorities have arrested an army colonel, two lieutenants and five lower-ranking military men on charges of murdering the priests. But Democrats said the Salvadoran Government had made hardly any effort to determine if senior military officers ordered the killings.
Representative Gerry E. Studds, Democrat of Massachusetts, said today, ''Evidence in the Jesuit case has disappeared, and the investigation is at a standstill.''
Mr. Moakley said, ''The American people and the American Congress have been played for fools by the Salvadoran military and forces from both the left and the right who need war to continue in order to sustain their power in that troubled land.''
''Corruption is a way of life'' in El Salvador, he asserted. ''For 10 years now, American taxpayer money has been used not to build peace with democracy, but to destroy hope and build the private bank accounts of crooks who get rich at the expense of the Salvadoran people and the American people.''
Under the House bill, any funds withheld from the Salvadoran armed forces could be spent on child nutrition, health, housing or education programs in El Salvador.

HEADLINE: House Approves Bill Establishing Broad Rights for Disabled People

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved legislation today that would guarantee millions of disabled Americans access to employment, transportation, public accommodations and communications services.
Beating back amendments that would have significantly weakened its provisions, the House voted 403 to 20 for the proposed Americans With Disabilities Act, which supporters call the most sweeping civil rights bill in two decades.
The bill has already been approved by the Senate and is supported by President Bush. Although some differences in the versions passed by the House and the Senate remain to be worked out in a conference, sponsors of the legislation say they expect to have a bill on the President's desk before Congress breaks for its Fourth of July recess.
The measure would extend protections established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against discrimination based on sex, religion, color, race or national origin to people with physical or mental disabilities, including people with AIDS as well as recovering alcoholics and drug abusers. Both the 1964 law and the new measure bar discrimination in public accommodations, private employment and government services. protection. #200 Watching Supporters Cheer Many of the bill's requirements are already embodied in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits companies and government agencies receiving Federal aid from discriminating against people with disabilities. The legislation would extend this throughout the public and private sector; the businesses or agencies need not receive Federal funds to be covered. 
Many businesses will be forced to change their offices, factories or stores to accommodate the disabled. The bill is also expected to have a significant economic effect on government at all levels, although it is unclear what the ultimate costs to government or the private sector will be.
More than 200 supporters of the bill, many of them in wheelchairs, cheered, hugged one another and wept as Representative Bob Traxler, a Michigan Democrat who was presiding over the House, announced the final vote.
The group had followed the debate on television monitors in the National Statuary Hall, the marble-columned portico between the House Chamber and the Capitol Rotunda. For the first time, the televised House debate was translated in sign language.
 
'First Declaration of Equality'
''This is the first declaration of equality for people with disabilities around the world,'' said Justin Dart Jr., chairman of the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities, and a longtime advocate of disability rights.
Taking effect two years after it is signed into law, the measure would require employers to make reasonable accommodations for qualified workers and job applicants with disabilities unless doing so presents an undue hardship. The measure defines undue hardship for businesses as something that would ''be too costly or be too disruptive or substantially alter the way they do business.''
The bill defines a person with a disability as someone with a physical or mental impairment that ''substantially limits a major life activity'' like walking, talking or working. It covers people with AIDS and drug abusers or alcoholics who have undergone treatment. It excludes people with emotional disorders like kleptomania, gambling compulsions or pedophilia. Congressional researchers have estimated that one in six Americans is disabled, or about 43 million in all.
Public and private transportation systems must make new buses and rail cars accessible to handicapped people, installing lifts for people in wheelchairs, if necessary. Elevators or ramps must be installed at many rail stations. New or renovated buildings must be free from barriers preventing the disabled from entering, and restaurants and retail outlets must make their premises and services available to disabled persons.
Three years after passage of the bill, telephone companies would be required to establish relay services between special telephones for people with speech or hearing disabilities and people using ordinary telephones. The handicapped people would use the special phones to type out their messages, and an operator would act as an intermediary between them and the users of ordinary phones. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company calculated last year that service to people with hearing problems would cost the telecommunications industry $250 million to $330 million a year.
 
Costs to Bus Operators
Although the final costs are hard to estimate, the Government estimated last year that as the result of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the legislation passed today, state and local governments would have to spend $20 million to $30 million a year over the next several years to purchase buses equipped with hydraulic lifts.
After the Senate passed its bill last summer, Greyhound Lines Inc. asserted that the company would have to spend $40 million to $80 million a year to comply. Officials of the New York City Transit Authority, which runs the nation's largest transit system, said the bill would not have a signficant impact on its operating or capital expenses. More than 80 percent of the city's buses are now equipped with lifts, and officials say the rest will be so equipped by the end of 1992. As a result of a settlement of a lawsuit in 1984 brought by disability rights advocates, the city is already spending $40 million to install elevators in 54 of the subway system's 469 stations by the end of 1992.
The issue of how to punish violations of the proposed law had been a contentious one.
Supporters of the measure were able to beat back an amendment by Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, that would have limited the remedies available to handicapped people who are the victims of discrimination to those embodied in the 1964 civil rights law: injunctions to halt biased actions by employers and back pay for victims of discrimination who were dismissed or passed over for promotion. Another pending measure, the Civil Rights Act of 1990, would expand the 1964 civil rights law to allow for punitive damages and jury trials in the case of intentional discrimination, and such changes would apply to the disability law as well.
The Bush Administration, which opposes allowing increased damage awards, had supported the Sensenbrenner amendment, which was defeated 227 to 192. Administration officials said President Bush, who promised in the 1988 Presidential campaign to help Americans who have physical or mental disabilities, would not veto the disability bill over the issue. The Administration will seek to amend the civil rights bill instead, they said.
Nancy R. Fulco, a lawyer for the United States Chamber of Commerce, which supported the Sensenbrenner amendment, said the House had ''chosen to put unreasonable damage awards and attorney's fees above the needs of employers and employees.''
The House narrowly passed last week by a vote of 199 to 187 an amendment on food handlers, offered by Representative Jim Chapman, Democrat of Texas. Supporters contended that without the amendment the bill would have put businesses at undue economic risk by making it impossible for them to move workers who carry communicable diseases like AIDS from jobs where they handle food. The amendment would require employers to provide infected workers with another job for which they are qualified.
 
'Not an Unrealistic Fear'
''This is not an unrealistic fear,'' said Mr. Chapman of the public perception of a health risk. ''There are real examples in the real world of how this caused a loss of business, the closing of jobs and the loss of employment.''
Public health officials, including Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and gay rights organizations had denounced the amendment. Opponents of the amendment circulated a letter from William L. Roper, director of the Centers for Disease Control, that said food service workers infected with the AIDS virus ''need not be restricted from work'' unless they show signs of other maladies as well.
''The food handlers amendment has no basis in the science of transmission of HIV,'' said Urvashi Vaid, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ''It was a close vote, and members seemed to be swept up by emotion, rather than reason.''
The House also amended the bill to increase the time given small businesses to meet the requirements. The amendment, offered by Representative Tom Campbell, Republican of California, would give companies with 25 or fewer workers an extra six months and businesses with 10 or fewer employees a extra year to comply with the provisions on public accommodations.
But the lawmakers defeated two amendments that would have weakened the bill's provisions regarding public transit systems. One, defeated by a vote of 290 to 110 would have allowed commuter railroads to make only one car in every train accessible to the disabled, including people in wheelchairs. The other, defeated by a vote of 266 to 148, would have exempted public transit systems in cities with a population of less than 200,000 from the requirement of making all new cars accessible if they made other transportation available.
The sponsors of the amendments argued that the bill needed to be changed because of its costs to public transit systems. Opponents said the effect of the proposed changes would be to segregate people with disablities.

HEADLINE: BANK DEPOSIT FUND HITS A RECORD LOW

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
For the second year, the fund that insures the nation's bank deposits declined, the Government said today. And at the end of last year less money was available to insure each dollar deposited than at any time since the fund began in the early 1930's.
By the end of December, officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said, the fund held only 70 cents in assets for every $100 of insured deposits at commercial banks, down from 80 cents a year earlier. Experts say a safe figure is $1.25. 
Despite the continuing drain on the fund from recent bank failures, no insured depositors at commercial banks or at savings and loan associations have lost money, and Congress has promised that no insured depositor will lose a dime.
The losses to the fund last year amounted to $851 million from the record of 206 banks that failed, including MCorp in Dallas, the Seamen's Bank for Saving in New York, Texas American Bancshares of Fort Worth and the National Bancshares Corporation of San Antonio.
 
Bigger Losses Than Expected
The F.D.I.C. losses in 1989 were greater than expected. They are apart from those that swamped the savings and loan industry in recent years.
The banking fund is now left with $13.2 billion in assets, and regulators and banking experts say the insurance fund is not in immediate danger. Still, if there is a strong recession and real estate values weaken further than they already have, several more large banks could fail, raising the possibility of a new bailout by taxpayers.
Real estate pressures contributed heavily to the collapse in the savings and loan industry which is now expected to cost taxpayers and the savings industry $300 billion to 500 billion over the next 30 years.
The F.D.I.C.'s bank insurance fund is separate and distinct from the currently depleted fund that insures deposits at the nation's savings and loan associations, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The management responsibility for the savings and loan fund was given to the F.D.I.C. in the legislation for the savings and loan bailout.
A large loss for the bank deposit fund was expected, so most analysts were unshaken by the report, saying that unless a severe recession strikes, the F.D.I.C. will be able to begin rebuilding its resources this year. Indeed, last year's loss was far less than 1988's deficit of $4.3 billion.
But they warned that the loss for 1989 comes at a time of other significant strains on the commercial banking system, particularly depressed real estate markets in the Northeast and scattered reports of a drying-up of credit.
''Clearly our results in the next year or two will depend on whether we have large banks that fail in the system,'' said L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C. and the Resolution Trust Corporation, which manages the savings and loan bailout. ''Much depends on future interest rates and real estate markets.''
 
A Critical Point
The F.D.I.C.'s bank fund stands at a critical point in its history, from which it could either rapidly return to health of slip quickly into crisis.
The 1980's brought about dramatic change to the sleepy agency that for decades handled a handful of small bank failures a year. Within a few years, failures went from 10 a year to almost 200, creating what most experts say was a daunting administrative task for the agency. During Mr Seidman's five-year tenure, it has coped with the collapse of almost 700 banks, including many of the largest in Texas.
But if the economy stays on track and interest rates remain steady, the failure rate could change, and even fall, experts say.
An important indicator of future bank failures is the number of banks on the F.D.I.C.'s problem bank list. That number peaked in 1987 at more than 1,600 and has dropped since then, so that by the end of 1989, the list had only 1,109 problem banks.
 
Fewer Failures Seen
Mr. Seidman has said for several months that so far he sees no major bank failures this year. Moreover, he sees fewer failures this year, ''I'd say between 150 and 175,'' he said.
If all those factors remain unchanged, and the economy stays strong, F.D.I.C. officials said the fund might be able to show a considerable profit in 1990.
Robert Dugger, chief economist for the American Bankers Association, said he projected that the F.D.I.C.'s bank fund would fall again in 1990, before it finally bottoms out and begins moving upward.
His trade group, the industry's largest, expects the fund to fall as low as 62 cents for every $100 of insured deposits. It had expected the fund to fall to 64 cents in 1989.
Mr. Dugger said he did not expect the fund to reach the $1.25 level until 1996 or 1997.
 
Premiums to Rise
One factor working in the favor of the F.D.I.C. is that this year and next, the premiums that banks pay for deposit insurance rise sharply. This year, they rose to 12 cents for every $100 of deposits, from 8.33 cents. They will rise again in 1991 to 15 cents.
Mr. Seidman also has the option, if the five-member board of the F.D.I.C. feels the situation is serious enough, to increase the premium banks pay by another 7.5 percent to 22.5 cents a year.
By 1991 the F.D.I.C. will be collecting premiums of more than $2 billion above the 1989 levels.
''By 1991, the F.D.I.C. will have more than $4 billion to play with in premiums and investment income,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president for the Independent Bankers Association. ''Where are they going to spend that? I don't think any big bank failures are in the works, other than one bank in New England. I think we are over the hump.''
 
This Is the Rough Period
''We have known that the F.D.I.C. was going to have a rough period in 1998 and 1989, but the problems are largely behind us,'' said William M. Isaac, former F.D.I.C. chairman and now head of the Secura Group, a Washington-based financial consulting firm. ''Now it is a matter of giving the fund an opportunity to rebuild.
But Mr. Guenther and other experts acknowledged that the downside possibilities, particularly in case of a recession, were considerable.
Another problem for the agency has been the transfer of some of its best talent to the Resolution Trust Corporation to manage the day-to-day activities of the savings and loan bailout, a process that some have described as a brain drain.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Lithuanian Compromise With Moscow Unravels

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 22

 BODY:
Movement toward compromise on the Baltic republics' campaign for independence stopped today, as Lithuania rejected demands to suspend its declaration of independence and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned all three Baltic republics that they must abide by Soviet law.
Lithuanian legislators voted in principle today to suspend important laws enacted since the republic declared independence on March 11, as soon as Moscow agrees to begin negotiations. Parliament is expected to formally approve the text of a resolution on Wednesday, but none of the variations being considered includes any mention of freezing the declaration itself, and members of Parliament confirmed that such action had been ruled out.
Mr. Gorbachev has demanded that Lithuania place a moratorium on its declaration as a condition for beginning talks with Moscow about independence, and it seems unlikely that he will be satisfied by a move that puts a hold only on independence laws. 
The Soviet leader had a brief and tense conversation today with the President of Latvia, Anatolijs Gorbunovs, and the President of Estonia, Arnold Ruutel, and reaffirmed his intention to deal toughly with all three Baltic republics in their quest to leave the Soviet Union.
''Mr. Gorbachev confirmed his demand to the three Baltic states to abolish their decisions on independence,'' Mr. Ruutel told the Estonian news service tonight. He also described the 20-minute conversation as ''unpleasant'' for both sides, people who spoke with him said.
The Kremlin and the Baltic republics seemed to have struck more conciliatory tones toward one another during a visit by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to Moscow last week. During the Baker visit, Mr. Gorbachev met with Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene of Lithuania after the republic's Parliament proposed suspending independence legislation passed since its decision to break from the Soviet Union.
 
Advice From Baker
American and Lithuanian officials indicated that Mr. Baker had encouraged Mrs. Prunskiene to make some concession on the declaration itself, telling her that freezing the act did not amount to revoking it.
But in today's debate, only a handful of Lithuanian legislators proposed suspending the declaration and the vast majority agreed that there was no way to tamper with the independence declaration without leaving the republic vulnerable to Moscow.
''Let us be honest,'' Kazimieras Moteika, deputy chairman of the Lithuanian Parliament, told the legislators today. ''Having chosen the road of independence, we must be firm and remember that we will not veer off it.''
Lithuanian officials said that the resolution being debated differs from the proposal brought to Moscow last week by Mrs. Prunskiene in that Parliament now says it is not only willing to, but in fact will suspend independence laegislation when Moscow confirms that talks are to begin.
The Lithuanian decision was made despite the worsening effects of an economic blockade imposed by Moscow on the renegade republic more than a month ago.
Deputy Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas announced today that, as a result of a continuing Soviet embargo on fuel, stricter gasoline rationing would go into effect on Wednesday.
 
Hardships Ahead
Describing Lithuania as being in a ''crisis situation,'' Mr. Brazauskas said gasoline would be allotted only to ambulances, police and food transport vehicles. Fuel for public transportation will be cut back, he said, and for private vehicles will be cut off.
The new measures will put about 23,000 drivers out of work, doubling the number of people who have been laid off from their jobs since the economic sanctions were first instituted, a spokesman for the Lithuanian Parliament said.
Officials also said that hot water to homes would be reduced by Friday because of the fuel shortages and that power to most industries might have to be cut by the end of the week, although medical and food enterprises will continue to be served.
Most of the republic's apartment buildings are served by a central hot-water pumping station, officials said, adding that for the time being, those buildings that heat their own water with natural gas will not be affected.
In his conversation with Mrs. Prunskiene last week, Mr. Gorbachev threatened to broaden the economic blockade against Lithuania if the republic failed to comply with his demand to suspend its declaration of independence.
The Parliaments of Latvia and Estonia tried to avoid a similar confrontation with Moscow, by voting for transitional periods to independence after Lithuania had voted for a clean break with Moscow. So far, the kremlin has not imposed any sanctions against Latvia and Estonia, but Mr. Gorbachev has condemned both republics' actions as illegal and today repeated his warning that the only way any republic can leave the country is through a new law on secession recently adopted by the Soviet Parliament.

HEADLINE: Safety Board Urges F.A.A. To Order Use of Child Seats

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The National Transportation Safety Board today called on the Federal Government to require that infants and small children sit in safety seats during airline flights.
It was the board's first endorsement of such a mandatory rule. The unanimous recommendation by the five-member safety board puts additional pressure on the Federal Aviation Administration, which is considering what its regulations should say about safety restraints for babies under 2 years old, who now may fly free of charge if they are held on an adult's lap. The safety board is independent of the aviation agency. 
Anthony J. Broderick, the F.A.A. official in charge of writing the new safety regulations, said it might take as long as a year for the agency to decide on a child restraint rule and expressed serious doubts about the wisdom of requiring safety seats for all babies.
''The result of this rule could be a very significant increase in airline revenues being borne by families with small children, many of whom are of modest income because they are very young,'' he said. A cost-benefit analysis by the agency suggests that a family that chose to save money by traveling by car instead of by plane would face a substantially higher probability of an accident, he said.
 
Crashes Renewed the Debate
Flight attendants, pediatricians and child safety experts have long urged that the use of child safety seats be required on aircraft. Since 1985, seats have been manufactured that meet Federal standards for both cars and aircraft. But their use has been optional in airplanes while it is mandatory in cars.
Several babies who were not strapped into safety seats were killed or injured in two crashes in the past year. The crashes, one in Iowa involving a United Airlines jet and the other on Long Island involving an Avianca jet, led to new calls for a rule requiring the use of safety seats.
In February, the nation's major airlines for the first time recommended that the aviation agency require infant seats for all infants on airplanes.
Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot, an Iowa Republican, and Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Missouri Republican, have introduced legislation that would require use of the seats.
 
An Even Stronger Rule
The safety board today went further than the airlines and its own staff in its recommendation, urging that the Government require children up to 40 inches tall or up to 40 pounds, regardless of age, to sit in approved seats when flying.
Jim Burnette, a board member, argued that automobile safety seats are designed to handle babies up to that size, and that the seats would provide the maximum protection for young passengers.
The board also asked the agency to investigate the possibility of designing improved restraints for even larger children.
The aviation agency published a preliminary proposal in February that did not include a mandatory seat rule. The proposal suggested requiring airlines to let parents use approved safety seats when they have bought a ticket for the baby, or when there is a vacant seat next to the parent.
The agency said it would consider public comments received by May 30 before making a final decision.
 
Some Would Pay Willingly
The several dozen comments received by the agency favored a mandatory safety rule by a margin of three to one. The commenters said the increased costs would be acceptable.
Airline executives have said that cut-rate fares for babies would still be available if a rule requiring child seats was adopted and that babies might even fly free on some flights.
After the vote today by the safety board, its chairman, James Kolstad, said, ''I don't think the economic cost for protecting an infant's life is too much to ask.''

Adversity Can Help A Garden To Grow

 BODY:
On a four-block lot in Boston's South End, Kai Fok Lai crouches behind a wall of bedsprings, sticks and refrigerator shelving, working the soil with a spatula.
Two decades ago the row houses that stood there were demolished in an urban renewal program. But the renewal never came. Instead, Mrs. Lai, who is 70 years old, and others who live nearby quietly began carving out tiny vegetable gardens amid the rubble. 
But it has not been easy for the Berkeley Street Garden to take root, and not just because of inhospitable soil. The project, one of Boston's largest urban gardens, has also been buffeted by economic and social forces that have long roiled the South End.
The gardeners, mostly elderly Chinese, often must scratch out a living hampered by their lack of job skills and the fact that they do not speak English. With vegetables priced out of reach in many markets, the gardens help keep food on the table.
But vagrants and homeless people stole entire harvests of melons and peas. And fights on nearby streets often spilled over into the carefully cultivated plots.
Like any community struggling to survive in a foreign land, the gardeners defended themselves, turning the garden into a fortress of nearly 100 walls, many of them built of stitched-together trash.
''We built this because last time somebody stole the plants,'' Mrs. Lai said, pointing to the 6-foot-high wall on her plot and using her 9-year-old grandson to translate. ''Some drunk people came in here, too.''
The garden's newest assailants are the upscale young professionals who have settled in the neighborhood in the last two years.
They complained that rats and robbers were hiding in the garden at night, and that knives and guns were dropped off in trash piles. Then there was the more delicate issue of fertilizer. With a pungent mix called ''night soil,'' a mix of human excrement and fish emulsion, the immigrants followed a Chinese tradition of treating the nutrient-poor ground so their crops would grow.
''You would sit down for a barbecue and it would be like low tide,'' said Bill McCarthy, who lives in a renovated house next to the garden.
The South End residents ''were concerned that this was an unnecessary health hazard,'' said Julie Stone, director of education for the Boston Urban Gardeners, a nonprofit group that has upgraded more than 100 community gardens in the city.
But Mr. McCarthy and other residents who live near the garden did more than complain about its fertilizer and unsightly appearance. Armed with their own hoes and aided by the Boston Urban Gardeners and a $50,000 grant from the Boston Public Facilities Department, an army of volunteers and translators have helped the Chinese to put in new soil and a new water system.
With the improvements came new rules. According to a notice in Chinese posted recently in the garden, $10 yearly fees must be paid, the gates are locked at night and the pungent fertilizer is forbidden.
And, like it or not, it also means the walls are coming down.
Many gardeners say they are happy to receive the new wire fences supplied by the Boston Urban Gardeners. ''No problem,'' one elderly woman said through a translator. But other gardeners are troubled.
''I spent the whole day Saturday building this wall,'' said Sin Yung Lai, 41, as she ran her hand along the 6-foot wall. ''It is so fine.''
Wedged between the predominantly black Roxbury section, the fashionable Back Bay and an expanding Chinatown, Boston's South End has long been an social and economic mixing bowl. Given the diversity of residents now signing up for plots, community leaders see the garden as a way to promote integration and to provide badly needed open space.
''I find gardening here to be a very rich experience,'' said Duncan Davidson, who spent a recent lunch break looking over his sprouting eggplants, chives and green beans. ''The old Chinese women are wonderful; they look through the fence and point at your plants.''
And Mr. Davidson said he was even fond of the homemade fortresses that are being taken down. ''I like junk fences,'' he said. ''I wish they could be junkier.''
