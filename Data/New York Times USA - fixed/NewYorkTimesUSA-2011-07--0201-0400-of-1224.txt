HEADLINE: All Greek To Him

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mitch McConnell, Hellenizer. 

 BODY:
I've been complaining for a while about the Hellenization of economic discourse -- the way everyone is being treated as being just like Greece, when in fact Greece -- with a long history of fiscal irresponsibility, very high public debt, and a country without a currency -- doesn't bear much resemblance even to the other peripheral Europeans, let alone the United States.
So here, via Steve Benen, is Mitch McConnell, declaring "We look a lot like Greece already."
Yep, aside from the fact that everything is different. Here's debt levels (if you ask me the IMF projections for Greece are too optimistic):
Plus there's the having your own currency thing, and the fact that the interest rate on US 10-year bonds is 3.11 percent, on Greek bonds 16.82 percent.
Otherwise we're exactly the same.
Also, didn't Republicans used to accuse people talking down America of being unpatriotic?

HEADLINE: Arguing from the Facts

BYLINE: GARY GUTTING


HIGHLIGHT: As a recent debate on the budget shows, inductive reasoning can take us only so far. 

 BODY:
The Stone is featuring occasional posts by Gary Gutting, a professor of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, that apply critical thinking to information and events that have appeared in the news.
In trying to cut through the passion and rhetoric of political debates, one important move is to focus on the facts relevant to the issue in dispute. This, however, is not as easy as it might seem. To make the issues concrete, consider an example from current discussions of the federal budget.
John Taylor, a distinguished economist at Stanford, recently wrote a column in the Wall Street Journal in which he offered a "fact-based" critique of President Obama's budget proposal. The centerpiece of his argument was a chart showing the amount of federal government expenditures from 2000 to the present, along with projections of what Obama proposes to spend from now through 2021. According to the chart, in 2000 spending was 18.2 percent of our gross domestic product and has steadily increased, reaching 19.6 percent in 2007, and averaging 24.4 percent for the last three years. Obama's budget slightly reduces this rate to about 23 percent over its first few years, but then gradually increases it, ending with a rate of over 24 percent in 2021.
Given these data and the general agreement that we need to reduce our enormous deficit, Taylor asked why anyone should take seriously a budget that maintains the "spending binge" of the last three years into the indefinite future. If the federal government got along on spending of 19.6 percent just four years ago, why can't we at least reduce our spending to this level over the next 10 years? This, he points out, is precisely what the Republican House budget, devised by Rep. Paul Ryan, does. "When I show people this chart," he says, "they ask why Washington is even having the debate" over whether to prefer Obama's or Ryan's budget.
This seemed like a strong argument, but I soon learned that Taylor was getting a lot of flack from other distinguished economists such as Richard Grossman and Paul Krugman. They pointed out that almost all the increased spending in Obama's budget was due to increases in the number of people eligible for Social Security and Medicare, to expected increases in the cost of health care, and to increased interest on the debt we incurred to overcome the recent recession. The increased spending was not due to new programs but to inevitable increases in the cost of existing programs.
As with Taylor's initial argument, this seemed like a strong reply. But Taylor's responsegained back some ground. Yes, he said, "much of the increase comes in the form of mandatory spending," but Obama had the option of not continuing this spending. He chose not to seriously reform the current social welfare system (Social Security, Medicare, etc.) and instead to maintain them in a form that required large increases in spending. Ryan's budget, Taylor claims, offers reforms that enable us to significantly decrease spending on these programs. Critics responded, however, that Ryan's cost-cutting reforms have clearly unacceptable consequences, requiring, for example, many Medicare recipients to pay far more than they can afford for adequate medical care.
The argument could be pursued much further, but this is enough for my purpose, which is not to argue about the budget but to reflect on difficulties involved in arguing from the facts. The key point is that both Taylor's argument and that of his critics were based on established facts. Moreover, in each case, the facts did support the conclusions Taylor and his critics were arguing for. There was no flaw in their logical moves from premises to conclusions. How, then, could there be something wrong with their arguments?
The answer lies in a crucial distinction between deductive and inductive reasoning. In a deduction (e.g., all humans are mortal; Socrates is human; therefore, Socrates is mortal), the truth of the premises logically requires the truth of the conclusion. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Adding further premises that might seem relevant to the conclusion (e.g., Socrates is very young and there will be major medical advances before Socrates reaches old age) will make no difference to the conclusion.
In an inductive argument (e.g., Most humans do not live for 100 years; Socrates is human; therefore, Socrates will not live for 100 years), the premises only make the conclusion probable. As a result, adding further premises can alter the force of the argument. For example, if Socrates is 99 years old and in very good health, it is probable that he will live to be 100.
As is inevitable in almost all discussions of complicated political topics, Taylor and his critics are employing inductive arguments. Therefore, their reasoning is open to question simply by adducing further relevant facts such as pointing out the aging of our population and increases in medical costs, or noting that there could be serious reform of the structure of our welfare system.
Even a strong argument from purely factual premises is open to refutation unless we are assured that it has taken account of all relevant facts. Realistically, of course, we can never be sure that we have taken account of all relevant facts, especially with an issue as complex as a national budget. But a good inductive argument requires getting as close as we can to this ideal. (Even if we achieved this ideal, we might, as noted in my previous discussion of Medicare, try to reinterpret the facts in light of fundamental convictions.)
Ignoring relevant facts can give us false confidence in the strength of our positions in political debates. I put forward a barrage of indisputable facts that show, with a very high probability, that my view is correct. But you construct an equally impressive argument refuting my view. (The comments on my Medicare piece provide some good examples). Each of us may conclude that the other is irrational or ignorant. But we should beware of the sense of the inviolability of our own positions when what we really need is a serious effort to argue from all the relevant facts.

HEADLINE: Journalists Cull Questions for Obama's 'Twitter Town Hall'

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Journalists from across the country are helping generate questions for President Obama's "Twitter Town Hall." 

 BODY:
To get the conversation started for today's first Twitter Town Hall at the White House, Twitter executives turned to a handful of journalists from across the country to help generate questions about jobs and the economy for President Obama.
Dorrine Mendoza, 42, the online editor for The North County Times, a daily newspaper outside San Diego, was among the journalists invited by Twitter late last week to help find questions. "I am deeply honored to participate," she said. "I believe Twitter can be the great equalizer. It allows anyone to ask the president a question."
Ms. Mendoza said most of the questions she is getting from her Twitter followers reflect concerns from military families who live in the region and worries about the economy, expiring unemployment benefits and the California state budget, especially the impact of cuts on education.
Steven Norton, 21, editor of The Daily Tar Heel at the University of North Carolina, said he has been focused on trying to get questions from people living in the South and from college students who are wondering about job prospects after graduation."The questions that I hope will reach the president will be a lot about job trends, what jobs will be available for seniors coming out of college and what initiatives are being taken to provide job opportunities," he said.
Mr. Obama is expected to answer questions from Twitter users for about an hour, beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern time. The conversation will be displayed in real time on two gigantic screens in the East Room. Questions will be chosen in advance and during the event by Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder and executive chairman who recently returned to the company.
The event will be streamed live at http://askobama.twitter.com and http://wh.gov/live and regular updates will be posted on @townhall on Twitter.
In addition to the help from journalists, Twitter is also using its own curation tools and working with a partner, Mass Relevance, to help identify the most popular and relevant questions on the platform that use the hashtag #AskObama.
Twitter officials said they looked mostly to journalists as curators to help make sure questions reflected geographic diversity. The journalists include Kara McGuire, personal finance columnist for The Minneapolis Star Tribune; Kim Quillen, business editor of The Times-Picayune in New Orleans; and Drew Cline, editorial page editor for the New Hampshire Union Leader in Manchester.
Mr. Cline said that he was flooded with questions from Twitter users within a few hours after he made a few posts on his Twitter feed, saying he was asked to be a curator.
"It's an interesting mix of people expressing their anxieties and fears about their own economic future, people grinding axes, and people trying to ask something that might be noticed amid the deluge," said Mr. Cline who began using Twitter about two years ago.
The Twitter Town Hall is the latest effort to use social media platforms to help Mr. Obama hear from people outside of Washington, according to Macon Phillips, special assistant to the president and director of digital strategy.
Mr. Obama took questions from Marc Zuckerberg, the chief executive officer of Facebook, at the company's headquarters in California earlier this year. The event was also streamed live and the questions and answers were displayed on Facebook.
In addition to the @whitehouse Twitter account with more than two million followers, there is a @barackobama account on Twitter with nearly nine million followers. That account is now being operated by members of Mr. Obama's campaign team.
Campaign officials announced last month that Mr. Obama would post his own updates from time to time to the account, signing them - BO. So far, he is not tweeting regularly.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Prosecute

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times The Obama administration announced Tuesday that it would prosecute in civilian court a Somali man accused of ties to two Islamist militant groups. The decision to fly the man, Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, to New York for trial is likely to reignite debate about the detention and prosecution of terrorism suspects, writes Charlie Savage, who reports that Mr. Warsame was interrogated for more than two months aboard a United States naval vessel. President Obama ratcheted up pressure on Congressional Republicans on Tuesday, pledging to put popular entitlement programs like Medicare on the table in return for Republican agreement to raise some taxes. Mr. Obama, who disclosed that he met secretly with the House speaker, John A. Boehner, at the White House on Sunday to try to advance the talks, called House and Senate leaders from both parties to the White House on Thursday for further negotiations on raising the debt ceiling. While Mr. Obama did not retreat from his demand that the package contain tax increases as well as spending cuts, the pledge to put entitlement programs in play is likely to unsettle many Democrats, Mark Landler and Carl Hulse report. Over the past few days, Mitt Romney's presidential campaign has revolved around three words: "things are worse." But after being confronted by a journalist with various signs of economic improvement since the president took office, Mr. Romney replied, "I didn't say things are worse," adding, "What I said was the economy hasn't turned around." Now, Jim Rutenberg reports, Democrats are trying to use his shift in wording to raise a theme that has dogged him since his first presidential run four years ago: inconsistency. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a Republican contemplating a presidential run, is hoping to distinguish himself from the last man who ran from his state: his predecessor and onetime patron, George W. Bush. In recent years, Mr. Perry has criticized and broken politically with the former president, a move that holds potential peril and benefit for him should he decide to mount a presidential campaign, Jim Rutenberg and Jeff Zeleny report.Around the Web Once a Louisiana state representative and high-ranking member of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke may soon be a presidential contender, The Atlantic reports.Happenings Around Washington The White House will host its first Twitter Town Hall at 2 p.m. in the East Room. Jack Dorsey, Twitter co-founder and chairman, will moderate the conversation as Americans send questions to President Obama about jobs and the economy. Twitter users can submit questions using the hashtag #AskObama.

HEADLINE: Obama Takes Questions From His Tweeps

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama has begun taking questions from his Tweeps. 

 BODY:
President Obama has begun taking questions from his Tweeps.
For the first time, Twitter users are getting the chance to use their 140-character musings to direct questions at the leader of the free world.
As if to show how it's done, Mr. Obama started the questioning himself, standing behind a laptop and typing in his own query: 
in order to reduce the deficit,what costs would you cut and what investments would you keep - boless than a minute ago via web FavoriteRetweetReplyThe White House
whitehouse
But if Mr. Obama thought he'd get a free ride with easy-going questions, he was sorely mistaken.
The first question was whether he should have done anything differently to help the economy. Mr. Obama offered two suggestions: to better explain to the public about how long it would take for the economy to improve; and to do more to deal with the housing market.
Before the event started, Republicans in Washington seized the opportunity to flood Twitter with their own politically tinged questions, using the social network to push their critique of Mr. Obama's handling of the economy, one blurb at a time.
"With 9.1% unemployment & 'shovel ready' jobs a bust, will you admit the 'stimulus' was a mistake?" House Speaker John A. Boehner tweeted.
Mr. Boehner was followed by a steady stream of those questions from his fellow Republicans and his supporters in the Twitter universe. By the time Mr. Obama started his town hall, hundreds of such questions had flooded in.
The potential questions for the president also included many that he would not be likely to be asked during a typical news conference.
"Why is your administration insisting on prosecuting those who cultivate/distribute medical marijuana for sick people?," one person asked.
Another sought to get Mr. Obama on the record on "Harry Potter" versus "The Lord of the Rings." "If Dumbledore & Gandalf battled Voldemort & Sauron, who do you think would win and wouldn't it be awesome?" the Twitter member asked
Will any of those questions actually be put to Mr. Obama? Stay tuned and we'll find out.

HEADLINE: Romney Holds London Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: RAVI SOMAIYA


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney traveled to London to "meet with some friends," but also to raise money from American expatriates. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- Mitt Romney told reporters outside a lavish town house in the heart of the upscale Mayfair neighborhood on Wednesday evening that he was "meeting a few friends" while in London. The invitation from his campaign to attend an evening reception, on a street where a house was listed recently for $26 million, was more candid: "Suggested contribution to Romney for President: $2,500 per person."
The event's co-chairmen and co-chairwomen included the hedge fund billionaire Louis Bacon, the New York Jets owner Woody Johnson and two dozen others, mostly drawn from London's still-booming financial sector. The perfectly coiffed guests were deposited by a series of sleek limousines.
Mr. Romney, the Republican former governor of Massachusetts, is not the first presidential candidate to tap into the pool of wealthy American expatriates living in London (donations from foreign citizens are prohibited). While a candidate in 2008, Barack Obama attended a fund-raiser at the home of Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, at which the actress Gwyneth Paltrow was among the "event chairs." On the Republican side, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and Senator John McCain of Arizona also took over illustrious addresses in and around the capital for an evening's fund-raising during that campaign.
"We're in an era where presidential candidates are seeking out every dollar they can, wherever they can find it," said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a group that advocates for campaign finance reform. Now that the practice has been established, he said, candidates will probably continue to go "where the money is." 
The event was held on the same day that Mr. Romney's campaign released its fund-raising totals for the second quarter. Mr. Romney reported raising $18.25 million, with $12.6 million on hand, far outpacing his rivals for the nomination.
A statement about the reception from the Romney campaign referred to his support among "Americans living abroad," and touched on issues like the weak economy and slow job market in the United States, but did not mention fund-raising outright.
Outside the event, as he buttoned his dark suit, Mr. Romney told reporters that he was in London for meetings with officials. He met Wednesday with former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, as well as Britain's minister of defense, Liam Fox, with whom, he said, he discussed "global affairs."
A British government official who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting said Mr. Romney would also be meeting with Britain's national security adviser, Peter Ricketts, and other officials Thursday afternoon. Prime Minister David Cameron "might stop by," the official said, though there were no concrete plans for the two men to meet.
Though a spokesman declined to say whether Mr. Romney would return to Britain for further events, Mr. Wertheimer said he suspected that he and others seeking the White House in 2012 would be back. "If the money is there to be raised," he said, "I would expect them to try and raise it."
But even in Britain, competition among the Republican field is fierce. The Boston Globe reported last week that Mr. Romney's Wednesday evening fund-raiser was to have been held at the home of the financier Evelyn de Rothschild and his wife, Lynn Forester de Rothschild. That is, until Mrs. Rothschild held a fund-raiser in her New York home -- for Mr. Romney's rival Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah. Mrs. Rothschild told The Globe that they had raised $1.2 million.

HEADLINE: For Obama, Brevity Is Not the Soul of Twitter

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The questions are brief, but not the answers, in President Obama's social-media town hall. 

 BODY:
The one thing that President Obama's Twitter town hall was not? A test of his ability to answer in 140 characters.
For more than an hour, Mr. Obama took questions sent in via Twitter, but answered them the old fashioned way -- verbally.
Questions came over Twitter, submitted with the hashtag #AskObama. But they were read aloud by Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder and executive chairman, and answered by Mr. Obama as if he were being interviewed for a television news broadcast.
For Mr. Obama, that meant answers of hundreds, even thousands of characters -- a clear violation of basic Twitter etiquette, if not the specific rules of Wednesday's town hall format.
It was clear from the early questions that Mr. Obama had no intention of trying to squeeze his answers down. He began his response to a question about the debt ceiling with a phrase that accurately suggested a lengthy answer.
"Let, me as quickly as I can, describe what's at stake with the debt ceiling," he started, and then started the rest of his answer with, "Historically..."
It took a while.
The questions focused primarily on economic factors, a reflection, Mr. Dorsey said, of the large interest in that subject among Twitter followers.
One asked about clean energy and jobs. Another asked what Mr. Obama would do differently, prompting an answer from the president about the difficulty of resolving the housing crisis. Several tweets followed up on the housing issue, urging the president to do more to help people in trouble with their mortgages.
"Most of this is going to be a function of the market slowly improving as people start having confidence in the economy," Mr. Obama said in response to a question about the free market and housing. "Given the size of the housing market, no federal program is going to be able to solve the housing market."
Somehow among the tens of thousands of regular Americans, a couple of especially non-regular people got to ask questions.
House Speaker John A. Boehner got to ask Mr. Obama "where are the jobs," a question that he probably put to the president during a previously secret meeting at the White House over the weekend.
"Obviously, John's the speaker of the house," Mr. Obama said, smiling. "He's a Republican and so, this is a slightly skewed question. But what he's right about is that we have not seen fast enough job growth relative to the need."
And then there was a question from Nicholas D. Kristof, a columnist for The New York Times, who asked why Mr. Obama did not get Republicans to agree to an increase in the nation's debt limit during budget talks at the end of last year.
Mr. Obama called Mr. Kristof "a great columnist," but added gently that "that wasn't the deal that was available."
Some ordinary Twitter followers were not happy at questions being posed by the powerful and well-connected.
"Kristof & Boehner questions poor judgment," said one Twitter message. "Do NYT reporters and Speaker of the House have too little access to POTUS?"
Most of the Twitter queries were not very tough-minded and gave the president the opportunity to repeat his talking points.
He answered several questions about taxes by saying that millionaires and billionaires should be willing to see their taxes go up. He listed his administration's efforts to help small businesses. And he talked about trying to help veterans coming back from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan find jobs at home.
At the beginning of the hour, Mr. Obama offered his own question, asking Twitter followers how they thought the government should help reduce the deficit. The answers were fairly predictable.
Several suggested cuts in defense spending and ethanol subsidies. They said the government should keep spending on education, and they offered that Mr. Obama should stop sending money to corrupt governments. One suggested ending welfare programs.
For the most part, Mr. Obama agreed, though he defended the government's role in helping people and said defense spending should be cut carefully.
In the end, Mr. Obama's questions were pretty typical. 
But one thing that did change: the length of the questions. Washington is a town where reporters are famous for their sometimes rambling, three-part questions during presidential news conferences. Maybe if they had to ask their questions in 140 characters, more questions could be asked.

HEADLINE: Social Media Take on Role of Presidential Questioner

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: New media companies are taking on roles that used to be the sole province of the traditional news organizations. 

 BODY:
The decision by President Obama to participate in Wednesday's first Twitter town hall meeting, live from the East Room, is a reminder that the White House is eager to exploit whatever technologies will help get out his message, unfiltered.
But the forum, an hourlong "conversation" between the president and millions of Twitter users, is also remarkable for the ways in which new media companies are taking on roles that used to be the sole province of traditional news organizations.
And it raises interesting questions for everyone involved: Are the hosts from the social media companies journalists? Do the companies involved, which all lobby the federal government, have a reason to shape the conversation? Are the questions posed by Twitter followers -- and trending on the social media service -- a better representation of what people want to hear from Mr. Obama than those asked by reporters at last week's news conference?
In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, made it clear that Mr. Obama's advisers believe that the exchanges are valuable.
"We've entered a different information age, where people get news and information in a different way than they did in the past," Mr. Pfeiffer said. "If you're going to communicate with the broad public, it is no longer sufficient to simply do it through traditional mainstream media."
He added: "You have to go beyond that because people are getting their information in different ways and from different sources. And we're always on the lookout for ways to have a productive interaction with the public in new and exciting ways." 
The Twitter town hall meeting is just the latest example of the new political reality for politicians like Mr. Obama. 
In April, Mr. Obama sat down with the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for a similar exchange that featured questions from Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook users. In January, Mr. Obama answered questions from YouTube users in a forum sponsored by Google. 
On Wednesday, the president will answer questions submitted during the past several days from Twitter users. The conversation, to be asked in 140 characters or less but answered in Mr. Obama's typically extended manner, will be moderated by Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey.
Hoping to avoid any accusations that the White House is managing the news, Mr. Pfeiffer and other aides repeatedly noted that questions would be selected in part by 10 Twitter users around the country who were picked by the company.
Those "superusers" will help cull through the thousands of questions to pick the ones put to Mr. Obama. The company will also use its own filters, officials said.
"That's all Twitter," said Macon Phillips, the director of digital strategy for the White House. "So Twitter came up with a list of people that they felt had good geographic distribution and that they could include in their process of identifying popular themes and representative questions." 
The real change may not be in the desire of the White House to use any means possible to advance its agenda. Throughout Washington, political figures are turning to Twitter as a way to get formal -- and less formal -- information to their supporters and adversaries.
But the social media companies are now becoming a competitor of sorts to the more traditional means of putting the president on the spot -- the on-camera interview by a network anchor, the yelled-out questions by a reporter at an event or the full-blown news conference in the East Room.
The social media companies are now firmly established as an alternative means of getting a president to respond to the big -- or maybe not so big -- questions of the day. Rather than being up to a journalist or blogger, the direction of the questioning will be largely guided by the broader interests of the Twitter community.
That's not to say that the traditional political establishment is about to let the questions meander wherever the Twitter users might want them to go. Republicans took to the online service on Wednesday morning, offering tough questions for Mr. Obama on the economy.
"Under 8 years of George W. Bush, the unemployment rate was never above 7.3%," the conservative blogger Jim Geraghty proposed as a question. "When will it be that low again?"
House Speaker John A. Boehnersuggested: "Will you outline a plan #4jobs - other than more spending - for the American people?" He helpfully included a link to jobs.gop.gov, where House Republicans have detailed their proposals.
And Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a Republican presidential hopeful, suggested that Mr. Obama be asked, "Where are the jobs?"
Will he? 
That's up to Mr. Dorsey, the 10 Twitter users who are culling the questions, and the broader online universe of millions of Twitter users.
It's a new world.
An earlier version of this post misidentified the number of Twitter users who will moderate questions posed to President Obama on Wednesday. It is 10, not 20.

HEADLINE: Fewer Americans File for Bankruptcy as Debt Woes Ease

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
After steadily climbing for several years, the number of Americans filing for bankruptcy is on the decline, though that is not necessarily an indicator of an improving economy.
The number of bankruptcy filings in June was 120,623, or an average of 5,483 a day, a drop of 6.2 percent from May, when filings totaled 122,775, or 5,846 a day, according to a report from Epiq Systems, which tracks bankruptcy filings. There was one additional day to file in June compared with May. Average daily filings are down nearly 10 percent from June of last year.
Though economic factors like foreclosures and unemployment play a role in bankruptcy, over the long run, the filing rate tends to be more closely tethered to the amount of outstanding consumer debt. 
Access to credit, however, can influence the bankruptcy rate over the shorter term: as lenders tighten their standards, filings tend to rise because struggling consumers can no longer rely on credit cards or other loans to get them through a rough period. But when more new loans are being made, filings tend to fall -- at least for a while.
''There is a lot of mythology about what drives bankruptcy rates,'' said Robert M. Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law who specializes in bankruptcy. ''But consumer credit appears to be the most significant indicator.''
Over all, he said he expected filings to decline 5 to 10 percent this year, leveling off at about 1.46 million, largely because consumers have slightly more access to credit now than in recent years. But he also said that consumers had taken on less debt in the past three years, which means there is less debt to discharge and fewer incentives to file bankruptcy.
That estimate compares with about 1.56 million bankruptcy filings in 2010 and nearly 1.45 million in 2009. Filings surpassed two million in 2005, when many people rushed to declare bankruptcy before a new law went into effect that made it more difficult, and significantly more expensive, to file.
There have been 731,237 filings this year. ''If they keep going the way they were,'' Professor Lawless said, ''bankruptcy filings will keep going down a little bit.''
So far this year, the vast majority of the bankruptcy cases -- nearly 70 percent -- were Chapter 7 filings, which provide individuals with the proverbial ''fresh start'' because their debts are forgiven. (To qualify, filers need to pass a means test to determine whether they are unable to repay their debts.)
In contrast, a Chapter 13 filing requires individuals to use their disposable income to pay back a portion of their debts through a three- or five-year repayment plan. Some people choose Chapter 13 because it allows them to save their primary homes from foreclosure, though they are required to catch up on their mortgage payments. Slightly more than 27 percent were Chapter 13 filings. (The remainder were mostly commercial filings.) The overall split between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 filings is consistent with last year's ratio.
While the overall number of bankruptcy filings was down last month, there were variations from state to state. For instance, filings in Georgia rose 13 percent and were up 33 percent in Delaware, compared with May. But filings in Wyoming fell 30 percent, in South Dakota 21 percent, in West Virginia 18 percent and in Wisconsin 17 percent.
In both New York and New Jersey, the number of bankruptcy cases dropped by 5 percent.

HEADLINE: Looking for a Pool and Coming Up Dry as Cities Shave Budgets

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; Malia Wollan contributed reporting from Sacramento, and Ian Lovett from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
SACRAMENTO -- On a recent balmy afternoon in Sacramento, 10-year-old Olivia Rios stared at her local swimming hole and fondly remembered a summer in the not-so-distant past when there wasn't a ''Pool Closed'' sign outside.
''We would go swim every single day,'' said Olivia, sitting behind by a wire fence near a ''Keep Out'' notice. ''And we'd get there the next day when it opens.''
There are few things in life more doleful than a child looking at a closed pool on a steamy summer day, and yet that sad scene has become as common as sunburns and mosquito bites as struggling local governments make the painful choice to shut their pools to save the budget. The list of locales where public pools have been in jeopardy in recent years includes some of the sweatiest spots in the nation, including Central Florida (90s and humid on the Fourth), Atlanta (90), and Houston (97). 
And while corporate and nonprofit white knights sometimes appear at the last minute to salvage at least some of the summer, some say that the age of free dips on the public dime is increasingly endangered.
''There's some people treading water,'' said Bill Beckner, the research manager for the National Recreation and Park Association, and some people who are sinking.''
And some who have managed to adapt and survive. In Phoenix, where the forecast called for a high of 108 degrees on Wednesday, officials have shuttered a quarter of the city's 29 pools in each of the past three years -- but managed to use a new tax to pay for refurbishing. That will allow all the city's pools to reopen next year, basically brand new.
Rick Naimark, the deputy city manager, said it was only a recent bump in other revenues that made the plan work. ''If the budget this year had continued to deteriorate, we would have had to cut back,'' Mr. Naimark said.
While Memorial Day was long considered opening day for public pools in many spots, that holiday now often comes and goes without so much as a game of Marco Polo.
The substantial expenses that accompany public water holes, including lifeguards, training and insurance, often make them ''low-hanging fruit'' for officials looking for budget fixes, Mr. Beckner said, particularly during the winter negotiations when no one worries about the pool being open. Likewise, public pools are usually used only during the summer, making them an even easier target for bean-counters.
''The bottom line is they are only open three months a year,'' said Joe Turner, the director of Parks and Recreation in Houston. ''It's not good, bad or indifferent. It's just a question of how do you affect the most lives.''
Mr. Turner's department has faced some of its own problems in recent months. Budget shortfalls forced the city to keep some pools closed earlier this summer, a situation remedied only after Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, helped persuade a pair of petroleum giants -- Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips -- to underwrite the pools and a group of community centers.
But such generosity cannot always be counted on. In Pasco County, Fla., which is just north of Tampa, officials were able to stave off a pool closing last year with the help of a nonprofit group, despite declining property tax revenues. This year, however, that well -- and the pool -- ran dry.
Officials in other urban centers -- including Atlanta, Cincinnati and Philadelphia -- have also had to close pools, cut back hours or seek alternative financing in recent years. Baltimore counts more than 40 public pools of various sizes (and depths, including wading pools), but has most operating on limited schedules this summer, including some so-called ''walk-to pools,'' often in poorer areas.
The question of where pools are closed often raises issues of class and race. In the case of Houston, one of the pools closed in June was in Independence Heights, a historically black neighborhood where the median household income in 2009 was about $27,000, according to city statistics.
The city councilman for the area, Ed Gonzalez, said the loss of a pool there would sting worse than in more well-to-do neighborhoods. ''There are no other true community assets out there,'' he said. ''Your neighborhood park and your pools are the only real amenities that some of these communities have.''
Mr. Gonzalez, a former police officer, said it was not just a matter of letting people beat the heat. The lack of a local pool, he said, could have an impact on public safety. ''If kids do not have a productive thing to do, like swimming or community centers to go to,'' he said, ''it's more idle time they have on their hands.''
At the same time, public pools are often being asked to do more: in Santa Rosa, Calif., for example, north of San Francisco, the list of activities offered is almost longer than the snack bar menu, including lessons, lap swim, scuba, dive team, water polo and kayak practice. And that does not even include lifeguard training.
Indeed, concerns about liability mean better-trained lifeguards than in decades past, said Mr. Beckner of the recreation and parks association, adding to the cost of running pools. Not to mention making the job kind of a bummer. ''You can't sit around talking to the girls anymore,'' Mr. Beckner said. ''You actually have to do your job.''
But the biggest enemy of the public pool still seems to be the budget knife. In Sacramento, where the high hit 100 degrees on Independence Day, the city has only 13 pools in operation -- including some kiddy pools -- down from 21 just four years ago.
Terri Matal, the aquatic supervisor with the Sacramento Parks and Recreation Department, called the closings painful, particularly in an area hit hard by the recession, the foreclosure crisis, high gas prices and cutbacks in state government.
''We especially need them with people being out of work and not even able to drive somewhere for a little recreation,'' said Ms. Matal. ''People are like, 'Wait, I'm on furlough and the pool isn't open?' ''
At James Mangan Park, a leafy, well-used patch sitting amid middle-class ranch homes, the pool grounds are locked, but the pool itself is still full of clear blue water. That was the sight that taunted Olivia Rios and her friend Jahvae Hicks, 12. ''I hate that it's closed,'' Jahvae said.
Olivia, meanwhile, said her 11th birthday was coming up this month and that she had looked at the weather forecast.
''It's about to get really hot here,'' she said. ''I want a pool party.''
Correction: July 20, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on July 7 about the closing of public pools nationwide because of budget cuts referred incorrectly to the operation of New York City pools in recent years. While the city proposed pool closings in its last two budgets, funds were ultimately provided and all pools were able to remain open; it is not the case that the city had to close pools, cut back hours or seek alternative financing as did several other major cities.

HEADLINE: U.S. Backs Project to Produce Fuel From Corn Waste

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Energy Department plans to provide a $105 million loan guarantee for the expansion of an ethanol factory in Emmetsburg, Iowa, that intends to make motor fuel from corncobs, leaves and husks.
Experts say that the new factory, being built by POET, a major producer of ethanol derived from corn kernels, could be the first commercial-scale plant to make ethanol from a nonfood, or cellulosic, plant source. However, POET would first have to overcome technical hurdles in scaling up its production from the current pilot project, which processes one ton of plant matter per day, to a plant capable of processing 700 tons of biomass a day. High volume is necessary to make cellulosic ethanol competitive with the corn-based version.
Commercial production of ethanol from waste products like husks is the holy grail of the ethanol industry, and other companies have stumbled in their quest to achieve that goal. 
The loan guarantee for POET is the first by the Energy Department for cellulosic ethanol. But the Department of Agriculture announced $405 million in loan guarantees in January. Coskata, a company backed in part by General Motors and by Khosla Ventures, got a guarantee for $250 million for a plant in Boligee, Ala., that will convert household waste and other materials into ethanol. Enerkem, which is based in Montreal, got an $80 million guarantee for a plant in Pontotoc, Miss. Ineos Bio got a $75 million guarantee for a biorefinery in Vero Beach, Fla.
If celluosic ethanol could be produced in an economical fashion, it would vastly increase the American potential to make motor vehicle fuel and reduce use of fossil fuels. It could reduce the use of corn in the manufacture of ethanol as a motor fuel, which is criticized for reducing food supplies for people and animals.
POET's corncob plant is intended to make all the energy it needs to operate and to supply some energy to the conventional corn ethanol plant next door.
The company's pilot plant, in Scotland, S.D., has been running since 2008 and converts a ton of cobs, husks and leaves, a day into 75 to 80 gallons of ethanol.
''Our ultimate target is to be competitive with corn ethanol and gasoline,'' said Jeff Lautt, president of POET. ''Coming out of the gate, no one would expect it to be of equal cost.''
Today, the pilot plant is producing ethanol at a cost of $2.50 to $3 a gallon, which is at least 50 cents a gallon higher than the price of ethanol from corn, according to Mr. Lautt.
Because of federal mandates that fuel blenders use a certain amount of ''advanced cellulosic biofuels,'' blenders will pay extra for the ethanol from cellulose.
The waste parts of corn plants, called stover, are steamed and treated with acid, and then broken down by enzymes into ordinary sugar and a second sugar with one fewer carbon atom. Both are converted by yeast into alcohol, but persuading the yeast to eat the second sugar requires altering its DNA.
Cellulosic ethanol becomes more cost-competitive as the price of corn rises because the price of stover is typically more stable. The fuel also becomes more attractive as the price of natural gas rises, since corn ethanol plants use that fuel in copious amounts.
POET operates 27 corn-to-ethanol plants. The Energy Department hopes that if the technology for using stover is successful in Iowa, it will be expanded to other plants.
The loan guarantee does not ensure that POET will have a commercial-scale plant running before the others, but it ''puts POET in the pole position to be first,'' said Brooke Coleman, executive director of the Advanced Ethanol Council, a trade association.
Abengoa, a Spanish alternative energy company, is developing a plant in southwest Kansas that will make ethanol from crop waste. Fulcrum Bioenergy, of Pleasanton, Calif., is working on a plant near Reno, Nev., to convert municipal trash to ethanol.
Previous attempts to build commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plants have failed. For example, Range Fuels developed a federally subsidized working prototype in an industrial park near Denver and broke ground on a commercial-scale plant in Soperton, Ga., where it planned to use pine chips as feedstock. But the company ran into technical problems.
Jonathan Silver, the executive director of the Energy Department's loan guarantee program, said POET's technology was ''much less complicated'' than some of the other entries.
While the Obama administration has been pushing a broad array of renewable energy projects, the ones in the electricity field, including solar and wind power, have shown more progress toward technical feasibility and market competitiveness than the programs to replace gasoline with batteries or liquid fuels made from nonfood sources.
However, Mr. Silver said that he believed that cellulosic ethanol technology was moving in the right direction.
''It's not as mature as solar is, but one of the goals of this loan guarantee program is to bring all these various energy-sector technologies forward as fast as we can.''

HEADLINE: A Wave of Chinese Money Gives a Lift to Companies Struggling in Tough Times

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

 BODY:
Chinese investment in American companies rose to $5 billion in 2010, but that may be only the beginning of a tidal wave of direct Chinese investment in American businesses, according to a recent report that envisions another $1 trillion to $2 trillion of Chinese overseas investment this decade.
The report, commissioned by the Asia Society and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, outlines the change in China's priorities from attracting foreign investment to becoming a global purveyor of capital. While China has been investing to develop natural resources in Australia, Africa and elsewhere for years, the coming wave is different. It reflects China's intention to expand its already enormous but still growing domestic market. To do so, Chinese companies that have mastered manufacturing must develop their distribution, marketing and innovation skills, all areas where American businesses could help.
While there is some concern that political tensions could get in the way, the investment money is a huge opportunity for American businesses. The following four small businesses, already the beneficiaries of such investments, illustrate the aims of Chinese investors and the benefits that American companies can take from them -- including rescue from a very tough economy. 
Solar Power Inc., of Roseville, Calif., received a $33 million investment in March from LDK Solar, a large Chinese manufacturer of solar cells. The American company, now seven years old and with 60 employees, installs solar arrays on commercial buildings, including on the roofs of Staples Center and the 20th Century Fox movie studios in Los Angeles. Solar Power initially focused on the United States residential market but that market collapsed in the recession. In 2010 the company's sales declined to about $24 million and its losses increased.
So Stephen C. Kircher, Solar Power's founder and chief executive, turned to commercial projects and attracted LDK Solar's investment in exchange for 70 percent ownership of Solar Power. Mr. Kircher had met LDK executives in China through two California financial institutions, Roth Capital Partners in Newport Beach and East West Bank in Pasadena.
''LDK Solar's investment will allow us to compete for many projects across the United States, not just one job at a time,'' Mr. Kircher said. Indeed, Solar Power recently won a three-year job to provide engineering on solar energy projects in New York and New Jersey.
Why did LDK, which has $3.6 billion in annual sales of solar energy components, buy into Solar Power? ''Their aim is to employ Chinese people,'' Mr. Kircher said. ''They will integrate their manufacturing with marketing and distribution on our solar panel projects and then have the know-how to help them in the emerging domestic economy in China.''
MVP RV of Riverside, Calif., a maker of recreational vehicles, was able to reopen its doors this year thanks to a big order and significant investment from Winston Battery of Shenzhen, China. Brad B. Williams, Roger J. Humeston, and Pablo Carmona had purchased MVP, a motor home and travel trailer operation, in July 2008 from their employer, Thor Industries. At that time, MVP had 440 employees and close to $100 million in sales, Mr. Williams said.
Two months later, the recession began and demand for recreational vehicles collapsed. Gradually, employees were laid off, and the company closed its factory ''to preserve capital,'' Mr. Williams said.
''We went through more than 40 presentations trying to raise capital, with no luck,'' Mr. Williams said. ''But then we got a call from somebody asking us to visit Winston Battery in Shenzhen.'' There the partners met Winston Chung, an entrepreneur whose company makes lithium ion batteries. ''We hit it off immediately,'' Mr. Williams said.
Mr. Chung gave MVP an order for a few motor homes that got the company working again. Then early this year, Winston Battery gave MVP a $5 billion order for 10,000 motor homes -- which can cost from $100,000 apiece to more than $1 million -- and 20,000 smaller vehicles over the next three years.
The Chinese company also began an investment ''that will ultimately amount to $310 million, making Mr. Chung the majority owner of our company,'' Mr. Williams said. As a result, he added, the original partners will have ''a smaller piece of a bigger pie.''
The company is now back up to 250 employees and plans to take on about 1,000 more in the next few years. ''We are building prototypes for the China market now,'' Mr. Williams said. The recreational vehicles on order will be diesel-powered, he said, ''but we will work with Winston Battery to develop electric-powered vehicles in the next few years.''
Synthesis Energy Systems, of Houston, recently got an $84 million investment from Zhongjixuan Investment Management, of Beijing, which will assist Synthesis in developing new ventures in China. Synthesis Energy was introduced to Zhongjixuan Investment, also known as ZJX, through a Chinese business associate who helped arrange a gas-from-coal energy project in China in 2006.
Synthesis holds a license for a coal gasification process that can upgrade the efficiency of burning low-quality coals while reducing toxic gas emissions. It was formed in 2004 to spread the use of a combustion process developed by the nonprofit Gas Technology Institute. Its revenue, from two projects in China, reached $4.5 million for the fiscal half year that ended last December, with a loss of $7.4 million, down from a $16 million loss in the comparable 2009 period.
''The real value lies in participation in the success of projects,'' said Robert W. Rigdon, president of Synthesis, ''but that demands a lot of capital.''
So he agreed in March to sell 43 percent of Synthesis Energy to ZJX. The hope is that a coal-burning technology developed partly in research at the United States Department of Energy can help China produce clean electricity from its vast reserves of low-quality coal. Mr. Rigdon said he was aware that considerable intellectual property -- the coal-burning technology -- could be at risk, given the history of Chinese companies' use of foreign technology without regard to patents.
''That's true,'' Mr. Rigdon said, ''but I think the intellectual capital is now safer because of our partnership with ZJX, which has extensive connections, both government and private, in China.''
Pansun's Inc. is a maker and distributor of women's and men's sportswear and fashion apparel that was formed by Yu Ming Pan, president of Shanghai Tiqiao Textile and Yarn Dyeing, and Stacy Sun, a business consultant in Los Angeles who came from China a dozen years ago. They pooled $5 million in 2009 to start Pansun's and to make equity investments in American design firms that had established their brands with retail chains.
''The designers' merchandise was already in major retailers like Saks and Bloomingdale's, Dillard's and Nordstrom's,'' Ms. Sun said. ''Our idea was that because of our financial strength from China, we could offer the chains assurances of a long-term supplier and good terms on inventory and returns.''
Along with reassuring the chains, Pansun's would also help the designers. ''We give each design house $1 million a year for marketing,'' she said. One designer, Eric Niccoli, founder of Orthodox -- a company that designs youthful fashions for men and women -- has worked under a licensing agreement with Pansun's for the last year and is negotiating the sale to it of a 50 percent stake in his company. ''They are learning how to build a brand and they have a long-term vision,'' Mr. Niccoli said.
That vision is to build a large clothing distribution and retail company with more than $100 million in revenue in the United States and Latin America. In so doing, Ms. Sun explained, the company's principals will expand the market for Chinese manufacturing and acquire knowledge of branding and distribution, ultimately looking to create a large apparel company in their home country. ''Our final destination is China,'' Ms. Sun said.

HEADLINE: Services Sector Trimmed Growth in June

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The pace of growth in the services sector of the United States economy dipped modestly in June, while prices paid for services fell sharply to their lowest level since August 2010, according to an industry report released Wednesday.
The Institute for Supply Managementsaid its services index fell to 53.3 points last month from 54.6 in May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. The reading fell shy of economists' forecasts of 54.0, according to a Reuters survey.
The prices-paid index tumbled to 60.9 points from 69.6 in May, while new orders eased to 53.6 from 56.8.

HEADLINE: Homes Dark and Lifeless, Kept by Out-of-Towners

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
New Yorkers who stay in town during summer and holiday weekends know the empty-streets, Potemkin-village look that parts of the city take on.
But some Manhattan neighborhoods are assuming that vacant feeling the year round, because the people who own or rent apartments there actually live somewhere else most of the time. This explains why, in a city of bright lights, so many windows dotting the imposing facades of Fifth, Madison and Park Avenue apartment buildings are pitch dark every evening.
Wealthy out-of-towners have always had pieds-a-terre and unused investment properties in the city. What is new is how many.
In a large swath of the East Side bounded by Fifth and Park Avenues and East 49th and 70th Streets, about 30 percent of the more than 5,000 apartments are routinely vacant more than 10 months a year because their owners or renters have permanent homes elsewhere, according to the Census Bureau's latest American Community Survey. 
In one part of that stretch, between East 53rd and 59th Streets, more than half of the 500 apartments are occupied for two months or less. That is a higher proportion than in resort and second-home communities like Aspen, Colo.; Palm Beach, Fla.; Virginia Beach; and Litchfield, Conn.
And the ranks of part-timers are growing. Since 2000, the number of Manhattan apartments occupied by absentee owners and renters swelled by more than 70 percent, to nearly 34,000, from 19,000. They proliferated in virtually every census tract south of 110th Street, with the most pronounced surges in the East Village, SoHo, Greenwich Village, Gramercy Park, Midtown East and the Upper East Side.
''My block is like a ghost town,'' said Gay Talese, the author and keen urban observer, who has lived on East 61st off Park Avenue for a half-century. ''It's dark on this street at night, and I'm not talking about summer people in the Hamptons and people who have apartments here but spend a lot of time out of town for tax reasons.''
He described the part-timers as ''skim-milk New Yorkers -- only 2 percent.''
Reasons abound. The construction of luxury housing, especially condominiums, has exploded in the last decade, and the market for high-end apartments has rebounded. Manhattan continues to attract foreign investors seeking a haven.
More out-of-towners contemplating retirement in the city are trying Manhattan on for size, with an apartment they visit now and then. Globalization has more executives sleeping less often in what is ostensibly their hometown. And many New Yorkers have long spent most of their time elsewhere and claimed permanent domicile there to avoid the city's higher resident income tax.
Some other cities are concerned that too many out-of-towners buying up desirable homes will deaden neighborhoods and deplete any street life: Charleston, S.C., has subjected second homes to higher property taxes than primary residences. New York City does not, taxing second and permanent homes at the same rate, but a state tribunal this year suggested that city apartments owned by commuters could be included in the definition of a permanent abode, subjecting them to New York taxes even on income earned out of state.
Still, fears of creating dead zones have been muted in Manhattan, where congestion routinely trumps desolation as an urban crisis and where, as a result, some residents actually prefer the sense of solitude.
''I love getting up in the morning and seeing Park Avenue empty,'' said Abby Leigh, an artist who lives with her husband, Mitch, the composer and real estate developer, on East 68th Street.
Among all of the 845,000 apartments and houses in Manhattan, 102,000 were identified as vacant in the 2005-9 American Community Survey. Of those, about 33,000 -- or about 1 in every 25 Manhattan homes -- had an owner or renter who lived there less than two months of the year.
The proportion of part-time apartments in the borough peaked at nearly 4 in 10 in 2007, then dipped with the recession and has been rising again.
Trump Tower, at Fifth Avenue and East 56th Street, is in many ways typical of the trend. Rhona Graff, vice president of the Trump Organization, estimates that only about half of those who own the building's 263 apartments live there full time.
''It's a good mix, but primarily Europeans, South Americans, Asians and, of course, Americans,'' she said. ''I would say the vast majority of these people are active in business, although there are some retirees.''
Whether such a building seems half empty or half full depends on the dweller.
''Some people might feel they rather live in a building with more of a social environment,'' said Gary Malin, president of Citi Habitats, a real estate brokerage firm. ''Other people might say, 'Less people in my building means less wear and tear on the facilities.' ''
Among the latter is Michael Gross, who wrote the book ''740 Park,'' about one of those apartment buildings, he explained, where every owner ''has five homes'' someplace else.
''It's lovely,'' said Mr. Gross, who lives on a block of West 58th Street where about 1 in 6 people lives only part time. ''A fully staffed building, empty elevators and you never run out of hot water.''
Co-ops are typically more likely to limit the number of pieds-a-terre than condominiums. ''They're not looking for people who are going to treat their apartments like a hotel and let friends come and go,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group Real Estate.
Mr. Malin said apartments have gained appeal as investments, ''with hotel rates being as crazy as they are and rental rates going through the roof.''
''A lot of foreign buyers are coming in,'' he said. ''They think the finances make sense. An apartment is more convenient than a hotel, and they would rather have the investment.''
Because some people have mixed feelings about sparsely occupied buildings, agents and owners are often reluctant to publicly reveal their full-time population. The proportion at the Excelsior at 303 East 57th Street is probably about the same as Trump Tower's, said Elayne Reimer, executive vice president of Halstead Property. So is 470 Park's at East 58th Street, another broker said.
Doormen know. So do mail carriers. And building superintendents.
A few years ago, a leak in an apartment at Olympic Tower, on Fifth Avenue at 51st Street, caused $500,000 in damage to several apartments below it. A building newsletter noted that the mess ''could have been completely avoided if a set of working keys for that apartment were maintained'' at the concierge desk.
The notice did not say, however, whether the apartment was occupied full time. But another notice advised residents, ''If you do not plan to receive mail at the apartment, please specify where monthly common charge bill and correspondence should go.''

HEADLINE: Neon on the Racks, Not in the Window

BYLINE: By ERICA M. BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
WITH Thug Mama, her newly opened boutique in Willliamsburg, JoAnn Berman brings a sense of old-school flavor to the neighborhood. In the early '90s, Ms. Berman was known for designing costumes for hip-hop stars like Salt-n-Pepa and A Tribe Called Quest, as well as a rapper then known as Puff Daddy. That was when she acquired her moniker. ''I was a gangster rapper designer of the '90s, and we loved bling-bling,'' she said. ''All the kids on the block called me Thug Mama.'' 
Ms. Berman, a native New Yorker who learned sustainability from punks in '70s London (''Punks work with what they have,'' she said), worked in animation for several years before opening a store in 2006 that mysteriously burned down and another, three years later, that didn't survive the recession. At the new shop, her one-of-a-kind summer dresses made from vibrant vintage materials are very much in tune with the print-happy season. She has also amassed an impressive collection of '60s platforms and vintage accessories. But it's the neon screen prints and splatter paint on everything from totes and T-shirts to furniture that make the shop a real trip.

HEADLINE: As Plastic Reigns, Printing of Money Slows

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The number of dollar bills rolling off the great government presses here and in Fort Worth fell to a modern low in the last fiscal year. Production of $5 bills also dropped to the lowest level in 30 years. And for the first time in that period, the Treasury Department did not print any $10 bills.
The meaning seems clear. The future is here. Cash is in decline.
You can't use it for online purchases, nor on many airplanes to buy snacks or duty-free goods. Last year, 36 percent of taxi fares in New York were paid with plastic. At Commerce, a restaurant in the West Village in Manhattan, the bar menus read, ''Credit cards only. No cash please. Thank you.'' 
There is no definitive data on all of this. Cash transactions are notoriously hard to track, in part because people use cash when they do not want to be tracked. But a simple ratio is illuminating. In 1970, at the dawn of plastic payment, the value of United States currency in domestic circulation equaled about 5 percent of the nation's economic activity. Last year, the value of currency in domestic circulation equaled about 2.5 percent of economic activity.
''This morning I bought a gallon of milk for $2.50 at a Mobil station, and I paid with my credit card,'' said Tony Zazula, co-owner of Commerce restaurant, who spoke with a reporter while traveling in upstate New York. ''I do carry a little cash, but only for gratuities.''
It is easy to look down the slope of this trend and predict the end of paper currency. Easy, but probably wrong. Most Americans prefer to use cash at least some of the time, and even those who do not, like Mr. Zazula, grudgingly concede they cannot live without it.
Currency remains the best available technology for paying baby sitters and tipping bellhops. Many small businesses -- estimates range from one-third to half -- won't accept plastic. And criminals prefer cash. Whitey Bulger, the Boston gangster who lived in Santa Monica for 15 years, paid his rent in cash, and stashed thousands of dollars in his apartment walls.
Indeed, cash remains so pervasive, and the pace of change so slow, that Ron Shevlin, an analyst with the Boston research firm Aite Group, recently calculated that Americans would still be using paper currency in 200 years.
''Cash works for us,'' Mr. Shevlin said. ''The downward trend is clear, but change advocates always overestimate how quickly these things will happen.''
Production of paper currency is declining much more quickly than actual currency use because the bills are lasting longer. Thanks to technological advances, the average dollar bill now circulates for 40 months, up from 18 months two decades ago, according to Federal Reserve estimates.
Banks regularly send stacks of old notes to the Fed, which replaces the damaged ones. Until recently, notes were simply stacked facedown and destroyed, as were dog-eared notes, because the Fed's scanning equipment could not distinguish between creases and tears. Now it can. In 1989, the Fed replaced 46 percent of returned dollar bills. Last year it replaced 21 percent. The rest of the notes were returned to circulation where they may lead longer lives because they are being used less often.
The futurists who have long predicted the end of paper money also underestimated the rise of the $100 bill as one of America's most popular exports.
For two decades, since the fall of the Soviet Union, demand has exploded for the $100 bill, which is hoarded like gold in unstable places. Last year Treasury printed more $100 bills than dollar bills for the first time. There are now more than seven billion pictures of Benjamin Franklin in circulation -- and the Federal Reserve's best guess is that two-thirds are held by foreigners. American soldiers searching one of Saddam Hussein's palaces in 2003 found about $650 million in fresh $100 bills.
This is very profitable for the United States. Currency is printed by the Treasury and issued by the Federal Reserve. The central bank pays the Treasury for the cost of production -- about 10 cents a note -- then exchanges the notes at face value for securities that pay interest. The more money it issues, the more interest it earns. And each year the Fed returns to the Treasury a windfall called a seigniorage payment, which last year exceeded $20 billion.
To meet foreign demand, the Fed has licensed banks to operate currency distribution warehouses in London, Frankfurt, Singapore and other financial centers.
In March, largely because of the boom in $100 notes, the value of all American notes in circulation topped $1 trillion for the first time.
In the United States, research suggests that the spread of electronic payment technologies is steadily reducing the share of payments made in cash. Drivers use E-Z Pass at toll plazas for roads and bridges. Commuters swipe stored-value cards at turnstiles. Christmas stockings are stuffed with gift cards.
Mr. Zazula, the restaurateur, made his decision in 2009, inspired by a flight on American Airlines, which had just introduced a no-cash policy. He said that 85 percent of his customers already paid with credit cards, and taking cash to and from the bank was a nuisance and security risk.
Two years later, Mr. Zazula said he had no regrets.
''You still have some people that are outraged that we won't accept cash,'' he said, ''but most of it is a show because they end up having a credit card.''
But Commerce remains a rarity. Experts on payments cannot name another no-cash restaurant. Snap, a cafe in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, rejected cash in 2006, then reversed the policy a few years later.
Businesses are not required to take cash. The famous phrase ''legal tender for all debts'' means that lenders -- and only lenders -- are required to accept the bills. But most merchants don't see the point in frustrating customers.
''It's a rarity for a retailer of any size to go cash only, and it's a rarity to decline to accept cash at all,'' said Brian Dodge of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group.
Even the financial industry, which has promoted the spread of electronic payments, has moved away from grand predictions.
''There's always going to be some people, for good or nefarious reasons, who want to use cash,'' said Doug Johnson, vice president for risk management policy at the American Bankers Association. ''I'm glad I had it yesterday,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''I blew out a fan belt on my car, and it's nice to be able to give the tow driver a twenty.''

PERSON: George Lang 

HEADLINE: George Lang, Whose Overhaul Made Cafe des Artistes a Hit, Is Dead at 86

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
George Lang, a restaurateur and cookbook writer who in the 1970s transformed Cafe des Artistes into one of New York's most romantic, beloved dining spots and in the 1990s helped restore the historic Budapest restaurant Gundel to its former glory, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.
His death was confirmed by his wife, Jenifer Harvey Lang, who said he had been treated for Alzheimer's disease.
Mr. Lang, a native of Hungary who escaped a forced-labor camp and imminent execution during World War II, came to New York in 1946 with a few dollars, no English and dreams of becoming a concert violinist. A mesmerizing concert by Jascha Heifetz convinced him that his future lay elsewhere; he found it in restaurants. 
He ascended quickly through the business as a chef, a banquet manager and then a developer of new projects for Restaurant Associates, the pioneering company, then in its heyday, that created the Four Seasons and other innovative restaurants. In 1970 he formed one of the first restaurant-consulting businesses in the United States, the George Lang Corporation.
In 1975 the media consultant David Garth, a board member of the venerable Hotel des Artistes near Lincoln Center, asked him to take over the ground-floor restaurant. Originally conceived as a room-service operation for the hotel's resident painters and musicians, it had fallen on hard times. In his memoir, ''Nobody Knows the Truffles I've Seen,'' published in 1998, Mr. Lang described it as ''a dark, dingy little place that was empty most of the time.''
Mr. Lang cleaned the Howard Chandler Christy murals, with their pouty nymphs, renovated the interior and let light into the dining room. At the same time, he recast the menu to feature updated versions of trattoria and bistro dishes, many of them included in ''The Cafe des Artistes Cookbook'' (1984), written by Mr. Lang.
''I wanted to avoid the intimidation factor that was so prevalent among the more fashionable restaurants in New York at the time,'' Mr. Lang told Nation's Restaurant News in 1985. ''I wanted to create something more along the lines of an elegant bistro.''
Caviar was out, replaced by seafood gazpacho, tripe with prunes, the Provencal fish stew known as bourride, and Ilona torte, the flourless chocolate cake that became the cafe's signature.
His formula proved to be an enduring hit with performers at Lincoln Center and a long list of actors and celebrities. Labor troubles and a sour economy forced him to close the restaurant, at 1 West 67th Street, in August 2009. Under new owners and a new name, Leopard at des Artistes, it reopened this year.
Gyorgy Deutsch was born on July 13, 1924, in Szekesfehervar, in central Hungary, where his father ran a successful custom-tailor shop. Since his last name meant ''German'' in German, he adopted his mother's maiden name around the time he left for the United States.
A promising violinist, he moved to Budapest as a teenager to study at the Franz Liszt Music Academy, but World War II threw his life into disarray. The family was Jewish, and at 19 he was sent to a forced-labor camp in Komarom, on the Czechoslovakian border. After the war, he learned that his parents had died at Auschwitz.
With the connivance of a friendly guard, Mr. Lang escaped from the labor camp using false papers and made his way to Budapest, then in chaos, as the German and Hungarian forces mounted a last-ditch defense against advancing Soviet forces.
Mr. Lang, as a last resort, joined the fascist Arrow Cross militia but used his position to assist Jews in hiding. In the final days before the Soviets entered Budapest, his subterfuge was discovered and he was imprisoned in a coal cellar to await execution.
When the Russians took over the city, he was arrested as a suspected fascist, tortured and put on trial. Ultimately, he was acquitted after several of the Jews he had helped testified on his behalf.
After escaping to Austria hidden in a coffin, Mr. Lang made his way to New York, where he worked as a busboy at Reuben's, turned pages for accompanists at Carnegie Hall and, after spending a summer on a scholarship at Tanglewood, became a violinist with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra.
After putting down his violin, he found lowly employment at a series of restaurants before being hired to sell wedding banquets at a converted Greek Orthodox church on Houston Street that looked, he wrote in his memoir, ''like a muted version of Frankenstein's castle circa 1898.''
Mr. Lang showed flair and ingenuity in a tough, competitive business. One master stroke was to install a grand spiral staircase that allowed the bride to make a Hollywood-style entrance and descend gracefully in the admiring illumination of a spotlight. Soon he was plying the banquet trade in more luxurious surroundings, at the Waldorf-Astoria.
His sense of showmanship and an innovative approach to menu creation caught the eye of Joe Baum, who hired him in 1960 to develop and direct new projects for Restaurant Associates. He oversaw more than a dozen restaurant operations at the 1964 New York World's Fair and, beginning in 1967, spent three less than happy years as the director of the Four Seasons before establishing his consulting business.
He also opened the Tower Suite at the top of the Time-Life Building, a restaurant that projected the illusion of dining in a private apartment. The servers, dressed as butlers and maids, introduced themselves by name to diners, an innovation that, Mr. Lang admitted sheepishly, became one of the more tiresome cliches in the restaurant business.
Mr. Lang's first two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, Jenifer, he is survived by a daughter, Georgina, known as Gigi, and two sons, Brian, of Manhattan, and Simon, of Los Angeles. Another daughter, Andrea, died in 1990 while trying to flee a wildfire closing in on her home in Santa Barbara, Calif.
In 1991, the philanthropist and art collector Ronald S. Lauder, of the cosmetics family, asked Mr. Lang to combine business and sentiment by rescuing Gundel, the once-grand Budapest restaurant that had declined badly, both in physical condition and food quality, under the Communist regime.
Mr. Lauder, whose grandparents had emigrated from Hungary, was keen to re-establish a connection with his roots. Mr. Lang, who had once dined at Gundel when he was a violin student, saw the restaurant as a golden opportunity to return to Hungary in triumph.
After a multimillion-dollar renovation, Gundel reopened in 1992, serving classics like sauerkraut baked with catfish and fish sausage; goose liver baked with onion; and palacsinta, the Hungarian walnut-stuffed pancakes in chocolate sauce.
An avid student of culinary history, Mr. Lang wrote ''The Cuisine of Hungary'' (1971), the first serious work in English on Hungarian cooking, and ''Lang's Compendium of Culinary Nonsense and Trivia'' (1980), a collection of historical anecdotes and odd dishes, like elephant schnitzel.
Mr. Lang often enjoyed constructing fantasy meals, including his last. The ideal final meal, he told The Village Voice in 2007, would include some of the great dishes from his restaurant career but above all his Hungarian favorites: fisherman's soup, stuffed goose neck, sour cherry soup, layered cabbage, stuffed peppers, plum dumplings, pancakes with apple meringue, and whipped-cream strudel.
''And then I will have what it takes to get to another world,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Equities Rise Modestly Amid Conflicting Signals

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stock markets posted their sixth advance in seven days, as gains in transportation and consumer-staple companies overshadowed slower growth in the services industry and China's interest-rate hike.
Union Pacific climbed 0.8 percent to lead gains in shipping companies, while Costco Wholesale rallied 1.7 percent to help lead an advance in companies that sell consumer goods. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase slumped at least 1.1 percent as financial stocks retreated.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained a scant 0.1 percent, or 1.34 points, to 1,339.22. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 56.15 points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,626.02. The Nasdaq composite rose 8.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,834.02. 
''We're beginning to put the short-term economic issues behind us,'' said Robert N. Schaeffer, a money manager at Becker Capital Management in Portland, Ore. ''We're likely to get better economic data over the next months and that will rally the stock market on an intermediate basis even if the long-term problems, such as too much debt, remain unsolved.''
The recent rally has exposed a partial shift that had favored companies less sensitive to economic growth. Since the S.& P. 500 slipped to its low for the year in March, drug makers, phone companies, utilities and makers of household products have gained most, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But the biggest advances in last week's rally were among so-called cyclical stocks, including energy companies, computer makers, automakers and industrials.
Market indexes fell early on after the Institute for Supply Management services index fell to 53.3 in June from 54.6 a month earlier. A reading above 50 signals expansion. The slower pace is a sign the economy cooled at the end of the first half of 2011.
Other data showed employers announced 5.3 percent more job cuts in June than a year earlier, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a firm based in Chicago. The report comes two days before the Labor Department's monthly jobs report, which is expected to show unemployment unchanged at 9.1 percent.
Stock-index futures had also retreated after China's central bank said Wednesday that it would raise its benchmark deposit and lending rates by one-quarter point . This is the third time this year China has raised rates as it tries to cool its economy, the world's fastest growing.
''China is perceived as the economic engine of the world right now,'' said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services based in Suffern, N.Y. ''Them slowing down by raising interest rates at a time when we have an overhang of high unemployment and low growth in the U.S., as well as the sovereign debt issues in Europe, causes investors to get concerned about what the impact will be on our markets and economies.''
General Motors rose 1.1 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded American carmakers.
The News Corporation fell 3.6 percent to $17.47. The company's News of the World, the tabloid accused of hacking into a murder victim's voicemails, is losing advertisers including G.M.'s Vauxhall and Lloyds Banking.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 2/32, to 100 4/32 to yield 3.11 percent, down from 3.12 percent.

HEADLINE: As It Emerges as a Nation, South Sudan Extends the Clout of Its Neighbor Uganda

BYLINE: By JOSH KRON

 BODY:
JUBA, Sudan -- Shakirah Namwanje may be something of a big shot.
Like tens of thousands of fellow Ugandans who have emigrated to this new land across the border, Ms. Namwanje has come to get rich. Outfitted with a sharp mind and a must-do personality, she earned eight times as much in three months as she would have back home. She helps run a successful import business here, and when her boss is out of town, Ms. Namwanje is in charge, barking out orders and making things happen -- an emblem of an increasingly influential legion of foreigners.
''To get money,'' says Ms. Namwanje. ''It's easy to make.'' 
And she's only 17.
South Sudan's independence celebrations on Saturday will not only usher in the world's newest country, they may also be a coronation of its southern neighbor, Uganda, as a cresting regional influence.
In the last two decades, Uganda has helped bring three surrounding governments to power -- here, in Rwanda and in Congo. In Somalia, it has dispatched thousands of troops to preserve another. And for southern Sudan, Uganda has been nothing short of a life-support system.
Southern Sudan's former rebel leader, John Garang, attended the same university in Tanzania as President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, and his guerrilla movement used Uganda as a base during its war with the north. Since the end of the war, the two governments have maintained an intimate security relationship, with agreements on training and joint military operations.
Even now, with independence close at hand, South Sudan will be a nation in dependence. Countries from the United States to China are investing in the soon-to-be country, and the nearby East African Community says it is likely South Sudan will join the regional economic bloc. But Uganda, a developing country itself, holds a special place.
A vast portion of South Sudan's produce is imported, and Uganda exports more goods to South Sudan than any country in the world, with exports surging alongside the south's growing demand for them. A Ugandan diplomat in Juba said there were roughly 60,000 Ugandans living and working in southern Sudan, and entire neighborhoods of the small but booming capital are populated by Ugandans.
Cross-border trade between Uganda and South Sudan recently surpassed $150 million, and the two governments have been reported to be working on a joint-venture to build a state-of-the-art market in Juba.
This is nothing new. Uganda has a history under President Museveni of supporting nearby rebel movements and later exporting large amounts of goods and people to the countries once those groups came to power.
The most famous example may be Rwanda, to Uganda's south. That country's president, Paul Kagame, grew up as a refugee in Uganda and helped bring President Museveni to power in 1986, later working in the upper echelons of the country's military. In 1990, Mr. Kagame and other Rwandans in Uganda started a rebel offensive in Rwanda, taking power in 1994 after stopping that country's genocide.
Rwanda and Uganda enjoyed close relations for years, and still do, though some political observers argue that relations have since cooled.
In the 1990s, Uganda also teamed up with Rwanda to prop up a little-known soldier in eastern Congo, Laurent Kabila, who soon toppled the longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
In the meantime, Uganda has become a close military ally of the United States. Its forces make up the vast majority of a peacekeeping force to help bolster the shaky government in nearby Somalia, a major foreign policy priority for the United States. President Museveni recently called for a one-year extension of Somalia's transitional government, threatening to pull out Ugandan troops otherwise.
''We contributed to Rwanda; we contributed to Congo; now we are talking about Sudan,'' said Tamale Mirundi, a spokesperson for the Ugandan government. ''Our mission is clear.''
Still, Mr. Mirundi said, ''To be a superpower, that is not high on the agenda,'' and that economic interests played second-fiddle to ''African solidarity.''
After South Sudan, Rwanda and Congo rank among the top recipients of Ugandan exports. Rwanda recently switched its national language to English from French, and the country has hired many Ugandan teachers to work in its schools.
In Juba, people like Ms. Namwanje are pixels in a larger picture.
Working to save money for law school, Ms. Namwanje says she went against her parents' wishes in crossing the border. They feared Sudan's volatile security situation. Here, she said she had met many countrymen: motorcycle-taxi drivers, construction workers, traders like herself.
''Ugandans are the most here in Juba,'' said Ms. Namwanje, whose business in the city's largest market sells eggs for roughly four times the price they cost in Uganda. ''We can get a profit, and much profit.''
Agaba Livingstone, who hails from Hoima, Uganda, said he could not agree more.
''There is no money like here,'' said Mr. Livingstone, adding that he also disobeyed his parents' wishes to come to Sudan.
''They heard that this country is in war, that they are killing themselves,'' said Mr. Livingstone, who says he can make up to $100 each week collecting scrap metal and delivering vegetables to expensive hotels in town. ''Now they are happy.''
But he said his parents' prophecies proved true as well. South Sudan security forces have been implicated in widespread human-rights abuses, and Ugandans here say there has been a backlash against foreigners, who are often harassed and marginalized.
''There are many problems people have here,'' said Kasim Okwai, 25, a motorcycle-taxi driver in Juba, adding that he was robbed last month. He said he tried to complain to the police, but ''they treat foreigners badly.''
But money makes it all worthwhile. For Mr. Okwai, the defining moment came three years earlier, watching as a frustrated young adult in his parents' home in central Uganda as his older brother returned home from a trip to Sudan.
''I saw him coming back,'' said Mr. Okwai. ''Buying clothes; he built a home; so I said, 'Why can't I be like that?' ''

HEADLINE: Some of Thriftiest Schools Will Pay Under New Policy

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Math conundrum: When is 70 percent more than 100 percent?
When the Department of Education's new budget-rollover policy takes effect.
Responding to criticism from principals and their union, the schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott has changed a controversial policy of letting schools that save money in a given year keep only 70 percent of it, with the city taking the rest for general use. Instead, he told principals last week, schools that earn A's, B's or C's on their annual progress reports will be allowed to keep anything they save - up to $44 per enrolled student.
There's the rub. 
On Wednesday, Edward Tom, the principal at the Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics, sent an e-mail to Mr. Walcott, pointing out that he saved $200,000 in the school year that just ended, and could roll over $140,000 of it under the 70-percent rule enacted in March by Mr. Walcott's predecessor, Cathleen P. Black. But under the new policy, which begins next year, the 415-student school, Mr. Tom noted, would be able to roll over at most $18,260 - 9 percent. ''My colleagues and I are willing to accept greater responsibility and accountability for the success of every child, but we require the autonomy to lead our schools the way we see fit,'' Mr. Tom wrote.
Similarly, under the current policy, the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, will get to roll over $445,000 of the $650,000 it had accumulated over three years; under the new policy, with its enrollment of 1,280 as of October, it could keep no more than $56,320 - about 8.6 percent. For schools like these, the new policy, like the old one, provides a strong disincentive for saving large sums.
The math is less confusing at Public School 133 in Bellerose, Queens, which saved $15,587 in 2010-11, of which it can keep $10,911 for the new school year under the 70-percent rollover rule. Based on its most recent enrollment, 485 children, the school will be entitled to roll over $21,340 under the new policy. If it manages to save that much next year, that is.
Principals, is your school more like the one in Bay Ridge or the one in Bellerose? Please use the comment box below to do the math and let us know whether $44 per student is more or less than 70 percent of a typical year's savings.
The whole idea of schools rolling over funds from one year to the next began in July 2005. Before that, any money left in a school's budget at the end of the year reverted to the city.
In the first year that the policy changed, schools saved - and rolled over - $36 million; by 2009-10, the amount had increased to $80 million. This coming year, with some principals having gone on shopping sprees for supplies upon learning the city would take almost a third of their unspent money, the schools will get to hold on to about $22 million of the $32 million they had left at the end of June.
Facing tight budgets, a tool given to principals to plan for a rainy day became too enticing for a city starved for cash.
''In better economic times, the city could absorb it,'' said Natalie Ravitz, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education. ''But we've had a huge loss of state and federal funds. So we are trying to strike a balance, and be very clear from the outset about the program.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China Raises Rates Again in an Effort to Slow Inflation

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China raised interest rates for the fifth time in nine months Wednesday, the latest in a series of moves aimed at cooling the pace of economic growth and the steep price increases that have accompanied expansion. 
The central bank announced that it was raising the key lending and deposit rates in the world's second-largest economy, after the United States, by a quarter of a percentage point. The increase had been widely expected by analysts.
The central bank said the one-year deposit rate would rise to 3.5 percent from 3.25 percent, beginning Thursday. The one-year lending rate was increased to 6.56 percent from 6.31 percent.
Signs that inflation in China has accelerated to levels well above what the Chinese authorities are comfortable with have mounted in recent months and prompted Beijing to step up its efforts at reining in the ample lending that fueled growth and helped fan sharp increases in real estate prices as well as overall inflation.
Data released last month showed that consumer prices rose 5.5 percent in May from a year earlier, and economists widely believe that data for June, due next week, will show an even more substantial increase, of 6 percent or more.
The rate announcement came just weeks after news of the latest in a long line of instructions by Beijing to the nation's banks to extend fewer loans -- the 12th such move since early 2010.
Beijing's gradual cutting back in lending -- by raising reserve-requirement ratios for banks, which reduces the amount of money available for loans -- has had the desired effect of moderating the sizzling pace of growth to a level that most economists here believe points to a soft landing for the Chinese economy.
But many forecasters also say that Beijing now has little room left to increase reserve-requirement ratios much further or to lift interest rates much more. Another small rate increase may come later in the year, but over all, the current round of tightening may soon have run its course, many say.
''The current rate hike could be the last in this tightening cycle'' as the Chinese central bank rarely raises rates when inflation starts to fall, economists at Citigroup wrote Wednesday in a research note. ''But, if inflation exceeds 6 percent for more than two months, another rate hike is likely this year.''
The price rises that have accompanied soaring growth, meanwhile, have so far shown little sign of abating, in part because of sharp increases globally in the costs of raw materials. Natural disasters in China have helped push up the cost of food.
Inflation levels could ebb somewhat later this year but are widely expected to remain elevated, presenting Beijing with a headache. The Chinese authorities are intensely aware that soaring household bills could lead to widespread public dissatisfaction.

HEADLINE: In The Matter Of... Federal Judge Holds Financial Fate Of Wilpon and Katz

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
In 2002, Jed S. Rakoff, a federal district court judge in Manhattan, declared the death penalty unconstitutional. No one -- neither defense lawyers nor prosecutors -- had asked him for such a ruling. But Rakoff, who felt strongly about the growing number of exonerations of death row inmates through DNA evidence, went ahead and did it.
He was lauded by some, excoriated by others, and his decision was soon overturned.
Seven years later, in a scathing decision, he refused to approve the $33 million settlement of a lawsuit arising from the bonuses paid by Merrill Lynch before its takeover by Bank of America. A deal had been reached, but Rakoff thought it was far too little. He forced the sides into a new, far larger one, that was heralded as a victory for taxpayers, whose money had been used to bail out the financial industry in the crisis of 2008. 
Rakoff, 67, is a former federal prosecutor and defense lawyer with an independent streak and a flair for phrase-making. He has been called an activist judge. He has been called a maverick. He has been called other things, a number of them probably unprintable. But few observers of the federal bench would dispute that he is capable of the unexpected.
Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University, said that the death penalty decision was a ''real reach for a trial judge,'' but Rakoff ''decided it was legally correct and therefore it didn't matter if he was just a trial judge.'' Gillers, a former colleague of Rakoff's at two law firms, added: ''Others may call it overconfidence in the correctness of one's views. On the other hand, sometimes such overconfidence prevails and forces a re-examination of assumed premises. Here it did not.''
Rakoff now has the financial fate of the men who own the Mets before him. Last Friday, he pulled the billion-dollar lawsuit against the team's owners brought by the trustee for victims of Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme out of bankruptcy court and into his own. Rakoff could dismiss all or part of the case when he rules next month.
''I can't guarantee this, of course, but my tendency is to try to get quick decisions,'' he said during a hearing last week in which he evinced, at least for the purposes of the legal argument before him, a fair amount of sympathy toward the team's owners, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz.
Indeed, near the end of the hearing, one that was consumed by debate about the merits of the trustee's efforts to get hundreds of millions from the team's owners, Rakoff expressed skepticism about the trustee's approach. He suggested that in accusing the owners of being ''willfully blind'' to the possibility that Madoff was a fraud during their many years of investing with him, the trustee might be holding them to an unfair standard. In fact, determining that, Rakoff said, could invite even larger issues.
''There are even intimations, though not raised by the movants, of constitutional issues,'' he said.
He did not say what they were, but lawyers familiar with Rakoff and his appetite for novel rulings said this week that they would not be shocked if he tried try to say something larger about the law.
The hearing last week certainly illustrated aspects of Rakoff's style: persistent, challenging and humorous. He suggested that he nearly fell asleep reading the trustee's 373-page lawsuit against the team's owners, yet he allowed that he admired its ''Tolstoy-like rhetoric.''
He jabbed a little at the confidence and arguments of David Sheehan, counsel to the trustee. And he seemed to vigorously question the approach being taken by the trustee, Irving H. Picard. Picard was appointed in 2009 by a federal bankruptcy judge to try and recoup as much money as possible and distribute it to deserving victims of Madoff's colossal fraud. To date, Picard, often through the threat of aggressive lawsuits against Madoff investors he thinks either knew -- or should have suspected -- Madoff was involved in wrongdoing, has collected roughly $10 billion.
At the heart of the hearing -- lawyers for the team's owners had asked Rakoff to remove the case from bankruptcy court -- were Rakoff's questions about what laws should govern how culpable, if at all, the Mets' owners should be found for investing in what turned out to be a Ponzi scheme.
Picard says bankruptcy laws apply, and those laws allow him to look at an investor's history to see if they had doubts -- or should have had doubts -- about Madoff's operation. He has accused Wilpon and Katz of ignoring numerous warnings about Madoff. As a result, he is seeking the return of $1 billion in what is known as a ''clawback'' action.
In strictly legal terms, the trustee says, the owners had across the years, and in the face of alarms and warnings, been put on what is known as ''inquiry notice,'' a standard that obligated them to look into Madoff's legitimacy. Picard has asserted that the owners never did the slightest bit of investigating during years and years of spectacularly consistent, always profitable years of investing with Madoff.
Lawyers for the owners reject that analysis, and have accused Picard of trying to strong-arm them into a massive settlement. The lawyers argue that securities law, not bankruptcy law, applies to Wilpon and Katz. Under securities law, they argue, the men were no different than any other investors -- not at all obligated to mount their own investigation of their private broker.
Interpreting how a judge might rule based on his conduct and demeanor during a hearing is, of course, risky. Judges can play the devil's advocate. Still, Rakoff sounded like he was siding with arguments made by Karen Wagner, the Mets' lead lawyer.
Rakoff asked, with some amazement, a question that is critical to Katz and Wilpon's case.
How, he wondered, can investors like them not be judged by the securities laws that governed their 25 years of investing with Madoff, but by the bankruptcy laws that came into play after Madoff's collapse.
''That's the nature of bankruptcy law,'' said Christopher LaRosa, a lawyer for the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a federal agency that is working with Picard.
''I'm not sure I agree with that,'' Rakoff said.
Rakoff is now awaiting more legal briefs before hearing arguments again on Aug. 17.
Rakoff, a Harvard Law graduate, served as the head of the securities frauds unit of the United States Attorney for the Southern District in New York from 1978 to 1980. He developed a reputation as a leading securities lawyer, before becoming a district court judge in 1996.
He has overseen the financial fraud case of WorldCom; two years ago, he sentenced Marc S. Dreier to 20 years in prison for bilking investors and hedge funds of $700 million; and he is an expert on the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.
And for nearly 25 years, Rakoff has taught a class on white collar crime at Columbia University with John C. Coffee Jr., a law school professor. Coffee, who said that Rakoff was more of a mainstream judge than some of his maverick rulings suggest, said that district judges and bankruptcy judges see things differently.
''In the bankruptcy court,'' Coffee said, ''plaintiffs can sometimes convince a bankruptcy judge that gross negligence implies willful blindness. But that is unlikely to work with Judge Rakoff.''
Rakoff can dismiss the case, or rule on some issues then return it to bankruptcy court to be tried by Judge Burton R. Lifland. It remains to be seen if Rakoff will rule on the $300 million Wilpon and Katz are accused of earning in fictitious profits -- the difference between what they took out and what they put in -- with another case on that subject awaiting a decision by an appeals court.
Sheehan said in an interview that his ''fictitious profits'' claim against the owners does not involve charging that the men turned a blind eye to warnings of the possibility of a fraud. That claim, then, might survive even an adverse ruling by Rakoff.
''A Ponzi scheme is a zero sum game,'' he said. ''So if you are a net winner, you perforce have someone else's money and your state of mind should be irrelevant.''

HEADLINE: Baseball Opposes Dodgers Motion for Documents in Court Case

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Major League Baseball on Wednesday opposed a Los Angeles Dodgers motion to produce a broad swath of evidence that the team believes will advance its case in bankruptcy court.
The filing by M.L.B., in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware, is the latest episode in the war between Commissioner Bud Selig and Frank McCourt, who bought the team in 2004. Selig believes McCourt's mismanagement led the team into bankruptcy; McCourt accuses Selig of denying the team needed cash. 
The biggest flashpoint was Selig's rejection last month of a 17-year cable TV deal with Fox Sports worth $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Selig felt that a provision of the deal -- an upfront loan from Fox of $385 million -- would have unfairly enriched McCourt and his wife, Jamie, who are divorcing.
The immediate battle is over financing the team's day-to-day operations. Last month, the court let the Dodgers use $60 million of $150 million in interim financing offered by a hedge fund, Highbridge Capital Management, to pay bills, including payroll, through July 20, when a hearing will be held by Judge Kevin Gross to re-examine the arrangement. M.L.B. said it wants to lend the team $150 million on better terms, but McCourt has refused, claiming its proposal is ''laden with fine print and malignant ramifications.''
To further his case against Selig and baseball, McCourt demanded a lengthy list of documents and other evidence that would show, in part, that M.L.B. has been unnecessarily punitive in its handling of the Dodgers' financial crisis, compared with the ''velvet glove'' treatment of other teams with money problems.
''This is not the time for Mr. McCourt to try to build a case to challenge M.L.B.'s administration of baseball,'' the opposition brief said. According to the filing, 28 of the 31 document requests are irrelevant to the motion over interim financing that will be argued on July 20.
M.L.B. asserted that the documents the Dodgers are seeking are ''related almost exclusively to Mr. McCourt's mismanagement of the team, his inability to subordinate his personal interests to those of the team and the league (as required by the M.L.B. governing documents), and the resulting harm to one of the league's most storied franchises and its fan base.''
But a team spokesman said that the evidence ''will reveal the commissioner's real agenda in his mistreatment of the Dodgers, and demonstrate why the Dodgers should not borrow money from M.L.B.''
Baseball accused McCourt of having a financial motivation against M.L.B.'s interim financing proposal: he would have to personally pay all or part of the fees if the Highbridge plan is not finalized by the court. Baseball says McCourt has a conflict of interest, but a Dodgers spokesman said in a statement that ''there is no conflict of interest in terms of the Highbridge'' financing proposal.
Baseball also opposed the Dodgers' demand for deposition of Selig and other executives, including Tom Schieffer, the monitor appointed by Selig to oversee the team's day-to-day operations.

HEADLINE: China's Cities Piling Up Debt To Fuel Boom

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Xu Yan contributed research.

 BODY:
WUHAN, China -- In the seven years it will take New York City to build a two-mile leg of its long-awaited Second Avenue subway line, this city of nine million people in central China plans to complete an entirely new subway system, with nearly 140 miles of track.
And the Wuhan Metro is only one piece of a $120 billion municipal master plan that includes two new airport terminals, a new financial district, a cultural district and a riverfront promenade with an office tower half again as high as the Empire State Building.
The construction frenzy cloaks Wuhan, China's ninth-largest city, in a continual dust cloud, despite fleets of water trucks constantly spraying the streets. No wonder the local Communist party secretary, recently promoted from mayor, is known as ''Mr. Digging Around the City.'' 
The plans for Wuhan, a provincial capital about 425 miles west of Shanghai, might seem extravagant. But they are not unusual. Dozens of other Chinese cities are racing to complete infrastructure projects just as expensive and ambitious, or more so, as they play their roles in this nation's celebrated economic miracle.
In the last few years, cities' efforts have helped government infrastructure and real estate spending surpass foreign trade as the biggest contributor to China's growth. Subways and skyscrapers, in other words, are replacing exports of furniture and iPhones as the symbols of this nation's prowess.
But there are growing signs that China's long-running economic boom could be undermined by these building binges, which are financed through heavy borrowing by local governments and clever accounting that masks the true size of the debt.
The danger, experts say, is that China's municipal governments could already be sitting on huge mountains of hidden debt -- a lurking liability that threatens to stunt the nation's economic growth for years or even decades to come. Just last week China's national auditor, who reports to the cabinet, warned of the perils of local government borrowing. And on Tuesday the Beijing office of Moody's Investors Service issued a report saying the national auditor might have understated Chinese banks' actual risks from loans to local governments.
Because Chinese growth has been one of the few steady engines in the global economy in recent years, any significant slowdown in this country would have international repercussions.
As municipal projects play out across China, spending on so-called fixed-asset investment -- a crucial measure of building that is heavily weighted toward government and real estate projects -- is now equal to nearly 70 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. It is a ratio that no other large nation has approached in modern times.
Even Japan, at the peak of its building boom in the 1980s, reached only about 35 percent, and the figure has hovered around 20 percent for decades in the United States.
China's high number helps explain its meteoric material rise. But it could also signal a dangerous dependence on government infrastructure spending.
''If China's good at anything, it's infrastructure,'' said Pieter P. Bottelier, a China expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. ''But right now it seems the investment rate is too high. How much of that is ill-advised and future nonperforming loans, no one knows.''
For the last decade, as economists have sought to explain China's rise, a popular image has emerged of Beijing technocrats continually and cannily fine-tuning the nation's communist-capitalist hybrid. But in fact, city governments often work at odds with Beijing's aims. And some of Beijing's own goals and policies can be contradictory.
As a result, China's state capitalism is much messier, and the economy more vulnerable, than it might look to the outside world.
In the case of Wuhan, a close look at its finances reveals that the city has borrowed tens of billions of dollars from state-run banks. But the loans seldom go directly to the local government. Instead, the borrowing is done by special investment corporations set up by the city -- business entities whose debt shows up nowhere on Wuhan's official financial balance sheet.
Adding to the risk, the collateral for many loans is local land valued at lofty prices that could collapse if China's real estate bubble burst. Wuhan's land prices have tripled in the last decade.
The biggest of the separate investment companies set up by the municipal government here is an entity known as Wuhan Urban Construction Investment and Development, created to help finance billions of dollars' worth of projects, including roadways, bridges and sewage treatment plants.
According to city records, Wuhan U.C.I.D. has 16,000 employees, 25 subsidiaries and $15 billion in assets -- including the possibly inflated value of the land itself. But it owes nearly as much, about $14 billion.
''U.C.I.D. is heavily in debt,'' a company spokesman, Sun Zhengrong, conceded in an interview. ''This may lead to potential problems. So we are trying to make some adjustments.'' He declined to elaborate, saying the state company's finances were ''our core secret.''
Dozens of other cities are following a similarly risky script: creating off balance-sheet corporations that are going deeply into debt for showpiece projects, new subway systems, high-speed rail lines and extravagant government office complexes. And they are doing it despite efforts by the central government in Beijing to rein in the excess.
To limit the cities' debt, Beijing has long prohibited municipalities from issuing bonds to finance government projects -- as American cities do as a matter of course. Lately, too, China's central government has put tighter limits on state-owned banks' lending to municipalities. But by using off-the-books investment companies, cities have largely eluded Beijing's rules.
Zhang Dong, a municipal government adviser who also teaches finance at the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law in Wuhan, estimates that less than 5 percent of the city's infrastructure spending comes from Wuhan's general budget. ''Most of it comes from off-the-books financing,'' he said.
This system is not a secret from Beijing, which now says there are more than 10,000 of these local government financing entities in China. In fact, because Beijing now takes a large share of government tax revenue, local governments have had to find their own way to grow, and land development is primarily how they have done it.
But it is a risky game. A recent report by the investment bank UBS predicted that local government investment corporations could generate up to $460 billion in loan defaults over the next few years. As a percentage of China's G.D.P., that would be far bigger than the $700 billion troubled-asset bailout program in the United States.
As frightening as that may sound, many analysts see no reason for panic -- no imminent threat of an economy-collapsing banking crisis in China. That is largely because of Beijing's $3 trillion war chest of foreign exchange reserves (much of it invested in United States Treasury bonds), and the fact that China's state-run banks are also sitting on huge piles of household savings from the nation's 1.3 billion citizens.
Because all that cash is protected by government restrictions on money flowing in and out of the country, a global run on China's banks would be unlikely.
The real problem, analysts say, is that municipal government debt in China has begun casting a large shadow over the nation's growth picture. If instead of investing in growth, China had to start spending money to gird the banks against municipal defaults, some experts see a possibility of China eventually lapsing into a long period of Japan-like stagnation.
A Recession Peril
Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor and co-author of ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,'' has studied China's boom. He predicts that within a decade China's lofty property bubble and its mounting debts could cause a regional recession in Asia and stifle growth in the rest of the world.
''With China, you have the ultimate 'this time is different' syndrome,'' Professor Rogoff said. ''Economists say they have huge reserves, they have savings, they're hard-working people. It's naive. You can't beat the odds forever.''
By Beijing's estimate, total local government debt amounted to $2.2 trillion last year -- a staggering figure, equal to one-third of the nation's gross domestic product. A wave of municipal defaults could become a huge liability for the central government, which is sitting on about $2 trillion in debt of its own.
And Beijing's estimate of what the cities owe might be too low, in the view of Victor Shih, a professor of political economy at Northwestern University who has studied China's municipal debt. He says that by now, after even more borrowing in early 2011 and some figures hidden from government audits, total municipal debt in China could be closer to $3 trillion.
''Most of the government entities that borrow can't even make the interest payments on the loans,'' Professor Shih said.
Around the clock, seven days a week, the construction crews burrow to build Wuhan's $45 billion subway system. One segment snakes beneath the mighty Yangtze River.
''For most areas we dig down 18 to 26 meters,'' said Lin Wenshu, one of the planning directors of the Wuhan Metro. ''But for part of this line we've had to go down 50 meters because there's high pressure and a lot of mud from the river,'' he said. ''But the citizens want a subway system, and so we're going to build it as fast as possible.''
In all, city officials say there are more than 5,700 construction projects under way in Wuhan. In some neighborhoods, workers demolish old homes with little more than sledgehammers and their bare hands to make way for shopping malls, high-rise apartment complexes and new expressways.
Having seen Beijing, Shanghai and other coastal metropolises thrive on big infrastructure projects, cities thousands of miles inland, like Wuhan, are trying to do likewise. Wuhan wants to become a manufacturing and transportation hub for the heartland -- China's version of Chicago.
But it is a dream built on debt. This year, relying largely on bank loans, Wuhan plans to spend about $22 billion on infrastructure projects, an amount five times as large as the city's tax revenue last year. And aspirations notwithstanding, Wuhan is still relatively poor. Residents here earn about $3,000 a year, only about two-thirds as much as those in Shanghai.
But Wuhan has made the most of the soaring value of its land. In the northwest part of the city, for example, bulldozers have cleared a huge tract more than twice the size of Central Park. A dozen years ago it was a military air base.
Giant billboards advertise a new purpose: future home of the Wangjiadun Central Business District, featuring office towers and luxury apartments for 200,000 people. That assumes, of course, that financing for the project -- a web of loans and deals based largely on the underlying value of the land -- holds up.
Planning began in 1999, when the city decided to relocate the air base. After the city ran short of cash for the project, in 2002, it turned to a deep-pocketed Beijing developer, the Oceanwide Corporation. Oceanwide agreed to chip in $275 million and pay some of the infrastructure costs in exchange for a prime piece of the land.
Since then, the city has sold large plots of the former air base to other developers, while earmarking yet other parcels for future sale to help pay for the new business district.
There is no question that China needs new infrastructure and transportation networks if it is to meet its goal of transforming most of its huge population into city dwellers. Less certain is whether the country can afford to keep building at this pace, and whether many of these projects will ever pay off in terms of the economic development they are meant to support.
Beijing helped ratchet up the municipal building boom in early 2009, when in response to the global recession, it pressed local governments to think big and announced a huge economic stimulus package. That unleashed a wave of government-backed bank lending.
''What we're seeing was not very common before 2008,'' said Fu Zhihua, a research fellow at the Research Institute for Fiscal Science. ''Now, all cities are rushing headlong into this.''
And now, try as it might, Beijing seems unable to stop the stampede.
Part of the problem may be incentives in China's Politburo-driven economic system. Simply put, municipal officials in China keep their jobs and earn promotions on the basis of short-term economic growth.
''The fact is, local governments in China compete to grow G.D.P. in order to get promoted as government officials,'' said Zeng Kanghua, who teaches finance at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.
Ruan Chengfa, Wuhan's 54-year-old local Communist party secretary, who was promoted earlier this year from mayor, has certainly benefited politically from his ''Mr. Digging'' reputation.
He declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a speech in February, he said, ''If we want Wuhan to have leapfrog development and enhance people's happiness, then we must build subways and bridges.''
Pressure From Beijing
Wuhan is starting to show symptoms of financial stress.
Despite selling about $25 billion worth of land over the last five years, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research firm based in New York, Wuhan is struggling to pay for its projects. City officials have announced a big increase in bridge tolls. Under pressure from Beijing to reduce Wuhan's debt, they have promised to pay back $2.3 billion to state-backed creditors this year.
Whether the city would do this by borrowing more money or selling land or assets is unclear. But rolling over old debts with new borrowing is not uncommon among Chinese cities. In 2009, for instance, Wuhan's big investment company, Wuhan U.C.I.D., borrowed $230 million from investors and then used nearly a third of the money to repay some of its bank loans.
Mainly, Wuhan's leaders are counting on property prices to continue defying gravity, even if some analysts predict a coming crash.
In a report this year, the investment bank Credit Suisse identified Wuhan as one of China's ''top 10 cities to avoid,'' saying its housing stock was so huge that it would take eight years to sell the residences already completed -- never mind the hundreds of thousands now under construction.
But criticism has not deterred Mr. Ruan, the local party secretary, who has vowed to keep his foot on the shovel. ''If we don't speed up construction,'' he said in the speech in February, ''many of Wuhan's problems won't be solved.''

But the work, divided into project segments, is being financed in complex ways that some analysts say pose risks to the local government. In one method, called build and transfer, the builder pays for the work with the plan to later sell it to the city. Under another technique, the city sets up a separate entity to borrow money for the projects -- debt that shows up nowhere on the city's official balance sheet. Wuhan Urban Construction Investment and Development is the city's largest such entity.

HEADLINE: President Looks To Broader Deal In Deficit Talks

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and MARK LANDLER; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Heading into a crucial negotiating session on a budget deal on Thursday, President Obama has raised his sights and wants to strike a far-reaching agreement on cutting the federal deficit as Speaker John A. Boehner has signaled new willingness to bargain on revenues.
Mr. Obama, who is to meet at the White House with the bipartisan leadership of Congress in an effort to work out an agreement to raise the federal debt limit, wants to move well beyond the $2 trillion in savings sought in earlier negotiations and seek perhaps twice as much over the next decade, Democratic officials briefed on the negotiations said Wednesday.
The president's renewed efforts follow what knowledgeable officials said was an overture from Mr. Boehner, who met secretly with Mr. Obama last weekend, to consider as much as $1 trillion in unspecified new revenues as part of an overhaul of tax laws in exchange for an agreement that made substantial spending cuts, including in such social programs as Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security -- programs that had been off the table.
The intensifying negotiations between the president and the speaker have Congressional Democrats growing anxious, worried they will be asked to accept a deal that is too heavily tilted toward Republican efforts and produces too little new revenue relative to the magnitude of the cuts. 
Congressional Democrats said they were caught off guard by the weekend White House visit of Mr. Boehner -- a meeting the administration still refused to acknowledge on Wednesday -- and Senate Democrats raised concerns at a private party luncheon on Wednesday.
House Democrats have their own fears about the negotiations, which they expressed in an hourlong meeting Wednesday night with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.
''Depending on what they decide to recommend, they may not have Democrats,'' Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, said in an interview. ''I think it is a risky thing for the White House to basically take the bet that we can be presented with something at the last minute and we will go for it.''
Officials said Mr. Boehner suggested that he was open to the possibility of $1 trillion or more in new revenue that would be generated by addressing tax issues already raised in the talks, like killing breaks for the oil and gas industry, eliminating ethanol subsidies and ending preferential treatment for corporate jets.
But those changes would fall far short of the revenue goal, and the source of the rest of the money would, under what they described as Mr. Boehner's proposal, be decided by Congress through a review of tax law changes. One official said some revenue could be generated by allowing Bush-era tax cuts for affluent Americans to expire at the end of 2012, which would produce hundreds of billions of dollars, though those savings would be offset by the costs of retaining lower rates for those below the income threshold.
Aides to Mr. Boehner said that no tax increases were on the table and that he had not agreed to the expiration of any tax cuts.
One source familiar with the talks said the speaker had put forward options on how to proceed, including making a commitment to a tax code overhaul that would lower rates while closing loopholes, ending deductions and instituting other changes to generate substantial new revenue. Mr. Boehner has in the past pushed tax simplification as a way to help the economy.
Democrats were distrustful of Mr. Boehner's idea, saying such an approach raises the prospect that future tax and revenue changes could be blocked by Republicans after Democrats had already agreed to the detailed cuts. They sought assurances that all the elements of any budget deal would be enacted simultaneously.
''We want as robust a deficit reduction deal as possible,'' said David Krone, chief of staff to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, who would serve as point man for moving any agreement through the Senate. ''But it has to be balanced between spending and revenues, in terms of timing, specificity and dollars.''
Democrats are not just worried about the substantial policy issues at stake; they are also concerned about the political implications of any deal as they try to hold control of the Senate next year and win back the House.
To the degree that any deal wins bipartisan support on slowing the growth of Medicare, for example, it would deprive Democrats of what has been one of their most potent arguments heading into 2012: their assertion that Republicans would gut the traditional Medicare system and leave older Americans vulnerable to rapidly rising health care costs.
Faced with the prospect that the federal government would default on its credit obligations, Democrats might indeed be cajoled into backing an agreement they did not strongly support. But at the moment, there is substantial private and public grumbling about what looms ahead.
Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, urged the president not to yield to Republican demands to reduce the deficit by cutting hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare, Medicaid and other domestic spending. He said that ''the president has got to demand that at least 50 percent of deficit reduction come from revenues,'' including higher taxes on the wealthy and large corporations.
At the same time, Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and majority leader, said Wednesday that he would not accept any net increase in federal revenues, and that any money raised from eliminating tax breaks or loopholes must be offset by cuts elsewhere in the tax code.
''If the president wants to talk loopholes, we'll be glad to talk loopholes,'' Mr. Cantor said. ''We have said all along that preferences in the code are not something that helps economic growth over all. But, listen, we are not for any proposal that increases taxes. Any type of discussion should be coupled with offsetting tax cuts somewhere else.''
White House officials acknowledge the unrest among Democrats. But they argue that Democrats will be in stronger shape politically heading into November 2012 if they help enact a credible deficit reduction deal, allowing them to mount the argument that they protected Medicare from a much more drastic overhaul by Republicans.
In contrast, they say, failure to produce an agreement could bring unpredictable and unfavorable economic and political consequences.
The officials are convinced that a larger package -- one that would demand deeper cuts and more taxes but put the nation on a sounder fiscal footing for a decade or longer -- is more politically palatable than the $2 trillion-plus package that was being cobbled together in talks presided over by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
And not all Democrats see the push for a major package as a negative.
''We don't need a minideal,'' Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ''We need something that speaks authoritatively to the world that the United States understands its deficit challenge and is prepared to make the hard choices to address it.''

HEADLINE: Taxes And Billionaires

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
The House speaker, John Boehner, suggests that the Republican threat of letting the United States default on its debts is driven by concern for jobs for ordinary Americans.
''We cannot miss this opportunity,'' he told Fox News. ''If we want jobs to come to America, we've got to give American businesspeople the confidence to invest in our economy.''
So take a look at one of the tax loopholes that Congressional Republicans are refusing to close -- even if the cost is that America's credit rating blows up. This loophole has nothing to do with creating jobs and everything to do with protecting some of America's wealthiest financiers. 
If there were an award for Most Unconscionable Tax Loophole, this one would win grand prize.
Wait, wake up! I know that ''tax policy'' makes one's eyes glaze over, but that's how financiers have gotten away with paying a lower tax rate than their chauffeurs or personal trainers. Tycoons have bet for years that the public is too stupid or distracted to note that in many cases they're paying just a 15 percent tax rate.
What's at stake is the ''carried interest'' loophole, and President Obama is pushing to close it. The White House estimates that this would raise $20 billion over a decade. But Congressional Republicans walked out of budget talks rather than discuss raising revenues from measures such as this one.
The biggest threat to the United States this summer probably doesn't come from Iran or Libya but from the home-grown risk that the nation will default on its debts. We don't know the economic consequences for America or the world, and some of the hand-wringing may be overblown -- or maybe not -- but it's reckless of Republicans even to toy with such a threat.
This carried interest loophole benefits managers of financial partnerships such as hedge funds, private equity funds, venture capital funds and real estate funds -- who are among the highest-paid people in the world. John Paulson, a hedge fund manager in New York City, made $4.9 billion last year, top of the chart for hedge fund managers, according to AR Magazine, which follows hedge funds. That's equivalent to the average per capita income of 184,000 Americans, according to my back-of-envelope calculations based on Census Bureau figures.
Mr. Paulson declined to comment on this tax break, but here's how it works. These fund managers are compensated mostly with a performance bonus of 20 percent or more of the profits they make. Under this carried interest loophole, that 20 percent is eligible to be taxed at the long-term capital gains rate (if the fund's underlying assets are held long enough) of just 15 percent rather than the regular personal income rate of 35 percent.
This tax loophole is also intellectually vacuous. The performance fee is a return on the manager's labor, not his or her capital, so there's no reason to give it preferential capital gains treatment.
''The carried interest loophole represents everyone's worst fear about the tax system -- that the rich and powerful get away with murder,'' says Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who has written about the issue. ''Closing the loophole won't fix the budget by itself, but it gets us one step closer to justice.''
At a time when the richest 1 percent of Americans have a greater collective net worth than the entire bottom 90 percent, there are other ways we could raise money while also making tax policy more equitable. The White House is backing some of them in its negotiations with Congress, but others aren't even in play.
One important proposal has to do with founder's stock, the shares people own in companies they found. Professor Fleischer has written an interesting paper persuasively arguing that founder's stock is hugely undertaxed. It, too, is essentially a return on labor, not capital, and shouldn't benefit from the low capital gains rate.
Likewise, Europe is moving toward a financial transactions tax on trades made in financial markets. That is something long championed by some economists -- especially James Tobin, who won a Nobel Prize for his work -- and it would also raise tens of billions of dollars at a time when it is desperately needed. It makes sense.
The larger question is this: Do we try to balance budget deficits just by cutting antipoverty initiatives, college scholarships and other investments in young people and our future? Or do we also seek tax increases from those best able to afford them?
And when Congressional Republicans claim that the reason for their recalcitrance in budget negotiations is concern for the welfare of ordinary Americans, look more closely. Do we really want to close down the American government and risk another global financial crisis to protect the tax bills of billionaires?

HEADLINE: Europeans Caution Ratings Agencies After the Downgrade of Portugal's Debt

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN and JACK EWING; Liz Alderman reported from Paris and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt. Stephen Castle contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
PARIS -- European officials scrambled on Wednesday to prevent the debt crisis in Greece from destabilizing their currency union, threatening credit-rating agencies with possible retaliation after the decision on Tuesday by Moody's Investors Service to downgrade Portugal's debt to junk status. The move raised fears that Spain and Italy might soon find themselves in the line of fire, too.
The downgrade included a warning that Portugal, like Greece, might need a second bailout, pushing European stock markets lower on Wednesday and adding to the woes of Ireland, Spain and Italy as traders dumped their bonds, forcing their interest rates up. 
Portuguese and European officials condemned the ratings agencies for intensifying the euro crisis, suggesting they were overreacting after they were admonished for moving too slowly to warn of problems in the United States. The move by Moody's added ''another speculative element to the situation,'' said Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission.
With both Standard & Poor's and Moody's making it more difficult for policy makers handling the bailouts of Greece, Portugal and Ireland, the European commissioner for financial regulation said the credit-rating agencies needed to tread carefully.
''I invite the agencies, which are under the control of national supervisors, to be extremely careful to fully respect E.U. rules,'' Michel Barnier, the financial regulator, said in a statement from Brussels. ''They should learn the lessons from the past.''
The urgency grew as Europe's biggest banks met with central bankers on Wednesday to figure out ways to put together a second bailout package for Greece that would include contributions from private creditors, despite opposition from the European Central Bank and the rating agency warnings that the proposals discussed so far would be tantamount to a Greek default.
Portugal's junk rating means that Europe's banks may face wider losses if their efforts to help Greece falter. The banks, which met under the auspices of the Institute of International Finance, a lobbying group of the 400 biggest banks and insurance firms in the world, were trying to reshape a proposal to give Athens more time to repay loans as they come due without it being termed a default.
''We need to find a solution that avoids a default,'' Michel Pebereau, the chairman of BNP Paribas, the biggest French bank and one of Europe's biggest holders of troubled Greek debt, said on French radio.
But both banking executives and policy makers seemed to be open to a solution that might involve a brief default and selective write-downs of Greek debt.
Charles H. Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, said that the move by the rating agencies ''helps us see that it may not be practical to devise solutions that avoid all the ratings agencies from judging this a selective default.'' The issue, he added, ''may be more whether any selective default is temporary and surrounded by an environment that can lead to an upgrade of Greece's creditworthiness.''
Germany revived a proposal, opposed by the European Central Bank, to persuade lenders to voluntarily exchange their Greek debt for securities that could be paid back much later. German leaders, who do not want ratings agencies to tell them what to do, seemed to be willing to risk a short-lived, technical default to ensure that banks and other financial institutions contributed to the bailout.
But one worry is that any form of default could disqualify Greek debt from the collateral that the central bank requires to continue extending loans. Some bankers have warned that such an event could touch off a panic that would rival the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
The central bank declined to comment on Wednesday, a day ahead of its planned council meeting, where it is widely expected to bump interest rates up slightly.
But the bigger menace may actually lie hidden, in the form of other financial institutions outside the banking system, including insurance firms and pension funds that are suspected of holding substantial amounts of bonds from troubled European countries.
''If you work backwards and look at Greek public debt and try to understand who owns what, you have a hole of 140 billion euros held by asset managers, pension funds and the like, but there is very little information on the details of those holdings,'' said Gilles Moec, an economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''It's a much bigger pot than what is actually held by banks, but we don't know who owns how much, or in which country,'' he said.
Many banks have already sold their bonds to hedge funds or the E.C.B., which began buying Greek debt more than a year ago.
According to the most optimistic assessments, banks would contribute about 30 billion euros in debt relief to Greece by agreeing to swap maturing bonds for new ones with longer maturities. That sum would be less than 10 percent of Greece's outstanding debt.
Officials have not provided any detail on where the 30 billion euros would come from, though. German commercial institutions, which along with French banks are the most exposed to Greek debt, have only about 2 billion euros in Greek bonds that would be part of a rollover plan, according to the German finance ministry.
For German banks, ''private sector involvement is very small,'' said Jens Bastian, an economist at the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy in Athens. ''The demand for banks to share the burden is coming too late.''
Also unclear is whether billions of euros in insurance contracts against the possibility of a Greek default are concentrated in the hands of a few companies, and if these companies will be able to pay out what they would owe.
But while a Greek default alone would probably be manageable, the biggest fear has been that lenders would abandon other highly indebted countries -- justly or unjustly -- further distressing the finances of an even larger swath of the 17-nation euro zone. Those concerns mounted Wednesday as analysts said the Portuguese downgrade could ricochet back to Ireland, which received a bailout last winter and may also wind up being downgraded to junk.
Meanwhile, analysts and traders are starting to ask whether Italy, which has the next highest debt ratio of any euro zone country after Greece, might get caught up in the whirlwind. S.& P. warned this month that the economy -- the third largest in the euro zone after Germany and France -- is not growing fast enough to cover its debts.

HEADLINE: Live From the White House, a Twitter Town Hall

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
The one thing that President Obama's Twitter town hall was not? A test of his ability to answer in 140 characters.
For more than an hour, Mr. Obama took questions sent in via Twitter, but answered them the old fashioned way -- verbally.
Questions came over Twitter, submitted with the hashtag #AskObama. But they were read aloud by Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder and executive chairman, and answered by Mr. Obama as if he were being interviewed for a television news broadcast. 
For Mr. Obama, that meant answers of hundreds, even thousands of characters -- a clear violation of basic Twitter etiquette, if not the specific rules of Wednesday's town hall format.
It was clear from the early questions that Mr. Obama had no intention of trying to squeeze his answers down. He began his response to a question about the debt ceiling with a phrase that accurately suggested a lengthy answer.
''Let, me as quickly as I can, describe what's at stake with the debt ceiling,'' he started, and then started the rest of his answer with, ''Historically...''
It took a while.
The questions focused primarily on economic factors, a reflection, Mr. Dorsey said, of the large interest in that subject among Twitter followers.
One asked about clean energy and jobs. Another asked what Mr. Obama would do differently, prompting an answer from the president about the difficulty of resolving the housing crisis. Several tweets followed up on the housing issue, urging the president to do more to help people in trouble with their mortgages.
''Most of this is going to be a function of the market slowly improving as people start having confidence in the economy,'' Mr. Obama said in response to a question about the free market and housing. ''Given the size of the housing market, no federal program is going to be able to solve the housing market.''
Somehow among the tens of thousands of regular Americans, a couple of especially non-regular people got to ask questions.
House Speaker John A. Boehner got to ask Mr. Obama ''where are the jobs,'' a question that he probably put to the president during a previously secret meeting at the White House over the weekend.
''Obviously, John's the speaker of the house,'' Mr. Obama said, smiling. ''He's a Republican and so, this is a slightly skewed question. But what he's right about is that we have not seen fast enough job growth relative to the need.''
And then there was a question from Nicholas D. Kristof, a columnist for The New York Times, who asked why Mr. Obama did not get Republicans to agree to an increase in the nation's debt limit during budget talks at the end of last year.
Mr. Obama called Mr. Kristof ''a great columnist,'' but added gently that ''that wasn't the deal that was available.''
Some ordinary Twitter followers were not happy at questions being posed by the powerful and well-connected.
''Kristof & Boehner questions poor judgment,'' said one Twitter message. ''Do NYT reporters and Speaker of the House have too little access to POTUS?''
Most of the Twitter queries were not very tough-minded and gave the president the opportunity to repeat his talking points.
He answered several questions about taxes by saying that millionaires and billionaires should be willing to see their taxes go up. He listed his administration's efforts to help small businesses. And he talked about trying to help veterans coming back from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan find jobs at home.
At the beginning of the hour, Mr. Obama offered his own question, asking Twitter followers how they thought the government should help reduce the deficit. The answers were fairly predictable.
Several suggested cuts in defense spending and ethanol subsidies. They said the government should keep spending on education, and they offered that Mr. Obama should stop sending money to corrupt governments. One suggested ending welfare programs.
For the most part, Mr. Obama agreed, though he defended the government's role in helping people and said defense spending should be cut carefully.
In the end, Mr. Obama's questions were pretty typical.
But one thing that did change: the length of the questions. Washington is a town where reporters are famous for their sometimes rambling, three-part questions during presidential news conferences. Maybe if they had to ask their questions in 140 characters, more questions could be asked.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: London Event Helps Fill Coffers

BYLINE: By RAVI SOMAIYA

 BODY:
LONDON -- Mitt Romney told reporters outside a lavish town house in the heart of the upscale Mayfair neighborhood on Wednesday evening that he was ''meeting a few friends'' while in London. The invitation from his campaign to attend an evening reception, on a street where a house was listed recently for $26 million, was more candid: ''Suggested contribution to Romney for President: $2,500 per person.''
The event's co-chairmen and co-chairwomen included the hedge fund billionaire Louis Bacon, the New York Jets owner Woody Johnson and two dozen others, mostly drawn from London's still-booming financial sector. The perfectly coiffed guests were deposited by a series of sleek limousines. 
Mr. Romney, the Republican former governor of Massachusetts, is not the first presidential candidate to tap into the pool of wealthy American expatriates living in London (donations from foreign citizens are prohibited). While a candidate in 2008, Barack Obama attended a fund-raiser at the home of Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, at which the actress Gwyneth Paltrow was among the ''event chairs.'' On the Republican side, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and Senator John McCain of Arizona also took over illustrious addresses in and around the capital for an evening's fund-raising during that campaign.
''We're in an era where presidential candidates are seeking out every dollar they can, wherever they can find it,'' said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a group that advocates for campaign finance reform. Now that the practice has been established, he said, candidates will probably continue to go ''where the money is.''
The event was held on the same day that Mr. Romney's campaign released its fund-raising totals for the second quarter. Mr. Romney reported raising $18.25 million, with $12.6 million on hand, far outpacing his rivals for the nomination.
A statement about the reception from the Romney campaign referred to his support among ''Americans living abroad,'' and touched on issues like the weak economy and slow job market in the United States, but did not mention fund-raising outright.
Outside the event, as he buttoned his dark suit, Mr. Romney told reporters that he was in London for meetings with officials. He met Wednesday with former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, as well as Britain's minister of defense, Liam Fox, with whom, he said, he discussed ''global affairs.''
A British government official who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting said Mr. Romney would also be meeting with Britain's national security adviser, Peter Ricketts, and other officials Thursday afternoon. Prime Minister David Cameron ''might stop by,'' the official said, though there were no concrete plans for the two men to meet.
Though a spokesman declined to say whether Mr. Romney would return to Britain for further events, Mr. Wertheimer said he suspected that he and others seeking the White House in 2012 would be back. ''If the money is there to be raised,'' he said, ''I would expect them to try and raise it.''
But even in Britain, competition among the Republican field is fierce. The Boston Globe reported last week that Mr. Romney's Wednesday evening fund-raiser was to have been held at the home of the financier Evelyn de Rothschild and his wife, Lynn Forester de Rothschild. That is, until Mrs. Rothschild held a fund-raiser in her New York home -- for Mr. Romney's rival Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah. Mrs. Rothschild told The Globe that they had raised $1.2 million.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In an Earthbound Era, Heaven Has to Wait

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI. 
Gail Collins is on book leave.

 BODY:
Friday morning, barring thunder or blunder, the space shuttle Atlantis will cough smoke, spit fire and, in a spectacle no less dazzling for its familiarity, bust free of its earthly trappings, some 2,250 tons somehow rising above the clouds.
And that will be that. Roll the credits. Its scheduled takeoff -- and slated return 12 days later -- are the last in the U.S. shuttle program, which now draws to an unsettling close. 
Ending it, I suppose, makes good sense. Its benefits grew increasingly debatable, at least in relation to its cost: around $200 billion over four decades (including the planning years). Money is tight. What budget NASA still has might be better used in other ways.
But as the centerpiece of our country's gaudily ambitious space adventures, the shuttle program was a pre-eminent symbol of our belief that there were literally no limits to where we could go and no boundaries to what we could accomplish, so long as we hitched our ingenuity to our imagination and marshaled the requisite will. And there's no real sense of what big dreams, if any, lie beyond Atlantis. The program's end carries the force of cruel metaphor, coming at a time when limits are all we talk about. When we have no stars in our eyes.
The current political debate and the nascent 2012 election season are utterly earthbound, with a tone so gloomy it's often shocking. Instead of the defiant trumpet blast that it's morning in America -- Ronald Reagan's retort to the so-called malaise of the Jimmy Carter years -- we have anxious promises to hold back the night.
''Let's stop this American downward spiral,'' Rick Perry, the Texas governor, told a conservative convention last month, as he rehearsed lugubrious lines he might use in a presidential bid.
Jon Huntsman, declaring his candidacy for the presidency a few days later, observed, ''For the first time in history, we are passing down to the next generation a country that is less powerful, less compassionate, less competitive and less confident than the one we got.'' Hard decisions had to be made, he added, in order ''to avert disaster.''
To some degree, such dire language reflects predictable political gamesmanship. By lamenting the status quo, candidates disparage its designated steward -- in this case, President Obama.
And the country has certainly survived more devastating and sustained periods of economic distress than the present one, finding renewed prosperity on the far side.
But Americans right now are profoundly doubtful. Shaken. For many, the fear isn't just that there's no imminent end to high unemployment and tepid economic growth, but that we've turned a fundamental corner and our best days really are behind us.
A Gallup/USA Today poll conducted in late April found that 55 percent of Americans considered it unlikely that children today would have better lives than their parents, while only 44 percent considered it likely. Those responses were the most negative, by far, over the last quarter-century, and they undercut a central tenet of American optimism.
Just last week the Democratic pollster Mark J. Penn, writing in Time magazine, concluded that ''the country is going through one of its longest sustained periods of unhappiness and pessimism ever.'' He cited a recent survey suggesting that ''more than two-thirds of the country sees the past decade as a period of decline.''
And 39 percent of the respondents in a recent New York Times/CBS News poll characterized that decline as permanent, at least in economic terms. That was a marked increase from 28 percent who said so last fall.
It's in this context that many Democrats and Republicans alike nurse a new isolationism, convinced that we can no longer afford broad engagement in the world. It's in this context that immigrants, wanting pieces of a pie deemed more finite, are vilified.
And it's in this context that hard-line conservatives cling to the notion of American exceptionalism. They can't shut out what's in their peripheral vision -- economies in China, India and Brazil that are expanding much faster than ours -- and doth protest too much.
In Washington and in state capitals, the squabbling is epic, and it's focused not on what we might dare to build but on what we might manage to preserve, not on degrees of progress but on gradations of regress: how many parks, schools, libraries need be closed.
Despite the president's exhortation that we chart the frontiers of innovation, there's no grand mission that represents the kind of storehouse for our confidence and emblem of our can-do spirit that space exploration once did.
What has happened to our sense of discovery? I'm not sure, but I know what will happen to the spaceship Discovery, one of four remaining shuttles in the fleet. It's bound for the Smithsonian, where we stockpile the glories of yesteryear.

HEADLINE: German Emotions Are Stirred by Report Of a Secret Tank Deal

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Ethan Bronner contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Stefan Pauly from Berlin.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing growing criticism from across the political spectrum here after news of a multibillion-dollar deal for the secret sale of 200 tanks to Saudi Arabia leaked from the national security council that approved it.
The government has responded with what the German news media have called an ''iron silence,'' which has fueled rather than dampened the furor over a sale that experts estimate would be worth roughly $2.5 billion. 
Germany strained ties with its NATO allies when it abstained in the United Nations Security Council on the resolution authorizing military action to protect Libyan civilians. Now the government has approved the shipment of the 68-ton tanks to Saudi Arabia even as the image of Saudi tanks rolling into Bahrain to help suppress the protests there remains fresh in the public's mind.
According to the Web site of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, which produces the tank, the latest version, the Leopard 2A7+, includes ''nonlethal capabilities'' and an ''obstacle clearance blade'' almost like a plow in the front that can clear debris and roadblocks.
''This would be a perfect tank to drive into Bahrain and crack down on any uprising,'' said Jan Grebe, a researcher at the Bonn International Center for Conversion, a nonprofit research institute that deals with security and development issues. ''It's also a good tank to fight any demonstrations in Riyadh.''
Not only political opponents but even members of Mrs. Merkel's own party have criticized the sale on human rights grounds. The deal also reveals the shifting Israeli attitude toward the Saudis. Israel has notably not complained about the arms deal, and government sources here say that it was cleared with both the Americans and the Israelis before it went through.
Once viewed as a potential threat by Jerusalem, the government in Saudi Arabia is increasingly viewed as a guarantor of stability in a region in upheaval, as revolutionary fervor sweeps through the Middle East.
''Every step that we take in the region we take with the condition that it promotes the security and the right to exist of Israel,'' said Philipp Missfelder, a foreign policy spokesman for Mrs. Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats.
While Mr. Missfelder cautioned that he was not privy to the secret negotiations in the German security council, a deal to support Saudi Arabia was in Germany's interest.
''We cannot act as though we can paint the world pink and everything will be O.K.,'' he said. ''We are a grown-up country and must define our policies through strategic interests.''
The sale could also be seen as an effort to placate the Saudis, who were infuriated earlier this year when President Obama sided with the protesters in Egypt and helped to usher Hosni Mubarak from power and again when NATO began its air campaign against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya.
The national security council is led by Mrs. Merkel and is made up of top ministers, the head of her chancellery staff and, in an advisory capacity, the inspector general of the military. The council rarely leaks unauthorized information. That news of the council's approval of the Leopard tank deal was published by the news magazine Der Spiegel over the weekend was itself viewed in Germany as a sign of the discord and high emotions surrounding the issue.
Nick Brown, editor in chief of Jane's International Defense Review, cautioned that the deal was not finalized and that it could still fall through, but that if it happened it ''would be a really big shift.''
''The Saudis have been asking for Leopards for quite a long, long time and the Germans keep saying no,'' Mr. Brown said, referring to requests for a version of the tank dating to the 1980s.
He cautioned that although the tanks could be used for urban warfare, they were better suited for military uses than shutting down protests. The armored vehicles sent into Bahrain were smaller ones from the Saudi national guard, rather than the best army tanks, and were used only to protect property, not against demonstrators.
In a raucous and passionate debate in Parliament on Wednesday, Jurgen Trittin, leader of the Green Party, declared that the government was ''stimulating an arms race in the Middle East.'' Joachim Pfeiffer, an economic spokesman for Mrs. Merkel's party, promptly accused him of hypocrisy on the floor of the Bundestag.
Germany has aroused fears in recent years that it is going its own way more often, a concern that was heightened by the decision to break with its allies on the intervention in Libya. The sale of Leopard tanks fits the growing impression in many corners of a mercantilist Germany, whose foreign policy is first and foremost concerned with its own economic interests.
Even as the German government demanded budget cuts in Greece, officials also insisted that that struggling European partner honor its military contracts. Germany is the No. 1 arms dealer to Greece.
Despite its image as a pacifist country, chastened by both the atrocities committed during World War II and its total defeat, Germany is a major weapons producer and dealer, responsible for 11 percent of global conventional arms exports, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, ranking it third in the world, behind the United States and Russia. The United States is not only the largest exporter of weapons in the world, but has also long supplied arms to the Saudi Arabian military.
For a decade after World War II, Germany had no military industry, forbidden by the victorious allies from producing weapons. As German industries began to increase production, tanks using the same powerful engines as trucks were one of their strong suits, said Michael Brzoska, a professor and director of the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg. Today, the military industry employs around 80,000 people, he said.
But as European governments cut back spending on weapons systems, those jobs would disappear without new markets.
''There has been a perception that Germany is more restrictive toward exports to the Middle East than France or the United Kingdom,'' said Mark Bromley, senior researcher at the Stockholm institute's arms transfers program. ''The fall in defense budgets is putting pressure on governments to help industry secure markets abroad, and not just in Germany.''

HEADLINE: Dirtier Air and Higher Costs Possible if Indian Point Closes, Report Says

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
Shutting down the Indian Point nuclear power plant would lead to significantly dirtier air and higher electric bills for New York City residents, according to a report commissioned by the city that is circulating among state officials in Albany.
The report, a copy of which was obtained on Tuesday by The New York Times, concludes that, for the next several years, there probably will not be enough new power generated to replace the 2,000 megawatts produced by the two reactors at Indian Point. That shortfall could leave the city with a less reliable supply of electricity and a greater risk of brownouts, the report finds. 
Those findings buttress the stated views of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has said that Indian Point probably cannot be shut down ''for the next four or five years.'' That position could leave him at odds with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has told executives of Indian Point's owner, Entergy, that he was determined to close the plant, which stands along the Hudson River about 35 miles north of Midtown.
The licenses for the plant's reactors are scheduled for renewal in 2013 and 2015. Together, the reactors produce as much as 25 percent of the power consumed in Consolidated Edison's service area, which includes New York City and Westchester County.
Asked for a response to the report, Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, indicated that it would not deter the governor. He reiterated a statement from last month that said that ''the governor's longstanding position with respect to closing Indian Point has been clear, and this administration intends to follow through with implementing that policy.''
Three projects are under way that could replace some of the power that would be lost if Indian Point closed. But even after the completion of all three -- power plants in Astoria, Queens, and Bayonne, N.J., and a transmission cable from New Jersey to Manhattan -- there would not be enough power to meet the standards for reliability required in the city, the report says.
When demand for electricity rises in the summer of 2016, the first peak period after the reactors could be retired, ''given the current prospects for new capacity in New York, resource adequacy will fall below acceptable levels at that point,'' it says.
Last week, the mayor addressed that potential problem in a radio interview. ''If you want to shut down Indian Point, you probably cannot do it for four or five years anyways because we don't have alternative power sources,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Now, there are plants being built and power lines bringing power from up north into the city, but it's four or five years before they get here.''
The commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, Caswell F. Holloway, said the report was not intended to bolster an argument against closing Indian Point, but to explore the implications of a shutdown. It was produced by Charles River Associates, a research firm in Boston, Mass.
''This really provides a deep layer of backup to what the mayor said,'' Mr. Holloway said. ''This analysis shows that any plan is going to require time to implement and tough decisions about the economic, reliability and environmental trade-offs that would be necessary to do it.''
On another issue important to the mayor, the report says that a shutdown of Indian Point ''would substantially reduce the possibility'' of achieving the goals for reducing the city's carbon emissions that were laid out in Mr. Bloomberg's long-term plan known as PlaNYC. It estimates that the amount of carbon emissions and nitrogen oxides in the air in the city and state would increase by at least 5 percent to 10 percent because replacing Indian Point's output would require more fuel-burning plants. If none of the lost power was replaced by renewable sources of energy, like wind farms, the increase in carbon emissions could be as high as 15 percent, the report states.
A shutdown also would drive up the wholesale cost of electricity in the city and state by about 10 percent, or a total of $1.5 billion a year, it says. That would translate to a rise of 5 percent to 10 percent in the amount residential customers pay Con Edison for the electricity they consume. Those consumers also would most likely bear some of the costs of the subsidies that would be necessary to entice developers to build new power plants, the report says.
The New York League of Conservation Voters has not taken a stand on whether Indian Point should be shut down, said its president, Marcia Bystryn. But she said she found the report's analysis of the potential environmental effect convincing.
''Whatever other alternatives are put in place to generate that power that we'll lose, the air will inevitably be dirtier,'' she said.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Mexico Sign Trucking Deal

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- Mexican truckers will be able to carry goods deep into the United States, and vice versa, under a deal signed Wednesday in Mexico City to keep a 17-year-old promise.
As part of the deal, Mexico will eliminate tariffs on $2.3 billion of American goods and agricultural products as soon as the first Mexican truck obtains a permit and is allowed to enter the United States. As a preliminary step, the tariffs will be reduced 50 percent by the end of this week.
The United States had refused to honor a condition of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement that allowed Mexican trucks to carry shipments across the border to a final destination. Regulations instead required those trucks to unload shortly after crossing the border. After more than a decade of waiting and negotiating, Mexico retaliated by imposing tariffs in 2009. 
In March, President Obama and the Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, agreed on a preliminary framework for compromise. Under the terms of the final deal, signed by their transportation secretaries, both sides agreed to drop their barriers for a trial period of three years.
The deal furthers the Obama administration's goal of expanding foreign trade to support domestic growth, but it was signed quietly, with little advance notice. The White House declined to comment, referring questions to the Transportation Department, which described it as ''a win for trade.''
''We will create jobs and opportunity for our people and support economic development in both nations,'' the transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said in a statement.
The reaction was much louder outside the administration.
Business groups immediately hailed the deal, which will reduce the cost of moving goods across the border. Under current rules, a single shipment between the two countries often requires three trucks, including a short trip on a class of trucks that specializes in shuttling across the border.
''If we're going to boost U.S. exports and create jobs here at home, we must hold on to our major export markets, such as Mexico,'' said Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''Today's news will help American businesses to do just that.''
Opponents said they would seek to stop the deal from being carried out.
Three congressmen, two Democrats and a Republican, said Wednesday that they were introducing legislation to block the financing the government needs to supervise Mexican trucks.
''As we debate deep and harsh cuts to programs that help middle-class families, it is outrageous that taxpayers are being told to foot the bill for the Mexican trucking industry to comply with American safety standards,'' said Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon.
A trade group for drivers who own their trucks, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, filed a petition on Wednesday with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit requesting a review of the deal's legality.
''This program will jeopardize the livelihoods of tens of thousands of U.S.-based small-business truckers and professional truck drivers and undermine the standard of living for the rest of the driver community,'' said Todd Spencer, the group's executive vice president.
The free trade agreement among Canada, Mexico and the United States, known as Nafta, made clear that trucks could cross the border. But in 1995 the Clinton administration closed the southern gates, citing concerns about safety.
Mexico won a 2001 ruling allowing it to impose retaliatory tariffs, but it chose to keep talking with the Bush administration, resulting in a 2007 agreement on a similar pilot program.
Two years later, Congress cut off the financing, and Mexico responded with tariffs.
Under the new deal, Mexican truckers can begin to apply for permits on Thursday. American officials estimate that the first trucks could roll across the border next month.
Like foreign airlines, Mexican truckers will be allowed to carry goods to and from destinations in the United States but not within the country. They must comply with American safety standards, and are subject to additional safeguards including electronic monitoring to ensure that they take regular breaks from driving. They also must pass drug screening and demonstrate an ability to speak English.

HEADLINE: Assimilation's Failure, Terrorism's Rise

BYLINE: By KENAN MALIK. 
Kenan Malik, a British writer and broadcaster, is the author of ''From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Legacy.''

 BODY:
London
SIX years ago today, on July 7, 2005, Islamist suicide bombers attacked London's transit system. They blew up three subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and leaving a nation groping for answers.
In one sense the meaning of 7/7 is as clear to Britons as that of 9/11 is to Americans. It was a savage, brutal attack intended to sow mayhem and terror. Yet whereas 9/11 was the work of a foreign terrorist group, 7/7 was the work of British citizens. The question that haunts London, but that Washington has so far barely had to face, is why four men born and brought up in Britain were gripped by such fanatic zeal for a murderous, medieval dogma.
British authorities have expended much effort in seeking to understand how the 7/7 terrorists acquired their perverted ideas and became ''radicalized.'' In the immediate wake of the attacks, much ink was spilled over the role of extremist preachers and radical mosques. More recently, the focus has shifted to universities as recruitment centers for terrorists. 
But this obsession with radicalization misses the point. The real question is not how people like Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the 7/7 bombers, came to be radicalized, but why so many young men, who by all accounts are intelligent, articulate and integrated, come to find this violent, reactionary ideology so attractive. To answer it, we need to look not at extremist preachers or university lecturers but also at public policy, and in particular the failed policy of multiculturalism.
Multiculturalism has become a fraught issue throughout Europe in recent years. A rancorous chorus of populist politicians, like Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Jimmie Akesson in Sweden, have made major electoral gains by stoking fears about multiculturalism. Mainstream politicians have joined in, too. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany have recently made deeply critical speeches, and the Dutch government decided last month to dump a decades-old policy of multiculturalism.
The real target of much of this criticism, however, is not multiculturalism but immigration and immigrants -- especially Muslims. Mr. Wilders, leader of the Freedom Party, the third largest in the Dutch Parliament, has campaigned for an end to all non-Western immigration, a ban on mosque building and the outlawing of the Koran. Mr. Akesson, whose far-right Sweden Democrats shocked the nation by winning 20 seats in last year's parliamentary elections, denounces immigration as the biggest threat facing Sweden since World War II. Centrists have responded not by challenging such prejudice but by appropriating the right's arguments in an effort to hold on to votes.
Part of the difficulty in thinking about multiculturalism is that it has come to have two meanings that are rarely distinguished. On one hand, it refers to a society made diverse by mass immigration, and on the other to the policies governments employ to manage such diversity. The failure to distinguish between these meanings has made it easier to use attacks on multiculturalism as a means of blaming minorities for the failure of government policy.
Mass immigration has been a boon to Western Europe. It has brought great economic benefits and helped create societies that are less insular, more vibrant and more cosmopolitan. But the policies designed to manage immigration have been largely a disaster. To see why, one needs only to look at the experience of Britain and Germany. Both have adopted multicultural policies, though they have taken different paths. The consequences, however, have been similar.
Thirty years ago, Britain was a very different place than it is now. Racism was vicious, visceral and often fatal. ''Paki bashing,'' the pastime of hunting down and beating up Britons with brown skin, became a national sport in certain circles. I remember organizing patrols on the streets of East London during the 1980s to protect South Asian families from rampaging racist thugs. Workplace discrimination was endemic and police brutality frighteningly common. Anger at such treatment came to an explosive climax in the riots that rocked London, Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol and other cities during the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was in response to this rage that Britain's multicultural policies emerged.
The British government developed a new political framework for engaging with minority groups. Britain was now in effect divided into a number of ethnic boxes -- Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, African, Caribbean and so on. The claims of minorities upon society were defined less by the social and political needs of individuals than by the box to which they belonged. Political power and financial resources were distributed by ethnicity.
The new policy did not empower individuals; instead, it enhanced the authority of so-called community leaders, often the most conservative voices, who owed their positions and influence largely to their relationship with the state. In 1997, the Islamist groups that had led the campaign against Salman Rushdie's ''Satanic Verses'' during the 1980s helped set up the Muslim Council of Britain. Its first general secretary, Iqbal Sacranie, had once declared death ''too easy'' for Mr. Rushdie. Polls showed that fewer than 10 percent of British Muslims believed that the council represented their views, yet for more than a decade the British government treated it as their official representative.
Politicians effectively abandoned their responsibility to engage directly with minorities, subcontracting it out to often reactionary ''leaders.''
If the prime minister wanted to get a message to the ''Muslim community,'' he called in the council or visited a mosque. Rather than appealing to Muslims as British citizens, politicians preferred to see them as people whose primary loyalty was to their faith and who could be politically engaged only by other Muslims. As a result religious -- and Islamist -- figures gained new legitimacy in their own neighborhoods and came to be seen by the wider society as the authentic voice of British Muslims.
More progressive movements became sidelined. Today ''radical'' in an Islamic context means someone who is a religious fundamentalist. Thirty years ago it meant the opposite: a secularist who challenged both racism in the streets and the power of the mosques. Secularism was once strong within Muslim communities, but it has been squeezed out by the new relationship between the state and religious leaders.
Many second-generation British Muslims now find themselves detached from both the religious traditions of their parents, which they often reject, and the wider secular society that insists on viewing them simply as Muslims. A few are drawn inevitably to extremist Islamist groups where they discover a sense of identity and of belonging. It is this that has made them open to radicalization.
A similar process has taken place in Germany. Postwar immigrants, primarily from Turkey, came not as potential citizens, but as ''gastarbeiter,'' or guest workers, who were expected to eventually return to their native countries. Over time, immigrants became transformed from a temporary necessity to a permanent presence, partly because Germany continued relying on their labor, and partly because they -- and especially their children -- came to see Germany as home.
The German state, however, continued to view them as outsiders and to refuse them citizenship. Unlike the practices in Britain, France or the United States, German citizenship is based on blood, not soil: it is granted automatically only to children born of German parents. Germany has nearly four million people of Turkish origin today, many of them born there, but fewer than 25 percent have managed to become citizens. Instead, multiculturalism became the German answer to the ''Turkish problem.''
In place of citizenship and a genuine status in society, the state ''allowed'' immigrants to keep their own culture, language and lifestyles. One consequence was the creation of parallel communities. Without any incentive to participate in the national community, many Turks became dangerously inward-looking. Today, almost a third of Turkish adults in Germany regularly attend mosque, a higher rate than elsewhere in Western Europe and higher than in many parts of Turkey. The increasing isolation of second-generation German Turks has made some more open to radical Islamism. The uncovering last year of German jihadis fighting in Afghanistan should therefore have come as no surprise.
In Britain, the promotion of multicultural policies led to the de facto treatment of individuals from minority groups not as citizens but simply as members of particular ethnic units. In Germany, the formal denial of citizenship to immigrants led to the policy of multiculturalism. In both cases this has resulted in the creation of fragmented societies, the scapegoating of immigrants and the rise of both populist and Islamist rhetoric.
IN neither Britain nor Germany did multiculturalism create militant Islam, but in both it helped clear a space for it among Muslims. The challenge facing Europe today, therefore, is how to reject multiculturalism as a political policy while embracing the diversity that immigration brings. No country has yet succeeded in doing so.
In principle, the French assimilationist resolve to treat everyone as a citizen, not simply as an inhabitant of a particular ethnic box, is welcome. Yet as evidenced by police brutality against North African youth and the state ban on burqas, France continues to tolerate, and even encourage, policies that polarize society in the name of colorblindness. And although the relationship between Muslims and the state is healthier in America than in most European countries, the furor over a proposal to build an Islamic center and mosque near ground zero in New York reveals that the same fears and problems that haunt Europe exist in the United States.
There is no off-the-shelf solution. But the anniversary of 7/7 should remind us of how much is at stake in finding one.

HEADLINE: In Her First Week at the I.M.F., a New Leader Stresses Diversity and Respect

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Christine Lagarde said Wednesday that meetings had consumed 18 of her first 24 hours as the new head of the International Monetary Fund, as the former French finance minister seeks to lift her staff's bruised morale while helping to preserve Europe's financial stability.
On Tuesday, she met at the fund's headquarters in Washington with employees still shaken by the abrupt resignation of her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, after he was charged with the sexual assault of a hotel maid. On Friday, she holds her first board meeting to consider another round of emergency financing for Greece. 
''I thought it was necessary to come back to D.C. very promptly simply because there are so many issues to address,'' Ms. Lagarde said by way of introduction at her first official news conference. ''It cannot wait for another summer holiday. Here I am, and for good.''
When Ms. Lagarde last met with reporters here, during the fund's annual spring meetings, she made a point of speaking mostly in French. On Wednesday, settling into her new international role, she spoke in English even when addressed in French.
She mostly dodged questions about Greece, saying that she would not prefigure Friday's meeting, but she did provide a measure of her thinking on the fund's mission and priorities.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a member of the Socialist Party in France, expanded the fund's focus on financial stability to include broader goals like reduced unemployment. He argued that the benefits of prosperity did not necessarily flow to the broader populace.
Ms. Lagarde, by contrast, is a political conservative. She said that she needed time to study the fund's policies before offering her own opinions. But she sounded a note of caution, saying that she supported a move toward ''comprehensive'' measures of efficacy, but that the fund ''should not become a specialized boutique to reduce unemployment.''
The fund was created by the United States and its allies after World War II as a lender of last resort for troubled governments. Since that time it has always been run by a European, though the United States maintains effective control.
Ms. Lagarde campaigned to replace Mr. Strauss-Kahn largely on the strength of Europe's determination to maintain that leadership. But her victory required the support of emerging economies, who want to play a larger role. Ms. Lagarde indicated Wednesday that she was likely to expand the number of her deputies to four from three to make room for the elevation of a Chinese official at the fund, Min Zhu.
Ms. Lagarde also said during her campaign that a female executive would be an advantage for the fund, reducing what she described as the testosterone level.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn was allowed to remain atop the fund after the disclosure of an affair in 2008 with a subordinate, a decision that some considered a mistake.
A number of women have come forward in recent months to describe the fund as a problematic workplace, where some superiors felt free to press subordinates for dates and little effort was made to prevent or to punish sexual harassment. Officials at the fund have disputed their characterizations, and a group of several hundred female employees signed a public letter defending the fund as a workplace.
On Wednesday, Ms. Lagarde said that increasing the diversity of the fund's staff would be a priority. ''Together with diversity comes respect for everybody,'' Ms. Lagarde said, ''and it's been the case in the past that people have been respected and I will make sure that they continue to be respected no matter what their differences are.''
The fund has made a number of recent changes to improve its workplace culture, including instituting a more restrictive policy on relationships with subordinates. Ms. Lagarde's contract includes a new injunction, ''You shall strive to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.'' And Ms. Lagarde noted Wednesday that she would soon attend a new ethics program now required for all employees.
She will make $467,940 in her new job, plus a stipend of $83,760, all of it untaxed.

HEADLINE: Assimilation's Failure, Terrorism's Rise

BYLINE: By KENAN MALIK. 
Kenan Malik, a British writer and broadcaster, is the author of ''From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Legacy.''

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
London
SIX years ago today, on July 7, 2005, Islamist suicide bombers attacked London's transit system. They blew up three subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and leaving a nation groping for answers.
In one sense the meaning of 7/7 is as clear to Britons as that of 9/11 is to Americans. It was a savage, brutal attack intended to sow mayhem and terror. Yet whereas 9/11 was the work of a foreign terrorist group, 7/7 was the work of British citizens. The question that haunts London, but that Washington has so far barely had to face, is why four men brought up in Britain were gripped by such fanatic zeal for a murderous, medieval dogma.
British authorities have expended much effort in seeking to understand how the 7/7 terrorists acquired their perverted ideas and became ''radicalized.'' In the immediate wake of the attacks, much ink was spilled over the role of extremist preachers and radical mosques. More recently, the focus has shifted to universities as recruitment centers for terrorists. 
But this obsession with radicalization misses the point. The real question is not how people like Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the 7/7 bombers, came to be radicalized, but why so many young men, who by all accounts are intelligent, articulate and integrated, come to find this violent, reactionary ideology so attractive. To answer it, we need to look not at extremist preachers or university lecturers but also at public policy, and in particular the failed policy of multiculturalism.
Multiculturalism has become a fraught issue throughout Europe in recent years. A rancorous chorus of populist politicians, like Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Jimmie Akesson in Sweden, have made major electoral gains by stoking fears about multiculturalism. Mainstream politicians have joined in, too. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany have recently made deeply critical speeches, and the Dutch government decided last month to dump a decades-old policy of multiculturalism.
The real target of much of this criticism, however, is not multiculturalism but immigration and immigrants -- especially Muslims. Mr. Wilders, leader of the Freedom Party, the third largest in the Dutch Parliament, has campaigned for an end to all non-Western immigration, a ban on mosque building and the outlawing of the Koran. Mr. Akesson, whose far-right Sweden Democrats shocked the nation by winning 20 seats in last year's parliamentary elections, denounces immigration as the biggest threat facing Sweden since World War II. Centrists have responded not by challenging such prejudice but by appropriating the right's arguments in an effort to hold on to votes.
Part of the difficulty in thinking about multiculturalism is that it has come to have two meanings that are rarely distinguished. On one hand, it refers to a society made diverse by mass immigration, and on the other to the policies governments employ to manage such diversity. The failure to distinguish between these meanings has made it easier to use attacks on multiculturalism as a means of blaming minorities for the failure of government policy.
Mass immigration has been a boon to Western Europe. It has brought great economic benefits and helped create societies that are less insular, more vibrant and more cosmopolitan. But the policies designed to manage immigration have been largely a disaster. To see why, one needs only to look at the experience of Britain and Germany. Both have adopted multicultural policies, though they have taken different paths. The consequences, however, have been similar.
Thirty years ago, Britain was a very different place than it is now. Racism was vicious, visceral and often fatal. ''Paki bashing,'' the pastime of hunting down and beating up Britons with brown skin, became a national sport in certain circles. I remember organizing patrols on the streets of East London during the 1980s to protect South Asian families from rampaging racist thugs. Workplace discrimination was endemic and police brutality frighteningly common. Anger at such treatment came to an explosive climax in the riots that rocked London, Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol and other cities during the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was in response to this rage that Britain's multicultural policies emerged.
The British government developed a new political framework for engaging with minority groups. Britain was now in effect divided into a number of ethnic boxes -- Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, African, Caribbean and so on. The claims of minorities upon society were defined less by the social and political needs of individuals than by the box to which they belonged. Political power and financial resources were distributed by ethnicity.
The new policy did not empower individuals; instead, it enhanced the authority of so-called community leaders, often the most conservative voices, who owed their positions and influence largely to their relationship with the state. In 1997, the Islamist groups that had led the campaign against Salman Rushdie's ''Satanic Verses'' during the 1980s helped set up the Muslim Council of Britain. Its first general secretary, Iqbal Sacranie, had once declared death ''too easy'' for Mr. Rushdie. Polls showed that fewer than 10 percent of British Muslims believed that the council represented their views, yet for more than a decade the British government treated it as their official representative.
Politicians effectively abandoned their responsibility to engage directly with minorities, subcontracting it out to often reactionary ''leaders.''
If the prime minister wanted to get a message to the ''Muslim community,'' he called in the council or visited a mosque. Rather than appealing to Muslims as British citizens, politicians preferred to see them as people whose primary loyalty was to their faith and who could be politically engaged only by other Muslims. As a result religious -- and Islamist -- figures gained new legitimacy in their own neighborhoods and came to be seen by the wider society as the authentic voice of British Muslims.
More progressive movements became sidelined. Today ''radical'' in an Islamic context means someone who is a religious fundamentalist. Thirty years ago it meant the opposite: a secularist who challenged both racism in the streets and the power of the mosques. Secularism was once strong within Muslim communities, but it has been squeezed out by the new relationship between the state and religious leaders.
Many second-generation British Muslims now find themselves detached from both the religious traditions of their parents, which they often reject, and the wider secular society that insists on viewing them simply as Muslims. A few are drawn inevitably to extremist Islamist groups where they discover a sense of identity and of belonging. It is this that has made them open to radicalization.
A similar process has taken place in Germany. Postwar immigrants, primarily from Turkey, came not as potential citizens, but as ''gastarbeiter,'' or guest workers, who were expected to eventually return to their native countries. Over time, immigrants became transformed from a temporary necessity to a permanent presence, partly because Germany continued relying on their labor, and partly because they -- and especially their children -- came to see Germany as home.
The German state, however, continued to view them as outsiders and to refuse them citizenship. Unlike the practices in Britain, France or the United States, German citizenship is based on blood, not soil: it is granted automatically only to children born of German parents. Germany has nearly four million people of Turkish origin today, many of them born there, but fewer than 25 percent have managed to become citizens. Instead, multiculturalism became the German answer to the ''Turkish problem.''
In place of citizenship and a genuine status in society, the state ''allowed'' immigrants to keep their own culture, language and lifestyles. One consequence was the creation of parallel communities. Without any incentive to participate in the national community, many Turks became dangerously inward-looking. Today, almost a third of Turkish adults in Germany regularly attend mosque, a higher rate than elsewhere in Western Europe and higher than in many parts of Turkey. The increasing isolation of second-generation German Turks has made some more open to radical Islamism. The uncovering last year of German jihadis fighting in Afghanistan should therefore have come as no surprise.

IN neither Britain nor Germany did multiculturalism create militant Islam, but in both it helped clear a space for it among Muslims.

HEADLINE: How Health Insurance Affects Health

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A study by some of the country's top health economists aims to estimate the effects of not having health insurance -- and the effects are large. 

 BODY:
In the nearly year and a half since Congress passed the health care overhaul, one of the main purposes of the bill -- to provide health insurance to people who lack it -- has often been lost in the debate. Instead, supporters and opponents of the bill have argued over whether the bill is constitutional, and they've argued over whether the bill will cut medical costs more or less than the Congressional Budget Office projects.
Those are obviously important issues. But so is the fact that, unlike any other rich country in the world, the United States has tens of millions of people who do not have health insurance and therefore go without some forms of medical care.
A new study being released today, by some of the country's top health economists, aims to estimate the effects of not having health insurance -- and the effects are large.
The researchers used a lottery that the state of Oregon conducted in 2008 to determine who would become eligible to apply for a limited number of Medicaid slots. The researchers compared the health outcomes of those who won the lottery (many of whom then received insurance) and those who did not (who were more likely to remain uninsured).
The researchers have followed the subjects for only a year so far, so the paper has some clear limitations. But it nonetheless suggests that having health insurance substantially improves health. Expanding insurance does not save society money -- as some advocates of preventive medicine have claimed -- but it does appear to make people mentally and physically healthier.The authors point out that the insurance in question -- Medicaid -- is the same one that many uninsured people will receive as part of the health care law. For that reason, among others, the paper suggests that the law is likely to improve the health and well-being of many of the uninsured. 
Katherine Baicker -- one of the authors and a Harvard economist who served in President George W. Bush's administration -- wrote the following to me, via e-mail:
There has been a great deal of uncertainty about how much of a difference Medicaid makes to enrollees. Some argued that Medicaid isn't 'good' insurance coverage and that a Medicaid card doesn't get enrollees much access to care. Others argued that the uninsured already have access to care through the emergency room, clinics, or charity care. 
Our study shows that gaining access to Medicaid matters on a number of different dimensions, including increased access to and use of health care. 
The authors also point out that the benefits of health insurance aren't only medical. They're financial too, as is the case with other forms of insurance. Here's another author, Amy Finkelstein (an M.I.T. economist who has written for The Wall Street Journal opinion pages and whom I've writtenabout), also via e-mail:
Health insurance isn't just about access to health care - it's also about protection from financial ruin. This point isn't often discussed in the debate about health insurance expansions, but the reduction in financial strain that we found was substantial. This is important for enrollees, but it is also important for the providers who see fewer of their bills go unpaid. 
Besides Ms. Baicker and Ms. Finkelstein, the paper's authors include Jonathan Gruber (an M.I.T. economist, who has advised the Obama administration) and Joseph Newhouse (a Harvard economist who designed and ran the famous RAND Health Insurance Experiment in the 1970s and '80s). The other authors are Sarah Taubman, Bill Wright, Mira Bernstein, Heidi Allen and members of the Oregon Health Study Group.
Excerpts from the study follow:About one year after enrollment, we find that those selected by the lottery have substantial and statistically significantly higher health care utilization, lower out-of-pocket medical expenditures and medical debt, and better self-reported health than the control group that was not given the opportunity to apply for Medicaid.
The increase in hospital admissions appears to be disproportionately concentrated in the approximately 35 percent of admissions that do not originate in the emergency room, suggesting that these admissions may be more price sensitive.
[W]e find that insurance is associated with improvements across the board in our measures of self-reported physical and mental health, averaging two-tenths of a standard deviation improvement. These results appear to reflect improvements in mental health and also at least partly a general sense of improved well being; they may also reflect improvements in objective, physical health, but this is more difficult to determine with the data we now have available.
[I]nsurance is also associated with an increase in compliance with recommended preventive care. We look at four different measures of preventive care: blood cholesterol checks, blood tests for diabetes, mammograms, and pap tests. ...[T]he results indicate ... a 20 percent increase in the probability of ever having one's blood cholesterol checked, a 15 percent increase in the probability of ever having one's blood tested for high blood sugar or diabetes, a 60 percent increase in the probability of having a mammogram within the last year (for women 40 and over), and a 45 percent change in the probability of having a pap test within the last year (for women).
[Our] calculation suggests that insurance is associated with a $778 (standard error = $371) increase in annual spending, or about a 25 percent increase relative to the implied control mean annual spending.

HEADLINE: Will the United States Default?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Broad tax reform is an essential step to address federal budget deficits, but little is heard of it as the debt ceiling is debated, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, is the co-author of "13 Bankers."
Three views emerge on whether the United States will default on its government debts, as I talk to people on and close to Capitol Hill. The first is, hopefully yes, and this August offers a good opportunity. The second is, possibly yes, but this would be bad, so we need some form of fiscal austerity. The third is, under no circumstances, and any talk of a need for austerity is a hoax.
The first view is mistaken. The second view hides a dangerous contradiction. And the third view borders on complacency. So how can we find our way to fiscal responsibility? We need tax reform.
People in the first camp think that the United States government has become too big and the only way to cut it down to size is to limit its ability to borrow. A constitutional amendment to limit the size of government relative to gross domestic product or to require a balanced budget could work, but experience suggests a future Congress could always find a way to escape any such constraint.A big part of the underlying problem is that the world has a taste for American assets. Foreign citizens and many of their governments like the ability to buy and sell dollars in liquid markets, and they are particularly fond of American government debt as a place to keep their rainy-day money. Private investors and government wealth managers around the world wring their hands about the trajectory of deficits and debt in the United States - and then buy more of that debt.
So, in one interpretation of this view, the only way to remove the ability of the federal government to borrow is to miss some payments, thus convincing the financial markets that the government is not really a good credit risk.
Such thinking is part of the strategy to threaten not to extend the debt ceiling for the federal government. That would lead to defaulting on some debt. But default, as the Greeks are finding out, is an all-or-nothing enterprise. Doing just a little default is not possible, because, in the view of the market, your country pays its debt in full and on time, or it does not.
The consequences of a United States default would be severe, not just for world markets but also for the ability of every American business and household to borrow, lend or make just about any financial decision. So threatening to blow up the current government debt system is not a credible threat, unless you sincerely believe that this would be a good thing ultimately for all concerned.
From the hearing I attended in June of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, my distinct impression is that some leading legislators are leaning this way. In coming votes on raising the debt ceiling, we'll find out how many members of the House support such views.
The second camp represents the mainstream of American politics today. Genuinely worried about future insolvency, people on both sides of the aisle propose ways to cut future budget deficits. On the Republican side, people prefer spending cuts; the Democrats would rather raise taxes.
Everyone in this camp fully intends to allow the government to pay its debts. Yet increasingly it appears that some people on the left and the right might be attracted to the idea of a government shutdown, at least for a while, assuming that they can effectively blame the other side.
The point is not to change the nature of government or its ability to borrow, but rather to position ideas and personalities for the 2012 presidential election. The government will be able to make its debt payments, but only if it does not pay wages or keep some nonessential parts of government functioning.
The good part of this thinking is that mainstream politicians are increasingly talking about budget constraints and the need to live within our means. The bad news is that these same people extended the so-called Bush tax cuts at the end of 2010, at a stroke not just refusing to deal with the deficit but also significantly contributing to what they now say is our most pressing problem.
The net impact on debt in 2018, relative to what it would have been otherwise, is an increase of $3 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office says in that year nearly a quarter of total outstanding federal debt will exist because these tax cuts were extended last December. (In these pages, James Kwak and I have made the case for opposing the extension.)
For both parties, the gap between rhetoric and policy actions within the mainstream is not closing. And the presidential election is unlikely to help very much. The Bush tax cuts are up for renewal in 2012; are any candidates likely to run on the platform of not extending them?
The third position is that the United States cannot default on its debts. People in this camp offer various explanations, mostly having to do with the fact that long-term interest rates are at their lowest in 50 years. Clearly someone is happy buying United States government debt.
But how long will this continue? Will foreign investors seek to shift out of dollars in the foreseeable future, perhaps because the euro becomes more appealing? And if the Federal Reserve steps in to buy whatever government paper is not wanted by private participants, this surely can become inflationary.
We have put our head into the mouth of the financial markets lion. Ask Greece, Ireland or Italy what happens when the lion's mood changes.
You will note that none of these three views addresses tax reform, except in passing. Left and right agree that as a country we spend too much relative to our income. It would make sense, therefore, to find ways to tax consumption more and income less.
This could be done in a way that is not regressive, that does not punish people at the lower end of the income scale. Some of the most progressive tax systems in the world are based in large part on consumption taxes.
Such tax reform could support either a smaller government or a larger one. With a stronger tax base, the size of government is a good debate to have, but that issue that can be completely separated from whether our current and future deficits can be sustained.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Rejects Tax Change Said to Favor Small Business

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The reform, known as combined reporting, failed in part because reliable estimates of how much money it can bring to state coffers are difficult to come by. 

 BODY:
Are national corporations using state laws to shave millions of dollars off their tax bills - and gain an advantage over smaller rivals? That's the claim some lawmakers and activists are making in statehouses around the country, and as states grapple with deep cuts in spending and seek new sources of revenue, it is putting big business on the defensive. This year, the fight moved to Rhode Island.
At issue was a measure proposed by Gov. Lincoln D. Chafee, an Independent, that would make it much harder for companies to move profits earned in Rhode Island to states with lower tax rates. Known as combined reporting, it requires companies to file state income taxes in the same manner they file federal taxes, accounting for profits and losses of affiliated companies, even those that may have no connection to Rhode Island, and increasing, proponents say, the amount of income subject to state taxes.
Since the 1990s, leading corporations have redoubled efforts to cut their state tax obligations, and total corporate tax revenue to the states has fallen both as a share of state revenue and of corporate profits. In Rhode Island and 21 other states - half the states that tax corporate income - big businesses have been helped by rules that require companies doing business in the state to file tax returns that account only for their own operations and not those of sister companies. This system allows a company to pay expenses to a sister company in another state and then deduct those expenses from its revenue, resulting in less taxable income in Rhode Island. Of course, the affiliate reports more income, but if it is based in a state with lower taxes, the corporation saves money.
Several national retailers, for example, charge individual stores a licensing fee for company logos and other trademarks; the fees typically go to an affiliate in a state where income from intellectual property is not taxed at all, such as Delaware. Starting in the mid-1990s, Wal-Mart began paying rent on its stores to a real estate investment trust, a Delaware-based subsidiary, and was able to use a variety of rules to shelter that income from taxes in several states. Naturally, local stores competing with these national brands have no way to obtain similar tax savings.
In recent years several states, including Rhode Island, have closed off these avenues for shifting income to low-tax states, but according to Michael Mazerov, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington policy research organization that focuses on tax and spending policies that affect low-income people, without combined reporting many more potential tax-sheltering opportunities remain available to national corporations. Under combined reporting, a member of a family of companies (or, legally, a "unitary corporation") files a tax return that encompasses all of its affiliates, whether or not they have a physical presence in the state. The company then apportions a share of its total combined income to the state based on sales, or on a formula that takes into account sales, property and payroll.
Combined reporting has been standard practice in most western states for decades - California was the first to adopt it, in the 1930s. But in the last five years, as state budgets have been squeezed, the practice has migrated eastward, often propelled by organizations hoping to preserve spending on social services. Since 2006, six states have adopted variations on the rule, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Massachusetts, all of which made the switch in 2009. "Combined reporting is an essential tax policy for any state with a corporate income tax," Mr. Mazerov told Rhode Island legislators at a hearing in April. "Rhode Island continues to suffer very serious erosion, year in and year out, of its corporate tax base because it's not a combined reporting state."
This spring, combined reporting came up for consideration in eight states, said Joseph Crosby, of the Council on State Taxation, which represents large corporations on state tax issues and opposes combined reporting. The Rhode Island version was part of an even more ambitious proposal to revamp business taxes. Under Governor Chafee's plan, the state would use the additional revenue from combined reporting, which officials projected would be about $9 million in the first year, to reduce the state's corporate tax rate - one of the highest in the nation - and to reduce the minimum corporate tax for the state's smallest businesses.
Reliable estimates of how much money combined reporting can bring to state coffers are difficult to come by, since states that adopt it are reluctant to go to the trouble of comparing it to a system they no longer use, and year-to-year tax comparisons are always difficult. A report (pdf) produced for the National Conference for State Legislators used econometric modeling to show that it would be impossible to predict how much money - if any - combined reporting might raise. However, advocates point to a study by the state of Maryland, where lawmakers have flirted with combined reporting for several years. In 2007, the legislature required companies in the state to file both a standard separate-entity return and returns showing how much they would pay under various combined reporting regimes. For 2006 and 2007, combined reporting would have increased state revenues by 13 to 20 percent, depending on the version used. In 2008, when the economy plunged into recession, combined reporting would have brought in slightly less tax money.
In Rhode Island, as elsewhere, opponents seized on this volatility. (Ultimately, the Maryland Business Tax Reform Commission created to study combined reporting recommended the legislature there not adopt the system in 2011.) More to the point, the opponents argued that a new tax regimen would force corporations to look elsewhere when making new investments. At the April hearing, representatives from Amgen, a California-based pharmaceutical giant that has 1,500 employees in Rhode Island, told legislators that "combined reporting would create disincentives for future expansion and investment for Amgen in Rhode Island, dramatically increase our tax liability by unfairly subjecting income that is unrelated to our Rhode Island manufacturing activity to Rhode Island tax, and put our site at a competitive disadvantage with our other manufacturing locations throughout the United States and globally." (A spokesman for Amgen declined to elaborate on its lobbying against the measure.)
"When the economy improves, and a company needs to put in a third shift at one of its facilities around the country, the question is, where are they going to do it?" said Mr. Crosby, of the Council on State Taxation. "Taxes matter exactly as much as any other expense."
Moreover, proponents had a difficult time articulating how the current rules that shelter big-business income disadvantage small businesses. At the hearing, a Republican skeptic noted that, apart from one small-business owner, "I have not heard any testimony this afternoon from anybody representing smaller companies that are sharing that complaint or that concern that things are not equal."
In the end, Democratic lawmakers, who control both chambers of the Rhode Island General Assembly, declined to make any of the changes to the corporate tax code that Governor Chafee proposed. Instead of adopting combined reporting, the legislature decided to follow Maryland's example and study it. For two years, companies will file both a standard separate tax return and a return showing how much they would owe under combined reporting. Then state officials will spend a year analyzing the data. Last Wednesday, the Rhode Island Senate approved the House budget by a wide margin. Governor Chafee signed the legislation last Thursday.
"There wasn't enough information, and there was conflicting data, so this will allow us to collect enough data to gauge the effect of implementing combined reporting," said Larry Berman, spokesman for House Speaker Gordon Fox.
Representative Teresa Tanzi, the most vocal advocate for combined reporting - she proposed her own version in a stand-alone bill - acknowledged that legislators didn't have much to go on. "Amgen came up to me and said they alone would pay more to the state of Rhode Island than the state's entire projection of how much combined reporting would bring in," she said. Ms. Tanzi believed that ultimately the study would help her cause: "They really, truly are doing a full study of this and making an informed decision."
In the meantime, Ms. Tanzi said, supporters of combined reporting would have to devote more effort to organizing small businesses behind the bill. "The one thing that was lacking in this was the voice of small business," she said. "And we can say over and over that small business will be affected by this, but until they actually hear from small-business people, they won't take it seriously. We have to now spend the next three years developing leaders among our small businesses who will come forth and talk about the impact that this has on their businesses."

HEADLINE: Regulators Finalize New Derivatives Rules

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission adopted the first in a series of new rules for the derivatives market, giving the government new authority over the $600 trillion industry. 

 BODY:
Federal regulators on Thursday adopted the first in a series of new rules for the derivatives market, giving the government broad new authority over the $600 trillion industry that played a central role in the financial crisis. 
The rules, approved unanimously by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, greatly expand the government's ability to police insider trading and other fraud. The plan, regulators say, injects new life into the commission's often-hamstrung enforcement efforts. 
"We will use these tools to be a more effective cop on the beat, to promote market integrity and to protect market participants," Gary Gensler, the commission's chairman, said at a public meeting in Washington on Thursday. "Effective regulation requires an effective enforcement program." 
Another crucial rule enacted on Thursday requires hedge funds and other large firms to turn over details about their derivatives trading to the commission. The agency approved five rules altogether, a critical step in the push to overhaul Wall Street regulation in the aftermath of the crisis. 
Still, more than 40 derivatives regulations remain unfinished. The commodities agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission recently said they would miss the July 16 deadline to complete most derivatives rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, enacted a year ago this month. 
While Mr. Gensler plans to finalize the remaining proposals by the end of the year, some Republican regulators want the agency to slow down even further. Jill Sommers, a Republican official at the agency, warned on Thursday that the agency was "haphazardly" finalizing the rules to meet "arbitrary deadlines." 
Mr. Gensler defended the agency's efforts to overhaul the derivatives market, noting that the opaque securities contributed "to the bubble in the housing market and helped to accelerate the financial crisis."
In the lead up to the crisis, investors bought billions of dollars' worth of derivatives as insurance on mortgage-backed securities. When the underlying mortgages soured, the American International Group and other firms that sold the deals could not meet their obligations. 
The new regulations approved on Thursday could prevent a repeat of the mess, Mr. Gensler said. 
One rule allows the agency to survey the swaps market, a type of derivative contract that previously was off limits. Under the proposal, hedge funds, energy firms and other large players in the market must turn over daily reports detailing an array of private data, including their stakes in swaps and records of their trades. 
When traders run amok in the derivatives market, another rule grants the agency broad new powers to prosecute fraud and manipulation. 
For years, the agency had to prove that a trader intended to manipulate the market -- and successfully created artificial prices. Now, the agency eased the standard so that prosecutors only have to show a trader intended to act "recklessly." The plan, modeled on the S.E.C.'s insider trading ban, also prohibits trading on "material nonpublic" information that is obtained illegally. 
 "We currently have a nearly impossible manipulation standard," said Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the commodities agency. Mr. Chilton noted that the agency had won only one price manipulation case in 35 years. 
The expanded authority, however, is "critical ammo in the commission's enforcement arsenal," he said. 
Proponents of regulation welcomed the agency's ruling. 
"The C.F.T.C. provided good news today for investors and the financial markets," said Dennis M. Kelleher, the president of Better Markets, an advocacy group. "We look forward to broad application and aggressive enforcement to ensure that market manipulation is eliminated."

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Spending Questioned

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: A Justice Department inquiry into a $556 million office-space lease complicates the commission's effort to get more money to meet its Dodd-Frank mandate. 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission's fight for more money, an effort opposed by many Republican lawmakers, has met a new obstacle: the regulator's own questionable spending. 
A recent report by the S.E.C.'s internal watchdog said that the agency leased $556 million in office space last year using "a deeply flawed and unsound process" that lacked competitive bidding. Officials also backdated a form that justified the hefty expense, according to the inspector general's report, giving the false impression that the document was created shortly after the 10-year lease was signed. 
Now, the Justice Department is looking into the S.E.C.'s handling of the deal, Inspector General H. David Kotz told Congress this week. Mr. Kotz referred his report to prosecutors earlier this year, saying that the agency may have violated federal law. 
The controversy stems from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, which gave the S.E.C. expanded authority to oversee Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. The agency, expecting to hire 800 new people to meet the broadening mandate, scrambled to find new office space. 
While Dodd-Frank authorized the agency to double its $1 billion budget over the next few years, Congress never doled out the money. That did not stop the S.E.C. from securing 900,000 square feet of space last summer at the Constitution Center in Washington. 
Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, told a Congressional committee on Wednesday that her agency would address Mr. Kotz's allegations "aggressively and transparently."
"As chairman of the S.E.C., I am ultimately responsible for the actions of the agency," she said. She also noted, however, that the agency so far has not paid any rent on the building, as other tenants agreed to occupy the space. 
Still, this was not the S.E.C.'s first spending mishap. The Government Accountability Office has faulted the agency's accounting almost every year since 2004.
The problems over the lease "represent another in a long history of missteps and misguided leasing decisions made by the S.E.C. since it was granted independent leasing authority by Congress in 1990," Mr. Kotz said in the report.
The recent controversy could also embolden Republican lawmakers who want to curb the agency's spending. In June, House Republicans approved a plan to keep the S.E.C.'s budget flat, despite its expanded authority under Dodd-Frank. Some have called for outright cuts. 
In April, Congress raised the S.E.C.'s budget for the next few months by $74 million, to $1.18 billion. 
Soon after, Ms. Schapiro warned a Senate committee that further spending cuts or freezes "would have a devastating impact on the agency's ability to protect the public from financial fraud." 
As DealBook reported in May, budget woes at the S.E.C. and other financial regulators are crimping plans to fill important jobs, enforce new rules and upgrade market surveillance technology. The budget constraints, regulators say, also have jeopardized their efforts to police Wall Street.
Ms. Schapiro argues that her agency costs taxpayers nothing. The agency offsets its budget with fees collected from the financial industry, often turning a profit for the government.

HEADLINE: Yes, Coins Too

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The government is minting fewer coins as well as printing less paper currency, but for different reasons. 

 BODY:
Several readers have asked a good question about my article in today's newspaper, which reports that the government is printing less paper currency: What about coins?
The simple answer: Yes, coins too.
The U.S. Mint produced about 5 billion pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters in 2010, less than one-third of the average annual production over the last 30 years.
Just like paper currency, right? Well, not quite.
People clearly are using fewer coins.
But there's something else too. Call it The Coinstar Effect.
In 1992, three Stanford University graduate students convinced four Bay Area supermarkets to let them install a new machine designed to count spare change. The concept was rather brilliant, like a slot machine with a guaranteed payout. There's nothing quite like the sound and sight of money -- your money -- being counted. And as the company grew, the technology began to change the basic physics of change. 
Americans keep vast quantities of coins around the house. "Keep" is maybe the wrong word. Coins gather in the folds of couches and drawer bottoms and coat pockets. They are collected in jars, popped into piggy banks, socked away. And until Coinstar came along, that money mostly just sat there. In keeping with the law of entropy, it was easy to turn bills into coins and difficult to turn coins back into useable money.
And that is exactly what Coinstar made easy.
By the early 2000s, the company's machines were annually collecting more coins than the U.S. Mint was producing. And the company was putting those coins back into circulation, meeting a growing share of market demand, reducing the need to mint new coins.
There's another important difference between bills and coins: Coin production tracks the American economy much more closely, because the demand for coins is almost entirely domestic, while the demand for paper currency comes mostly from overseas. (Moreover, the demand for paper currency can rise during a financial crisis, as it did in 2008, because people sought to withdraw their money from the banks.)
Coin production, in other words, is likely to rebound somewhat as the economy recovers. But the U.S. Mint estimates that production still won't top 10 billion coins a year, so it is shuttering equipment and reducing capacity at its plants in Philadelphia and Denver.

HEADLINE: Shift in Treasuries System Vexes Older Investors

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The Treasury Department's shift from a mail- or phone-based system of buying Treasury bills to a Web-based one is causing some problems for users, many of them elderly. 

 BODY:
Pauline Gordon wants to know where her savings are.
Mrs. Gordon, an 85-year-old resident of Silver Spring, Md., was a satisfied, long-time user of the federal government's old Legacy Treasury Direct system, which allowed users to buy Treasury bills and other securities by mail or phone and receive paper statements.
But the Bureau of the Public Debt, the Treasury arm that handles the sale and redemption of Treasury bills and other government securities, is phasing out the system and will shut it down on Nov. 1, 2012.
Users must switch to the newer, Web-based TreasuryDirect system. Or they can arrange to buy Treasury bills, notes and bonds through a bank or broker. That's what Mrs. Gordon tried to do. "I'm 85 years old," she explained in a phone interview. "I don't get much involved with electronics, if I can avoid it."
So when she received a letter about the change from the Treasury Department on March 30, she enlisted the help of her son, Robert. He accompanied her to her bank and helped her get a signed affidavit, as required, authorizing the transfer of her securities to her broker. Then, they sent the paperwork to the Bureau of the Public Debt, which received the packet on April 27.
Four weeks later, the funds still hadn't been transferred to her brokerage account. Another two weeks later, Robert Gordon called the information number given by the Treasury Department. "I left messages," he said. "No one's ever called me back." When he did reach a person, he said, he was told the paperwork was received and was being processed.
Mr. Gordon knew his mother didn't want to sell any of her securities - she is partial to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities -- but asked what would happen if she did decide she wanted to do so. He was told, he said, that she could sell them through the old Legacy Direct system. But she's still worried. "The anxiety it's causing her is considerable," he said.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Gordon is fretting about what is happening with a large portion of her savings, and pesters her broker frequently about whether the funds have arrived. "I'm very upset," she said. "I can't understand the government being so slow. There's no reason for it. We filled everything out."
Mckayla Braden, a bureau spokeswoman, said Wednesday that the bureau was "overwhelmed" by requests from users of the old system and is working on processing them. "We were totally slammed," she said. "Her request is not forgotten."
Slightly more than 200,000 people are affected by the change, according to the Bureau of the Public Debt. Ms. Braden didn't have information immediately available about how many users have switched to the new system. The problem is that most users of the older system are elderly - their average age is 75, and many are over 80. Many, like Mrs. Gordon, lack computers, or the inclination to use one. They invest in Treasuries because they are very safe, and not knowing where there money is stressful to them.
Now, an update: On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Gordon called to say that after Bucks contacted the bureau, he and his mother received phone calls telling them that a portion of her securities would be transferred to her brokerage account on Thursday. The remainder, he was told, would be transferred at a later date, after pending interest posts. Mr. Gordon said he was grateful for the update, because if only some of the securities had been transferred without explanation, he and his mother would have been even more concerned. "People need to know that it might go in stages," he said.
Are you trying to move your Treasury investments to an outside broker? Has the switch gone smoothly?

HEADLINE: Why the Republicans Resist Compromise

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The voter-enthusiasm gap that really matters in Washington now wasn't the one between the two parties - it was the one between conservative Republicans and everyone else, including moderate Republicans. 

 BODY:
The chart that I'm going to show you is one of the more important ones that we've presented at FiveThirtyEight in some time. It helps explain a lot of what's going on in American politics today, from the negotiations over the federal debt ceiling to the Republican presidential primaries. And it's pretty simple, really, although it took me some time to track down the data.
Here's what the chart will show: The Republican Party is dependent, to an extent unprecedented in recent political history, on a single ideological group. That group, of course, is conservatives. It isn't a bad thing to be in favor with conservatives: by some definitions they make up about 40 percent of voters. But the terms 'Republican' and 'conservative' are growing closer and closer to being synonyms; fewer and fewer nonconservatives vote Republican, and fewer and fewer Republican voters are not conservative.
The chart, culled from exit poll data, shows the ideological disposition of those people who voted Republican for the House of Representatives in the elections of 1984 through 2010. Until fairly recently, about half of the people who voted Republican for Congress (not all of whom are registered Republicans) identified themselves as conservative, and the other half as moderate or, less commonly, liberal. But lately the ratio has been skewing: in last year's elections, 67 percent of those who voted Republican said they were conservative, up from 58 percent two years earlier and 48 percent ten years ago.
This might seem counterintuitive. Didn't the Republicans win a sweeping victory last year? They did, but it had mostly to do with changes in turnout. Whereas in 2008, conservatives made up 34 percent of those who cast ballots, that number shot up to 42 percent last year. Moderates, on the other hand, made up just 38 percent of those who voted in 2010, down from 44 percent in 2008 (the percentage of liberals was barely changed). The 2010 election was the first since exit polls began in 1976 in which a plurality of the voters said they were conservatives rather than moderates.
This was fortunate for Republicans, because they lost moderate voters to Democrats by 13 percentage points (and liberals by 82 percentage points). Had the ideological composition of the electorate been the same in 2010 as in 2008 or 2006, the Republicans and Democrats would have split the popular vote for the House about evenly - but as it was, Republicans won the popular vote for the House by about 7 percentage points and gained 63 seats.
Many of the G.O.P. victories last year were extremely close. I calculate that, had the national popular vote been divided evenly, Democrats would have lost just 27 seats instead of 63. Put differently, the majority of Republican gains last year were probably due to changes in relative turnout rather than people changing their minds about which party's approach they preferred.
Some care is called for here: Political ideology is not an immutable characteristic, and some people who called themselves conservative in 2010 might have called themselves moderate in 2008. Most polls have found a modest increase in the number of people in the broader electorate (not just those who voted) who say they are conservative.
But this only explains a small part of the difference in 2010. For the rest, we need to look toward the so-called enthusiasm gap. 
That gap is commonly understood as the average Republican having been more likely to cast a vote in 2010 than the average Democrat. That's true as far as it goes. But on top of the gap between Democrats and Republicans, there was a another enthusiasm gap within the Republican party, cleaving conservatives, who were very likely to turn out, from moderate Republicans, who were no more likely to vote than Democrats were.
The data for this assertion comes from a Pew Research poll conducted just a few days before the election. The poll was quite accurate - it predicted a 6-point Republican margin in the popular vote for the House, almost exactly in line with what actually happened.
Pew is among the most transparent polling organizations, and their entire data set for this particular poll is available for public consumption. I looked at the percentage of people from various groups who were given at least 6 points on Pew's 7-point scale of voting propensity - who I defined as "likely voters."
Among conservatives who are either registered as Republicans or who lean toward the Republican party, about 3 out of 4 were likely to have voted in 2010, the Pew data indicated. The fraction of likely voters was even higher among those who called themselves "very conservative:" 79 percent. 
By contrast, only about half of moderate or liberal Republicans were likely voters, according to Pew's model. That is about the same as the figure for Democrats generally: - about half of them were likely voters, with little difference among conservative, moderate and liberal Democrats. 
So the enthusiasm gap did not so much divide Republicans from Democrats; rather, it divided conservative Republicans from everyone else. According to the Pew data, while 64 percent of all Republicans and Republican-leaning independents identify as conservative, the figure rises to 73 percent for those who actually voted in 2010.
This is why Republican politicians find it difficult to compromise on something like the debt ceiling, even when it might seem they have substantial incentive to do so. Republicans are still fairly unpopular - only about 40 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the party, which is barely better than their standing in 2006 or 2008 (although Democrats have become significantly less popular since then). As long as conservative Republicans are much more likely to vote than anyone else, the party can fare well despite that unpopularity, as it obviously did in 2010. But it means that Republican members of Congress have a mandate to remain steadfast to the conservatives who are responsible for electing them.
Presidential elections are different: they tend to have a more equivocal turnout. The G.O.P. can turn out its base but it has not converted many other voters to its cause, and President Obama's approval ratings remain passable although not good. The Republicans will need all their voters to turn out - including their moderates - to be an even-money bet to defeat him.
If a relatively moderate candidate like Mitt Romney is nominated, that probably won't be a major problem. But there is a significant chance that the party will nominate a someone like Michele Bachmann instead. 
Imagine that Ms. Bachmann has won the Iowa caucuses while Mr. Romney has taken the New Hampshire primary, and the nomination is essentially up for grabs between them. As the contest shifts to a key state like Ohio or Pennsylvania, suppose that conservative Republicans split 60-30 in Ms. Bachmann's favor (with a few voters opting for a hanger-on like Ron Paul), while moderate Republicans go 80-15 for Mr. Romney. Who is going to win?
Turnout would be decisive. If two conservative Republicans cast ballots for every moderate Republican - roughly the ratio in 2008 - Mr. Romney would prevail by a couple of points. But if the turnout looks more like 2010, and there are three conservative Republicans at the polls for every moderate Republican, Ms. Bachmann would win by about six percentage points:
So the presidential race gives Republicans some incentive to engage their moderate voters sooner rather than later - but at the same time, moderate voters are not who elected them to Congress. The poor economy has bought the party some slack, but there is still potential for disaster: Either the nomination goes to someone like Ms. Bachmann, who would have a difficult time winning over moderates and independents, or someone like Mr. Romney wins the nomination but alienates the conservatives along the way.
Is the same kind of phenomenon occurring on the Democratic side? To some extent, yes: Back in 1984, just 26 percent of the people voting Democratic for Congress said they were liberals, but that fraction has now risen to 41 percent.
Nevertheless, moderate Democrats are still the plurality of the party. And there are even a fair number of conservative Democrats - certainly more than there are liberal Republicans - despite the geographical realignment of the parties in the early 1990s, in which many conservative southerners switched allegiance. The Democratic Party is intrinsically more pluralistic than the G.O.P. - a characteristic that may be disadvantageous when it comes to governing, but can give the party an edge in elections.

HEADLINE: At Goldman, Mounting Pressure on Staff to Keep a Low Profile

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Investment banks have always prized discretion among employees. But at Goldman Sachs, a public persona can be a liability. 

 BODY:
Jim Wilson/The New York TimesAllen Mask, a former Goldman employee who now works at Google, is pursuing his passion for hip-hop music.When Matt Levine, a vice president at Goldman Sachs, announced in May that he was leaving his job to become a full-time writer for Dealbreaker, a satirical blog that covers the finance industry, a few colleagues gave him a wary send-off.
"Pretty much everyone thought it was awesome, though some of them are sort of nervous about talking to me now," he said.
Katie Baker got a similar reaction when she announced that she was planning to leave Goldman's private wealth management division, where she worked as a vice president, to write for Grantland, a new ESPN sports site. While colleagues in her group were excited, Ms. Baker, 28, had to meet with Goldman executives, who quickly rejected her plans to continue working at the firm for her final two weeks, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.
Restless Wall Street workers often dream about quitting their jobs, breaking the so-called golden handcuffs of high-paying finance careers to chase their passions. But several recent Goldman Sachs employees with interests in the media, arts and other visible industries have found themselves in uncomfortable positions with the firm. At Goldman and other banks whose reputations were damaged in the financial crisis, a public persona can be a liability.
In Ms. Baker's case, she was told that writing about her time at Goldman would represent a breach of her confidentiality agreement, which extended indefinitely. The firm informed Mr. Levine, 33, that he would have to take a paid 60-day leave before he could start at Dealbreaker, a common industry waiting period referred to as a "garden leave."
"I don't think it's all that surprising, given everything that's gone on with Goldman Sachs and the press," said Bess Levin, the Dealbreaker editor who hired Mr. Levine.
A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Ms. Baker and Mr. Levine declined to talk about the contractual terms of their departure, citing their confidentiality agreements.
Investment banks have always prized discretion among employees. But at Goldman - an investment bank so private that many of its employees refer to it simply as "the firm" - there is added pressure to keep a low profile.
Allen Mask came to Goldman's retail analyst program as a 22-year-old with a side career. An amateur rapper during his time at the University of North Carolina, Mr. Mask had recorded several albums and hoped to further his music career in New York.
"At first, it was a cool thing, and everyone at the firm was like, 'We're here to support you,' " said Mr. Mask, now 23. "They knew that was part of my life."
But then a financial blogger discovered his Goldman connection and posted one of his performance videos online, crowning him the "hip-hop investment banker." As more blogs and media outlets picked up his story, Goldman's media gatekeepers clamped down. They declined interview and television requests on his behalf and eventually gave him strict orders: no more performing, no more recording and no speaking to the media.
Mr. Mask, faced with a choice between his music and his finance career, decided to quit.
"I didn't do anything to deserve the negative treatment and the harassment I got," said Mr. Mask, who now works for Google and lives in Silicon Valley. "It's not like I changed the share price."
Tom Comerford, an employee in Goldman's graphics department, was also a victim of side-career success. In his spare time, he moonlighted for the Wall Street Experience, giving guided tours of New York's financial district. When a British newspaper wrote an article about Mr. Comerford, he was called into meetings with the firm's legal and compliance officers. He left the firm of his own accord shortly thereafter.
"I told them I could understand their anger," said Mr. Comerford, who still gives Wall Street tours.
"But they said, 'No, you don't understand. Even if you want to be on the board of your condo, you have to get it passed through us,' " he added. "They're very covetous over their name."
Goldman has regulatory reasons to be wary. A federal rule requires employees at financial institutions to disclose outside sources of income. Ms. Baker, the wealth manager, wrote paid freelance articles for several blogs while on the job at Goldman without informing the firm, a clear violation of the regulation.
But reputation is just as important on Wall Street.
"People expect their bankers to behave like bankers," said one former trader at JPMorgan Chase, who left the firm to pursue a film career. The trader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his relationships at the bank, added, "You're not supposed to be known for anything else or stand out for anything besides your work."
Image concerns in the corporate world are hardly unique to Goldman, and not everyone gets the third degree. Frank Leung, who worked at Goldman's London office, left in 2009 to open a Mexican restaurant with a friend from college. Mr. Leung said that he was on good terms with his former colleagues, some of whom he continued to serve as customers at the restaurant.
"Maybe they're more lenient in the United Kingdom," he said.
Regardless of the tenor of their departures, recent Goldman dropouts said they were happier now. Mr. Levine and Mr. Mask emphasized that they still had good relationships with Goldman, and Ms. Baker said that her only regret was quitting before a Shake Shack diner went up next to the firm's Manhattan headquarters. ("Goldman always wins," she joked.)
For Mr. Levine, taking a big pay cut to work at Dealbreaker - a blog that covers, and often lampoons, his old employer - could be seen as a rogue move. But the blog's editor, Ms. Levin, said she did not expect Mr. Levine to reveal any trade secrets, although she was excited about having a Wall Street insider on staff.
"Of course Goldman expects me not to write about anything that I saw or did at the firm," Mr. Levine said. "But I was a corporate equity derivatives marketer and believe me, no one wants to read about that."

HEADLINE: Investment Values Twitter at $8 Billion

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: The start-up, based in San Francisco, is in the process of raising $400 million dollars, a deal that values the company at $8 billion. 

 BODY:
While Twitter isn't rushing to go public like some of its larger peers, the micro-blogging service doesn't lack investor interest. 
The start-up, based in San Francisco, is in the process of raising $400 million, a deal that values the company at $8 billion, according to two people briefed on the matter. 
The financing round, which will be split into two tranches, will be led by DST Global, the investment firm headed by the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner. Previous investors, including the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, will also participate, one person said.
A Twitter spokesman declined to comment.
With more than 200 million accounts, Twitter is part of an elite group of social Web start-ups that have flourished in recent years by rapidly attracting users. While peers like Groupon and Zynga are hurtling toward the public markets, Twitter, which has been slow in building out its model, is holding back. 
"I think they're still trying to find a way to make it into a big business," said Rory Maher, an analyst for Hudson Square Research. 
The company, according to his analysis, makes about $200 million a year from online advertising and is close to profitability. At those levels, Mr. Maher said, a valuation of $8 billion -- or roughly 40 times sales -- is difficult to justify.
By comparison, Zynga, the popular online gaming company, recorded $597.5 million in revenue last year, with a profit of $90.6 million, according to a recent regulatory filing. The company, which has filed to go public, is expected to offer its shares at a valuation near or above $20 billion, which amounts to around 33 times sales.
"It's a small business," Mr. Maher said, describing the economics of Twitter. "The ad volume isn't there. They're going to have to come up with products that drive more volume for them, and they need to increase the number of users." 
At present, Twitter makes the bulk of its money from an advertising platform that relies on "promoted tweets." The program, which was rolled out last April, displays sponsored messages in users' feeds or keyword searches. For instance, a recent search for "Pepsi," generated a message about a current summer promotion, paid for by the company.
Founded in 2006, the company is also adjusting to a recent management reshuffling. Dick Costolo -- a former product manager at Google who was Twitter's chief operating officer -- ascended to chief executive last October. Several months later, Jack Dorsey, who initially came up with the idea for Twitter, returned as the head of product development. Mr. Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Square, a mobile payments start-up, has been working closely with Mr. Costolo to improve Twitter's platform. 
Despite its challenges, the company is attracting loads of investor capital, at increasingly ambitious valuations. In December, Twitter raised $200 million from Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, Spark Capital, Benchmark Capital and Union Square Ventures. The investment back then valued the company at $3.7 billion.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Intensity

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times: 
President Obamais expected to move well beyondthe $2 trillion in savingsover a decade that he sought earlier in negotiations over raising the federal debt limit now that Republicans have signaled their willingness to scale back some tax breaks, Carl Hulse and Mark Landler write. The intensifying negotiations for a broader deal between the president and Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio have Congressional Democrats worried that they will be asked to accept a deal that is too heavily tilted toward Republican efforts and produces too little new revenue relative to the magnitude of the cuts imposed. Mr. Obama will meet with Congressional leaders from both parties at 11 a.m. at the White House.
 Mr. Obama fielded questions on the economy from the public on Wednesday during an hourlong town hall on Twitter. Michael D. Shear shares some of the 140-character questions and Mr. Obama's comparatively lengthy answers, while also exploring some of the questions the conversation raised about the intersection of social media, politics and journalism.
 Charlie Savage looks at the Obama administration's new approach to terrorism cases brought to light by the case of a suspected al Qaeda supporter captured in waters between Yemen and Somalia and interrogated aboard a Navy vessel. The suspect, Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, will face a civilian trial in New York. The decision to keep Mr. Warsame out of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and to prosecute him in a civilian court reflects legal deliberations in the administration that could have implications for the evolving conflict against Al Qaeda and its affiliates.
 The Department of Homeland Security is warning airlines to take extra safety precautions on international flights amid concerns that terrorists might try to board airplanes bound for the United States with surgically implanted bombs.
 The families of service members who commit suicide in combat zones are now receiving condolence lettersfrom the president, just like families of troops who die in other ways. James Dao reports that the White House made the change this week after a two-year review of the longstanding policy in an effort to destigmatize mental illness. Before, the White House would send presidential condolences to the families of only those who died either in combat or in accidents in war zones.
Around the Web: Major business groups are warning Congress that a failure to quickly raise the debt ceiling could send the financial markets into "disarray," The Hill reports.
 A pair of competing transportation bills that were rolled out Wednesday in the House and Senate illustrate the gulf between House Republicans and Senate Democrats over how to address the fiscal crisis in Washington, The Wall Street Journal says.
 The Justice Department is considering prosecuting the Securities and Exchange Commission over a $557 million lease for offices in downtown Washington that the agency cannot afford and does not need, The Washington Post reports.
Happening in Washington: The economic data that will be released today includes weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. from the Department of Labor and weekly mortgage rates at 10 a.m. from Freddie Mac.
 Jury selection continues in the federal trial of Roger Clemens on charges that he lied about using performance-enhancing drugs. The trial, which began Wednesday, opens at 9:30 a.m.
 The risks of the the federal government defaulting on its debt are the focus of a hearing of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. The discussion begins at noon.

HEADLINE: Tech-Wary Buffett Shies Away From Facebook

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: While investors are salivating over the Web's hottest start-ups, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway talks about why he's reticent about the social networking space. 

 BODY:
SUN VALLEY, Idaho -- While investors are salivating over the Web's hottest start-ups, Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, long reticent of technology companies, has no plans to take the plunge into the social networking space. 
"It's not my game," he said in an interview with DealBook at the Allen & Company conference here. "The world is changing, and I'm lagging behind."
Mr. Buffett said he was not exactly sure what to make of the multibillion-dollar valuations of Facebook, Groupon, Zynga, LinkedIn and the like. 
"A few of them will be worth enormous amounts," he said. But "I don't know which ones." 
The most successful ones, he added, will figure "out something that somebody wants that they don't know they want now."
And what about Facebook, the world's largest social network, which is said to be preparing a public offering that would value the company at more than $100 billion? 
"I'm the last guy to ask about that," Mr. Buffett said.
At 80, the Oracle from Omaha says he's pretty comfortable sticking with his long-held strategy.
Although fellow attendee, Barry Diller, the chairman of IAC, told reporters Thursday morning that current valuations are "wildly overpriced," Mr. Buffett said he was optimistic about his ability to find great investments in this market.
"We're looking for ones that aren't crazy," Mr. Buffett said. "Most companies I don't know how to value, there's a few that I think I know how to value and every now and then one of those are a price number that falls within my valuation range." 
Despite his bullish outlook on India and China, he's not rushing to put Berkshire's capital in Asia.
"The Chinese economy is going to be growing a lot faster than the U.S. economy, but that's good for us," Mr. Buffett said. "The world is not a zero-sum game, and we will do much better in the next 50 or 100 years, if the Chinese do better in the 50 or 100 years. And they will.
"They got enormously talented, hardworking people," he said "They just didn't have a system that unleashed the potential for a long time. Now the system is unleashing the potential in both countries, and you're seeing a miracle in both countries."
As always, Mr. Buffett, who recently traveled to India, is just waiting for the right opportunities.
"I respond to availability," he said. "If I get a call from China or India, I'm ready act. I don't get up every morning and think what part of the world do I want to concentrate on; I wait for the phone to ring."

HEADLINE: Buffett Hearts Blankfein

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, which gave Goldman Sachs a crucial lifeline during the financial crisis, doesn't think the investment bank's chief executive Lloyd Blankfein will resign and doesn't want him to leave 

 BODY:
SUN VALLEY, Idaho -- Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd C. Blankfein certainly has his fair share of detractors. But billionaire investor Warren Buffett isn't one of them. 
At the annual Allen & Company conference, DealBook asked Mr. Buffett if he thought Mr. Blankfein might resign from Goldman in the coming months. The Oracle of Omaha didn't mince words. 
"I don't think he is. I've seen nothing to indicate that myself, and I don't want him to," he said enthusiastically. "I want him to stay!" 
Mr. Buffett came to Goldman's rescue in 2008 during the financial crisis, investing $5 billion in the Wall Street firm. It was a crucial lifeline for Goldman and a sweet deal for Mr. Buffett. He negotiated a 10 percent annual dividend on the deal, which amounted to about $500 million a year. 
While Goldman paid back the money earlier this year, Mr. Buffett still has a lucrative tie to the investment bank. Mr. Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway negotiated the right to buy $5 billion in stock with a strike price of $115. Those warrants are outstanding. 
In Sun Valley, Mr. Buffett said his plans to exercise those warrants remains the same. He expects to do so in 2013 when they are set to expire. 
"We'll wait till the last month or two, before their expiration," he said.
With Goldman stock is currently trading at roughly $135 a share, Mr. Buffett would stand to make a roughly $900 million profit if he exercised them today. 
No wonder he likes Mr. Blankfein.

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Balanced Budgets

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Basic economics dictates that fiscal responsibility does not require banning deficits. 

 BODY:
I realize they may just be practicing politics, but Senators Olympia Snowe and Jim DeMint serve up a basic misunderstanding of economics in their commentary on The Wall Street Journal's op-ed page today. Ms. Snowe, a Republican from Maine, and Mr. DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, write:
For the long term, to prevent both this Congress and its successors from hijacking the promise of American prosperity, we also need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, like the one we and all 47 Senate Republicans have introduced... Our government has balanced its budget only five times in half a century. 
Ms. Snowe and Mr. DeMint seem to be suggesting that the federal government is fiscally responsible only when it runs a balanced budget. But that's not true. The government can run deficits indefinitely, without federal debt rising, so long as one year's economic growth pays off the previous year's deficit. 
Economists typically say that a deficit equal to about 3 percent of gross domestic product -- or $450 billion today -- qualifies as a sustainable deficit. The government is obviously well above that threshold now and will almost certainly need to get the deficit below 3 percent of G.D.P. for a time to pay off today's debt. Yet the long-term goal does not need to be zero. "We should borrow to finance investments that will pay off over time," Leonard Burman of Syracuse University on his blog. "That includes obvious things like roads and dams, but also spending on wars and homeland security if those investments make us safer over the long run." When the economy is struggling, a deficit is usually a good idea too, Mr. Burman adds. 
Of course there are also times when the government should be running a surplus -- when the economy is strong and big future bills (like Medicare and Social Security) are on the horizon. But the notion that the federal government should always aim for a deficit of zero has little if any economic rationale.
Ms. Snowe and Mr. DeMint compare the federal government to a family that supposedly has to balance its budget, and the comparison is actually a useful one. If a middle-class family had to run a balanced budget every year, it would never be able to buy a house or send a child to college. 
More from Mr. Burman, this time by e-mail:
 Squashing investment in a misguided effort to balance the books every year could leave our children huge deficits - in infrastructure, education, technology, etc. Not to mention the fact that a balanced budget amendment would cripple the ability of the government to conduct fiscal policy. Had we been subject to a BBA in 2009, the great recession might well have become a depression. 
Finally, a related note: On the same page of today's Wall Street Journal, Paul Light of New York University has a proposal with much more potential to cut the deficit constructively. Mr. Light calls for a reorganization of the federal government, modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation that cleaned up the savings-and-loan banking crisis. He estimates that the job cuts and other efficiencies could save $100 billion a year. That number seems high, but the idea is intriguing.

HEADLINE: White House Paints Doomsday Default Scenario

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Obama administration is aggressively pushing the message that failure to raise the nation's debt ceiling would have disastrous consequences for average Americans. 

 BODY:
As the high-wire negotiations with the Congressional leadership resume Thursday over raising the nation's debt ceiling, one message from President Obama and his top aides has remained consistent: The consequences of default would be very, very scary.
Mr. Obama's tone toward his Republican adversaries has shifted over the weeks; last week he wagged his finger, while this week he seemed optimistic and hopeful about a deal. But Mr. Obama has not wavered in his use of surprisingly stark language to describe what would happen if the United States defaulted on its financial obligations.
During his otherwise news-free Twitter town hall on Wednesday, the president sketched the doomsday scenario that would snowball from a breakdown in the negotiations and a failure to raise the nation's debt ceiling. "Then the Treasury will run out of money," he said. "Potentially the entire world capital markets could decide, you know what, the full faith and credit of the United States doesn't mean anything. And so our credit could be downgraded, interest rates could go drastically up, and it could cause a whole new spiral into a second recession, or worse."
Mr. Obama usually resists the use of overheated rhetoric. But even as administration officials have searched for what Mr. Obama calls a "balanced approach," they have sought to convince Americans that failing to reach a deal will affect them directly - and in a big and very bad way.
Last Thursday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner went even further than Mr. Obama, saying during a forum in Chicago that the risks are calamitous.
"Interest rates will rise," the normally soft-spoken Mr. Geithner warned. "We'll have to pay more to borrow, if we're still able to borrow; the cost of borrowing will rise across the country and across the world for every business, every family; equity prices will fall; value of savings will fall; you will see more people out of work, more businesses fail."
The dangers should not take much convincing, given the country's recent experience with an economic meltdown. It was just three years ago that the world saw the ripple effects of the banking and housing collapse on the global capital markets and the job market in the United States. In the space of about a year, eight million people lost their jobs.
But Americans have a notoriously short memory, and some Republican politicians have been pushing the idea that the consequences of default are overblown.
Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, scoffed last month at the suggestion that failing to raise the debt ceiling would have harmful effects. She accused Mr. Geithner of making "false statements" about the situation.
"I don't believe the debt ceiling has to be raised," Ms. Palin told reporters, asserting that spending could be prioritized to avoid defaulting. She said an increase in the debt ceiling based on Mr. Geithner's warnings of "catastrophe" would indicate a failure of leadership by House Republicans.
Even House Speaker John A. Boehner last month played down the consequences of missing the Aug. 2 deadline set by Mr. Geithner. "Nobody believes the United States is going to walk away from its obligations," Mr. Boehner said on Fox News Channel on June 28. "Dealing with this debt problem and this deficit problem is far more important than meeting some artificial date created by the Treasury secretary."
That kind of rhetoric has clearly alarmed the White House, which has instructed just about every member of its economic team to warn about the economic danger in nearly apocolyptic terms.
In a briefing last week, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, even invoked the memory of former president Ronald Reagan to get the point across. Quoting from a letter that Mr. Reagan wrote in 1983, Mr. Carney noted that the former Republican president recognized the danger.
"The full consequences of a default or even the serious prospect of default by the United States are impossible to predict and awesome to contemplate," Mr. Reagan wrote at the time, according to Mr. Carney. "Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United States would have substantial effects on the domestic financial markets and on the value of the dollar in exchange markets. The nation can ill afford to allow such a result, the risks, the costs, the disruptions and the incalculable damage."
To make it seem even more real to Americans, Mr. Carney took aim at their pocketbooks.
Default on the nation's debt, Mr. Carney said, would have a negative impact "on Americans who have pension funds and 401(k)'s, Americans who have jobs but are worried about losing them, or Americans who are looking for jobs. The impact is significant and real. It is not some ethereal thing."
The effort to drive home that message has also been taken up by officials at Third Way, a Washington research organization with close ties to Mr. Obama's White House. 
In a memo being circulated on Capitol Hill and elsewhere in Washington, the group warns of the "dominoes of default" if the government does not meet its obligations.
"Say goodbye to 642,500 jobs," the memo says. "Add nearly $19,175 to every mortgage in process. Lop 1 percent off the United States G.D.P. Give the S.&P. a 6.3 percent-plus haircut. 401(k)'s lose an average of $8,816."
Those are specific numbers that the group hopes will help shock the public. The memo concludes by saying: "Should the U.S. government default, the short and medium-term effect would be that the economic recovery would be halted. The combination of factors including cessation of consumption and investment, and asset liquidations, are all self reinforcing and would lead to a downward spiral."
Will the American people buy the argument? The more important question may be whether the eight lawmakers who will gather at the White House Thursday are convinced.
If not, expect negotiations to go to the wire. And maybe beyond.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Issues Rules to Slash Power Plant Emissions and Protect the East

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday issued new standards for power plants in 27 states that would sharply cut emissions of chemicals that have polluted forests, farms, lakes and streams across the Eastern United States for decades.
The agency said the regulations, which will take effect in 2012, would reduce emissions of compounds that cause soot, smog and acid rain from hundreds of power plants by millions of tons at an additional cost to utilities of less than $1 billion a year. The E.P.A. said the cleaner air would prevent as many as 34,000 premature deaths, 15,000 nonfatal heart attacks and hundreds of thousands of cases of asthma and other respiratory ailments every year. 
Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, said the new rule would improve air quality for 240 million Americans living in states where the pollution is produced or where it travels downwind.
''No community should have to bear the burden of another community's polluters, or be powerless to prevent air pollution that leads to asthma, heart attacks and other harmful illnesses,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''This is a long-overdue step to protect the air we breathe.''
The rule, which governs emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from fossil-fuel-burning power plants, does not explicitly aim at carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Those are covered by other, far more controversial, proposed regulations. But most actions to cut emissions of conventional pollutants also have the indirect effect of reducing global warming gases.
The new regulation, known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, is essentially a rewrite of one issued by the George W. Bush administration in 2005 but invalidated by a federal judge in 2008. The regulation, known popularly as the transport rule because it is directed at emissions that are carried eastward by prevailing winds, is a significant toughening of the acid rain program that was part of amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990.
The new rule applies to all the states east of the Rockies except the Dakotas, Delaware and the six New England states.
The agency said that utilities could meet the new standards at modest cost by using readily available technology like catalytic converters and smokestack scrubbers. Under some E.P.A. projections, the new rule will create thousands of jobs in pollution-control businesses and significantly increase labor productivity by reducing workdays lost to respiratory and other illnesses.
The utility industry and many Republicans in Congress contend that the new rule, along with other pending E.P.A. air quality regulations, will require the premature closing of dozens of aging coal plants and impose heavy financial burdens on power companies and their customers. They had asked for a more gradual phase-in of the new rules.
''The E.P.A. is ignoring the cumulative economic damage new regulations will cause,'' said Steve Miller, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a group of coal-burning utilities. ''America's coal-fueled electric industry has been doing its part for the environment and the economy, but our industry needs adequate time to install clean coal technologies to comply with new regulations. Unfortunately, E.P.A. doesn't seem to care.''
An industry-financed study found that new air pollution rules would cost tens of thousands of jobs and cause electricity rates to rise by more than 20 percent in some parts of the country.
Michael J. Bradley, executive director of the Clean Energy Group, a coalition of power companies, said that most utilities had already installed the equipment needed to meet the new standards and that the small number of plants that would be closed were among the oldest and dirtiest in the nation.
Mr. Bradley said that electricity markets had already factored in the price of compliance and that recent auctions had shown there would be adequate supplies of electricity in 2015 at reasonable prices. ''The bottom line is, the industry is well positioned to comply with this, has been anticipating this for three to four years now,'' he said.
Supporters of the new rule said any costs would be more than offset by health and other benefits. The E.P.A. estimates the annual benefits of the Cross-State Pollution Rule at $120 billion to $280 billion a year by 2014.
John F. Sheehan of the Adirondack Council, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the new air quality rule would help the Adirondack Park in upstate New York, the nation's largest outside of Alaska, to recover from decades of pollution produced far from its borders.
''This is the biggest leap forward in our long history of dealing with this problem,'' Mr. Sheehan said. ''This is a very deep cut on a very aggressive schedule and essentially enough to end chronic acidification of lakes and ponds in the Adirondacks.''
He said it would allow the regeneration of spruce and fir forests in the six-million-acre park while improving the habitat of dozens of species, from the Bicknell's thrush at high elevations to brook trout in streams.

HEADLINE: Stars Sign Letter Protesting City Opera's Move

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
In a rising tide of protest, opera-world stars are denouncing New York City Opera's planned move from Lincoln Center and calling into question the company's stewardship.
Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras, Carlisle Floyd, Sherrill Milnes, Samuel Ramey, Hal Prince and Frederica von Stade were among more than 120 singers, directors, composers and others who have agreed to have their names attached to an open letter criticizing the move, said Catherine Malfitano, the soprano and a former City Opera performer, who took the lead in writing it.
The letter, which was released to The New York Times on Thursday, calls on the company's board and management to reconsider the move from its longtime home at the David H. Koch Theater (formerly the New York State Theater). ''To lose City Opera as a vital part of the Lincoln Center family would be felt as a personal loss to each and every one of us as well as to this great city,'' the letter says, ''and we find it unnecessary and unacceptable.'' 
The letter accuses the management of ''the dismembering of City Opera, piece by piece, person by person.'' In an interview Ms. Malfitano said the reference was to the loss of key officials in recent years as well as the sharp cutback in orchestra and chorus involvement in a shrunken season.
''An opera company is a team, a cohesive family of soloists, chorus, orchestra and backstage and administrative personnel, which brings with it a shared point of view, a richness of context, ensemble values and a nest for nurturing young artists,'' the letter says. ''If City Opera is transformed into a small ad hoc presenting organization forced to deploy pickup orchestras, choruses and soloists, it can never again achieve these things and therefore cannot retain its identity or its impact.''
George Steel, the company's general manager and artistic director, and Charles Wall, its chairman, have said that City Opera's survival depends on reducing spending and cutting costs, part of which they said would come from leaving the Koch Theater.
A total of four operas are planned for next season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Museo del Barrio and the theater at John Jay College, with details expected to come at a news conference on Tuesday.
City Opera's decline resulted from years of deficits, the economic downturn, leadership turmoil, overly optimistic fund-raising goals, poor attendance and the drastic shrinking of its endowment, much of which was used to cover budget shortfalls. The closing of its theater for the 2008-9 season during renovation also hurt.
''A thorough and honest examination of the company's leadership and artistic profile is what is called for,'' the letter says. The signatories offer to give advice to the board: ''We know opera, and we want to help.''
Mr. Steel declined to discuss the letter, and Mr. Wall did not respond to a request for comment left with the company's spokeswoman, Maggie McKeon.
Ms. McKeon issued a brief written statement. ''Our decision to leave Lincoln Center was not entered into lightly,'' she said. ''Rather, it was born of very real financial necessity.'' Ms. McKeon said the company's new model ''not only reverses a decade-long trend of debilitating deficits, but -- equally important -- provides tremendous artistic opportunity and a clear artistic vision for moving forward.''
Ms. Malfitano said that help in writing the letter came from Cori Ellison, the company's former dramaturge. (Ms. Ellison has written freelance articles for The New York Times.)
Other major names who have signed on, Ms. Malfitano said, include June Anderson, Jane Bunnell, Tito Capobianco, Frank Corsaro, Phyllis Curtin, Justino Diaz, Joyce DiDonato, Jake Heggie, John Mauceri, Jan Opalach and Regina Resnik. Many had successes as young singers at City Opera and went on to major international careers.
Ms. Malfitano said she felt encouraged to circulate the letter after a recent Op-Ed article in The Times by Julius Rudel, the company's general director and principal conductor from 1957 to 1979, who took issue with the company's plans. She also cited the singer Joyce Castle, who had resigned from City Opera's board in protest and who also signed the letter.

HEADLINE: Injured President Speaks on TV for First Time Since Attack

BYLINE: By NASSER ARRABYEE and J. DAVID GOODMAN; Nasser Arrabyee reported from Sana, Yemen, and J. David Goodman from New York.

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen -- President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen appeared on television Thursday for the first time since he was injured in a bombing of his presidential compound's mosque a month ago. The prerecorded broadcast from Saudi Arabia, where he has been recuperating since the attack, showed him speaking with difficulty, with a red Saudi headdress and a darkened face from the severe burns he suffered. 
Mr. Saleh, who remained seated, said, ''I underwent eight surgical operations.'' Both of his arms were bandaged and did not move. It was unclear precisely when the message was recorded.
Mr. Saleh's televised appearance comes amid growing political uncertainty in the impoverished nation and appeared likely to embolden Mr. Saleh's supporters while angering the thousands of protesters still massed in the streets of the capital, Sana, calling for him to resign. After the speech, supporters in the capital and cities around Yemen celebrated with fireworks and bursts of gunfire.
His appearance seemed aimed at bolstering those supporters and dispelling rumors that he had succumbed to his wounds. He made no mention of when -- or if -- he would return to Yemen.
''Terrorists and elements connected with terrorists targeted me,'' Mr. Saleh said. The attack left dozens wounded including his prime minister, and at least seven were killed.
''But we and the Yemeni people will stand firm, and we'll face the challenges,'' the president said. ''We welcome the partnership and dialogue with all political parties and all forces, but in the framework of the Constitution.''
The content of his address stuck mostly to his previous positions. More notable was the televised sight of Mr. Saleh, a defiant and clever political manipulator whose image is reproduced on posters around Yemen.
His facial skin appeared dark, possibly scared by burns or covered over by makeup to conceal injuries, and he had a beard in addition to his signature moustache. A senior Yemeni official who was briefed on Mr. Saleh's health said last week that the president's injuries would leave him unfit to perform his duties for months.
Mr. Saleh's relatives, who continue to claim he will return to power, have moved to fill the leadership vacuum left by the attack on the presidential palace, saying that their continued control was necessary to prevent Islamist militants from seizing control of the country.
Mr. Saleh's departure to Saudi Arabia has yet to create the transition political opponents, the United States and even some governing party members are pushing for. Instead, his absence has prolonged a crisis that has left the economy in tatters and a security situation that has rapidly deteriorated. To some of Mr. Saleh's opponents, his televised appearance signaled that he might not return to Yemen.
''We congratulate his family and his supporters and lovers for getting reassured about his health, and his appearance must be a serious step for transferring power,'' said Hasan Zaid, a member of the council of opposition parties. ''Saudi Arabia would not have allowed such an appearance if it were not for arrangement of power transfer.''

HEADLINE: A Proposal for Drawing a Clearer Picture of Public Pension Finances

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The board that writes accounting rules for states and cities plans to issue a proposed solution Friday to one of the hottest disputes in public finance, whether governments are truthfully disclosing the size and condition of their pension funds, and how to fix any deficiencies.
The suggested changes -- which are voluntary rules -- are an effort to straddle the gaping divide between public sector unions, their supporters and public pension consultants on one side and, on the other, economists who have criticized the official fund disclosures as misleading and fiscally unsound. 
Among the recommendations to be proposed by the Government Accounting Standards Board is a new way to calculate today's value of pensions that will be paid in the future, in response to complaints that the current method drastically understates what governments owe.
The rule makers would also bar actuarial techniques that some states and cities have been quietly using to make it look as if pension cuts for the workers they will hire in the future are already producing savings today. That would appear to affect states including Illinois, Rhode Island, Ohio, Texas and Arkansas.
A third change would require cities and towns that participate in big, state-run pension systems like the New York State Common Fund to report their share of the systems' total obligations. Not all currently do so, making it impossible to trace such promises back to the municipalities that have to pay them.
The recommendations are efforts to forge a compromise between the sides in the hopes of getting states and cities to adopt the rules. But the proposals are likely to heighten the antagonism between interested parties with vehemently opposing views.
''We expect a lot of pushback,'' said Robert H. Attmore, the chairman of the accounting standards board, in an interview.
Public pension policy has grown increasingly polarized as municipalities and state governments face mounting pension costs at the same time that overall state revenues have constricted in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. Workers, unions, government officials and consultants who work for public pension funds contend that a full-blown accounting overhaul is unnecessary, and they suspect hidden agendas. They view substantial changes as a way to weaken public employees' unions and take benefits away, or as an opportunity for outside interests to get a crack at managing some of the billions held in pension trusts.
But economists and other proponents of significant changes argue that official pension numbers are fundamentally inaccurate. They warn that the current pension portrayals mask a looming fiscal breakdown as more and more public workers retire, threatening taxpayers whose own retirement plans have been shredded since 2008. Those taxpayers must still pay higher taxes to finance the pensions of public workers, some of whom can retire in their 50s, sometimes even in their 40s.
Rather than choose sides in the dispute, the rule makers have charted a third course, Mr. Attmore said.
''Nobody believes that it's going to be exactly correct,'' he said. ''We're trying to get as close as we can to what we think economic reality will be.''
The most closely watched issue for the board has been how to measure the value, in today's dollars, of all the pension benefits that governments must pay in the future. The process involves the use of a rate, known as a discount rate, to convert between dollars in the future and dollars today.
For years, economists and other analysts have complained that the current accounting rules call for governments to use a rate that is much too high, greatly understating the cost of the benefits they have promised, and making unsustainable plans look viable. Since public pensions are protected by state laws and constitutions, they have urged the accounting board to require a rate like the one for safe investments like Treasury bills.
The other side responds that most public pension plans look viable because they really are viable. It has urged the accounting board to preserve the current method, in which governments use their expected rates of return on the assets in their pension funds.
The accounting board's proposed solution would require governments to blend the two rates. Each government would be required to project all the pensions owed in the coming decades and all the investment returns it expects. By analyzing these cash-flow projections, governments would be able to see whether they were setting enough money aside, and if not, which year in the future they would run out, called the ''cross-over point.''
Until now, analysts who have warned that some pension funds could run out of money and tried to estimate when have been accused of fear-mongering and using faulty assumptions. Mr. Attmore said the rule makers hoped to keep the projections honest by making governments explain how they calculated their cross-over points.
In addition, governments would have to provide a sensitivity analysis, showing how changes in their assumptions would affect their final numbers.
After projecting how many years their pension assets would last, each government would use that information to calculate its own discount rate. It would be a blend, combining the rate governments now use for the years up to the cross-over point, and a more punitive low-risk rate for the years after that. The low-risk rate would be based on an index of tax-exempt municipal bonds, Mr. Attmore said.
Governments would then spread the cost over the estimated working lives of their employees. If the portion that workers have already earned exceeds the fair value of the pension assets, the excess would go onto the government's balance sheet. Benefits that workers expect to earn in the future would not be shown on the balance sheet, Mr. Attmore said. Currently, all pension disclosures are tucked away in footnotes.
This method might not satisfy critics, Mr. Attmore acknowledged, but it would shine a bright light on the public plans at greatest risk of running out of money, or those whose burdens would crowd out required government services. If adopted, the new rules would give governments an adjustment period, rather than demanding big, controversial changes overnight.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating certain states' and cities' pension numbers for possible fraud, but Mr. Attmore said he could not comment on the legal implications for governments whose current methods would not be allowed in the future.

HEADLINE: Ethanol Subsidies Besieged

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Federal subsidies for corn ethanol have long been considered untouchable in Washington -- not least because politicians want the votes of Iowans, who have traditionally held the first nominating caucuses in the contest for the presidency.
But this year, cutting the budget deficit holds more allure than courting corn farmers, making a turning point in ethanol politics.
In Washington, there is growing consensus that the ethanol industry has reached financial stability, making much government assistance unnecessary. A strong majority of the Senate recently voted to end most of the subsidies.
The pressure prompted three influential senators to announce a compromise on Thursday that would drastically cut the financial support and end a tariff on foreign ethanol entirely by the end of July. The White House, which has supported a reduction of the subsidies, said it was encouraged by the latest proposal. 
Three Republican presidential candidates -- Tim Pawlenty, Ron Paul and Rick Santorum -- are also seeking to eliminate or phase out subsidies for the industry even if that hurts them in Iowa. Jon Huntsman has decided he will not even participate in the caucuses, in large part because of his antisubsidy record.
No one is seeking to end the most important government support for ethanol -- a federal mandate that gasoline blenders mix increasing amounts of ethanol into gasoline. But at a time when many tax breaks are under scrutiny, there seems to be little political will to continue giving $6 billion a year in federal tax credits to fuel blenders that must buy the ethanol anyway.
Further undermining support for ethanol are food makers and livestock farmers, who say the industry's huge demand for corn is driving up their own costs, and the oil industry, which has never been fond of a fuel that displaces some of the gasoline in cars and trucks.
Recognizing reality, ethanol makers say they are willing to give up most of the money, although they and their allies in Congress want to spend some of the savings on new subsidies instead.
''They always say, 'It's just a few more years,' and now the few more years has added up to decades,'' said Jay Hakes, a former director of the federal Energy Information Agency and now director of the Jimmy Carter Library. Noting that the early subsidies provided by the Carter administration were originally intended to be temporary, he added, ''The time for heavy subsidies for corn-based ethanol has passed.''
Corn ethanol production has hit record levels this year, beating government goals and creating a surplus for export. With oil prices close to $100 a barrel, fuel blenders have not needed tax credits to make ethanol economically attractive, since wholesale ethanol is cheaper than gasoline in many markets. And the mandate, known as the renewable fuels standard, has increased the required amounts of ethanol that fuel blenders must use to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012 from four billion gallons in 2006.
Many top ethanol producers, like Valero Energy, Archer Daniels Midland and POET, are stable and profitable -- a contrast to the heavily indebted companies of five years ago, some of which were forced into bankruptcy.
Corn prices, meanwhile, have more than tripled since Congress first created an ethanol mandate in 2005, as the portion of the American corn crop devoted to ethanol has grown to nearly 40 percent. Food manufacturers and cattle and chicken farmers say the government's support for ethanol is, in effect, pushing up food prices.
''Over the last two years, the oil industry has been joined by food producers, environmentalists, as well as the poultry producers who use grain as a feed, to create a powerful coalition against ethanol subsidies,'' said Divya Reddy, an energy analyst for the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm.
Reflecting the new landscape, the Senate voted 73-27 in June to end the tariff on foreign ethanol and cut annual tax credits for blenders of ethanol. The vote was largely symbolic since the amendment was attached to a bill that failed. But many analysts view it as a sign that neither benefit is likely to survive this summer's negotiations between the Obama administration and Congress to deal with the national debt.
Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat and the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is among those who have shifted views on ethanol. Although he remains a strong supporter of the renewable fuels standard, he says the tax credit is no longer necessary.
''It doesn't make sense to provide people with a tax subsidy to encourage people to do what they would otherwise do at any rate,'' Mr. Bingaman said. ''The fact that we have budget problems is making the need to phase out or eliminate the tax credit that much more urgent.''
Many economists say an end to the blender's tax subsidy would have minimal impact.
''In the short term, six to nine months, we might see a minor reduction in production,'' said David A. Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University. ''But within a year or so, we would expect production to climb back to where it is right now because we still have the mandate, which guarantees demand and maintains the price level of ethanol.''
As for the tariff -- a 54-cent-a-gallon tax on imported ethanol first imposed in 1980 -- analysts say it is unnecessary now because Brazil, generally a leading source, is tightening production. Brazilian refiners make ethanol from sugar cane, but with sugar prices high on international markets, they are making less ethanol and more sweetener.
Mark Marquis, president of Marquis Energy, which operates two ethanol plants in Illinois and Wisconsin, said the industry understands that times have changed.
''We don't need the blender's credit,'' said Mr. Marquis, who is also a director of Growth Energy, an ethanol lobbying group. ''It's time that it goes away.''
But that does not mean the ethanol industry wants to give up the money entirely.
The fuel blending mandate has resulted in a standard of 10 percent ethanol mixed into gasoline sold at most service stations in the country. But with gasoline demand essentially flat, so is demand for ethanol.
In January, the Environmental Protection Agency said cars and light trucks built since 2001 could safely use a blend with up to 15 percent ethanol, although few stations are now equipped to supply that. So the ethanol industry now wants the government to help it grow by subsidizing gas pumps.
Industry lobbyists are now supporting a compromise announced Thursday by Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and a critic of ethanol subsidies, and two ethanol supporters, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Thune, Republican of South Dakota. That proposal would end the blender's tax credit entirely and dedicate $1.33 billion of the $2 billion in unspent money from this fiscal year's budget for deficit reduction.
The remaining $668 million would go toward tax credits for advanced biofuels and for gas stations to install special blender pumps to allow drivers to choose higher concentrations of ethanol in their gasoline.
''We have reached a bipartisan solution that reduces the federal deficit and modifies current biofuels policy without pulling the rug out from under American renewable energy producers,'' Senator Thune said in a statement.
The new plan might even end up costing taxpayers less than advertised, since it is not clear that gas stations will install the new blender pumps amid concerns that higher concentrations of ethanol could damage some vehicles.
''Most gas stations don't want it,'' said John Eichberger, vice president for government relations for the National Association of Convenience Stores. ''Even with financial support from the government, these products may not provide any return.''
Senator Bingaman said he expected that Congress would end or phase out the blender tax credits this year but might not go along with a new subsidy for gas stations.
That would disappoint Rick Brehm, president and chief executive of Lincolnway Energy, an Iowa corn ethanol distillery, who says the industry still needs help from the government.
''Ethanol is still in the adolescent stage of development,'' Mr. Brehm said, ''and an adolescent still needs a safety net.''

HEADLINE: As More Investors Seek Shelter in Gold, Russia Is Only Too Happy to Sell

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Two years ago during the global recession, gold bugs took note when Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev -- taking a swipe at the American dollar -- proposed that central banks hold reserves in what would be a new, gold-backed international currency.
But more recently, as gold prices have soared -- in part on market expectations that central banks will begin adding to gold reserves as a buffer against global uncertainties -- Russia is not following its own advice. 
Far from hoarding gold, Russia is selling it. The country's domestic gold mining industry has continued to sell onto international markets. Russia has also eased gold trading rules to let more gold be mined and exported more quickly.
Meanwhile, the Russian central bank is buying gold at a desultory pace that is barely keeping up with its overall accumulation of foreign currency reserves.
In short, Russia is selling gold because this has been a seller's market -- and the nation needs the money. After years of surpluses before the recession, Russia's federal budget has slipped into a deficit. And economists predict that Russia could also run a trade deficit within a few years, something that could be addressed in part by exporting gold.
Gold, which many investors view as the ultimate safe haven, is off the recent highs it reached in April. But the price is still up 62 percent in the last two years. And just this week, gold futures contracts have risen in response to continued uncertainty over the European debt crisis. On Thursday, spot gold contracts rose to $1,530.20 an ounce, up more than 3 percent for the week so far.
Russia was the fourth-largest gold producer globally last year, following China, Australia and the United States. (China in 2010 mined 351 metric tons of gold; Australia 261 tons and the United States 234 tons. Russia mined 203.)
When asked about Russian officials' supposed commitment to holding gold, the central bank issued written responses.
''The bank of Russia is not committed to buying any particular amount of gold,'' the bank said. ''Nor is there any official target amount of gold purchases. The bank buys gold at a market price, and its buying intentions completely depend on the market conditions.''
And despite Russia's frequent criticism of the dollar's status as an international currency, the bank statement said its gold policies were based purely on its investment judgment of the value of gold as a reserve. ''It doesn't result from the wish to diversify away from any particular asset or currency,'' the bank said.
Gold as a share of Russia's central bank's reserves has actually increased -- to 7.8 percent of the total this year, from 5.3 percent in January 2010. But nearly all of that gain is because of the rising value of the gold over that period.
The Russian bank's gold holdings are far below the global average of 12.1 percent as reported by the International Monetary Fund. And Russia's portion is minuscule compared with the United States, which holds 74 percent of its reserves in gold, according to the Treasury Department.
The Russian central bank now, as before the economic crisis, keeps about 50 percent of its reserves in United States dollars. It needs those assets on a daily basis to intervene in currency markets to smooth out fluctuations in monetary flows from Russia's main export of oil and natural gas, which are priced in dollars.
Russia's gold behavior seems grounded in the country's hard-learned lessons about commodity markets. Since its financial crisis in 1998, Russia has enacted policies intended to counterbalance the historical cycles of commodity prices to protect the economy during downturns.
Russia, for example, which is currently the world's largest oil producer, imposes high marginal taxes on oil exports during price spikes, with the proceeds shunted to Russia's sovereign wealth funds. During the recession, as oil prices plummeted, the government released a portion of these funds as a shock absorber for its domestic economy.
But gold, unlike oil, is naturally countercyclical. In times of economic insecurity, investors tend to buy gold. And so, for Russia's economy, an economic crisis can be a good time to sell, not stockpile.
And in contrast to tight state control of the far more lucrative petroleum industry, authorities have largely liberalized gold mining and trading in Russia, and have imposed no export restrictions or tariffs.
Russia formerly maintained tight Soviet-style secrecy around its gold reserves. Gold's glasnost occurred in 1992, when Yegor T. Gaidar, then prime minister, instructed the newly created central bank to publicly declare its holdings, at that point about 300 metric tons. (Last month the central bank held 854 metric tons of gold, while the United States Treasury, representing a much larger economy, reported holding 8,133 metric tons.)
There was more loosening in 1996 when Gokhran, a state agency that formerly had a monopoly on gold purchases, surrendered that role. Now, approximately 30 private banks are licensed to purchase gold. The largely liberalized sector has flourished.
''Our leaders pay far less attention to gold than to petroleum,'' Yuri V. Kirilov, director of Irmita-Konsalt, a consulting company, said in an interview.
The formerly highly secretive Gokhran agency, one of two state repositories for gold along with the central bank, also now publishes its reserves of gold bars. It had 12.3 tons in June. And like the central bank, it is not bulking up. So far this year, the agency has purchased only 375 kilograms of gold, according to Prime-Tass news agency.
Gokhran, formed in 1920 as a depository for jewelry confiscated from the bourgeoisie and from the millions of people sent to gulag camps under Stalin, had long embodied the mystery around Soviet and then Russian gold policy.
In one of the few residual areas of secrecy in Russian gold policy, it still does not disclose its volumes of gold jewelry from prison camp inmates and so-called trophy gold taken from Eastern European nations after World War II.

HEADLINE: Twitter to Raise $400 Million, Remaining Private for Now

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI

 BODY:
While Twitter isn't rushing to go public like some of its larger peers, the microblogging service has no problem luring deep-pocketed investors.
Twitter is in the process of raising $400 million in a deal that values the company at $8 billion, according to two people briefed on the matter. 
The financing round, which will be split into two portions, will be led by DST Global, the investment firm headed by the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner. Previous investors, including the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, will also participate, one person said.
A Twitter spokesman declined to comment.
With more than 200 million accounts, Twitter, based in San Francisco, is part of an elite group of social Web start-ups that have flourished in recent years by rapidly attracting users. While peers like Groupon and Zynga are now hurtling toward the public markets, Twitter is holding back.
''I think they're still trying to find a way to make it into a big business,'' said Rory Maher, an analyst for Hudson Square Research.
According to his analysis, the company makes about $200 million a year from online advertising and is close to profitability. At those levels, Mr. Maher said, a valuation of $8 billion - or roughly 40 times sales - is difficult to justify.
By comparison, Zynga, the popular online gaming company, recorded $597.5 million in revenue last year, with a profit of $90.6 million, according to a recent regulatory filing. The company, which has filed to go public, is expected to offer its shares at a valuation near or above $20 billion, which amounts to around 33 times sales.
''It's a small business,'' Mr. Maher said, describing the economics of Twitter. ''The ad volume isn't there. They're going to have to come up with products that drive more volume for them, and they need to increase the number of users.''
At present, Twitter makes the bulk of its money from an advertising platform that features ''promoted tweets.'' The program, which was rolled out in April 2010, displays sponsored messages in users' feeds or keyword searches. For instance, a recent search for ''Pepsi'' generated a message about a current summer promotion, paid for by PepsiCo.
Founded in 2006, Twitter is also adjusting to a recent management reshuffling. Dick Costolo - a former Google executive who was Twitter's chief operating officer - ascended to the chief executive job last October. Several months later, Jack Dorsey, who initially came up with the idea for Twitter and was its nonexecutive chairman, became head of product development.
Mr. Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Square, a mobile payments start-up, has been working closely with Mr. Costolo to improve Twitter's platform.
Despite its challenges, the company is attracting investor capital, at increasingly ambitious valuations.
In December, Twitter raised $200 million, from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Spark Capital, Benchmark Capital and Union Square Ventures. The investment back then valued the company at $3.7 billion.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Improvement Comes Up Short in South Texas Colonias

BYLINE: By EMILY RAMSHAW. 
eramshaw@texastribune.org

 BODY:
HARLINGEN -- Ask many of the officials charged with improving conditions in Texas' colonias about their progress and you will receive a string of pre-packaged responses: how generous state and federal budget writers have been, how wisely money has been spent, and how cooperatively they have worked together to aid the more than 2,300 impoverished villages on this side of the Mexican border.
''I don't want to be bragging, but the fact that we have several state agencies that have programs dedicated to the colonias, I have to give credit to the state for being able to provide some resources,'' said David Luna, director of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission's Office of Border Affairs. ''There's always a need for more. But being in public service, you have to learn the system and be patient.'' 
Patience is all the inhabitants of many Texas colonias have had. In Del Mar Heights, on the fringe of Cameron County, residents live on a devastated stretch of scrubland littered with dilapidated trailers and dotted with listing telephone poles. There are no paved streets or sewers, basic infrastructure that developers promised the Mexican immigrants who bought land here 30 years ago. There are often three families -- and several bleating goats -- to a lot. Floodwaters and hurricanes routinely sweep through the area, battering roofs patched with tarps and campaign signs.
''The elected officials remain pretty ignorant about all these issues,'' said Ann Cass, executive director for Proyecto Azteca, an organization that helps build safe and affordable homes in the Rio Grande Valley's colonias. ''There's so much turfism, so many bureaucratic challenges. If we as a nonprofit can't cut through all the red tape, how can we expect one of these families to do it?''
Conditions have clearly improved in the colonias -- Spanish for ''neighborhood'' or ''community'' -- since they were first established in the 1950s. At that time, opportunistic developers took worthless land, created unincorporated subdivisions with little or no infrastructure and began selling lots to predominantly Hispanic migrants looking for cheap land, often locking them into sky-high interest rates and precarious contract-for-deed mortgages. Of the nearly half a million residents in the colonias, an estimated 64 percent were born in the United States; some 85 percent of those under age 18 were born here.
In the last two decades, state and federal officials have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in roads, water lines and other public works projects and have taken legal action against the most unscrupulous developers. In the last four years, at least 250 more colonias got potable water, paved roads and wastewater systems, and 17,000 people moved out of conditions classified as the highest health risk, according to the Texas secretary of state's most recent report.
But advocates say many of these efforts have fallen short, and that even the best laid plans have had unintended consequences. Bureaucratic nightmares keep basic services and health care out of reach for many, and Catch-22s lead to a spiral of confusion and fees.
Many residents are duped into spending so much of their savings on land that they cannot afford to pay their taxes, let alone build a safe home, said Armando Garza Jr., mayor pro tem of San Juan and an advocate for the colonias.
When they cannot build to code, Mr. Garza continued, they cannot pass inspections to connect to water lines, sewers and electricity, and they are relegated to third-world conditions -- dragging extension cords and hoses over from their neighbors, using outhouses in lieu of flushing toilets, and adding on one substandard room at a time in a mess of concrete, tarps and composite wood.
''You need a permit for this, a permit for that,'' Mr. Garza said. ''It's so expensive; it's out of reach to connect to sewer, to water, even when it's available.''
Nieves, who declined to give his last name because he is in the United States illegally, is trapped in this cycle. He and his wife bought a lot on a rutted caliche road in Mexico Chiquito, outside Pharr, for $9,500 cash several years ago but cannot afford the hook-ups required to start building a home. Instead, they pay $200 a month to live without hot water or electricity in a dirt-floored rental shack next door, sharing a bedroom with their three teenage sons.
''Once our oldest son turns 18, we'll pass the deed on to him, because he's a citizen,'' said Nieves, a grease-blackened mechanic who came to the United States from Matamoros, Mexico. ''We're here so he can get an education, rise up. God willing, he will build on this land.''
Many programs designed to help families like these have seen little to no growth in financing over the last decade; others have faced cuts. State and federal grants ebb and flow depending on politics and the economy. When they are available, it is often a dog pile, with cities, counties and nonprofits competing for dollars.
''When there's a dollar on the table, it's all about who's going to get it,'' said Shirley Arnolde, head of nursing for Proyecto Desarrollo Humano, a community empowerment group.
Many advocates for colonias point to a glaring disconnect between ideas and results, between progress and reality. In interviews with nearly a dozen state, county and federal officials, they spoke of their ''coordination'' and ''oversight,'' their ''stakeholder'' participation. They listed reports they had commissioned and statistics they had collected. And they described public works projects and success stories that seemed, over the course of a week spent in the colonias, to be the exceptions, not the rule.
''In any bureaucracy, there are limitations. We work within those limitations and do the best with the tools we have,'' said Enriqueta Caballero, director of the Texas secretary of state's Colonia Initiatives Program, which she described as ''not funding, not regulatory, not enforcement -- more of a coordinating agency.''
''It's not an easy fix,'' Ms. Caballero added, ''but it's a great feeling to go out there and see projects and say, 'Wow, it was done.' ''
Cameron Park, a colonia on the outskirts of Brownsville, is the best example. Less than a decade ago, it had impassably muddy dirt roads, no city services and few homes up to code. Today, 90 percent of the streets are paved. There are sidewalks, streetlights and bus stops, ''all those things normal people are used to,'' said Alix Flores, the community development director for the Brownsville Community Health Center.
But Mr. Flores said the changes did not come through sweeping government grants or benevolent agency officials.
Rather, he said, they came through community mobilization. Residents became activists for improving their conditions, registering thousands of people to vote over the course of a few years and holding elected officials accountable for changes.
This is harder than it sounds in communities where residents fear authority and drawing any attention to themselves by registering to vote or demanding services. And the every-other-year election cycle for state lawmakers does not help: advocates for the colonias are constantly forced to educate and re-educate legislators.
''We'll make progress,'' said Oscar Munoz, deputy director of the Colonias Program at Texas A&M University's Center for Housing and Urban Development. ''But every time we have elections, it's almost like we have to start all over again.''

HEADLINE: Two Jobs Reports Point To a Higher Gain in June

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
New claims for unemployment benefits in the United States declined last week to the lowest level in nearly two months, according to a government survey on Thursday, while a separate report on jobs from the payroll processing company ADP was better than economists had forecast.
The reports were released a day ahead of the national monthly survey of the jobs market. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted that the survey would show the economy added 100,000 to nonfarm payrolls in June, up from a gain of 54,000 in May. The survey by Bloomberg did not forecast a rise in the unemployment rate, which edged up to 9.1 percent in May from 9.0 percent in April. 
The Labor Department said that initial claims for unemployment benefits declined by 14,000, to 418,000, as of July 1, reflecting a seasonally adjusted total. Economists had predicted 420,000.
ADP said its survey showed that the private sector added 157,000 jobs in June. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast that the ADP report would show 70,000 jobs for June.
''I would characterize those as fairly modest gains in employment,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR. ''They are better than last month's numbers but nothing to jump up and down about.''
Some economists use the ADP survey as a broad indicator for their forecasts of the monthly government jobs numbers. Mr. Shapiro said that the ADP survey had an ''inconsistent record'' in predicting the monthly government numbers, but it ''gets you in the general ballpark.''
He said in a telephone interview that he revised his forecast slightly higher on Thursday to 105,000 for the total nonfarm payrolls, from 80,000, after the ADP report.
Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said he raised his projection for the June payroll numbers to 140,000, from 100,000, after the better-than-expected ADP report. The firm predicts a gain of 165,000 private sector jobs and a loss of 25,000 government jobs.
The Labor Department report on Thursday also showed that applications for initial claims for jobless benefits exceeded 400,000 for the last 13 weeks. The four-week average fell to 424,750.
While that average is below the 440,000 peak in May, it is still above the levels of February and March.
''In order for labor market concerns to be allayed, we need to see the earlier downtrend in claims re-established,'' Mr. Shapiro said in a note. ''So far at least, there has not been a convincing move in that direction.''
Hiring slowed in May, according to the government's last monthly report, on a variety of factors that economists had seen as temporary, such as higher gas prices and the effects of cuts in the supply chain after the disasters in Japan in March.
''We clearly slowed on an underlying basis in the second quarter,'' said Mr. Gault, referring to overall economic growth. ''All the surveys showed a clear slowing in activity, and consumer spending growth is much slower, and there is no housing market recovery.
''It took a while before we actually saw that reflected in the payroll numbers, and it seemed to hit us all at once in May. Maybe June will show a better number than May, indicating that some of these headwinds are starting to ease.''
Online Correction: July 7, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that a Bloomberg News survey did not include a forecast for June's unemployment rate; the survey forecast no rise in the rate.

HEADLINE: Countdown for Shuttle, and for a Bit of the Florida Economy

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- As the scheduled launching of the final space shuttle approached, Tom and Jo Foley were having a dispute about the future of Space World U.S.A., the mom-and-pop souvenir shop they have run since 1968. He believes they should retire; she wants to stay open.
''We may sell,'' said Mr. Foley, 82, whose trinket-crammed NASA memorabilia shop is Florida's oldest. ''We just don't want to give people the impression the store is giving up on the space program.'' 
''Oh, we'll never sell the shop,'' Mrs. Foley, who does not tell her age, playfully retorted. ''He would just curl up and die without it.''
So go conversations up and down the Space Coast, where aeronautics are as culturally ingrained as sandy beaches and surfboard shops. Everyone feels the impact of the shuttle program's ending after 30 years and 135 flights, and questions about the area's future far outnumber answers.
Shuttles have launched here, on average, every three months since 1981 -- a ritual that is expected to draw up to a million people on Friday at 11:26 a.m. when, weather permitting, the Atlantis is scheduled to take its final flight. (NASA says there is a 70 percent chance the launching will be delayed by rainy weather.)
The Kennedy Space Center employs 13,000 people, and many thousands more work for aerospace contractors. Then there are businesses like the Foleys' -- on the order of NASA-themed restaurants and surfboard shops that take spectators on the water to watch the launchings -- that are bolstered by a regular tide of shuttle tourists. All of this in a county with 10.8 percent unemployment.
''The biggest focus economically is going to be keeping these talented, highly educated people in the area,'' said Bill Moore, the chief operating officer of the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex. ''We all have friends or husbands or brothers at the space center, and they're looking for work.''
Space center contractors have already announced 7,000 layoffs this year. And local officials worry about declining tourism as baby boomers age and memories of the golden age of space travel fade.
Marsha Getkey, the president of the Chamber of Commerce in Titusville, a city where many space center workers live, said it felt a little like the closing of a town's main factory. ''When a shuttle launch happens, people here don't just hear a rumble and look up,'' she said. ''You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't know the launch time and land time. It's that much a part of the community's fabric.''
That has created an atmosphere both nostalgic and celebratory around the space center, where visitors were already gathering Thursday to watch ''Star Trek'' movies, buy memorabilia and stake out viewing spots. Tickets to watch the launching from the best locations were selling for up to $1,200 online, as much as Super Bowl tickets.
''We're here to watch history, but we're also here to watch something become history,'' said Steve Allen, 64, an engineer from Colorado Springs who brought his family of five, all outfitted in blue NASA shirts.
The space center is expecting its largest crowd for a launching, despite the rain. Many tourists said they had dreamed of attending a NASA launching since the cold war, and splurged on the last opportunity of this kind.
''I bought a one-way ticket from South Korea,'' said Michael Kim, 57, an engineer. ''If it rains, I will just wait. Saturday. Sunday. Monday. I'm staying put.''
Robert E. Hunter, a historian from Chicago, persuaded his wife, Nancy Grim Hunter, to attend what he called a ''once-in-a-lifetime'' event: a trip that cost each of them about $1,000, including travel, rental car and souvenirs.
''A lot of times America gets criticized for what it does in the world,'' he said. ''But you think about the space program. It's something that doesn't hurt anyone, isn't imperialistic and is almost universally uplifting and inspiring.''
Carol Wyles, 70, a retired Lockheed Martin employee who lives near the center, has watched every launching since 1981. She has a routine -- sitting in her backyard with her grandchildren and her Chihuahua, Mojo, and counting down from 10 to zero -- that she will follow again.
''It's going to look the same,'' she said. ''But the feelings are going to be so much different.''
Mr. Moore said that only 5 percent of those who toured the visitors complex came for shuttle launching. But he said the space center planned to create new attractions involving unmanned and private space travel.
''The NASA story is not clear right now. It's still being written,'' Mr. Moore said. ''But even in this tumultuous time, it's going to be an historic weekend.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: ROBERT F. KENNEDY BRIDGE CELEBRATION: (Monday) It may not be as old or as famous as its Brooklyn sister, but at 75 years old the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, originally the Triborough Bridge, has a lot to crow about. Built during the Depression, it provided a crucial link in unifying the city, literally bringing together the boroughs of Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx, leaving a footprint also on Randalls Island. Opening on Monday -- the anniversary of the bridge's opening to traffic with a ceremony attended by President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- will be a display of historical photographs titled ''A Planner's Dream, an Engineer's Triumph, a Legacy to Our City. '' (At right, 1935 view of bridge construction from Astoria Park.) Sponsored by the Greater Astoria Historical Society and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Bridges and Tunnels, the exhibition runs through mid-November on Saturdays, noon to 5 p.m. and Mondays and Wednesdays, 2 to 5 p.m. On Monday the viewing starts with a special birthday party at 7 p.m., open to the public, featuring a panel of historians and transportation experts who will sing the bridge's praises
unlike the toll now needed to cross its span, the event is free. ''This is a birthday party, and you don't charge someone to attend a birthday party,'' said Bob Singleton, the historical society's executive director. The party continues with a series of walking tours in September and a continuing oral history project

HEADLINE: Nets Star Has Deal To Play In Turkey

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK and PETE THAMEL; Pete Thamel contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Deron Williams is set to become the biggest N.B.A. star to play in Europe -- a development that is bursting with intrigue, risks and caveats.
Williams, the Nets' star point guard, has agreed in principle to a one-year deal with the Turkish club Besiktas, according to the team's coach. His commitment would begin Sept. 1 -- when the N.B.A.'s lockout would be two months old -- and the deal includes an escape clause allowing him to return when the lockout ends.
''It's the biggest signing in the history of European basketball,'' Ergin Ataman, Besiktas' excitable coach, said Thursday. 
The agreement was confirmed by Misko Raznatovic, a European agent who works with Jeff Schwartz, the Los Angeles-based agent who represents Williams. Ataman and Raznatovic first met last month in Istanbul to discuss possible deals involving N.B.A. players.
Reports have pegged Williams's salary between $200,000 and $350,000 a month, or $2 million to $3.5 million for the 10-month Turkish league season. Raznatovic said that Williams, 27, would get between $1 million and $5 million, plus a car, housing and the tax breaks associated with playing overseas. He will also be provided with a security guard, driver and personal assistant, all of them available 24 hours a day. Ataman later told SI.com that Williams's deal would be paid for by a sponsor.
Ataman said he expected the deal to become official within 24 hours, and that the club's president, Yildirim Demiroren, would hold a news conference in the United States next week.
Besiktas opens its season Sept. 27. If Williams is on the court, he would be -- by far -- the biggest N.B.A. star to play overseas in his prime. But that day is far away, and Williams must first gain approval from the N.B.A. and FIBA, the world governing body for basketball.
In general, FIBA and the N.B.A. have an arrangement that precludes teams from signing players who are already under contract. But that agreement became moot July 1, when the N.B.A.'s labor deal expired and the league locked out its players.
''If there's a lockout, the players are free; their contracts are suspended,'' Commissioner David Stern said in February. ''It's that simple.''
N.B.A. officials reaffirmed that position Thursday, but indicated that they had not received any inquiry from FIBA regarding Williams.
FIBA has the authority to reject the deal if it determines, for instance, that signing N.B.A. players poses a risk to the stability of the European leagues -- because those players could leave at any time once the lockout ends. But there are no indications that FIBA intends to intervene.
FIBA has not yet been approached by Besiktas or the Turkish league regarding the Williams deal, according to a spokesman. It also has not established a policy for N.B.A. players under contract.
''We are currently working on a statement that will be sent to our membership and their clubs, that will clarify the legal situation,'' Patrick Koller, FIBA's head of communications, said in an e-mail.
Even if he gains approval, Williams could be risking the $34 million and two years left on his deal with the Nets. N.B.A. contracts are not insured against injuries sustained in another league. Conceivably, Besiktas could pay to insure Williams's Nets contract, but it could cost as much as $6.8 million.
The Nets have no ability to block the move. Nor can team officials comment publicly, because Stern has prohibited all N.B.A. personnel from talking about players during the lockout.
News of Williams's deal with Besiktas was greeted with surprise and heavy skepticism by a number of N.B.A. agents and executives Thursday. One prominent agent said it was not worth the risk and expressed doubt that Williams would ever put on a Besiktas uniform.
''A lot can happen in two months,'' said the agent, who did not want to be named discussing a player he did not represent.
Skeptics also cited a weak European economy and a history of European clubs failing to pay their players. Last season, Besiktas players briefly staged a strike when the team fell behind in paying them.
Although some N.B.A. stars have played overseas -- notably Dominique Wilkins and Bob McAdoo -- all of them made the move in the twilight of their careers. Allen Iverson played briefly for Besiktas last season, because no N.B.A. team would sign him. In 1989, Danny Ferry, the No. 2 pick in the draft, left for Italy rather than play for the dysfunctional Los Angeles Clippers. Despite his high draft standing, Ferry never became a star once he returned to the N.B.A.
Williams is different. He is a two-time All-Star and is widely regarded, along with Chris Paul of New Orleans, as one of the game's top two point guards. The Nets are counting on him to be their franchise player for years to come, and to help attract crowds when they move to Brooklyn in 2012.
If Williams plays for Besiktas, he will likely be an anomaly. Few teams in Europe have the resources to pay top N.B.A. players. And the best teams, including those in the Euroleague, will be reluctant to break up their rosters just to rent an N.B.A. player for a month or two.
''This will be, I think, a fairly unique situation,'' said Marc Cornstein, an N.B.A. agent who represents several international players. ''Because you're just not going to find a real combination of teams that can afford these kind of salaries, but also be willing to let a guy go the minute the lockout ends.''
Ataman said Zaza Pachulia, who plays for the Atlanta Hawks, also has an agreement to play for Besiktas. And the club is not done recruiting locked-out N.B.A. players, he said.
''If there's a possibility, we'll talk with Kobe if he'd like to play in Europe with Deron and with other guys to play we can talk with him,'' Ataman said. ''If Kobe would like to play with us, we will also contact his agent and maybe with him.''
Ataman acknowledged the risk that the lockout would end and Williams would leave. But, he said, ''We're happy, because Turkish boys will watch him play live.''

HEADLINE: Net Providers Plan Penalties To Slow Piracy

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO; Steve Lohr contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Americans who illegally download songs and movies may soon be in for a surprise: They will be warned to stop, and if they don't, they could find their Internet access slowing to a crawl.
After years of negotiations with Hollywood and the music industry, the nation's top Internet providers have agreed to a systematic approach to identifying customers suspected of digital copyright infringement and then alerting them via e-mail or other means.
Under the new process, which was announced Thursday, several warnings would be issued, with progressively harsher consequences if the initial cautions were ignored. 
The companies took pains to say that the agreement did not oblige Internet providers to shut down a repeat offender's account, and that the system of alerts was meant to be ''educational.'' But they noted that carriers would retain their right to cut off any user who violated their terms of service.
In bringing together the media companies and Internet carriers, the deal demonstrates how the once-clear line separating those two businesses has been blurred. Eight years ago, the Recording Industry Association of America had to sue Verizon to try to uncover the identity of a customer who was sharing music online. This year, Comcast completed its merger with NBC, bringing an owner of digital content and a conduit for it under the same roof.
Now the Internet providers are hoping to profit as they pipe music and video of the nonpirated variety to their customers.
''The I.S.P.'s want to cooperate with Hollywood because the carriers recognize that their own growth depends in part on bundled content strategies,'' said Eric Garland of BigChampagne, which tracks online media traffic. ''They don't want to be just utilities providing Internet access, but premium content distributors as well.''
The system announced on Thursday involves a series of six warnings that an Internet provider can send to a customer whom the media companies have identified as a possible copyright infringer.
The warnings escalate from simple e-mail notifications to, at levels 5 and 6, a set of ''mitigation measures,'' like reduced connection speeds or a block on Web browsing. As the alerts progress, a customer must acknowledge that he understands the notice. Customers will also have the opportunity to contest the complaint.
The effect on consumers, the companies hope, will be more of a deterrent-by-annoyance -- rather than the random lightning bolt of litigation that was once the preferred method of enforcement by the recording industry association, one of the parties to the agreement.
The media companies were also represented by the Motion Picture Association of America and groups acting on behalf of independent record companies and filmmakers. The Internet carriers involved in the deal include AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, Verizon and Time Warner Cable.
The music and movie companies, which estimate that digital piracy costs the United States economy $16 billion in lost revenue each year, have been eager for an efficient way to deal with the problem.
As illegal downloading has become ingrained as a cultural habit, especially among young people, expensive litigation has become less effective, and the lawsuits against individuals were something of a public relations disaster for the music companies. The new deal, the companies say, offers plenty of chances for even the most recalcitrant pirates to reform.
''This is a sensible approach to the problem of online content theft and, importantly, one that respects the privacy and rights of our subscribers,'' Randal S. Milch, executive vice president and general counsel for Verizon, said in a statement.
The agreement has an unlikely origin: it came about as a result of an effort to crack down on child pornography that was led by Andrew M. Cuomo while he was the New York attorney general.
In 2008, Mr. Cuomo, who is now the governor, brokered a deal in which several major Internet providers agreed to block access to online sources of child pornography. Seeing this, the recording industry association approached Mr. Cuomo for help with music piracy, said Cary H. Sherman, the association's president.
''We pointed out to him that there are overlaps between the child porn problem and piracy,'' Mr. Sherman said, because all kinds of files, legal and otherwise, are traded on peer-to-peer networks.
Mr. Cuomo led the early talks between the Internet carriers and entertainment companies, and on Thursday he issued a statement praising the deal.
The agreement, he said, ''provides a rational and thoughtful solution -- a solution that respects the rights of copyright holders as well as I.S.P.'s and their customers -- to a problem that has plagued the Internet.''
Under the agreement, the content owners will deliver evidence of illegal file-sharing to the Internet providers, which are then responsible for sending alerts and meting out penalties. The Internet providers will not disclose the identity of the offending customer to the media companies.
Many media and arts groups applauded the deal, saying that it would more effectively reduce piracy and therefore benefit the creators of music and movies, whose fortunes have eroded over the last decade.
Others, including Public Knowledge, an Internet rights group, and the Center for Democracy and Technology expressed concerns that consumers might be punished ''based on allegations that have not been tested in court.''
Many Internet music experts expressed doubt that the alert system would succeed in stamping out piracy. The new system largely aims for peer-to-peer file-sharing tools like BitTorrent. But plenty of other technologies exist for enterprising pirates, many of which might allow them to evade easy detection.
''The challenge is that consumers will continue to do whatever they wish on the Internet, and find clever ways to not attract the attention of the content companies or I.S.P.'s,'' said Mr. Garland of BigChampagne, whose company has long traced the proliferation of file-sharing. ''It will never end.''

HEADLINE: At Goldman, Pressure on Staff Members to Keep a Low Profile

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
Jim Wilson/The New York TimesAllen Mask, a former Goldman employee who now works at Google, is pursuing his passion for hip-hop music.When Matt Levine, a vice president at Goldman Sachs, announced in May that he was leaving his job to become a full-time writer for Dealbreaker, a satirical blog that covers the finance industry, a few colleagues gave him a wary send-off.
''Pretty much everyone thought it was awesome, though some of them are sort of nervous about talking to me now,'' he said. 
Katie Baker got a similar reaction when she announced that she was planning to leave Goldman's private wealth management division, where she worked as a vice president, to write for Grantland, a new ESPN sports site. While colleagues in her group were excited, Ms. Baker, 28, had to meet with Goldman executives, who quickly rejected her plans to continue working at the firm for her final two weeks, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.
Restless Wall Street workers often dream about quitting their jobs, breaking the so-called golden handcuffs of high-paying finance careers to chase their passions. But several recent Goldman Sachs employees with interests in the media, arts and other visible industries have found themselves in uncomfortable positions with the firm. At Goldman and other banks whose reputations were damaged in the financial crisis, a public persona can be a liability.
In Ms. Baker's case, she was told that writing about her time at Goldman would represent a breach of her confidentiality agreement, which extended indefinitely. The firm informed Mr. Levine, 33, that he would have to take a paid 60-day leave before he could start at Dealbreaker, a common industry waiting period referred to as a ''garden leave.''
''I don't think it's all that surprising, given everything that's gone on with Goldman Sachs and the press,'' said Bess Levin, the Dealbreaker editor who hired Mr. Levine.
A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Ms. Baker and Mr. Levine declined to talk about the contractual terms of their departure, citing their confidentiality agreements.
Investment banks have always prized discretion among employees. But at Goldman - an investment bank so private that many of its employees refer to it simply as ''the firm'' - there is added pressure to keep a low profile.
Allen Mask came to Goldman's retail analyst program as a 22-year-old with a side career. An amateur rapper during his time at the University of North Carolina, Mr. Mask had recorded several albums and hoped to further his music career in New York.
''At first, it was a cool thing, and everyone at the firm was like, 'We're here to support you,' '' said Mr. Mask, now 23. ''They knew that was part of my life.''
But then a financial blogger discovered his Goldman connection and posted one of his performance videos online, crowning him the ''hip-hop investment banker.'' As more blogs and media outlets picked up his story, Goldman's media gatekeepers clamped down. They declined interview and television requests on his behalf and eventually gave him strict orders: no more performing, no more recording and no speaking to the media.
Mr. Mask, faced with a choice between his music and his finance career, decided to quit.
''I didn't do anything to deserve the negative treatment and the harassment I got,'' said Mr. Mask, who now works for Google and lives in Silicon Valley. ''It's not like I changed the share price.''
Tom Comerford, an employee in Goldman's graphics department, was also a victim of side-career success. In his spare time, he moonlighted for the Wall Street Experience, giving guided tours of New York's financial district. When a British newspaper wrote an article about Mr. Comerford, he was called into meetings with the firm's legal and compliance officers. He left the firm of his own accord shortly thereafter.
''I told them I could understand their anger,'' said Mr. Comerford, who still gives Wall Street tours.
''But they said, 'No, you don't understand. Even if you want to be on the board of your condo, you have to get it passed through us,' '' he added. ''They're very covetous over their name.''
Goldman has regulatory reasons to be wary. A federal rule requires employees at financial institutions to disclose outside sources of income. Ms. Baker, the wealth manager, wrote paid freelance articles for several blogs while on the job at Goldman without informing the firm, a clear violation of the regulation.
But reputation is just as important on Wall Street.
''People expect their bankers to behave like bankers,'' said one former trader at JPMorgan Chase, who left the firm to pursue a film career. The trader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his relationships at the bank, added, ''You're not supposed to be known for anything else or stand out for anything besides your work.''
Image concerns in the corporate world are hardly unique to Goldman, and not everyone gets the third degree. Frank Leung, who worked at Goldman's London office, left in 2009 to open a Mexican restaurant with a friend from college. Mr. Leung said that he was on good terms with his former colleagues, some of whom he continued to serve as customers at the restaurant.
''Maybe they're more lenient in the United Kingdom,'' he said.
Regardless of the tenor of their departures, recent Goldman dropouts said they were happier now. Mr. Levine and Mr. Mask emphasized that they still had good relationships with Goldman, and Ms. Baker said that her only regret was quitting before a Shake Shack diner went up next to the firm's Manhattan headquarters. (''Goldman always wins,'' she joked.)
For Mr. Levine, taking a big pay cut to work at Dealbreaker - a blog that covers, and often lampoons, his old employer - could be seen as a rogue move. But the blog's editor, Ms. Levin, said she did not expect Mr. Levine to reveal any trade secrets, although she was excited about having a Wall Street insider on staff.
''Of course Goldman expects me not to write about anything that I saw or did at the firm,'' Mr. Levine said. ''But I was a corporate equity derivatives marketer and believe me, no one wants to read about that.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Regulator Adopts New Rules on Derivatives, a Key Step in a Wall St. Overhaul

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Federal regulators on Thursday adopted the first in a series of new rules for the derivatives market, giving the government broad new authority over the $600 trillion industry that played a central role in the financial crisis.
The rules, approved unanimously by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, greatly expand the government's ability to police insider trading and other fraud. The plan, regulators say, injects new life into the commission's often-hamstrung enforcement efforts.
''We will use these tools to be a more effective cop on the beat, to promote market integrity and to protect market participants,'' Gary Gensler, the commission's chairman, said at a public meeting in Washington on Thursday. ''Effective regulation requires an effective enforcement program.'' 
Another crucial rule enacted on Thursday requires hedge funds and other large firms to turn over details about their derivatives trading to the commission. The agency approved five rules altogether, a critical step in the push to overhaul Wall Street regulation in the aftermath of the crisis.
Still, more than 40 derivatives regulations remain unfinished. The commodities agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission recently said they would miss the July 16 deadline to complete most derivatives rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, enacted a year ago this month.
While Mr. Gensler plans to complete the remaining proposals by the end of the year, some Republican regulators want the agency to slow down even further. Jill Sommers, a Republican official at the agency, warned on Thursday that the agency was ''haphazardly'' finishing the rules to meet ''arbitrary deadlines.''
Mr. Gensler defended the agency's efforts to overhaul the derivatives market, noting that the opaque securities contributed ''to the bubble in the housing market and helped to accelerate the financial crisis.''
In the lead up to the crisis, investors bought billions of dollars' worth of derivatives as insurance on mortgage-backed securities. When the underlying mortgages soured, the American International Group and other firms that sold the deals could not meet their obligations.
The new regulations approved on Thursday could prevent a repeat of the mess, Mr. Gensler said.
One rule allows the agency to survey the swaps market, a type of derivative contract that previously was off limits. Under the proposal, hedge funds, energy firms and other large players in the market must turn over daily reports detailing an array of private data, including their stakes in swaps and records of their trades.
When traders run amok in the derivatives market, another rule grants the agency broad new powers to prosecute fraud and manipulation.
For years, the agency had to prove that a trader intended to manipulate the market -- and successfully created artificial prices. Now, the agency eased the standard so that prosecutors only have to show a trader intended to act ''recklessly.'' The plan, modeled on the S.E.C.'s insider trading ban, also prohibits trading on ''material nonpublic'' information that is obtained illegally.
''We currently have a nearly impossible manipulation standard,'' said Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the commodities agency. Mr. Chilton noted that the agency had won only one price manipulation case in 35 years.
The expanded authority, however, is ''critical ammo in the commission's enforcement arsenal,'' he said.
Proponents of regulation welcomed the agency's ruling.
''The C.F.T.C. provided good news today for investors and the financial markets,'' said Dennis M. Kelleher, the president of Better Markets, an advocacy group. ''We look forward to broad application and aggressive enforcement to ensure that market manipulation is eliminated.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Geico Uses Many Campaigns to Stand Out in a Crowd

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
MOVE over, gecko, cavemen, the Rod Serling clone who asks rhetorical questions and the rest of the Geico advertising characters. Geico is adding another campaign to its lengthy list of ad approaches.
Geico, the insurance company that is part of the Berkshire Hathaway empire of Warren E. Buffett, has long been known for running four or five campaigns at once. The look and style of the ads vary, but some core ideas are repeated from one campaign to another, among them the concept of how spending 15 minutes with Geico can help save money on insurance purchases.
The new campaign, which began appearing this week, is, in fact, centered on that idea of saving money -- in this instance, the ads suggest, by using geico.com. (Other ads also promote contacting Geico through a toll-free number or by calling a local agent.) 
The initial commercials in the new campaign use exaggerated humor to depict some difficult, and possibly unpleasant, methods of saving money. Among the extreme measures are teaching a 5-year-old to dunk a basketball so that he may eventually land a college scholarship, economizing on sushi by foraging in your fish tank, replacing the human workers at a day care center with robots and avoiding the expense of downloading music by teaching pets to play songs.
In each instance, it is not immediately clear that the spot is a Geico commercial. That becomes apparent at the end, when an announcer declares: ''There's an easier way to save. Get online, go to geico.com, get a quote.'' The camera then pulls back to show the Web site on a computer screen.
The idea behind multiple, simultaneous campaigns is to break through the proverbial clutter by attracting attention as well as avoiding the risk of wear-out -- that is, boring or annoying potential customers who may get tired of seeing and hearing the same pitches again and again.
That is a particular risk for a marketer that, like Geico, spends so much money each year on advertising. According to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, Berkshire Hathaway spent $745.2 million to advertise Geico in major media last year, an increase of 20.8 percent from the $617 million spent in 2009.
And the wallet stayed open into the first quarter of this year, Kantar Media reported, as spending for Geico ads totaled $184.1 million, up 6 percent from the $173.7 million spent during the same period last year.
The Geico strategy has been deemed successful enough that it is being followed by several other companies in the crowded insurance field, among them Allstate, Progressive and State Farm.
The goal of multiple campaigns is to be noticed in a hyper-competitive category, said Tim Van Hoof, advertising director at State Farm in Bloomington, Ill., which recently made significant changes in one of the two campaigns it is running.
In a recent interview, Mr. Van Hoof made a joking reference to an insurance company that runs 28 campaigns at once. No names, of course.
Asked if multiple campaigns to cut through the clutter only produce additional clutter, Mr. Van Hoof replied: ''Am I overly concerned about having two campaigns? No.''
Rather, he said, he was more concerned ''about them breaking through in a very noisy marketplace.''
That, too, is the belief among executives at Geico and its creative agency, which is the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
''Competitors are making it tough out there,'' said Amy Hooks, manager for broadcast production at Geico. ''It raises the bar for us.''
The reason for ''keeping things fresh'' by periodically introducing additional campaigns, she added, is to ''not burn out.''
Business results indicate the strategy is working, Ms. Hooks suggested, because ''we're still the fastest-growing company in our category,'' and ''we've had a great first half'' of the year.
Steve Bassett, group creative director at Martin, said the purpose of the new campaign is to ''freshen the savings message'' and take advantage of how, ''in this economy, people are talking about how to save money.''
The campaign seeks to increase its appeal with the ''misdirect'' or ''rug-pull,'' Mr. Bassett said, of presenting the ''faux testimonials'' from consumers that turn out to be ridiculous, unwieldy ways to pinch pennies.
''It's something a little different to drive people to geico.com and to emphasize how easy it is,'' he added, ''versus how hard it is to teach a 5-year-old to dunk.''
The Geico campaigns that are currently running on television, in addition to the basketball commercial in the ''Easier way to save'' campaign, include spots with the gecko character, sports-themed spots with the cavemen and many spots with the earnest man, reminiscent of Mr. Serling of ''The Twilight Zone,'' asking the rhetorical questions.
The most recent addition to the questions campaign is a commercial that mocks how people use smartphones ''to do dumb things,'' among them giving themselves a ''brostache,'' a virtual mustache. The spot offers viewers a free brostache application, which, Mr. Bassett said, has already been downloaded 100,000 times.
Additional Geico campaigns run in magazines and newspapers. Some echo television commercials and others are unique to print. One print campaign is customized for the publications in which the ads appear.
For instance, an ad in Cooking Light magazine carries this headline: ''It takes years to learn how to properly pair wines. Fortunately, it only takes 15 minutes to see how much you could save with Geico.''

HEADLINE: Positive Signs on Hiring Help to Rally Shares

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks hit five-week highs on Thursday as data on private sector hiring raised optimism about the economy, while oil prices posted their biggest gain in two months on strong fuel demand. 
The euro rose against the dollar for the first time in three sessions after Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, said the bank would relax rules and keep providing liquidity to struggling Portugal, allaying worries about Europe's debt crisis.
On Wall Street, stocks rallied as surprisingly strong hiring by private employers in June and strong retail sales added to optimism a day before the critical June payrolls report.
The payrolls processing company ADP reported that private employers in the United States added 157,000 jobs last month, more than double the 68,000 expected by the market.
''We went through a multimonth period of disappointing data, and now it is coming in better than anticipated, and that reset of expectations is providing a nice tailwind to markets,'' said Gary Flam, portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles.
Wall Street was also helped by a decline in the number of claims for new jobless benefits.
Analysts said stocks could rally further on Friday if the Labor Department put June jobs growth at more than 125,000.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 93.47 points, or 0.74 percent, at 12,719.49. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 14 points, or 1.05 percent, at 1,353.22. The Nasdaq composite was up 38.64 points, or 1.36 percent, at 2,872.66.
Global and European stocks hit their highest levels since June 1. The MSCI world equity index rose 0.8 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.4 percent at 1,123.32.
Oil prices surged as the stronger labor market data and decline in American crude stockpiles supported views of an economy in recovery.
Stockpiles fell an unexpectedly high 3.2 million barrels last week ahead of the long Independence Day weekend, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed. The United States is the world's largest energy consumer.
The euro was last up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.44, rebounding from a session low of around $1.42, Reuters data showed.
The euro zone single currency recouped losses against the dollar as investors were encouraged by the European Central Bank's move to suspend minimum credit rating requirements for Portugal's debt despite Moody's recent downgrade of the nation to junk.
The central bank's decision to help Portugal ''has provided more reassurance that European authorities will support the euro at almost any cost,'' said Camilla Sutton, senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ''That has taken away some of the uncertainty.''
Treasury prices fell on the encouraging jobs data and the European Central Bank action.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 8/32 to 99 28/32, while its yield rose to 3.14 percent, up from 3.11 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Biggest Stock of Foreclosed Homes: Right Here

BYLINE: By BRIDGET O'SHEA and JAMES O'SHEA. 
boshea@chicagonewscoop.org; joshea@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Although it never shared the notoriety of Miami, Los Angeles and Phoenix during America's foreclosure crisis, the Chicago area now has the nation's largest inventory of foreclosed homes because it is harder to unload troubled properties here than in most other metropolitan areas.
According to data compiled by RealtyTrac, a California company that tracks housing sales, Chicago ranks first among the country's 20 largest metropolitan areas.
Real estate experts attribute the high concentration of foreclosures to numerous factors including the strong protections built into Illinois law to protect borrowers, the impact of the ''robo-signing'' investigation by the Illinois attorney general, and the reluctance of banks to dump properties at prices far below the value of mortgage loans on their books.
As a result, banks and real estate firms here take longer to dispose of the properties they seize when loans go bad. The Chicago metropolitan area had 118,776 homes in May 2011 that were either owned by banks or were in the process of being taken over by lenders because the owners could no longer afford their monthly mortgage payments, according to RealtyTrac. 
The Chicago area inventory exceeds numbers in the Los Angeles and Miami areas, where the foreclosure crisis seemed particularly severe, and Chicago's inventory of foreclosed homes is falling more slowly than elsewhere, real estate and legal experts say.
The stubbornly high level of the foreclosure inventory here also seems to have a negative impact on housing prices in neighborhoods without a large number of foreclosures. A report from the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index, a leading measure of the health of the residential housing market, said Chicago single-family home prices in April declined 0.4 percent from March while the service's 20-city index rose 0.7 percent, the first increase in eight months.
''I don't think you can say that a person in Lincoln Park will hold off buying a home because things are not going well in Pullman,'' said Winifred Curran, an associate professor of geography at De Paul University who has studied the foreclosure problems in Chicago. ''But there is definitely a ripple effect.'' That occurs, she said, when ''there is a sense that the city does not have a healthy market.''
Some real estate and foreclosure experts, like Rick Rogers of the Rogers Law Group in Bannockburn, expressed skepticism about the numbers. Mr. Rogers said it often took far longer to foreclose on properties in states like Florida, Nevada and Michigan. Ms. Curran of DePaul also said the RealtyTrac numbers trended high.
But RealtyTrac says it compiles data from more than 2,200 counties throughout the United States to create a report on the top 20 metropolitan areas that conform to United States Census tracts.
The May 2011 RealtyTrac data, in which the foreclosure inventory here drifted lower from prior months as sales picked up slightly, said the Los Angeles area ranked second, with 86,745 homes either owned by banks or in the process of foreclosure. New York City ranks third with 84,600.
The data, which go back to January 2008 -- when the bursting of the years-long housing bubble was first gaining national attention -- show that the Chicago region has consistently ranked near the top in the listings.
The data suggest that banks and real estate agents in the area do not sell foreclosed properties as rapidly as they do in places like Miami, where home prices soared but then fell quickly.
Chicago sells fewer foreclosed homes each month than any other major metropolitan area except New York, where state laws similar to Illinois's offer protections that make it hard for banks to drive borrowers from their homes. During the first five months of the year, for instance, an average 4,004 foreclosed homes in Phoenix were sold each month. The monthly averages were only 1,697 foreclosed-home sales in Chicago, while 762 foreclosed properties sold in New York.
Ms. Curran at DePaul said that the housing boom in places like Miami had been so hot that banks became more desperate when prices plummeted and were more willing to sell at lower prices than in the Midwest, where housing prices rose but at a much slower pace than in other places.
''I think it's the banks; they are not willing to lower prices,'' said John Bouman, president of the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, an advocacy organization for low-income people. ''So these properties just sit there empty because they don't want to sell it at a lower price and lose the money they have in it.''
Mr. Bouman, who lives in Maywood, said the foreclosure problems had made it difficult for his family. The house across the street from him has been vacant for more than a year, he said, and he knows of two prospective buyers who inquired about the property but could not get satisfactory answers from the bank.
Mr. Bouman said he and his wife had thought about selling their house and moving to a condominium in Chicago, but the glut of foreclosures had depressed prices so much that he could not get enough money for his house to afford one.
''Sometimes I think that it's hard to find anyone at the banks who can make a decision,'' Mr. Bouman said, ''so these properties just sit there.''
Geoff Smith, a senior vice president at the Woodstock Institute, a nonprofit research organization that specializes in housing issues, said one factor contributing to Chicago's slow sales rate was that Illinois is a judicial state that requires banks to go through a court system to foreclose on a property rather than simply filing a notice to the borrower. Numerous consumer safeguards typically slow down the process and cause a backlog of cases in the courts.
Mr. Smith said the ''robo-signing'' scandal currently under investigation by Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general, also contributed to the slower pace. ''Robo-signing'' refers to the robotic generation of erroneous or fraudulent loan documents by companies that service mortgage loans. Some foreclosures were based on fake documents, giving homeowners an opportunity to challenge the right of financial institutions to seize the property.
''Problems were generated by the servicers not processing these correctly,'' Mr. Smith said. ''This led to government intervention. The state had to make sure its citizens were protected.''
According to a study done by Nicholas Bianchi of National People's Action, a national community rights organization, the nation's five largest banks -- Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank, J. P. Morgan Chase Bank, Citibank and US Bank -- are involved in three of every five foreclosures in Cook County. Mr. Bianchi's study says most foreclosures also occurred in black and Latino neighborhoods.
Several banks declined to comment about the reasons for the slow pace of sales here.
Daren Blomquist, the marketing and communications director at RealtyTrac, said he thought there was a big difference between foreclosures in the Midwest and the West, where the real estate boom drove prices sharply higher.
Foreclosures of western properties tended to be in sought-after suburbs, he said, but in Chicago they came in older, economically weaker neighborhoods.
''In the West, there were a lot of foreclosures on newer properties in suburbs that might be more desirable to someone trying to get back into the market,'' he said.
In contrast, Mr. Blomquist said foreclosures in the Midwest tended to be in neighborhoods where the property might have been more vulnerable to neglect or vandalism.

HEADLINE: The Unexamined Society

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Over the past 50 years, we've seen a number of gigantic policies produce disappointing results -- policies to reduce poverty, homelessness, dropout rates, single-parenting and drug addiction. Many of these policies failed because they were based on an overly simplistic view of human nature. They assumed that people responded in straightforward ways to incentives. Often, they assumed that money could cure behavior problems.
Fortunately, today we are in the middle of a golden age of behavioral research. Thousands of researchers are studying the way actual behavior differs from the way we assume people behave. They are coming up with more accurate theories of who we are, and scores of real-world applications. Here's one simple example: 
When you renew your driver's license, you have a chance to enroll in an organ donation program. In countries like Germany and the U.S., you have to check a box if you want to opt in. Roughly 14 percent of people do. But behavioral scientists have discovered that how you set the defaults is really important. So in other countries, like Poland or France, you have to check a box if you want to opt out. In these countries, more than 90 percent of people participate.
This is a gigantic behavior difference cued by one tiny and costless change in procedure.
Yet in the middle of this golden age of behavioral research, there is a bill working through Congress that would eliminate the National Science Foundation's Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences. This is exactly how budgets should not be balanced -- by cutting cheap things that produce enormous future benefits.
Let's say you want to reduce poverty. We have two traditional understandings of poverty. The first presumes people are rational. They are pursuing their goals effectively and don't need much help in changing their behavior. The second presumes that the poor are afflicted by cultural or psychological dysfunctions that sometimes lead them to behave in shortsighted ways. Neither of these theories has produced much in the way of effective policies.
Eldar Shafir of Princeton and Sendhil Mullainathan of Harvard have recently, with federal help, been exploring a third theory, that scarcity produces its own cognitive traits.
A quick question: What is the starting taxi fare in your city? If you are like most upper-middle-class people, you don't know. If you are like many struggling people, you do know. Poorer people have to think hard about a million things that affluent people don't. They have to make complicated trade-offs when buying a carton of milk: If I buy milk, I can't afford orange juice. They have to decide which utility not to pay.
These questions impose enormous cognitive demands. The brain has limited capacities. If you increase demands on one sort of question, it performs less well on other sorts of questions.
Shafir and Mullainathan gave batteries of tests to Indian sugar farmers. After they sell their harvest, they live in relative prosperity. During this season, the farmers do well on the I.Q. and other tests. But before the harvest, they live amid scarcity and have to think hard about a thousand daily decisions. During these seasons, these same farmers do much worse on the tests. They appear to have lower I.Q.'s. They have more trouble controlling their attention. They are more shortsighted. Scarcity creates its own psychology.
Princeton students don't usually face extreme financial scarcity, but they do face time scarcity. In one game, they had to answer questions in a series of timed rounds, but they could borrow time from future rounds. When they were scrambling amid time scarcity, they were quick to borrow time, and they were nearly oblivious to the usurious interest rates the game organizers were charging. These brilliant Princeton kids were rushing to the equivalent of payday lenders, to their own long-term detriment.
Shafir and Mullainathan have a book coming out next year, exploring how scarcity -- whether of time, money or calories (while dieting) -- affects your psychology. They are also studying how poor people's self-perceptions shape behavior. Many people don't sign up for the welfare benefits because they are intimidated by the forms. Shafir and Mullainathan asked some people at a Trenton soup kitchen to relive a moment when they felt competent and others to recount a neutral experience. Nearly half of the self-affirming group picked up an available benefits package afterward. Only 16 percent of the neutral group did.
People are complicated. We each have multiple selves, which emerge or don't depending on context. If we're going to address problems, we need to understand the contexts and how these tendencies emerge or don't emerge. We need to design policies around that knowledge. Cutting off financing for this sort of research now is like cutting off navigation financing just as Christopher Columbus hit the shoreline of the New World.

HEADLINE: Jobless Youth Get Summer Lift at Bicycle Works

BYLINE: By KAREN ANN CULLOTTA. 
kcullotta@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
It was creeping toward a sultry 90 degrees on Tuesday afternoon on Chicago's South Side, where the mix of heat, humidity and joblessness can weigh on teenagers like 19-year-old Marcus Cammon. But Marcus was keeping busy, mending the battered bones of an old Schwinn 10-speed bicycle.
''I've revived the bike with a wheel adjustment and a new seat,'' said Marcus, one of 140 novice mechanics at Blackstone Bicycle Works, a youth program in the Woodlawn neighborhood that tries to help keep young men and women off the streets this summer. They learn skills like repairing a flat tire, working on a team and helping customers. 
Last summer, 26 percent of Americans ages 16 to 19 were employed, down from 45 percent who had summer jobs in 2000, said Joseph McLaughlin, senior research associate at the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. Mr. McLaughlin said he expected this summer's rate to be similar to last year's.
Programs like Blackstone's are aimed toward those who face the hardest time finding jobs -- black teenagers from low-income families. For example, 15 percent of black teenagers were employed in the summer of 2010, Mr. McLaughlin said, while 32 percent of white teenagers were. His research shows that teenagers from families with a household income of less than $20,000 are those most likely to be unemployed. ''It is counterintuitive to what you might think,'' he said. ''The teens who need the jobs the most have the lowest employment rates.''
Only 14,000 teenagers out of 50,000 applicants were able to be hired for this summer's Youth Ready Chicago program, according to the city's Department of Family and Support Services.
Marcus, the youngest of 10 children, said the Blackstone program offered a chance to learn new skills, perhaps to earn a bit of money and to savor a quiet environment away from the tumult of his home life on the West Side.
An accidental bicycle mechanic -- Marcus is studying ballet and dreams of becoming a dancer -- he catches an 8:30 train each morning, arriving at Blackstone at 10 a.m., just after breakfast is served outdoors on folding tables beneath a canopy.
Blackstone serves food because some children from low-income families lose regular meals once school is out.
''One of the things we discovered when we started the summer program was that many of the kids were arriving without eating breakfast, and they had no food for lunch, either,'' said Connie Spreen, co-founder and executive director of the Experimental Station, a nonprofit community center.
Blackstone's mission includes projects like Earn-a-Bike, which awards a refurbished bicycle plus a helmet and lock to children ages 9 to 16 who work 25 hours in the shop. Teenagers with more advanced mechanical skills become paid members of the staff.
''I was working at McDonald's by the time I was 15,'' said Ty Juan Edwards, Blackstone's youth mentor, ''but the kids can't even get hired there these days.''
Without some structure in their lives, Mr. Edwards said, idle youths ''start doing silly, dumb things, like standing outside in the streets with the gangs, and the gang members will always find something for them to do.''

HEADLINE: Behind the Gentler Approach to Banks by U.S.

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
As the financial storm brewed in the summer of 2008 and institutions feared for their survival, a bit of good news bubbled through large banks and the law firms that defend them.
Federal prosecutors officially adopted new guidelines about charging corporations with crimes -- a softer approach that, longtime white-collar lawyers and former federal prosecutors say, helps explain the dearth of criminal cases despite a raft of inquiries into the financial crisis.
Though little noticed outside legal circles, the guidelines were welcomed by firms representing banks. The Justice Department's directive, involving a process known as deferred prosecutions, signaled ''an important step away from the more aggressive prosecutorial practices seen in some cases under their predecessors,'' Sullivan & Cromwell, a prominent Wall Street law firm, told clients in a memo that September.
The guidelines left open a possibility other than guilty or not guilty, giving leniency often if companies investigated and reported their own wrongdoing. In return, the government could enter into agreements to delay or cancel the prosecution if the companies promised to change their behavior. 
But this approach, critics maintain, runs the risk of letting companies off too easily.
''If you do not punish crimes, there's really no reason they won't happen again,'' said Mary Ramirez, a professor at Washburn University School of Law and a former assistant United States attorney. ''I worry and so do a lot of economists that we have created no disincentives for committing fraud or white-collar crime, in particular in the financial space.''
While ''deferred prosecution agreements'' were used before the financial crisis, the Justice Department made them an official alternative in 2008, according to the Sullivan & Cromwell note.
It is among a number of signs, white-collar crime experts say, that the government seems to be taking a gentler approach.
The Securities and Exchange Commission also added deferred prosecution as a tool last year and has embraced another alternative to litigation -- reports that chronicle wrongdoing at institutions like Moody's Investors Service, often without punishing anyone. The financial crisis cases brought by the S.E.C. -- like a recent settlement with JPMorgan Chase for selling a mortgage security that soured -- have rarely named executives as defendants.
Defending the department's approach, Alisa Finelli, a spokeswoman, said deferred prosecution agreements require that corporations pay penalties and restitution, correct criminal conduct and ''achieve these results without causing the loss of jobs, the loss of pensions and other significant negative consequences to innocent parties who played no role in the criminal conduct, were unaware of it or were unable to prevent it.''
The department began pulling back from a more aggressive pursuit of white-collar crime around 2005, say defense lawyers and former prosecutors, after the Supreme Court overturned a conviction it won against the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. That ended an era of brass-knuckle prosecutions related to fraud at companies like Enron.
Another example of this more cautious prosecutorial strategy: Government lawyers now go to companies earlier in an inquiry, and often tell companies to figure out whether improper activities occurred. Then those companies hire law firms to investigate and report back to the government. The practice was criticized last year when the Justice Department struck a settlement with Beazer Homes USA, a home builder accused of mortgage fraud.
This ''outsourcing'' of investigations -- as some lawyers call it -- has led to increased coziness between the government and companies, some critics say.
In banking, the collaboration is even stronger, dating to the mid-1990s when banks were asked to regularly report suspicious activities to the Treasury Department, an effort that aimed at relieving regulators of some of their enforcement loads. But it gave regulators a false assurance that banks would spot and report all wrongdoing, former investigators say. Moreover, companies are not as likely to come forward with evidence related to senior executives or to widespread patterns of misbehavior, some academics say.
Intended to make the most of the government's limited investigative resources, the government's cooperation with corporations and industry groups can work well and save money when business hums along as usual. But some veterans of government prosecutions question such collaboration in financial crisis cases, and contend they should have been pursued more aggressively.
''Traditionally, a bank would tell the Department of Justice when an employee engaged in crimes, but what do you do when the bank itself is run by a criminal enterprise?'' said Solomon L. Wisenberg, former chief of the financial institutions fraud unit for the United States attorney in the Western District of Texas in the early 1990s. ''You have to be able to investigate without just waiting for the bank to give you the referral. The people running the institutions are not going to come to the D.O.J. and tell them about themselves.''
A Clash of Agencies
Beazer Homes, based in Charlotte, N.C., became one of the nation's 10 largest home builders in the 2000s -- in large part because of mortgage lending options that attracted buyers. But its mortgage business eventually attracted prosecutors, too.
In March 2007, the inspector general and officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development began investigating claims that Beazer had engaged in mortgage fraud, causing losses to the Federal Housing Administration's insurance fund that covered mortgages when buyers couldn't pay.
Investigators found that Beazer had been offering a lower mortgage rate if buyers paid an extra fee, but then not giving them the lower rate. And it was enticing homeowners by offering down payment assistance, but not disclosing that it then raised the price of the house by the same amount.
The Beazer board's audit committee hired the law firm of Alston & Bird to conduct an internal investigation. Documents supplied to Congress by HUD show that Justice Department officials advised HUD investigators not to interview borrowers or former Beazer employees until Alston & Bird completed its review.
In April 2009, justice officials notified HUD that a deferred prosecution agreement with Beazer had been reached -- the sort of deal that Sullivan & Cromwell had celebrated in its client memo a year earlier -- essentially shutting down the HUD investigation.
Beazer agreed to pay consumers and the government as much as $55 million under the deal. It also paid approximately that amount to Alston & Bird, investigators found. While a member of the justice team told HUD that criminal proceedings would be forthcoming against individuals at Beazer, the documents show, there has been only one indictment: of Michael T. Rand, the company's former chief accounting officer, whose trial is to begin this fall.
A year after the settlement, Kenneth M. Donohue, the inspector general of HUD at the time, raised questions about its handling. He said he was disturbed by the interference by the Justice Department and its calls to stop pursuing Beazer executives so the deferred prosecution deal could be completed. ''As a law enforcement official for over 40 years,'' Mr. Donohue wrote in a letter to Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, ''I have never witnessed a like action in any of my varied dealings.''
In a recent interview, Mr. Donohue, now a senior adviser at the Reznick Group, an accounting firm in Bethesda, Md., said of the Justice Department: ''The most important point of this whole thing is the fact that they threatened the HUD office of the inspector general that we would not be allowed to go forward with our investigation of executives if we didn't agree to their settlement.''
David A. Brown, acting United States attorney on the case, said: ''What we do is work cooperatively as a team in conducting these investigations. We don't tell agencies to stand down when they are working as part of the team.'' He said that the investigation was continuing, and that the Justice Department was proud of the deferred prosecution agreement and the restitution Beazer paid, which more than covered the losses of the Federal Housing Administration fund.
Beazer did not respond to an e-mail, and Alston & Bird did not return a call seeking comment.
Ms. Finelli, the department's spokeswoman, said that deferred or nonprosecution agreements had led to charges against individuals in many cases; of the 20 companies she cited, three were financial companies. But none were cases related to the financial crisis.
Still, some lawyers applaud the closer relationship between the government and business. ''Given the scanty resources that have been committed to corporate crime enforcement, I think the government's leveraging of its prosecution power from corporations and their lawyers has been critically important,'' said Daniel C. Richman, professor of law at Columbia and a former assistant United States attorney in New York.
But Professor Richman added that the government should have ''a much more developed, funded and empowered S.E.C., Federal Reserve, E.P.A. and other agencies to do regulation, to do enforcement and feed cases where necessary to criminal prosecutors.''
Changing Course
The names have become synonymous with corporate wrongdoing -- and forceful prosecution: Not just Enron, but also WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, Rite Aid and ImClone. In the early part of the last decade, senior executives at all these companies were convicted and imprisoned.
But by 2005, a debate was growing over aggressive prosecutions, as some business leaders had been criticizing the approach as perhaps too zealous.
That May, Justice Department officials met ahead of a session with a cross-agency group called the Corporate Fraud Task Force. It was weeks after Justice Department lawyers had presented to the Supreme Court their case against Arthur Andersen, which was seeking -- successfully, it would turn out -- to overturn its criminal fraud conviction in a prominent case.
In the meeting, the deputy attorney general at the time, James B. Comey, posed questions that surprised some attendees, according to two people there who asked to remain anonymous because they were not supposed to discuss private meetings.
Was American business being hurt by the Justice Department's investigations?, Mr. Comey asked, according to these two people, who said they thought the message had come from others. He cautioned colleagues to be responsible. ''It was a total retrenchment,'' one of the people said. ''It was like we were going backwards.''
Mr. Comey said recently that he did not recall this conversation.
Around the same time, the Justice Department was developing instructions on dealing with companies under investigation -- particularly companies that work with the government. It issued a memo in 2003 that gave companies more credit for cooperating than in the past. That message was reinforced in another memo in 2006.
As the first memo put it, ''it is entirely proper in many investigations for a prosecutor to consider the corporation's pre-indictment conduct, e.g., voluntary disclosure, cooperation, remediation or restitution, in determining whether to seek an indictment.''
During this period, the Justice Department increased the use of deferred prosecutions or even nonprosecution agreements.
Many well-known companies have benefited. In 2004, the American International Group, the giant insurer, paid $126 million when it entered a deferred prosecution agreement to settle investigations into claims that it had helped clients improperly burnish financial statements.
Deals over accounting improprieties also were struck that year by Computer Associates International, a technology company, and in 2005 by Bristol- Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical concern. Prudential Financial entered into a deferred prosecution in 2006 over improper mutual fund trading.
No such prosecution deals for large banks have yet arisen out of the financial crisis. Some bank analysts say they may be coming. The government may eventually strike one with Goldman Sachs, which it continues to investigate for its mortgage securities dealings, Brad Hintz, a securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote recently. ''If an alleged violation is identified during a Goldman investigation, we expect a reasoned response from the Justice Department,'' he added.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
The S.E.C. can also file deferred prosecutions, and it sometimes issues reports about wrongdoing in lieu of litigation. It has been increasing the number of reports it files, and is considering issuing one about misleading accounting at Lehman Brothers, Bloomberg News has reported. The S.E.C. did something similar last year to resolve a credit ratings investigation of Moody's Investors Service. The reports from the commission are intended to give companies guidance on appropriate practices.
Such results provide bragging rights among corporate defense lawyers, according to longtime observers of the legal system.
''The corporate crime defense bar has this down to a science,'' said Russell Mokhiber, the editor of Corporate Crime Reporter, a publication that tracks prosecutions. ''I interview them all the time, and they boast about how they've gamed the system.''
Industry Advantage
Even as companies cooperate with the government, they also work closely with one another, creating industrywide strategies in response to investigations. Legal representatives for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and others talk regularly about what they hear from the government, according to lawyers in the industry. They have long held these conversations -- known as joint-defense calls -- but given the increased cooperation of the government with companies, lawyers can exchange more information.
Goldman's recent battle against the S.E.C. -- in which it agreed to pay $550 million to settle claims that it had misled investors in a mortgage security it sold -- was helpful to other banks, according to one lawyer who participates in these calls. On several occasions in 2009 and 2010, after Goldman and its law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, visited the S.E.C., lawyers representing other banks received intelligence on the government's areas of interest. The result has often been that banks walk into prosecutors' offices well-prepared to rebut allegations.
One assistant United States attorney, who requested anonymity because he is not allowed to speak with the news media, said many inquiries had been tabled because banks had such good answers.
''They'll hire a counsel who is experienced,'' said the assistant attorney, who has direct knowledge of cases related to the financial crisis. ''They often come in and make a presentation: 'We've looked at this and this is how we see it.' They're often persuasive.''
Some defense lawyers say it is easier to make a persuasive case because prosecutors, having becoming more dependent on companies for investigative legwork, are less knowledgeable and thus less likely to counter with evidence they have uncovered.
The process, in the end, is cloaked, some critics say. The Justice Department does not disclose any details about its decision-making in specific cases, such as why it did not charge individuals at a company.
''We will not get an explanation of why there haven't been prosecutions; at best, we will get a reference back to the Department of Justice manual that leaves the discretion to the prosecutors,'' said Professor Ramirez of Washburn University. ''The legal representatives will argue that since recoveries can be had by using civil measures, even private litigations, there's no need to bring criminal measures. I disagree with that very much.''

HEADLINE: What Obama Wants

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
On Thursday, President Obama met with Republicans to discuss a debt deal. We don't know exactly what was proposed, but news reports before the meeting suggested that Mr. Obama is offering huge spending cuts, possibly including cuts to Social Security and an end to Medicare's status as a program available in full to all Americans, regardless of income.
Obviously, the details matter a lot, but progressives, and Democrats in general, are understandably very worried. Should they be? In a word, yes. 
Now, this might just be theater: Mr. Obama may be pulling an anti-Corleone, making Republicans an offer they can't accept. The reports say that the Obama plan also involves significant new revenues, a notion that remains anathema to the Republican base. So the goal may be to paint the G.O.P. into a corner, making Republicans look like intransigent extremists -- which they are.
But let's be frank. It's getting harder and harder to trust Mr. Obama's motives in the budget fight, given the way his economic rhetoric has veered to the right. In fact, if all you did was listen to his speeches, you might conclude that he basically shares the G.O.P.'s diagnosis of what ails our economy and what should be done to fix it. And maybe that's not a false impression; maybe it's the simple truth.
One striking example of this rightward shift came in last weekend's presidential address, in which Mr. Obama had this to say about the economics of the budget: ''Government has to start living within its means, just like families do. We have to cut the spending we can't afford so we can put the economy on sounder footing, and give our businesses the confidence they need to grow and create jobs.''
That's three of the right's favorite economic fallacies in just two sentences. No, the government shouldn't budget the way families do; on the contrary, trying to balance the budget in times of economic distress is a recipe for deepening the slump. Spending cuts right now wouldn't ''put the economy on sounder footing.'' They would reduce growth and raise unemployment. And last but not least, businesses aren't holding back because they lack confidence in government policies; they're holding back because they don't have enough customers -- a problem that would be made worse, not better, by short-term spending cuts.
In his brief remarks after Thursday's meeting, by the way, Mr. Obama seemed to reiterate the Herbert Hooveresque view that deficit reduction is what we need to ''grow the economy.''
People have asked me why the president's economic advisers aren't telling him not to believe in the confidence fairy -- that is, not to believe the assertion, popular on the right but overwhelmingly refuted by the evidence, that slashing spending in the face of a depressed economy will magically create jobs. My answer is, what economic advisers? Almost all the high-profile economists who joined the Obama administration early on have either left or are leaving.
Nor have they been replaced. As The Wall Street Journal recently noted, there are a ''stunning'' number of vacancies in important economic posts. So who's defining the administration's economic views?
Some of what we're hearing is presumably coming from the political team, whose members seem to believe that a move toward Republican positions, reminiscent of former President Bill Clinton's ''triangulation'' in the 1990s, is the key to Mr. Obama's re-election. And Mr. Clinton did, indeed, rebound from a big defeat in the 1994 midterms to win big two years later. But some of us think that the rebound had less to do with his rhetorical move to the center than with the five million jobs the economy added over those two years -- an achievement not likely to be repeated this time, especially not in the face of harsh spending cuts.
Anyway, I don't believe that it's all political calculation. Watching Mr. Obama and listening to his recent statements, it's hard not to get the impression that he is now turning for advice to people who really believe that the deficit, not unemployment, is the top issue facing America right now, and who also believe that the great bulk of deficit reduction should come from spending cuts. It's worth noting that even Republicans weren't suggesting cuts to Social Security; this is something Mr. Obama and those he listens to apparently want for its own sake.
Which raises the big question: If a debt deal does emerge, and it overwhelmingly reflects conservative priorities and ideology, should Democrats in Congress vote for it?
Mr. Obama's people will no doubt argue that their fellow party members should trust him, that whatever deal emerges was the best he could get. But it's hard to see why a president who has gone out of his way to echo Republican rhetoric and endorse false conservative views deserves that kind of trust.

HEADLINE: Nuggets of Reform, But Lacking Applause

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
In the bowels of Soldier Field, the canny rock star Bono was telling me about yanking his children from an elite Manhattan private school and returning them to a better, public school in Dublin. He said his and his wife's high-minded New York education hopes had been misplaced.
The black leather-clad front man for U2 was soon tugged by an aide -- ''I have to do a show,'' he said apologetically. Within minutes, he was bringing joy to 63,000 with the Irish band's trademark muscularity, towering props and calls for political reforms in locales as faraway as Burma. 
I saw one black-T-shirt-clad speck of a spectator among the Tuesday night throng -- Mayor Rahm Emanuel a k a The Missile -- and sadly realized that he had a tougher task trying to inspire those same concertgoers in a wee bit of reform back here.
The Missile probably made some sort of history that morning in front of maybe 15 people in a sterile conference room. He was a politician surfacing voluntarily at the Board of Ethics.
He surely didn't inspire the press corps in announcing a high-minded plan to limit lobbyists' misdeeds and make their city dealings transparent. Reporters quickly changed the subject to police officers needlessly assigned to schools, the future of city-sponsored July 3 fireworks, the declining economics of Taste of Chicago, and where the mayor's three children would attend school in the fall.
The corrupt nexus of politics and money is passe to professional skeptics, a bit like U2's show was to music critics, who found it lacking innovation. For the City Hall savants, there were also the better odds of ginning up an editor's interest with the calamitous prospect of Life Without Taste.
Just like three-too-many Miller Lites on a sultry day at the lakefront, civic nonchalance about ethics should inspire dyspepsia. But lack of interest is a force more powerful than the new ordinances and rules promulgated by The Missile.
The new mayor can seek needed disclosures about lobbyists but still confront a collective ennui. Its best manifestation comes on Election Day, when about half of us don't vote even as our tax dollars seek to bring democracy to Iraq and Afghanistan.
And this inertia will be repeated despite another Illinois governor's standing convicted as a criminal. It may already be Stone Age news by current standards -- more than 10 days old, my goodness! -- but you do remember the guy, the ''Celebrity Apprentice'' contestant, don't you?
We're just dubious about a politician discussing ethics, transparency or other ''trust me'' issues, as they're called by Jeff Seglin, a lecturer on public policy and head of the communications program at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
Our doubts persist even as Illinois makes true headway on both campaign finance and ethics rules, in part inspired by the legacy of that just-convicted former governor whose name I'm repressing after months of obsession. There have been real advances on contribution limits, including by businesses doing state work. Yes, in Illinois.
Floodgates were opened nationally by the United States Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case, which ended limits on so-called independent political expenditures. By definition, they are not political contributions though they may seek to influence an election. One interpretation of the decision says governments can force disclosure of the identity of contributors to state and local races and, to that end, Illinois has made bonafide progress, in the view of Steve Berlin, executive director of the Board of Ethics.
A related question came from Cindi Canary, founder of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform: ''The law has changed, but has the culture?''
That's relevant since we'll need proof that money isn't unavoidably corrosive and won't forever bring access and influence, while shutting out the little guy. But just like there doesn't seem much to be gained in bashing a band for playing its own hits, especially if 63,000 people come away smiling, there's not a ton to be gained from visceral cynicism.
The proof, for the reform-minded politician, must be whether he can actually change behavior. Thus, one can embrace The Missile's early efforts even without being so presumptuous as to laud him for cleansing the system.
Maybe we can all seek the triumph of hope over experience. Yes, bars or limits on lobbyist gifts, loans or campaign contributions won't change the world. But while we fret over the loss of July 3 fireworks, we could also genuinely wish for more honest government.

HEADLINE: Democrats Oppose Talk Of Social Security Cuts

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional Democrats, who have thrived for decades as guardians of Social Security, said Thursday that they were not ready to surrender that role to help President Obama get a deal on federal spending and the debt limit.
As word spread that Mr. Obama was considering large savings from the use of a different measure of inflation to reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits, Democrats joined with lobbyists for older Americans to reject the idea. Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said Democrats would oppose changes in Social Security benefits as part of the deficit-reduction talks. 
''Any discussion of Social Security should be on a separate track,'' he said. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said, ''Any savings should be plowed back into making Social Security stronger.''
Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said, ''The proposal would place new burdens on the backs of seniors.''
Representative Xavier Becerra of California, a member of the House Democratic leadership, said, ''The cuts in Social Security benefits would grow larger as retirees age, and seniors who rely most on Social Security to pay for basic necessities would receive the biggest benefit cuts.''
On the Senate floor, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Thursday: ''Social Security and Medicare benefits should not be on the table. Social Security is not the cause of the deficit, and beneficiaries should not be made to shoulder the burden of deficit reduction.''
In particular, Mr. Whitehouse said, Congress must not ''cut benefits through backdoor methods such as lowering the cost-of-living adjustment.''
Republicans are concerned about the growth of entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicare. Some, like Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, support the idea of an alternative measure of inflation, known as the chain-weighted version of the Consumer Price Index, because they believe it is more accurate. But the party, waiting to see details, has not taken an official stand.
Lobbyists for older Americans were blistering in their criticism of the proposal, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, could reduce federal spending by more than $110 billion over 10 years.
''This is nothing more than a backdoor benefit cut that Washington hopes Americans won't notice or understand,'' said Max Richtman, executive vice president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
He said Social Security beneficiaries did not receive a cost-of-living adjustment this year or in 2010 because inflation, as measured by the standard Consumer Price Index, was so low.
AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said last month that it might be open to modest reductions in Social Security benefits for future recipients. But A. Barry Rand, the group's chief executive, tried to quash the inflation adjustment idea, saying that ''AARP will not accept any cuts of any kind to Social Security as part of a deal'' to reduce the deficit and increase the debt limit.
The proposal under discussion would affect current and future beneficiaries. Any move to exempt current beneficiaries would reduce the amount of savings.
Supporters of the proposal argue that the current measure of inflation overstates increases in the cost of living because it does not adequately reflect how, when faced with higher prices, consumers change their buying habits, substituting cheaper items for more expensive ones.
On the other hand, some economists say the current measure understates the impact of inflation on older Americans, who tend to spend more of their income on health care. Medical prices have been rising faster than the overall price index.
Budget negotiators are also discussing a proposal that would use the alternative measure of inflation to adjust income tax brackets and other provisions of the tax code, like the standard deduction and the personal exemption amount.
This proposal would raise nearly $60 billion over 10 years, as more Americans would find themselves in higher tax brackets.
Republicans, adamantly opposed to any form of tax increase, worry about an increase that might result from using the new measure of inflation to adjust tax brackets.
Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, said he would consider changes in the Social Security benefit formula only as part of a giant deficit-reduction package that included substantial new revenues and cuts in military spending. If the alternative measure of inflation is more accurate, he said, it would be ''logical, consistent and desirable'' to use it in adjusting tax brackets and Social Security benefits.
Grover G. Norquist, a prominent conservative strategist who is president of Americans for Tax Reform, said he saw a big difference. Reducing Social Security benefits would be a cut in spending, and ''that would be fine,'' Mr. Norquist said. But he said using the new price index to set tax brackets would be a tax increase, in violation of the pledge made by Republican leaders.
Stephen C. Goss, the chief actuary of Social Security, said the alternative inflation measure could reduce annual cost-of-living adjustments so the benefit for a retiree turning 85 in 2035 would be about 7 percent lower. The cuts are cumulative and would have a larger effect on older beneficiaries, who depend more on Social Security as a source of income.
Congressional Democrats said that using a different version of the Consumer Price Index could also reduce Medicare payment rates for some health care providers, including ambulatory surgical centers, clinical laboratories and suppliers of durable medical equipment like wheelchairs and respirators.
In addition, they said, the proposal could eventually increase the number of Medicare beneficiaries who must pay higher premiums because they have incomes above a certain level -- $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for married couples this year.

HEADLINE: For Some Jobless, a Break on Mortgages

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Help is on the way from the federal government for some homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments because of prolonged joblessness.
The Obama administration on Thursday announced a beefed-up program that will allow eligible homeowners to skip part or all of their monthly payments for 12 months or more while they search for a new job. Certain homeowners have been eligible to skip payments for three or four months, far shorter than most unemployed people need to get back on their feet.
While officials could not say how many homeowners might qualify for the extended grace period, they predicted that tens of thousands would benefit. 
The Obama administration has come under increasing criticism for its efforts to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure, especially as housing prices have continued their downward slide. On Wednesday, President Obama himself acknowledged the administration had come up short.
''We're going back to the drawing board, talking to banks, try to put some pressure on them to work with people who have mortgages to see if we can make further adjustments, modify loans more quickly, and also see if there may be circumstances where reducing principal is appropriate,'' he said.
Mortgage servicers whose loans are backed by Federal Housing Administration insurance will be required to offer payment deferments to eligible homeowners. Roughly 14 percent of active mortgages are backed by the federal insurance.
Servicers who participate in the Treasury Department's mortgage modification program will be asked to postpone payments for unemployed homeowners, though to date, their record at voluntarily modifying loans has been spotty. The changes will not apply to loans owned or guaranteed by the big mortgage companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which account for roughly half of all mortgages. Still, administration officials said they hoped the entire lending industry would follow the federal government's lead.
''Providing the option for a year of forbearance will give struggling homeowners a substantially greater chance of finding employment before they lose their home,'' said Shaun Donovan, the secretary of housing and urban development.
The announcement won praise from housing advocates, who have pushed for the administration to strengthen its programs for the unemployed.
''This action is another step toward breaking the link between losing your job and losing your home,'' said the Rev. Lucy Kolin, of the PICO National Network, a coalition of faith-based organizations.
''It's only fair that the big banks who caused so much job loss in America extend relief to families who've lost their jobs as a result of the financial crisis.''
One major problem in housing is that the administration's signature foreclosure-prevention program, the Home Affordable Modification Program, was meant to help homeowners with adjustable rate loans in which payments spiked upward.
But in recent years, the main cause of foreclosure has been unemployment, not risky loans, and the program has fallen far short of its original goals.
In his remarks Wednesday, President Obama said the housing market had not bottomed out as quickly as his administration expected and that its programs to help homeowners were not helping enough.
Under the revised program, mortgage servicers whose loans are backed by the housing administration will be required to postpone payments for eligible unemployed homeowners for at least 12 months.
In addition, mortgage servicers who participate in the Home Affordable Modification Program would be encouraged to provide similar assistance to unemployed homeowners.
Since the program is voluntary, however, eligibility could be hindered by investor and regulatory restrictions.
The maximum term would be 12 months of deferred principal and interest. That means that if a homeowner makes half a payment each month, they could get 24 months of forbearance, Mr. Donovan said.
Homeowners who are already enrolled in federal programs to defer mortgage payments can apply to get the length of their deferments extended, he said.
The repayment schedule will depend on the homeowners' employment status when the forbearance period ends. If the homeowners have decent-paying jobs, for instance, they will work out a repayment schedule with their mortgage servicer.
The Obama administration has made various attempts to turn around the moribund housing market since it came into office in 2009.
The administration originally predicted that the Housing Affordable Modification Program would help three million to four million homeowners, but to date, there have been roughly 730,000 permanent loan modifications.
And while Congress set aside $46 billion as part of the huge bank bailout to help struggling programs, the administration has spent slightly less than $2 billion of the money.
Recognizing that unemployment was a growing problem in foreclosures, the Treasury Department announced a program last August that would allow unemployed homeowners to defer payments for three months. About 10,000 homeowners have participated.
In addition, HUD received $1 billion last year to provide unemployed homeowners with loans to cover their mortgages for up to 24 months.
While the program was slow to get off the ground, department officials said it was now accepting applications in all 32 states that are participating.
''We've had to revamp our housing program several times to try to help people stay in their homes and try to start lifting home values up,'' the president said on Wednesday.
''But of all the things we've done,'' he said, ''that's probably been the area that's been most stubborn to us trying to solve the problem.''

HEADLINE: Industry Set for Fight to Keep Corporate Jet Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama used to like corporate jets. As a senator in 2005, he crisscrossed the country in them nine times to attend fund-raisers and other events, reimbursing the corporate jet owners at first-class rates.
But Mr. Obama said he soon grew uncomfortable with the high-flying perk in his Senate days and started flying commercial. Now, as the president squares off with Republicans over the debt ceiling, he and fellow Democrats are looking to turn tax breaks for corporate jet owners -- and yacht owners, too -- into a potent political symbol of a tax system that Democrats say tilts toward the very rich. 
Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders have made a rollback of tax breaks for corporate jets a frequent talking point in recent days in their efforts to persuade Republicans to agree to raise taxes as well as make spending cuts as part of the budget talks. But the drumbeat from Democrats has set off a counterattack from a small but powerful group of jet manufacturers and users, who have contributed millions of dollars over the years to lawmakers from both parties.
The debate is less about dollars and cents than it is about political imagery and a bit of class warfare. Ending special deductions for the depreciation of corporate jets would raise an estimated $3 billion in tax revenues -- or, as the jet manufacturers point out, a fraction of one percent of the deficit the country is facing.
''The president is vilifying an entire industry,'' said Dan Hubbard, a senior vice president for the National Business Aviation Association, which represents 8,000 companies that use private planes. ''This is an attempt to score some cheap political points on the back of an industry that employs 1.2 million people.''
Jet industry officials, in buttonholing sympathetic lawmakers and organizing an e-mail campaign in the past week to maintain the tax break, are making the case that raising taxes on jet ownership would inevitably cut jet production, endanger jobs and affect ordinary Americans.
Mr. Hubbard said it would be the Montana real estate broker, who relies on a plane to travel the state's vast expanses, or the employee in Schenectady, N.Y., who makes jet upholstery, who would ultimately be harmed, not the jet-setting corporate executive that Democrats have focused on.
He said the industry was surprised by Mr. Obama's focus on private jets -- the president mentioned the issue six times in a news conference last week -- because it was Mr. Obama who had helped create an expanded deduction last year for the industry as a way of creating jobs.
In fighting to hold on to the tax break, the industry has some major backers, with executives from Wal-Mart, J.P. Morgan and many other Fortune 500 companies all flying private jets.
Warren E. Buffett, the Omaha investor who leads Berkshire Hathaway, bought a plane-sharing business, now known as NetJets, after using its planes for a number of years. Asked in a CNBC interview on Thursday about tax breaks for corporate jets, Mr. Buffett declined to take a direct position but said that ''I don't really see where a business aircraft is different'' from other types of capital investments in how they should be taxed.
Political action committees and employees for jet manufacturers and related aviation sectors accounted for more than $6.6 million in political contributions to federal lawmakers in the last decade, according to an analysis by MapLight, a nonprofit group that analyzes campaign finance data.
But while Republicans accuse the White House of distorting the fiscal basis of the tax break for jets, they acknowledge that the issue carries a big political wallop in tough economic times.
''President Obama and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are obviously using poll-tested rhetoric about only raising taxes on millionaires and billionaires and corporate jets,'' said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. ''That sounds good. They want ordinary Americans to believe they will not be affected by the president's tax-increase proposals.''
Indeed, the embarrassing image of executives from the Big Three automakers flying to Washington in private jets in 2008 to ask for private bailout money looms large in the current debate. Democrats figure that trillion-dollar deficits are a tough concept for Americans to get their arms around. Tax breaks for corporate jet fliers and yacht owners, they say, are much easier.
''Yes, believe it or not, Uncle Sam subsidizes the purchase of sprawling, luxurious, 72-foot Viking yachts,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said on the Senate floor in arguing to close what he sees as tax loopholes for jet and yacht owners. ''As long as your yacht has a place to sleep and a place to -- how shall I put it -- relieve yourself, you can classify it as your 'second home' and claim the mortgage interest deduction.''
The Democrats' scrutiny of tax breaks for jets, yachts and other luxury items is a calculated strategy meant to force the Republicans to give ground in their demands for big spending cuts in areas like Medicare, said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
''This was a very clear symbol of the fact that Republicans are willing to protect big-money interests and loopholes at any cost,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. ''If Republicans are willing to dig in to protect tax breaks for corporate jets, they're clearly not serious about deficit reduction.''

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Super Stars: Quilts From the American Folk Art Museum' (through Sept. 25) In conjunction with the exhibition of quilts at the main museum, its branch is featuring 20 quilts in which stars figure in some way, whether as pieced-together geometric forms or as little tufts of thread that suggest a distant galaxy. American Folk Art Museum Lincoln Square Branch, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) 
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Lorna Simpson: Gathered' (through Aug. 21) Much of Lorna Simpson's photo-based work in the past has been about African American identity approached from an oblique and elusive perspective. She returns to theme in new ways in the two installations and video that make up this small show which includes some 300 framed photographs hung in grid formation on a long gallery wall. Roughly half the pictures are vintage 1950s pinup images of young black women (and a few men) alluringly posed in domestic settings. The rest are of Ms. Simpson herself, posed and dressed like the figures in the photographs, as if to forge overlooked connections between the present and the past. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'El Museo's Bienal: The (S) Files 2011' (through Jan. 8) Because of a long renovation of El Museo del Barrio's Fifth Avenue building, four years have passed since the museum's last biannual survey of new Latino, Caribbean and Latin American art. As if to make up for lost time, the new edition is the biggest so far, including work by 75 artists spread over seven shows in four boroughs, with the main event at El Museo itself. The ''S'' this year is for ''Street,'' which covers everything from graffiti to junk sculpture to painted cityscapes, and some of the work has problems with focus. Yet taking the street as a subject opens the possibility to at least think about other subjects, like money for artists, and the lack of it. Other segments of the show now on display are at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, and Lehman College Art Gallery in the Bronx; a Brooklyn show is scheduled to start in November. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)
Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2010: Hans-Peter Feldmann' (through Nov. 2) Mr. Feldmann, the septuagenarian German artist who was the surprise pick for the Boss Prize honors, has decided to exhibit his prize money in the form of 100,000 $1 bills, pinned to the wall of one of the Guggenheim's Tower galleries. What sounds on paper like a conceptual stunt or a riff on Warholian materialism becomes overpoweringly physical in person, thanks to the smell of the used bills and the traces of their circulation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Lee Ufan: Marking Infinity' (through Sept. 28) This five-decade retrospective fills the museum with about 90 works in a Zen-Minimalist, be-here-now vein by a Korean artist who lives in Paris and Japan. Sculptures consist of ordinary, pumpkin-size boulders juxtaposed with sheets and slabs of dark, glossy steel. Paintings made of wide brush strokes executed in gridded order on raw canvas exemplify tension between action and restraint. In its always near-perfect composure, Mr. Lee's art teeters perilously between art and decor. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Ken Johnson)
- International Center of Photography: 'Elliott Erwitt: Personal Best' (through Aug. 28) Like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Mr. Erwitt seeks ''the decisive moment,'' an instant in real time when people, animals or objects appear before the camera in surprising, funny and illuminating ways. The Henny Youngman of photographic one-liners, he delivers visual humor with such economy and grace that it is easy to overlook just how excellent an artist he is. This show presents more than 100 of his favorite images from the past seven decades. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'Hiroshima: Ground Zero 1945' (through Aug. 28) The contact prints and photographs in this show were made in connection with the 1947 United States Strategic Bombing Survey of Hiroshima, and depict the cataclysmic devastation in unflinching detail. The survey texts that accompany the images may appear shockingly clinical. The caption on a picture of a library, or what remains of it, reads: ''Interior first story showing contents damage and spalling of cement plaster by fire. Note all books reduced to ashes.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Rosenberg)
Jewish Museum: 'Collecting Matisse and Modern Masters: The Cone Sisters of Baltimore' (through Sept. 25) This exhibition samples the extraordinary trove of European art amassed by two American spinsters in the first half of the 20th century, work now owned by the Baltimore Museum of Art. Although some major collection highlights are absent, the pieces here -- presented in the order of acquisition -- generate a compelling portrait of the Cones as collectors. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Jewish Museum: 'Maira Kalman: Various Illuminations (of a Crazy World)' (through July 31) Like her fellow New Yorker magazine contributors Ed Koren and Roz Chast, Ms. Kalman offers gently humorous cartoon commentary on the trials and tribulations of modern metropolitan life. Ranging in style from faux-naive eccentricity to suave realism, the more than two decades worth of drawings and paintings on paper in this career survey make for an entertaining if not deeply provocative experience. With a flea market-like installation of nondescript objects from her personal collection, however, she tries too hard to be amazingly original. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Andean Tunic, 400 B.C.E.-1800 C.E.' (through Sept. 18) This small show celebrates the festive yet functional garments woven south of the equator. To the modern eye, they're wearable paintings; lovers of Keith Haring and Elizabeth Murray will find much to admire. So will anyone interested in the complex relationships among art, clothing, ritual and power. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Anthony Caro on the Roof' (through Oct. 30) No one in the 1960s produced groovier abstract sculpture than the British artist Anthony Caro, five of whose heavy metal assemblages grace the Met's Rooftop Garden. But only one of these works has that startling, newborn feeling. Sporting a new coat of shiny, taxicab-yellow paint, ''Midday'' (1960) has the look of a jaunty, industrial dinosaur. The others, dating from 1968 to 2010, show a development toward an increasingly conservative, ponderous monumentality. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty' (through Aug. 7) A triumph for this British fashion designer -- who died at 40, by his own hand, last year -- and for the curator Andrew Bolton of the Met's Costume Institute, this career retrospective is ethereal and gross, graceful and manipulative, and poised on a line where fashion turns into something else. The operatic spectacle is pushed along by soundtrack of wind, Handel and orgiastic moans, and has a holographic image of Kate Moss spinning like a moth in a flame at the center. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Night Vision: Photography After Dark' (through Sept. 18) It wasn't until the gelatin dry-plate process was introduced in the late 1880s that exposure time was lowered enough for photographs to be taken regularly after dark. Alfred Stieglitz was among the first to photograph New York at night. His work is shown alongside Berenice Abbott's spectral ''Nightview, New York'' from 1932, taken from the window of a skyscraper; Brassai's nocturnal views of Paris; and Weegee's high-contrast picture of a crime scene. Diane Arbus, Bill Brandt, Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand and Kohei Yoshiyuki are among the other artists included in this modest, lovely show of 40 black-and-white photographs drawn from the museum's collection, which stops a couple of decades short of the present. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Poetry in Clay: Korean Buncheong Ceramics from Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art' (through Aug. 14) This beautiful exhibition presents bottles, vases, bowls and dishes made by 15th- and 16th-century Korean artisans. In shades of gray, from creamy and opalescent off-whites to deep, warm blacks, the anonymous craftsmen covered vessels with loosely rendered images of flora and fauna and fine-grained patterns of dots and tiny blossoms. These infectiously lively works look as if they'd been made not centuries but only decades ago. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective' (through Aug. 28) Few artists have pushed drawing to such sculptural and even architectural extremes as Mr. Serra, so it makes sense that his adamantine pursuit of the medium, surveyed in an installation that he largely designed himself, is not quite like anything seen at the Met before. There are moments of off-putting starkness on Mr. Serra's side and some of the usual architectural infelicities on the Met's, but as a demonstration of this august institution's willingness to engage with genuinely radical, physically unsettling art of recent vintage, the show is cause for hope. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
MoMA PS 1: 'Laurel Nakadate: Only the Lonely' (through Aug. 8) Laurel Nakadate might be on the cusp of a great new career. She is known for disconcerting, sad and sexually provocative videos that she enlisted older, worse-for-wear men to participate in, but in the past three years she has made two feature-length films. Included in this enthralling survey of her 10-year career, they focus with lingering, heart-aching care on adolescent girls, lost souls looking for love and only getting into trouble. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
- MoMA PS1: Ryan Trecartin: 'Any Ever' (through Sept. 3) This game-changing show of seven related videos, viewed amid eccentric seating arrangements procured mostly from Ikea, reflects the combined imagination of a supertalented young artist and his band of merry, cross-dressing pranksters. The results teeter giddily at the intersection of art, reality television and social networking; forge a new integration of video and installation art, not to mention a blend of actual life and animation undreamt of by Walt Disney; and evince an aspirational faith in the potential of uninhibited self-expression, both individual and collective, to counter the mounting materialism of everyday life. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'The Age of Elegance: The Joan Taub Ades Collection' (through Aug. 28) This small but engrossing exhibition presents about three dozen works dating from the mid-17th to the late 19th centuries by European artists, each in his own way a draftsman of consummate skill. Some names, like Boucher and Millais, are familiar; most will be known only to art historical specialists. Ranging from postcard to laptop size, including portraiture, still-life and mythological scenes, they exemplify the fine but now endangered art of drawing at its best. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Fashion: Dress in the Art of Medieval France and the Netherlands' (through Sept. 4) Medieval illuminations -- so rich in narrative, embellishment and religious expression -- can display sartorial trends that can help experts date manuscripts and discern the subtleties of a figure's status or character. There are many examples here, as well as mannequins in full-scale model attire -- say, a splendid hunting ensemble of gold-embroidered blue velvet and lilac wool felt for the men, and for the women, a princessy gown of yellow silk trimmed in black crushed velvet, accessorized by a turret. This lively show will teach you to scrutinize centuries-old manuscripts as you would a style magazine. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Otherworldly: Optical Delusions and Small Realities' (through Sept. 18) In the age of the flat screen, a show about the diorama sounds charmingly naive. Yet ''Otherworldly'' circles back to the two-dimensional image in ways that feel very sophisticated. A good number of the show's more than 40 artists build model homes, cities and landscapes mainly to photograph them. At times the exhibition feels like a Hollywood film-studio tour in miniature. 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Access to Tools: Publications From the Whole Earth Catalog, 1968-1974' (through July 26) Brainchild of the visionary techno-hippie artist Steward Brand, the Whole Earth Catalog did for counterculture youth in the '60s what the Sears catalog did for children of the Great Depression and what Google does for people of the Internet age: provide a way for ordinary citizens to connect with and make use of the global economy. This modest but stirring time capsule of an exhibition presents various editions of the catalog, along with a mind-expanding array of books, magazines and ephemera that influenced or exemplified its holistic mission. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Francis Alys: A Story of Deception' (through Aug. 1) This possibly premature, hit-and-miss survey of the quixotic, politically aware yet obstinately poetic art of this Belgian artist, who has lived in Mexico since 1986, whipsaws a visitor between engagement and boredom, serious consideration and dismissal. In the show, at MoMA and its PS 1 site in Queens (closes Sept. 12), the best works are videos, but the split exhibition is garnished, you might say, with sometimes appealing paintings and sculptures and also dulled with extensive backup materials: studies, notes, texts and newspaper clippings pertaining to most of the works on view. Too often the result confirms this museum's blind faith in the wan, cerebral machinations of late-late-late Conceptualism. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'I Am Still Alive: Politics and Everyday Life in Contemporary Drawing' (through Sept. 19) This show of contemporary drawings (most acquired since 2005) is anchored by a group of telegrams sent by the Japanese artist On Kawara to friends and associates; each one bears the message ''I am still alive.'' The artists seem to be in a permanent state of wariness and suspicion, which is sometimes the result of political instability and at other times more innate. But their efforts to process matters of life and death in short bursts of creative activity feel very of the moment. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Boris Mikhailov: Case History' (through Sept. 5) This exhibition's visceral photographs of homeless people in Ukraine are not for the squeamish. The 19 photos, large-format examples from a series of more than 400 images produced in the late 1990s, portray people in grungy rooms or in wintery outdoor sites naked or pulling aside their clothes to expose parts of their bodies. Thus Mr. Mikhailov protests a society that allows people to fall into such substandard states and conditions. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Neue Galerie: 'Vienna 1900: Style and Identity' (through Aug. 8) One of history's more fraught fin-de-siecle efflorescences of art and thought is recounted in a shifting kaleidoscope of paintings, drawings, architectural models, posters and several species of decorative arts. Among paintings by Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, there is also a re-creation of Freud's psychoanalytic couch, an eye-popping tribute to the Vienna Secession and a crowded face-off between the designer-theoreticians Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Loos. Over all, it resembles a tasting menu with enough rich and disparate flavors that the gaps and omissions can be overlooked. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Cory Arcangel: Pro Tools' (through Sept. 11) This solo turn from Mr. Arcangel, the digital wunderkind, artist-musician and inveterate hacker, seems a trifle scrubbed clean, sanitized and austere. Containing work almost entirely from 2011, it tells us little of his funkier early digital efforts or artistic development. A few pieces reflect his longstanding interest in television and video games; in others he tries too hard to establish his formalist bona fides with wry riffs on abstract painting and sculpture. Mr. Arcangel seems guided by a somewhat callow faith in the avant-garde, striving to perpetuate its tradition, dating from Duchamp, of laying claim to new areas of nonart for art's sake. Sometimes he succeeds, but not always. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Breaking Ground: The Whitney's Founding Collection' (through Sept. 18) In anticipation of its move to a new home in 2015, the Whitney is cooking up a series of six back-to-back experimental permanent collection shows at its present location. The first of them is a sampler of the earliest work in the holdings, and as a summary of the institution's initial view of American Modernism, what a curious thing it is. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
Galleries: Uptown
- John O'Reilly: 'Recent Montage' (through July 29) Although the artist John O'Reilly is 81, his work hasn't been in the public eye all that long. He made his small, intricate photo-montages in private for decades before he came to art-world notice in the 1995 Whitney Biennial. The recent work at De Nagy, including pieces dedicated to Hart Crane and Marsden Hartley, combine images from art history, gay pornography, and found vintage photographs, supplemented by photographs taken by -- and of -- Mr. O'Reilly himself. The result is a boldly self-effacing and self-insistent art. Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, tibordenagy.com, (212) 262-5050. (Cotter)
Galleries: 57th St.
Willem de Kooning: 'The Figure: Movement and Gesture' (through July 29) This artist's own words -- brilliant as usual -- set the stage for this riveting show: ''The figure is nothing unless you twist it around like a strange miracle.'' The 32 mutually illuminating paintings, drawings and sculptures ranging from the late 1960s through the '70s are full of such twists and miracles, emerging from and then slipping back into extravagantly lush, unstable masses of brushwork. The capacity of these marks to read alternately as real -- even anatomically correct -- and malformed and abstract is one reason for the continuing relevance of de Kooning's art. Pace Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 421-3292, thepacegallery.com. (Smith)
Leo Villareal: 'Volume' (through Aug. 19) You might just want to sit and gaze in blissful stupefaction at ''Cylinder,'' the single-light sculpture featured here. It consists of 160 12-foot-long lengths of shiny stainless steel, each with 140 light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, along one edge, hanging in five concentric circles to create a cylindrical volume nine feet in diameter. The thousands of computer-controlled lights flicker in the darkness, generating all kinds of patterns and a fascinating beauty. Gering & Lopez, 730 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (646) 336-7183, geringlopez.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: Chelsea
Sol LeWitt: 'Arcs and Lines' (through July 28) This extraordinary show features three gridded wall drawings by the eminent Conceptual-Minimalist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), most prominently the airy and ebullient ''Wall Drawing #122'' from 1972, a spare work in blue crayon that wraps almost perfectly around the gallery's large central space. Featuring combinations of two straight, wavy, curved or broken lines in each compartment of the grid, its vaulting composition evokes Matisse's blue nudes, brisk Alpine views and even the blinking sweep of a radar screen, exemplifying both the economy and rich suggestiveness of LeWitt's art. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)
- Picasso and Marie-Therese: 'L'Amour Fou' (through July 15) While falling short of the exhibition of late Picasso paintings and prints that filled this space two years ago, the latest Gagosian exegesis into Picasso land is a wonderfully motley, almost scattershot affair, brilliantly installed. It presents works, in all mediums and several styles, that Picasso made during the late 1920s and '30s, when he was under the spell of the voluptuous, Roman-nosed, level-eyed, full-limbed Marie-Therese Walter, arguably the love of his life. Anchored by this single if perpetually mutating subject, the art on hand confirms that when Picasso told Walter she had saved his life, he meant that she had also saved his art. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)
- Jason Polan: 'Living and Working' (through July 29) This solo debut introduces an artist who is more or less drawing his way through life, as well as his own show. Friday is the last day he will spend drawing in the gallery, but he will continue adding works to the display, which includes, among much else, a ''life-size'' drawing of the head of King Kong, a decorated but useable table-tennis table and (my favorite) a wall covered with smudgy drawings of dense black circles, large, medium and small. Nicholas Robinson Gallery, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 560-9075, nrgallery.com. (Smith)
- Jo Ractliffe: 'Terras do Fim do Mundo (The Lands of the End of the World)' (through Aug. 13) At first glance, this South African photographer's black-and-white shots of sun-baked Angolan landscapes look random and bland: rocks, dirt, scrubby trees; some handwritten signs but no people. Only when you read some of the titles -- ''Mass Grave at Cassinga,'' ''Minefield Near Mupa'' -- do you learn where people are, or once were, and the pictures snap into expressive focus. The Walther Collection Project Space, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
Tyson Reeder (through July 15) Mr. Reeder, an art-world multitasker in Milwaukee who paints and organizes special events, is back in Chelsea for his first New York solo show in five years. He brings some of that peripatetic energy to his new paintings of heads and landscapes, which dart from Picabia to Fautrier to the Post-Impressionists. The heads in particular are richly varied. A natty bow-tied figure with masklike features, shaped with firm strokes of the palette knife, builds on Dubuffet; a loosely contoured cranium, with its pastel palette and palm trees, suggests Polke in Key West, Fla. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, (212) 924-4949, danielreichgallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Jessica Rohrer: 'Oakridge Road' (through July 23) In Ms. Rohrer's many, small, meticulous paintings on panels and paper of her domestic environment, every element, from a half-squeezed tube of toothpaste in a crammed medicine cabinet to leaves on trees outside bay windows is defined cleanly and exactly. There is something odd about how industrious she is. It is as if a mad hausfrau or a Stepford wife had become obsessed with conducting an inventory of every single thing in her fanatically groomed world. P.P.O.W., 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 647-1044, ppowgallery.com. (Johnson)
- Vladimir Tatlin: 'Monument to the Third International' (through July 29) Concocted by a founder of Russian Constructivism between 1915 and 1920, following close encounters with the Eiffel Tower and Picasso's guitar constructions in Paris, this tilting, spiraling, viaduct-like structure is one of early Modernism's most ambitious and best-known works of unrealized architecture, embodied by one of its biggest architectural models. Shown in the United States for the first time -- the oldest (1967) remake of the original model, which disappeared around 1932 -- it is dense with portents of 20th-century sculpture to come, from LeWitt's grids to Smithson's jetty. Tony Shafrazi, 544 West 26th Street, (212) 274-9300, tonyshafrazigallery.com. (Smith)
Richard Tuttle: 'What's the Wind' (through July 22) Working quite a bit larger than usual, this Post-Minimalist master of seeming trifles presents a series of deftly cobbled-together thingamajigs that charm and challenge. Each presents a kind of stage-set-like open volume of sculptural events patched together from colorful, lightweight materials and objects. The result is a somewhat slovenly, art-supplies Constructivism that is characteristically light, ephemeral and full of joy. Pace Gallery, 510 West 24th Street, (212) 255-4044, thepacegallery.com. (Smith)
- B. Wurtz: 'Works 1970-2011' (through Aug. 5) This wryly beautiful, morally invigorating retrospective highlights the playful, plain-spoken sculptures and wall pieces of the artist known by the gender-vague signature B. Wurtz. Cobbled together from carefully selected scraps of wood and wire, plastic grocery bags, food packaging, buttons, shoelaces and the occasional porcelain sink leg, his acts of ingenious recycling channel Duchamp and Calder while bringing existing materials and artistic thought into an unusually clear, mutually enhancing alignment. Against the profligacy of so much of today's art world, they constitute a quiet refusal, a rebellious act of abstinence that results in its own kind of fullness. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea; (212) 206-7100, metropictures.com (Smith)
Galleries: SoHo
'The Atomic Explosion: A Collection of Vintage Photographs' (through July 29) This show gathers 66 images of American nuclear tests and detonations, most of them conducted at the Nevada Test Site and on the Marshall Islands during the 1940s and '50s. The massing mushroom clouds in these images, photographed from miles away, are made to seem benignly organic. A giant portobello rises over Bikini Atoll; slender enokis sprout in Nevada. The news-service captions on many of the prints feel just as innocuous; one compares a double-capped cloud to ''a giant dumbbell.''

Drew Heitzler (through July 29) This solo by a surf-obsessed, Los Angeles-based artist draws on source material both wet (surfer films and television shows) and dry (critical theory). The three-channel video installation ''Spiral Jetty/Crystal Voyager/Region Centrale (Bootlegged, Re-ordered, Combined, Sometimes More, Sometimes Less),'' appropriates 1970s classics by Robert Smithson, Michael Snow and George Greenough, and finds the common ground in surfing, Land Art and structural film.

- Tom Fairs: 'Drawings' (through July 15) You might mistake the small, town-and-country drawings in this lovely show for the works of an early 20th-century follower of Pierre Bonnard. The truth is that the British painter Tom Fairs (1925-2007) did not begin producing art full time until after his retirement from teaching at age 60. Working with soft pencils, he drew the outdoor world with an almost shocking avidity. This show, the first solo ever devoted to Fairs's work, is inspiring.

- 'Paul Clay' (through July 30) The ever-lively ceramics arts -- so currently fashionable they may be the new video -- deserve more orderly and respectful attention than this jampacked show and its punning title. (Paul Clay? All Klee?) Still, with some 45 artists spanning from elder statesmen like Ken Price and Ron Nagle to newly minted Columbia University M.F.A.'s to unfamiliar talents from Japan and South Africa, and works that range from jewelry and tea bowls to large-scale sculpture, it is an achievement that will expand anyone's horizons.

'Mark di Suvero at Governors Island: Presented by Storm King Art Center' (through Sept. 25) With 11 works spanning more than three decades, this show organized by Storm King Art Center, the 500-acre sculpture park in the Hudson Valley, is Mark di Suvero's biggest New York City survey since 1975. The all-outdoor exhibition works alongside the island's packed calendar of activities and festivals, offering bike riders and picnickers culture by osmosis. Plan to spend some time along the island's southern end, where four of Mr. di Suvero's best sculptures engage the waterfront and one another in invigorating ways. Governors Island, govisland.com.

Eva Rothschild: 'Empire' (through Aug. 28) At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web over 18 feet at its highest point. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire'' will be a required photo-op for tourists and other visitors. Doris C.

- Anacostia Community Museum: 'Word, Shout, Song: Lorenzo Dow Turner, Connecting Communities Through Language' (through July 24) Housed in a converted movie theater in a predominantly African-American neighborhood that is a cab ride's distance from the National Mall, the Anacostia Community Museum is one of Washington's cultural secrets. Its exhibition on the scholar Lorenzo Dow Turner (1890-1972), who documented surviving traces of African languages and customs in modern African-American culture, is both an archival homage and a well-paced drama of ideas.

- The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery, Skidmore College: 'Environment and Object: Recent African Art' (through July 31) Contemporary African art can mean many things: art made in Africa, or by someone from Africa living elsewhere, or by someone not from Africa but of African descent. All definitions apply in this stimulating show, as do variant readings of the rest of exhibition title. This is very much a show of objects, with several environments or installations. At the same time, the environment itself, meaning the natural world, under dire threat, is the subject of much of the art. 815 North Broadway, Saratoga Springs, N.Y., (518) 580-8080, tang.skidmore.edu.

- Neuberger Museum of Art: 'Art in Cameroon: Sculptural Dialogues' (through Aug. 14) With 30 sculptures, two from the Neuberger's holdings, this show isn't large, but some of the pieces are spellbinders, given plenty of room to work their magic. Highlights are two figures, one of a man, the other of a woman, both elderly, found in the same area of Cameroon in 1910, taken to different collections in Europe and reunited here, in silent conversation, after some 75 years.

Last Chance
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Quilts: Masterworks from the American Folk Art Museum' (closes on Friday) This exhibition celebrating quilts from the museum's collection reveals the optical vitality of these eminently pictorial textiles. Ranging across a variety of patterns and techniques and nearly two centuries, the examples here effortlessly combine personal and national histories with rigorous down-home formalism, all the while making brilliant use of available, often humble, fabrics. The various geometric ins and outs, color contrasts and boldly scaled compositions confirm that quilts, like Navajo blankets, are among the earliest abstract art in post-conquest North America. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)
American Folk Art Museum: 'Eugene Von Bruenchenhein: Freelance Artist -- Poet and Sculptor -- Inovator -- Arrow maker and Plant man -- Bone artifacts constructor -- Photographer and Architect -- Philosopher' (closes on Friday) Whether photographing his wife as a sweetly chaste pinup girl; fashioning plant forms from scrounged clay or little thrones from salvaged turkey bones; or making delicate ballpoint-pen drawings or hallucinatory paintings rife with intimations of exotic undersea or sci-fi worlds, this self-taught, self-proclaimed multitasker (as made clear in the show's subtitle) never wavered in his sense of his own greatness. Mounted 27 years after his death, his first American museum survey doesn't quite do him justice and especially shortchanges the paintings, but it presents the fruits of his ceaseless labors with a clarity that makes them feel of a piece, and like a gift. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)
- John Chamberlain: 'New Sculpture' (closes on Friday) In some of the largest works of his career, this venerable American sculptor uses his signature materials -- crushed car bodies and fenders -- with tremendous compositional variety, verve and his usual unerring color sense. Variously comical, stately, architectural and gestural, these pieces erupt from the gallery's expansive concrete floors like unusually well-shaped mesas, creating an exhilarating indoor landscape. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Smith)
- Museum of Modern Art: 'German Expressionism: The Graphic Impulse' (closes on Monday) MoMA's largest survey of Germany's first Modern art movement is infused with an urgent, crackling energy, by turns joyful, satiric, grim and tragic. Presenting some 250 works -- most of them little-seen prints -- it celebrates one of the 20th century's most brutally effective, socially responsive unions of medium and message and shakes up the (understandable) conventional wisdom that the museum is almost terminally Francophile. While lavish, the show reveals but a fraction of the museum's 3,200 Expressionist works on paper, all of which are newly available for digital viewing at moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/161. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Paris Through the Window: Marc Chagall and His Circle' (closes on Sunday) Building on the Philadelphia Museum's substantial collection of early Modern art, this show includes a taste of Chagall at his best as well as a smattering of Modiglianis and Soutines and a generous serving of influential if less beloved artists like Jean Metzinger, Jacques Lipchitz and Albert Gleizes. But it does nothing to dispute the commonly held notion that Chagall remained a small-town artist at heart, even when he was rubbing shoulders with the Parisian avant-garde. Philadelphia Museum of Art, Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 26th Street, Philadelphia, 19130, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
John Storrs: 'Machine-Age Modernist' (closes on Saturday) The Chicago-born artist John Storrs (1885-1956) compacted utopian, machine-age dreaming into Cubist-Art Deco-style sculptures resembling pieces of architectural ornament and models of skyscrapers. There is nothing quite like his dense, carefully wrought stone and metal sculptures in early American -- or European, for that matter -- Modernism, and this finely tuned show gives a good account of his progress from the late '10s to the early '30s.

It presents works, in all mediums and several styles, that Picasso made during the late 1920s and '30s, when he was under the spell of the voluptuous, Roman-nosed, level-eyed, full-limbed Marie-Therese Walter, arguably the love of his life. Anchored by this single if perpetually mutating subject, the art on hand confirms that when Picasso told Walter she had saved his life, he meant that she had also saved his art.

HEADLINE: Still 'Far Apart' on Debt, 2 Sides Will Seek $4 Trillion in Savings

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and CARL HULSE; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, convening budget talks at the White House on Thursday, said Republicans and Democrats were still ''far apart'' but expressed confidence they could agree on an ambitious deal to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt.
Though the president and Congressional leaders did not close wide gaps on the issues of spending cuts or new tax revenues, officials briefed on the talks said, they emerged with a consensus to aim for the biggest possible deal -- one resulting in up to $4 trillion in savings -- and a recognition of the dire consequences of not acting before Aug. 2, when the government will lose its authority to borrow.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner gave a stark description of the upheaval he said would reverberate through financial markets and the broader American economy if the government were to go into default, these officials said. The eight lawmakers from both parties listened somberly, officials said, and pledged to avoid such an outcome.
''Everyone acknowledged that we have to get this done before the hard deadline of Aug. 2 to make sure America does not default for the first time on its obligations,'' Mr. Obama said to reporters after the meeting. ''And everybody acknowledged that there's going to be pain involved politically on all sides.'' 
Democrats and Republicans are confronting not only tough choices about how to balance spending cuts and higher taxes, but how best to sell such a package, which would probably challenge basic philosophical tenets of each party, to their rank-and-file members.
Declaring that the meeting had been ''very constructive,'' Mr. Obama said that White House and Congressional staff members would negotiate through the weekend and that the leaders would reconvene at the White House on Sunday. At that point, he said, he hopes ''the parties will at least know where each other's bottom lines are'' and try to conclude a deal within two weeks.
Later, top lawmakers and Congressional officials said that they thought a narrow opening existed for a far-reaching agreement, and that the next 48 hours and the Sunday meeting would prove pivotal. If an acceptable package cannot be agreed upon, they predicted a fallback plan in the range of $2 trillion or more, based on the earlier negotiations overseen by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
With the White House and the lawmakers promising not to divulge details of the talks, the specifics of an eventual deal were not yet clear. But Mr. Obama has put popular entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security on the table, while Speaker John A. Boehner has signaled for the first time his openness to up to $1 trillion in new revenues. The money could presumably be raisedthrough closing loopholes but would also probably require changes to the tax code that would have to be worked out later.
The prospect of cuts in health care benefits and Social Security has alarmed Democrats. On Thursday, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said she wanted to give the president room to negotiate a broad agreement but would resist efforts to tie the deal to Social Security.
''Do not consider Social Security a piggy bank for giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country,'' Ms. Pelosi said to reporters on Capitol Hill after the meeting. ''We are not going to balance the budget on the backs of America's seniors, women and people with disabilities.''
Mr. Obama plans to meet privately with Ms. Pelosi on Friday, suggesting that the White House is now turning its attention to soothing Democrats after the president held a secret meeting with Mr. Boehner last Sunday. That session advanced the talks and laid the groundwork for Thursday's session, but left some Democrats complaining that they were being excluded from the process.
''The big question everyone is asking is, 'What are we getting?' '' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.
The White House took pains on Thursday to play down reports that Mr. Obama was open to substantial cuts in Social Security benefits as part of a deficit-reduction deal. The press secretary, Jay Carney, said that the president had vowed in his State of the Union address in January to put Social Security on a firmer footing, and that he would not place the subject off limits in negotiations to reduce the deficit.
But Mr. Carney insisted that the president had not changed his approach to Social Security, saying Mr. Obama would consider only changes to the system that ''would not slash benefits.''
Among the proposals is an adjustment to the price index that measures cost-of-living increases, which would whittle its payments to recipients over time. For all the battles over the budget, the meeting on Thursday was, by all accounts, cordial and businesslike. Mr. Obama, seated between Mr. Boehner and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, told the lawmakers he would not sign an interim deal, only one that extended through the 2012 election.
Then he surveyed the eight leaders about their preference for three deals of different sizes -- the largest being up to $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade, according to aides briefed on the discussion.
Six of the eight expressed their support for the biggest deal, the aides said. But Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, favored the midrange $2 trillion, voicing doubts about how they could sell a $4 trillion deal to their rank and file, officials said, since it would involve tax increases.
The fact that Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid both embraced the largest deal was viewed as significant by senior aides, since it suggested that entitlement cuts were inevitable. Democrats would be likely to push for changes in Medicare to focus on providers rather than patients.
''The cuts on the table to Medicare and Medicaid are things the Democrats could live with,'' said Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Mr. Biden who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner seemed united in the desire to pursue as big a deal as possible. In the meeting, aides said, Mr. Boehner declared that he took the job of speaker to get things accomplished, not just to latch on to the title.
Mr. Geithner appeared to be playing a role not unlike that of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who warned lawmakers in the fall of 2008 that unless Congress voted to bail out the banking system, the credit crisis threatened to plunge the United States into a depression. Stunned by Mr. Bernanke's dire depiction, the lawmakers undertook measures that were until then unthinkable.
In addition to his warnings about the cost of a default, officials said, Mr. Geithner told the lawmakers the White House did not believe it had the authority, under the Constitution, to continue issuing debt if it reached the debt ceiling. Nobody in the room disputed Mr. Geithner's bleak assessment, the officials said.

I'm not the only one making this point, but when you hear Republicans saying that what we need to do to create jobs is slash government spending and cut government payrolls, that's exactly what has been happening for the past year, as the Obama stimulus has faded out. Here's government employment (that bulge was Census hiring):
And here's government purchases of goods and services (so it doesn't count transfer payments like unemployment insurance):
Basically, government has been shrinking for the past year -- in practice, fiscal policy has been doing exactly what Republicans say it should be doing. Where's my confidence fairy?

HIGHLIGHT: The simple design of ticket stubs from 1983, found while emptying out some old boxes, is kind of charming, considering the fancy ones that are given out today.

 BODY:
Tom Jolly, our former sports editor, is the Associate Managing Editor of The New York Times
Funny what housecleaning can reveal. In this case, it's a small window into the inflated cost of going to a Major League Baseball game. 
 I found these ticket stubs from 1983 while emptying out some old boxes. Even their simple design is kind of charming, considering the fancy ones that are given out today. They were issued by the Baltimore Orioles without listing the opponents' names (the White Sox in the American League Championship Series, which the Orioles won three games to one and the Phillies in the Series, which the Orioles won four games to one). 
What stands out, of course, is the price. 
It's hard to believe that I paid a grand total of $80 for lower reserved tickets for four postseason games in Baltimore - two in the American League Championship Series and two in the World Series. 
Naturally, it made me wonder what comparable tickets would cost today. 
 Memorial Stadium is gone, of course, but similar lowered reserve seats at Camden Yards cost $30 for a regular-season game. The Orioles haven't been in the post-season lately, of course, and it turns out that last season's American League champion Texas Rangers charge a bit more for regular-season tickets: $36 for lower reserved. 
 Inflation factors in, of course, and according to the United States Department of Labor's calculator, $15 in 1983 is equivalent to $34.03 today and $25 is equivalent to $56.72. In other words, the cost of the A.L.C.S. tickets in 1983 are about equal to the cost of regular-season tickets this season. 
 But how do they compare to postseason tickets? 
The Rangers charged $150 for lower reserved seats in last season's World Series. After adjusting for inflation, that's nearly three times the cost of those 1983 World Series tickets.

One summer Saturday afternoon, I was kneeling on a barren patch of dirt in Brooklyn, digging flat-bottomed trenches with a trowel. It was 2008. My sister was trying to open a bar, and I was helping her prepare to lay bricks in what would be the backyard.
A few weeks earlier, the lot had been a graveyard of broken bicycles, hip-deep in rusty spokes, fenders and other detritus from a shop that had occupied the space for many years. Friends had helped my sister haul the junk away and level the lumpy ground; the project took on the quality of a barn raising. It was hot. We were grimy. "Sweat equity" wasn't just a figure of speech. And I remember thinking that, although her enthusiasm might kill us, at least we'd all get a drink at the end.
These days, the backyard is full of activity. Patrons with pint glasses mill around the patio tables. Some of them barbecue on a pair of charcoal grills that a neighborhood welder built in exchange for a bar tab. It's a simple story, one that leaves a lot of things out -- including plenty of long nights, headaches and nails bitten to the quick. But it's also emblematic of why I love new ventures: there are few things more infectious than the creative drive of an entrepreneur bringing a new business to life. I'm a fan of roll-up-your-sleeves, work-'til-dawn anecdotes. They're the kind of stories I heard every day when I was an editor at Fortune Small Business, whether I was prowling the halls of start-up incubators in Detroit or riding across Texas in a Winnebago full of entrepreneurs doing a whistle-stop product introduction. 
So whether you're in the throes of starting a new company, or you're an old hand at entrepreneurship, or you're just helping a loved one dig in the dirt, I'm thrilled to welcome you to Start, a new channel at You're the Boss devoted exclusively to young businesses. From the outside, a start-up can look like alchemy: creating value out of thin air. But there's no magic recipe to transforming a napkin sketch into a sustainable endeavor.
It's a risk that few people are willing to take. Last year, some 6.5 percent of Americans -- or just one in 15 -- were self-employed business owners, according to recent data from the Kauffman Foundation (pdf). And though the recession has been pushing more people -- sometimes called "accidental entrepreneurs" -- into the ring, many of them are hunkering down and going it alone, rather than creating companies that employ other people.
In the coming months, we'll wade into the trenches with this latest batch of entrepreneurs and explore the challenges they face. Where do the ideas that drive successful new companies come from? How do you transform an idea into a great company? How do you get other people to buy in? How do you convince potential patrons that they actually want what you have on offer? How do you channel passion into profit? Which ideas succeed?
We will look at incubators, business-plan competitions and other efforts to turbo-charge new companies. We will examine disruptive ideas and innovative practices, perhaps diagnose a belly flop or two. And I hope we'll prompt a conversation that takes advantage of the wealth of experience You're the Boss readers share. Above all, this column is a start-up. You can invest in it by contributing your thoughts in the comments section or writing to me directly at upstartnyt@gmail.com

HEADLINE: Riding Out Volatile Times

BYLINE: BUCKS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Investment professionals offer their suggestions on riding out the political and financial upheaval around the world.

 BODY:
In his Wealth Matters column this week, Paul Sullivan checks in with some investment professionals on their advice to clients in this year of political and economic turmoil. They all agreed that investors should take the long view and not be swayed by individual events. 
But how do you define the long view? The professionals say they continue to be confident about the stock market in the United States, mainly because of strong corporate earnings. One adviser said he was investing in multinational companies that derive their revenue from around the world. Another recommended that investors buy dollars and long-dated United States Treasury bonds as protection against troubles in the euro zone.
What has been your strategy to ride out these volatile times, coming so soon after the financial crisis? Are you sticking with conservative investments, even low-interest CDs? Have you gotten back into stocks? Are you buying commodities?

HEADLINE: Consulting Group Says E.V.'s Are Not Needed to Curb Greenhouse Emissions

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The group, which advised the Treasury Department during the 2009 auto industry bailout, claimed that improvements to internal combustion engines would allow fleets to meet federal emissions targets.

 BODY:
In a report sure to rankle proponents and producers of electric vehicles, the Boston Consulting Group concluded that automakers could meet increasingly stringent federal greenhouse emissions requirements for 2020 mainly by making cost-effective improvements to existing internal combustion vehicles.
The group, which was hired to advise the Treasury Department in 2009 on the automotive industry bailout, issued the report, "Powering Autos to 2020: The Era of the Electric Car?", on Wednesday. The authors projected outward to 2020 based on the European Union's proposed timetable for carbon emissions standards, though in the United States the next round of corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards is scheduled to apply from 2017 through 2025.
Carmakers could achieve a 40 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions by improving internal-combustion technology, the report said. The improvements would cost automakers about $50 to $60 for every percentage point of carbon emissions saved. The authors also noted that this cost amounted to approximately half the amount projected as recently as 2008.
Last week, Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, cautioned that if the Obama administration adopted a very high fuel economy target for 2025, it would turn the program "into an electric car mandate." Fast-moving advancements in conventional engine technologies, however, could change that perception.
Reaching the 40 percent goal also would require advances in transmission and power management technology, better aerodynamics and a reduction in vehicle mass, the report said.
Xavier Mosquet, co-leader of the Boston Consulting automotive practice, said in a statement that electric cars "will gain only modest ground" by 2020. "Gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles are improving faster than expected and will continue to dominate the global landscape," he said.
The group also did not expect battery costs to decrease dramatically, asserting that a 20 kilowatt-hour battery would still add a $9,600 to the price of a car in 2020. The report did not say whether the figure accounted for inflation, but it did assume a 20 percent manufacturer markup.
Yet Khobi Brooklyn, a spokeswoman for Tesla Motors, the California-based E.V. manufacturer, said that the company saw lower prices ahead. "We do see an opportunity for the cost of batteries to come down as the chemistry and energy density improves," she said in an e-mail.

HEADLINE: Education Reform's Two-Month Warning

BYLINE: PAUL TOUGH


HIGHLIGHT: In the midst of the roiling sea of opinion, one commentary that I thought deserved more attention than it got was this one, by Michael J. Petrilli, an education analyst and researcher with the Thomas B. Fordham institute.

 BODY:
In writing my essay on education reform that appears in this weekend's magazine, I parachuted myself into an already crowded (and fairly angry) field of pundits reacting to Diane Ravitch's June 1 Op-Ed column in The Times. In the essay, I mentioned Jonathan Alter's response and Tim King's. There was also this retort from David Brooks and a reply to Brooks from the journalist John Merrow.
In the midst of that roiling sea of opinion, one commentary that I thought deserved more attention was this one, by Michael J. Petrilli, an education analyst and researcher with the Thomas B. Fordham Institute.
I disagree with some of Petrilli's conclusions, but I admire his essay nonetheless. I like the clear-eyed way he analyzes the prospects of young Americans in poverty and the honesty he demonstrates in proposing a solution to their education challenges. He writes:Rather than get defensive at Diane's defeatism, we reformers should clarify the ends that education reform can achieve. If not 100 percent proficiency, then what?
Try this exercise. This fall, about 1 million poor children will enroll in kindergarten in the U.S. The vast majority of them live in single-parent families headed by women in the late teens or early 20s. Most of their mothers dropped out of high school; most of their fathers are nowhere to be seen. Most live in urban or rural communities hit hard by the recession where unemployment, addiction, and violence are commonplace. Now, try to "see like a state" and play policy maker. When designing a school accountability system, what should its objectives be with respect to these 1 million children?What I like about Petrilli's approach is that it gets very specific and very immediate about the landscape in front of us: 1 million poor kids entering kindergarten in less than two months. And it challenges us with the fact that as policy makers - or voters or taxpayers - we are responsible for making dozens of different policy decisions, both inside and outside schools, that will directly affect how well those kids will do in school and how many of them will graduate from high school and from college.
I like Petrilli's question. I just don't like his answer. I think he sets the bar way too low:Assuming that these 1 million kids remain poor over the next 12 years, what outcomes would indicate "success" for education reform? Right now the high school graduation rate in poor districts is generally about 50 percent. What if we moved that to 60 percent? Right now the reading proficiency rate for 12th graders with parents who dropped out of high school is 17 percent. What if we moved that to 25 percent? The same rate for math is 8 percent. What if we moved that to 15 percent?To my eye, these are stretch goals - challenging but attainable. Yet to adopt them would mean to expect about 400,000 kindergarteners not to graduate from high school 12 years from now. And of the 600,000 that do graduate, we would expect only 150,000 to reach proficiency in reading (25 percent) and just 90,000 of them to be proficient in math (15 percent).
Petrilli is right that these results would be a significant improvement on where we are today. But I certainly hope that he's wrong that they are the most we can hope to achieve. Do we really want to accept that the best that the United States can do for those 1 million 5-year-olds, with 13 years and vast resources at our disposal, is to get 90,000 of them to proficiency in math, while we let the other 910,000 fail?
To me, a goal that is more closely aligned with the ideals of the nation, while still entirely realistic, would be the one that the Gates Foundation has adopted, to have 80 percent of American teenagers graduating from high school "with the knowledge and skills they need to complete college." Or the goal of the KIPP charter schools: for 75 percent of their (mostly low-income) incoming fifth-grade students to go on to earn a four-year college degree.
Once we decide on the targets we want to reach, the rest is relatively straightforward (though still incredibly difficult): finding the cheapest, fastest and most effective interventions to get us there.
I don't agree with analysts like Richard Rothstein, who argue that the best way to reach our goal is to embrace a traditional (and expensive) list of liberal social policies: increase the minimum wage, expand housing subsidies, strengthen unions, improve dental care, etc. Those may or may not be worthy aims on their own, but I have seen little evidence that they would have a significant effect on the academic achievement of low-income students. But I also don't agree with those reformers who say that classroom interventions alone will get us to our goal. To me, the evidence from the last decade suggests otherwise.
Instead, I am trying to encourage reformers to add to their current list of policy goals some targeted, evidence-based programs that are narrowly focused on improving school performance for children from the most disadvantaged families. That might mean a radical overhaul of Head Start; it might mean more and better early-home-visiting programs, especially for young single mothers; it might mean a very different kind of child-protective-services system.
It will definitely mean a very different kind of conversation about education than the one we are having today.
Beginning that conversation would require all of us - including both reformers and their ideological opponents - to enter some scary and unfamiliar territory. But Petrilli has given us the perfect inspiration to overcome those fears: the image of 1 million poor 5-year-olds, getting ready to slip on their Dora the Explorer backpacks and head off for the first day of school this fall, counting on our help to get them to and through college.

HEADLINE: Overly Optimistic, Once Again

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Despite predictions to the contrary, the share of adults with jobs is now at its lowest level since the recession began.

 BODY:
This morning's jobs report is terrible. For the second straight month, the economy created only a tiny number of jobs -- 18,000 in June, 25,000 in May. Both numbers are far below what's needed to keep up with normal population growth (roughly 125,000 jobs).
 For the second straight year, the recovery in the job market has essentially stalled. This chart, showing the share of adults with jobs, offers the best summary you'll find:
 The share begins falling in 2007 even before the recession officially began, picked up speed in early 2008 and then began plummeting after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. The job market began stabilizing in late 2009, as the stimulus and the Federal Reserve's efforts to battle to the crisis reached their peak. Employment began growing faster than population in early 2010 -- but then stalled, thanks to some combination of Europe's debt troubles, the waning of government action and the general uncertainty in the wake of a financial crisis.
 By late 2010 and early this year, the situation was improving again -- only to slide back again in recent months, this time because of gas prices, Europe (again) and general post-crisis uncertainty (again). The share of adults with jobs, 58.2 percent, is now tied with its low point since this recession began. It has not been lower since 1983. "This is a big bucket of very cold water," Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics wrote to clients this morning.
 Government officials, especially those at the Fed, have proven too optimistic again and again throughout the crisis. In recent months, they have been saying that they didn't need to take further action because the economy would soon heal on its own. What do they do now?

HEADLINE: The Cost of Austerity

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Cuts by state and local governments have cost the economy about 1 million jobs over the past two years.

 BODY:
The main problem with the job market is the lack of hiring by private employers. Above all, they aren't sure what the future will bring.
Financial crises have long hangovers, and this one is no exception. Home sales and car sales remain depressed, nowhere near their earlier peaks, even though the population has continued growing. Europe still has the potential to upset global financial markets. If Congress doesn't act on the debt ceiling soon, so does the United States.
In all kinds of ways -- consumer demand, the federal deficit, even the weather -- the medium-term future is highly uncertain. But this uncertainty, while the main problem, is not the only problem. We are also committing an unforced economic error. We're cutting government at the same time that the private sector is cutting.
It is the classic mistake to make after a financial crisis. Hoover and even Roosevelt made a version of it in the 1930s. The Japanese made a version of it in the 1990s. Now we are making it.
Federal payrolls have been roughly flat for years (even as the population has been growing). But state and local payrolls grew over the past decade, by almost 20,000 jobs a month on average. Since the crisis began and state and local taxes began plummeting, though, governments began to cut back. At first, the federal government stepped in, with the 2009 stimulus bill, and sent fiscal aid to states. Then the aid stopped.
In round numbers, state and local governments have cut about a half million jobs over the past two years. If they had continued to hire at their previous pace -- expanding as the population expanded -- they would have added about a half million jobs.
In other words, the state and local austerity of the past two years has cost the economy about one million jobs.

HEADLINE: Comparing Recessions and Recoveries: Job Changes

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A look at how many jobs the economy needs to add before returning to prerecession employment levels.

 BODY:
The United States added just 18,000 nonfarm payroll jobs over all in June, the Labor Department reported Friday, after having added 25,000 jobs the previous month. Neither figure is statistically significant from zero, given that the growth is compared to a base of 131 million jobs.
June's employment growth numbers were only about a tenth of what economists had been forecasting. 
Some of the biggest (although still modest) gains were in professional and technical services, leisure and hospitality, and health care. Government at all levels -- federal, state and local -- shed workers. Most of the local jobs lost were teaching jobs.
Even most of the winners, though, have a long way to go before returning to their prerecession levels.The chart above shows economywide job changes in this last recession and recovery compared with other recent ones, with the black line representing the current downturn. Since the downturn began in December 2007, the economy has shed, on net, about 5 percent of its nonfarm payroll jobs. And that does not even account for the fact that the working-age population has continued to grow, meaning that if the economy were healthy we should have more jobs today than we had before the recession.
The unemployment rate - measured by a different government survey, and based on how many people are without jobs but are actively looking for work - ticked up to 9.2 percent in June, compared to 9.1 percent in May (also not a statistically significant change).
There are now 14.1 million workers who are looking for work and cannot find it; the figure nearly doubles if you include workers who are part-time but want to be employed full-time, and workers who want to work but have stopped looking.

HEADLINE: Podcast: Jobs, Greece, Japan and Mutual Funds

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
After months of bleak unemployment reports, bad news isn't very surprising. But this bad?The Labor Department's monthly report on jobs and unemployment for June was a doozy. The rate of unemployment rose to 9.2 percent, its highest this year. And the rate of job creation plummeted. Only a net 18,000 new payroll jobs came into being in June, a number so weak that it would take years, at that rate, to put the millions of out-of-work Americans back into gainful employment. 
In a discussion in the new Weekend Business podcast, and in an article on the cover of Sunday Business, Catherine Rampell says it's worth noting that these very poor labor market conditions have not been accompanied by significant political action by the unemployed. These are not halycon days for labor unions, and unlike their counterparts in Greece and other parts of Europe and in the Middle East, where economic weakness has set off street demonstrations in recent months, people in the United States have suffered the indignity of unemployment rather quietly.
Conditions in Greece are poor and are likely to worsen, despite European efforts to arrange another bailout, in the opinion of Tyler Cowen, the George Mason University economist and frequent contributor to the Economic View column in Sunday Business. In a separate conversation, he analyzes the available options for Greece and for Europe over all, and finds no easy solutions.In Japan, recovery efforts are well under way after the triple disasters of last March - earthquake, tsunami and nuclear breakdown - but the long-term outlook for the Japanese economy is not particularly good, Ken Belson says in another conversation. Just returned from Japan, he says investors may want to take note of a joke made by bond traders: No one's lost money betting against Japan since the collapse of the bubble economy of the 1980s.
In the quarterly Mutual Funds Report in Sunday Business, Mr. Belson says Japan still has many strong world-class companies, which may well be worth investing in. But the country's economic trajectory, once sharply vertical, may no longer be so promising. 
Also in that quarterly report, John Schwartz takes note of a recent study showing that after politicians enter Congress, the performance of their investment portfolios suddenly improves. In a humor column, and in a monologue on the podcast, Mr. Schwartz suggests a surefire way of improving the odds that you'll beat the market: become a member of Congress yourself.
And in another conversation on the podcast, David Gillen talks to Natasha Singer about the economics of a business that is a rite of passage for many Americans: summer camp. On the cover of Sunday Business, Ms. Singer focuses on the evolution of a camp in the Poconos that has been run by the same family for three generations. It's a multimillion-dollar business that depends on keeping hundreds of children and their parents happy - a task that's become very complex these days.

HEADLINE: Metropolitan Preview: Private School Enrollment and Tuition Rising

BYLINE: JENNY ANDERSON


HIGHLIGHT: Chris Whittle and his partners are confident they can succeed with Avenues, a new for-profit private school, in part because of the imbalance between the number of children applying to New York's top private schools and the number of seats available.

 BODY:
In this Sunday's Metropolitan cover story, I chronicle the effort by the educational entrepreneur Chris Whittle to create Avenues, a new for-profit private school in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. An internationally focused school with a bilingual bent, it eventually plans to enroll about 1600 students in nursery through 12th grades.
Mr. Whittle's timing couldn't be better. Enrollment at New York City private schools is rising , according to the National Association of Independent Schools (recession? What recession?), and tuition at city schools is rising faster than tuition at private schools everywhere else, as the accompanying charts from the NAIS make clear. 
Here in the city, enrollment rose by about 3 percent between the 2007-2008 school year and 2010-2011 (though it grew at a slower pace every year), tracking the same group of schools. Adding in new schools, that figure rises to 36,473, or an increase of 15 percent. Nationally, enrollment dipped 1 percent from2008-2009 and 2010-2011.
In 2005-2006, tuition at city schools was about 58 percent higher than at schools elsewhere. By 2010-2011, New York was 63 percent higher. 
Mr. Whittle and his partners are confident they can succeed, in part because of the imbalance between the number of children applying to New York's top private schools and the number of seats available. Getting into Horace Mann, one of New York City's most elite private schools, is about as hard as getting into Columbia University, says Amanda Uhry, president of Manhattan Private School Advisors, which consults with families about private school admissions: Each institution takes about 6 percent of applicants, she says. 
Ms. Uhry says that the estimate of Horace Mann's acceptance rate is based only on her own data (she advises about 1,500 families a year). Horace Mann does not disclose that information. 
But it's that level of competition that creates ample opportunities for consultants like Ms. Uhry - and also for entrepreneurs like Mr. Whittle. Read the article and let us know what you think.

HEADLINE: Court Clears Way for Hospital Corporation Layoffs

BYLINE: JOHN ELIGON


HIGHLIGHT: Courthouse Confidential: A state appellate court ruled that the Health and Hospitals Corporation could go forward with planned layoffs, reversing a lower court ruling.

 BODY:
A state appellate court ruled on Thursday that the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation could go forward with planned layoffs it had announced last year, reversing a lower court ruling that prevented the staff reductions.
The city hailed the ruling as vindication that the mayor, his commissioners and the individual agencies had the right to determine the size of their work forces amid tight fiscal constraints.
"This decision is extremely important," Michael A. Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel, said in a statement. "It makes clear that in these difficult budget times the personnel and layoff decisions made by the executive branch cannot be second-guessed by the judiciary."
Since last year, when the lower court issued a temporary restraining order preventing the layoffs, the case has cost the city $10 million, Mr. Cardozo's office said in a press release. 
After hiring Deloitte Consulting to conduct a study, the Health and Hospitals Corporation determined in May 2010 that it would cut 144 positions: 45 of 136 carpenters, 45 of 156 electricians and 54 of 104 laborers.
Unions representing each of these groups sued, saying that the layoffs would prevent the corporation, which runs the city's public hospitals, from maintaining safe and adequate facilities. The layoffs, the union said, would affect the safety of hospital patients, staff members and the public.
"The Appellate Division has chosen to overturn the lower court's well-reasoned findings and in so doing has reopened very real concerns about the safety of both the public and our members," Lillian Roberts, the executive director of District Council 37, the city's largest municipal employees' union, said in a statement released Thursday.
The layoffs, she added, raised questions about who would do the work that was "so fundamental to the operations of H.H.C. facilities."
"The Union will be carefully evaluating H.H.C. actions from today forward, and assessing all our options to best defend both our members, and the interests of the communities which H.H.C. is meant to serve," she said.
A justice in State Supreme Court ruled last year that the layoffs, among other things, were arbitrary and capricious and that the corporation did not use sound methodology to determine the impact of the layoffs.
But Justice John W. Sweeny Jr., who wrote the 4-to-0 decision for the appellate court in Manhattan, said that the corporation appeared to use sound reasoning.
"The record before us clearly shows that H.H.C.'s layoff decision was rational in light of the imperative to reduce costs in conjunction with its mandate to provide medical services to all," Justice Sweeny wrote.
Justice Sweeny also noted that it was up to the city to manage its staff.
"Neither the petitioners nor the courts should be permitted to substitute their judgment for the discretionary management of the public business by public officials, as neither have been lawfully charged with that responsibility," he wrote.
Pro Bono
Although law firms seemed to rebound from difficult financial times last year by posting profits, the number of pro bono hours has fallen among the top 200 firms in the United States, according to The American Lawyer.
The average number of pro bono hours per lawyer at these firms dropped 8 percent, according to the journal.
The trend seemed to make sense, said Robin Sparkman, the editor in chief of The American Lawyer.
"It's not that the firms dramatically changed their commitment," Ms. Sparkman said. "It was a staffing issue. Hiring hasn't returned, but work to some degree has. There's only so many bodies, so many lawyers. So they have to do the paying work before they do the pro bono work."
Still, Ms. Sparkman said, the drop should be noted.
"It is significant to see pro bono numbers go down over all," she said. "It's big and it's disconcerting. But it is not completely surprising."

HEADLINE: Discouraged Workers, Especially at City Hall

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: State and local governments are squeezed as never before, and Washington now seems completely unwilling to help.

 BODY:
Two facts stand out from the dreadful jobs report this morning:
1. People are dropping out of the labor force.
2. This job recession is particularly bad for public sector workers. It is almost the worst on record.
In the spring of 2010, there was reason for optimism. Jobs were being added and the labor force participation rate was rising. That meant that some people without jobs had new hope and were looking again. Such a trend does not help the unemployment rate, which doesn't count you as jobless unless you are looking for a job, but it was a good sign nonetheless.
In April 2010, the participation rate -- the proportion of adults with jobs or looking for jobs -- rose to 65.1 percent. It had been much higher before the downturn, but that was a lot better than the low of 64.7 percent recorded the previous December.
This month the rate fell another tick, to 64.1 percent. The last time a rate that low was recorded was in March 1984.
The number of state and local government employees fell by 25,000 workers, and is now down 577,000, or 2.9 percent, from the peak reached in August 2008 -- the month before Lehman Brothers collapsed.Only once before -- or at least since they started collecting the numbers in the 1950s -- did state and local jobs fall that far. In July 1982 the number was down 3.1 percent.
These figures are seasonally adjusted, and you have to suspect that the numbers will get even worse this fall, when a lot of teachers don't go back to work.
The low point in state and local government jobs in 1982 came four months before the recession officially ended. This recession ended two years ago, but the relentless declines continue. 
This time is different in large part because state and local governments are squeezed as never before. Property tax collections have been devastated by collapsing property prices. Washington delayed the worst of the pain with the stimulus plan, but now seems completely unwilling to help. Instead, a lot of politicians seem to think that cutting employment is a positive good.
I have hoped that the recovery was strong enough to survive Washington's evident determination to tighten fiscal policy despite abundant evidence this was a bad time for such a tactic. Today's numbers argue that hope was mistaken.

HIGHLIGHT: Michele Bachmann's signing of a conservative "marriage vow" pledge in Iowa raised ire in the blogosphere.

 BODY:
Say what you will about Michele Bachmann, she's not media-shy. Nor is she particularly hesitant about stating her beliefs. And judging from the level of coverage she has received since announcing her candidacy for president on the Republican ticket, the media is quite interested in her every public move.
A moment captured by The Times's Jeff Zeleny in Iowa this week seemed to confirm this: "Newt and Callista Gingrich were standing on a street corner, an aide snapping pictures, as they waited for yet another campaign day to begin," Zeleny wrote. "A swarm of photographers gathered - a block away to capture the arrival of Michele Bachmann."
(The reason for all this attention? A top adviser to Bachmann's fellow candidate Tim Pawlenty offered an explanation, but if you're a public official, I suggest choosing a theory you don't have to immediately retract.)Bachmann's latest attention-getting move came Thursday when she became the first - and thus far only - candidate to sign a pledge drawn up by a Christian conservative group in Iowa. The pledge, called "The Marriage Vow: A Declaration of Dependence Upon Marriage and Family," requires signers to promise, among other things, to keep marital fidelity, support the Defense of Marriage Act and "robust childbearing and reproduction," and oppose gay marriage, abortion, "Sharia Islam," "intrusively intimate commingling among attracteds" in the military, and the abuse of women and children through human trafficking, pornography and prostitution. The group, called the Family Leader, run by Bob Vander Plaats, a former Iowa gubernatorial candidate and influential conservative, promises to withhold political support from any candidate who does not sign.
(As always, we suggest you read the document itself. The group's pledge and accompanying notes can be found here in pdf form.)
So with a possible presidency on the line, why sign onto an ideological script penned by others? At Huffington Post last week Jason Linkins and Elyse Siegel noted the trend: 
Yep, pledges and litmus tests are all the rage in politics at the moment. Sign on and you've maybe started down the path to securing an important endorsement. Beg off, and you're likely to draw fierce criticism -- if not from the field itself, then certainly from the sidelines. And if you get on the wrong side of someone who's significant to an early contest, you might be kissing your chances in that contest goodbye.
Well, that explains it.
ThinkProgress had the distinction of getting out in front Thursday night with a post on Bachmann's signing of the pledge, with a headline and blurb that quickly went viral: "BACHMANN PLEDGES TO BAN PORNOGRAPHY."
The very notion of banning pornography apparently inflamed a heck of a lot of left-leaning bloggers - who knew? - evidenced by the slew of outraged commentary that followed.
And it is a grabby banner, isn't it? Problem is, technically, it's not true. The vow does not explicitly call for a ban on pornography. A blogger called Ampersand at Atlas! points out the error:
I'm already seeing this quoted around the blogosphere and on Twitter. But it's wrong.
You can read the full text of the pledge It's full of all sorts of extreme, sexist, homophobic, racist garbage, allegedly for the purpose of protecting marriage. But it doesn't call for a blanket ban on pornography. Here's the relevant passage, in which the candidate vows:
Humane protection of women and the innocent fruit of conjugal intimacy - our next generation of American children - from human trafficking, sexual slavery, seduction into promiscuity, and all forms of pornography and prostitution, infanticide, abortion and other types of coercion or stolen innocence.
A footnote then explains:
Human trafficking, child pornography and prostitution, pimping, sexual slavery and forced abortion are inherently coercive of vulnerable females. Infanticide and abortion are inherently coercive of the babies who are killed.
Unless I've missed something, that's all the document says about pornography.
The "ban" assertion was repeated elsewhere, including at a Washington Post blog. Justin Elliott at Salon was a bit more forgiving when he wrote that the pledge "includes a reference to protecting children from 'all forms of pornography' that could arguably be read as an endorsement of a porn ban."
But Sister Toldja, a self-described "conservative Southern belle" thinks the error is part of trend of irresponsibility and bias in which the "MSM actively inserts itself into the public debate over various hot button issues with emotion-based reporting that routinely ignores or paints in a negative light the other side of a given argument." And she is clearly having none of it:
I know there are people who have issues with Michele Bachmann, primarily due to her stance on social issues like gay marriage and abortion. I understand that and can respect those disagreements. But what I will NOT respect nor tolerate is when mainstream media outlets accept without question the bogus "reporting" done by prominent liberal blogs and websites, which is clearly what has happened here. As a result, their lack of reading the actual document itself and instead relying on a liberal blog whose reputation is questionable at best has poisoned the information stream that Average Joes who do NOT follow politics like you and I do rely on to help them form opinions on both issues and candidates.
This is unacceptable.
Later on at ThinkProgress Alyssa Rosenberg avoids making the "ban" assertion, but thinks Bachmann's signing of a pledge that includes pornography among a list of outright crimes suggests a possible slippery patch on the First Amendment slope:
Equating pornography with human trafficking, prostitution, or infanticide suggests that Bachmann doesn't know very much about any of those things, or much about the sex lives of actual Americans (particularly those she claims to represent). And if Bachmann interpreted that pledge as a mandate to seek a governmental ban of pornography and pornography broadly defined (rather than, you know, folks doing the work to keep kids away from material they don't want them to access), it would be a demonstration of what startlingly low value Bachmann places on the First Amendment. "All forms of pornography" can be interpreted to include a lot of art and popular culture. None of this is surprising, I think, but it's not minor. And it merits pointing out and pushing back against.
But enough pornography: many found much else to fume about in the content of the pledge. Of particular note was this passage, featured at the very top of the document: "Slavery had a disastrous impact on African-American families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an African American baby born after the election of the USA's first African-American President."
This did not escape the attention or wrath of Cheryl Contee, a k a Jill Tubman, at Jack and Jill Politics, who wrote: "Given that families were broken up regularly for sales during slavery and that rape by masters was pretty common, this could not be more offensive. I mean, putting aside the statistics on this, which are likely off-base, I could not be more angry. When will Republicans inquire with actual Black people whether or not we're O.K. with invoking slavery to score cheap political points? It has to stop. It is the opposite of persuasive and is another reason Republicans repel us. It's hard to believe that Michele Bachmann would be foolish enough to sign this pledge."
Tommy Christopher at Mediaite espied devious intent, or at least less than rigorous research, in the direct reference the President Obama:
To be fair, The Marriage Vow doesn't appear to be arguing that slavery was good (hey, they said it was "disastrous"), but rather, that Barack Obama is worse than slavery. That's a key difference that needs to be highlighted. Besides, they used a footnote to a study by black scholars, so shouldn't Jill just relax a little?
For my money, this is where the story gets really disgusting. The study that they cite was published in 2005, which means that any comparison to slavery must be made, not with our first black president, but with our 43rd white one. Furthermore, the data in the study only dates back to 1880, which means they not only had to stretch their pretzel to include Barack Obama, but also to conflate the data with slavery.
Mark Kleiman a The Reality-Based Community singles out the religious angle for questioning:
"Sharia Islam" is an interesting phrase. They're not talking about the imposition of Sharia law through civil legislation: they believe in letting religion dictate public policy, but only fundamentalist Protestantism. The statement seems to imply that there's some form of Islam not involving Sharia and therefore tolerable, but that "Sharia Islam" is a form of "totalitarian control."
Now, Sharia is simply the legal aspect of Islam, as Halacha is the legal aspect of Judaism. Both, of course, are fiercely contested within the two traditions, but there is no more an Islam without Sharia than there is a Judaism without Halacha. So the candidates are being asked to "vow" hostility to an entire faith tradition.
Andrew Belonsky at Towleroad saw danger in a passage in the document's notes asserting that marriage has been debased in part by "anti-scientific bias, in the complete absence of empirical proof, that non-heterosexual inclinations are genetically determined, irresistible and akin to innate traits like race, gender and eye color." Belonsky wrote: "I sincerely hope that the mainstream media takes her to task on this one, because the "choice" debate is one of the most dangerous and incendiary weapons in the right-wing arsenal, and can be used to justify all sorts of discriminatory measures."
But remember, this was supposed to be about marriage and family, of which, the pledge asserts, fidelity is an indispensable part (yes, Dan Savage would beg to differ). To that end, Michelle Goldberg at The Daily Beast points out some possible knotty implications for other Republicans who may be weighing the tactical pros and cons of following Bachmann's lead:
It will be curious to see how other candidates respond. The thrice-wed Newt Gingrich is in a bind - to sign a document pledging "personal fidelity to my spouse" and "[r]espect for the marital bonds of others" would highlight his hypocrisy, but so would not signing. Tim Pawlenty, too, is in a tough spot. He needs to do well in Iowa, but promising such far-reaching intrusion into Americans' private lives probably wouldn't help him in a general election. Among the religious right, combining economic libertarianism with social authoritarianism seems natural, because the movement holds that only a society run according to a strict Christian morality can properly govern itself and avoid the crushing imposition of socialism. To much of the country, though, the idea of defending what the pledge calls our "exceptional and free society" by limiting citizens' freedoms might not make quite as much sense.
There's a lot of anger sloshing about, maybe rightly so, but is there anything funny about this? Well, maybe not, but this post, Sarah Morice-Brubaker, a guest blogger at Religious Dispatches magazine, greets the pledge's emphasis on "robust child-rearing and reproduction" with a sense of humor:
For too long, child-rearing and reproduction has been allowed to be an exhausting, sleep-depriving business-not without its blessings, to be sure, but one could hardly call it "robust." In my own experience, the addition of newborns to our household resulted in a marked decrease of robustness, from which none of the adults have recovered. The children, meanwhile, keep getting robuster and robuster-and that is, quite frankly, bad planning. Granted, the pledge does not spell out how child-rearing will become a robust enterprise, but I can only imagine that it will involve things like long morning constitutionals for all parents; deep breaths of good country air; meals of dark bread from the old country and pints of Guinness; slow knee bends; trips to the seashore, and mineral tonic. This is all to the good, surely.
Finally, Greg Sargent at The Plum Line attempted to put the whole matter in perspective, and issues a warning of sorts: 
Expect lots more of this. The real question is what Bachmann (and Cain, and Santorum) wouldn't sign if asked by social conservatives - and what, if anything, Mitt Romney, or Tim Pawlenty, or Rick Perry would actually oppose as too extreme. The answer appears to be: nothing. It's true that Bachmann is the only one to make this "vow" so far. But it's early yet.
It's probably worth noting that the GOP is far, far, from the mainstream on these issues. It's fairly well known that pluralities have now swung over to approval for same-sex marriage, but that one is still contested, so I wouldn't call Bachmann and friends out of the mainstream on that one. But on the rest well, people seem to support women in combat overwhelmingly, for example. And while I'm not sure how they feel about "intrusively intimate commingling among attracteds," I'm fairly confident that no one is going to run for president on an anti-smut platform in hopes of winning swing voters.
Reminder: we still have months remaining for the candidates to bid against each other for the support of these folks. This is only going to get more extreme - and more crazy.
More crazy, yes. That's a promise.

HEADLINE: Bristol Palin and How Society Establishes Value

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: How much celebrities earn is determined ultimately -- and simply -- by how much society values their contributions, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field.
It is a safe bet that Bristol Palin, not yet 21, will earn this year and next a multiple of the income earned by her son's pediatrician. Anyone who finds this amiss just does not like the verdicts of the free market, which sets those incomes.
Ms. Palin sells her services in a free market, and she purchases her son's health care in a free market, paying directly or through private health insurance. That free market has spoken.
During 2009-10, The Associated Press reports, Ms. Palin was paid $332,500 by Candie's Foundation, a nonprofit group, to appear in videos and print material to help raise awareness on the prevention of teenage pregnancies. According its Web site, the relatively small foundation "works to shape the way youth in America think about teen pregnancy and parenthood." Ms. Palin has appeared on the television show "Dancing with the Stars," signed on for a new television reality show and is said to earn $15,000 to $30,000 for each appearance on the speaking circuit. With the help of Nancy French, Ms. Palin just recently published her memoirs. 
Would anyone be surprised if her income this year and next is three to five times as much as that of a typical pediatrician? Would an economist find anything amiss in such a multiple?
Probably not. The free market, they will argue, appears to judge the value that Ms. Palin adds to American society greater than that added by the typical pediatrician. 
For more than a century, economists have tried to explain such reasoning with their marginal-productivity theory of wages and more recently with a variation of it, human capital theory. 
The basic idea is that in a competitive market, the owner of a resource -- be it hours of labor with a particular skill, or hours of a celebrity's glamour that can be shared with others, or a piece of capital equipment, or a natural resource -- will be paid for it an amount equal to the value that one unit of that resource, added to those already employed, would contribute in the form of valuable output that the rest of society is willing to pay for. 
Economists call this marginal value not because it is trivial, but because it is the value added by one unit of the resource (for example, one year's labor) at the margin of an already existing number of units employed. This theory makes a subtle point not always well understood by non-economists. 
While collectively, members of a profession may add immense total social value to the rest of society, each member's income tends to be determined by the value contributed only by the last unit added to that pool of professionals. 
Economists have long used this theory to explain, for example, why water almost everywhere is so much cheaper by weight or volume than are diamonds, whose utility is much more limited. The total social value that water contributes to human welfare approximates infinity; that contributed by diamonds certainly is finite. It is a matter of supply relative to demand.
Now, while there may be an overall shortage of pediatricians in many parts of this country, there certainly are more pediatricians in America than there are single teenage mothers who happen to be the daughter of Sarah Palin, which ipso facto makes Bristol Palin a celebrity as well. 
A pediatrician does, of course, add high value to each patient, but each pediatrician only to a limited number of them. By contrast, Bristol Palin may add only a bit of joy and excitement to each person who watches or reads her, but it is a very large number of people and that adds up quickly to a high social value, as economists define that term. 
Thus all celebrities, however accomplished, can earn so much more a year than most highly skilled professionals who are in more plentiful supply (or who just do not care to market themselves to the highest bidder for their talent). 
The theory of marginal productivity is taught every year to millions of college students around the world. It naturally fosters the idea that the prevailing distribution of income and wealth in a market economy reflects in rough-and-ready fashion the distribution of the contribution to society that people in different income classes make, where the "social contribution" is measured by willingness to pay for whatever actual contribution people make to society. We hear that doctrine cited regularly on television talk shows.
I suspect that not every reader will find the marginal productivity theory of wages persuasive. I personally believe that it can explain income differentials in many sectors of the economy. But as I have noted in several earlier posts on this blog, I do not believe that the theory can explain the compensation of corporate executives relative to other members of society -- and even less so the variance in compensation levels among executives. 
And I find it impossible to detect the working of the theory in the compensation of financial executives, whose incomes are so dependent on excessive risk-taking and the government for social reinsurance. 
Even Adam Smith appears to have rejected this theory when it comes to physicians. As he put it in Book 1, Chapter 10 of "An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations" (1776): 
We trust our health to the physician; our fortune and sometimes our life and reputation to the lawyer and attorney. Such confidence could not safely be reposed in people of a very mean or low condition. Their reward must be such, therefore, as may give them that rank in society which so important a trust requires. 
When entering a room of people in whom we repose trust, Adam Smith seems to check the supply-and-demand framework at the door.
Finally, there is, of course, a difference between explaining prevailing income differentials and justifying them with an appeal to some theory of justice. The latter is a purely normative exercise that lies outside the economist's professional competence, tempting though it may be for many economists to expound on that issue as well. If they do, they display their personal ethical doctrine, not their competence as social scientists.

HEADLINE: Farewell, Sheila Bair

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was a fierce banking industry watchdog during her five-year tenure that ends today.

 BODY:
Wall Street has a reason to celebrate: Today is Sheila Bair's last day as a regulator. 
Over her five-year tenure as chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Ms. Bair emerged as a fierce banking industry watchdog. Her reign spanned some of the industry's darkest days -- the subprime mortgage crisis, the near collapse of Wall Street and several hundred bank failures that depleted the agency's deposit insurance fund. In the wake of the crisis, Ms. Bair became an unapologetic advocate of financial regulation. 
Along the way, her hard-edged tactics have won her few fans on Wall Street, though she has become a darling of Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike. 
DealBook has taken a look back at some of the best -- or at least most entertaining - moments in her Washington career. 
Cassandra Comes to Washington
As a Treasury Department official in 2002, Ms. Bair was one of the first regulators to sound the alarms that the subprime mortgage market was, to say the least, a little risky. When she became F.D.I.C. chairwoman in 2006, Ms. Bair said she "started hearing that lending standards had deteriorated in subprime. So we started looking into it."
Poor, Vikram
Ms. Bair can be tough. Just ask Vikram Pandit. 
At the height of the financial crisis, Ms. Bair approved a deal for Citigroup to buy Wachovia with some help from taxpayers. But then Wells Fargo stepped in with a better offer. Ms. Bair reversed course, calling Mr. Pandit, Citi's C.E.O., in the middle of the night to deliver the bad news. 
Mr. Pandit protested, according to accounts in "Too Big to Fail," saying the deal was bad for the country. "Well, I can't get in the way of this," she reportedly said. 
Help for Homeowners
That was not her only run-in with Citi. During negotiations about a bailout of the Wall Street giant, she said the F.D.I.C. would approve a rescue plan only if Citigroup was compelled to participate in a foreclosure prevention program. Other regulators criticized her demands. But Ms. Bair, a Republican with a progressive streak, got her way.
"There are some people in the Republican Party who resent the idea of helping others," she told The New York Times shortly after the deal was hammered out. "But the market is broken right now, and unless we intervene, these people and the economy won't be helped." 
One of the Guys
Ms. Bair's role in the bailout negotiations irked some regulatory colleagues, including Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner, then the head of the New York Federal Reserve. 
A New York Times story from late 2008 captured the tiff. 
White House and Treasury officials argue that Mrs. Bair's high-profile campaigning is meant to promote herself while making them look heartless. As a result, they have begun excluding Mrs. Bair from some discussions, though she remains active in conversations where the F.D.I.C.'s support is needed, like the Citigroup rescue. A Treasury official involved in the discussions said that while Mrs. Bair was seen as a valuable part of the team, there was a sense of distrust and a concern that she always seemed to be pushing her own agenda.
Watch Out, WaMu
Where prosecutors have hesitated, the F.D.I.C. has pounced. The agency has sued former executives of big banks that failed during the crisis, including a case filed this week against the former chief executive of IndyMac. In March, the F.D.I.C. sued the former top executives of Washington Mutual - and their wives. 
Parting Shots
Ms. Bair has led the push for new financial regulation. At her final F.D.I.C. board meeting this week, she signed off on a plan to clawback lavish executive bonuses when a bank fails. 
In response to complaints from lobbyists and lawmakers that the rules are too tough, Ms. Bair offered some final words of wisdom: "I see a lot of amnesia setting in now."

HEADLINE: In Coverage of Jobs Report, Misplaced Attention to Horse Race

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Despite the importance of the jobs report as a news story, looking at just one report to analyze the presidential race is like trying to determine what's going on in a baseball game by watching just one at-bat.

 BODY:
The jobs numbers are awful, but they've also provided fodder for some poor political punditry.
I won't name names, since the people in question are normally thoughtful writers. But you can already find an article keyed off the news with the headline "How a one-term president is made." And a political scientist in my Twitter feed wrote of how numbers like these will have Mitt Romney "measuring the drapes" in the White House.
I do not mean to suggest that the unemployment numbers are unimportant as a news story. To the contrary, recent polls find that four times as many people list jobs rather than the budget deficit as a top priority, even though the latter issue has gotten more press attention lately.
But if you're going to write about the jobs numbers as a horse race story, you ought to do it right, and that means keeping an eye on the big picture.
In fact, looked at in the most literal way -- how much President Obama's re-election chances changed between 8:29 a.m. today and 8:30 a.m., when the numbers were released -- the impact is probably quite minor. At the betting market Intrade, the contract on Mr. Obama's 2012 chances has declined in value only barely, to implying a 57.9 percent chance of re-election from a 58.4 percent chance before the jobs numbers were published.
This was a terrible jobs report -- there were no silver linings. But it's still just one report, and there will be 16 more of them before Mr. Obama faces the voters. The unemployment rate, moreover, historically has a very weak correlation with an incumbent president's re-election performance. Certainly, that does not mean you should ignore it -- but it should be looked at along with other data that gets less attention, like reports on G.D.P. and disposable income and consumer confidence and the inflation rate, each of which have historically had more predictive power.
The employment report is also considered only a moderately important predictor of future economic data, because it can be more of a lagging than a leading indicator. If you're in the business of trying to predict what the economy will look like in November 2012, you should pay at least as much attention to relatively obscure pieces of data like building permits and manufacturing orders. Or take a shortcut by looking at what people who issue forecasts of macroeconomic performance are thinking.
You should also be paying attention to other employment-related data like the initial unemployment claims report that is released weekly, as well as to jobs reports put out by private agencies. Some of those reports had seemed promising in the last week or two, which is why some economists were expecting a better number from the government. A report by ADP Employer Services, for instance, thinks that private companies added 157,000 jobs in June rather than 57,000, as the government's statistic suggests. It's not uncommon for these numbers to diverge, since there is a fair amount of measurement error in coming up with any estimate of job creation (most of the reports are based on surveys of one kind or another). But there's not usually any immediate way to know which number is right and which is the outlier.
Not that all of the economic news has been good. Most of it hasn't been: there have been more negative than positive "surprises" lately. The recovery is in some doubt, and many economists have been busy revising downward their forecasts for future quarters. Nevertheless, looking at just one economic report is like trying to determine what's going on in a baseball game by watching just one at-bat.

HEADLINE: Bristol Palin and How Society Establishes Value

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: How much celebrities earn is determined ultimately -- and simply -- by how much society values their contributions, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field.
It is a safe bet that Bristol Palin, not yet 21, will earn this year and next a multiple of the income earned by her son's pediatrician. Anyone who finds this amiss just does not like the verdicts of the free market, which sets those incomes.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Far Apart

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: There's no budget agreement yet, but the president is optimistic it will happen. 

 BODY:
From Today's Times:
 Lawmakers are still "far apart" on how to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt, President Obama said Thursday after convening negotiations at the White House. But officials say Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders agree on the need for big savings and a speedy consensus, The Times's Mark Landler and Carl Hulse report, and the president expressed optimism that they could achieve both. Enduring a rhetorical beating from Democrats lately as they try to convince Republicans to support ending tax cuts for the rich, corporate jet owners have decided not to take it sitting down. A small but mighty band of owners and manufacturers are fighting back against the politicians they feel are "vilifying" them, The Times's Eric Lichtblau reports. Will the first in be the first out? Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty is fighting to stay in an unpredictable race as he plays by the rules, and the coming Iowa Straw Poll will be telling of his future, The Times's Jeff Zeleny reports. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, became the first American official to accuse Pakistan publicly of involvement in the death of a Pakistani journalist, further poisoning an already tense relationship between the country and the United States. The Times's Elisabeth Bumiller reports Admiral Mullen said he believes the government "sanctioned" the torture and killing of the journalist, who wrote damaging articles about the infiltration of Islamic militants into Pakistan's security forces.Around the Web:
 Mr. Obama's senior political adviser David Plouffe said the 2012 presidential race won't be won or lost on the unemployment rate, The Hill reports.Washington Happenings: It's about that time again - the Labor Department has June's employment numbers on Friday. Hiring slowed abruptly in May, raising concerns about the progress of the economic recovery. A House Ways and Means subcommittee takes a look at Social Security on Friday, examining its current costs and considering proposed changes. After meeting with Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, at the White House on Friday, Mr. Obama will give interviews about reducing the deficit to a handful of television stations from Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Seattle and Raleigh, N.C. Can't make it to Florida to see Atlantis blast off?

HEADLINE: Debt Deal Could Rewrite 2012 Political Calculus

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A grand bargain that plays to the political center could reset the electoral playing field. 

 BODY:
Are the far right and far left in Washington about to be thrown under the bus?
The assumption for months has been that Democrats would play to their base during the 2012 election cycle, using the specter of tax cuts for the rich and Medicare cuts to rally liberals behind President Obama and Democratic candidates.
On the right, it seemed certain that Republican presidential hopefuls and Congressional candidates would pander to the Tea Party wing of their party with demands for ever greater spending cuts and "read my lips" declarations when it comes to the idea of higher taxes. But what if Mr. Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner turn that political calculation on its head? 
Negotiations over the nation's deficit and debt suggest that both men are looking beyond the wishes of their most ardent supporters toward the larger, more moderate parts of the electorate. What could emerge in the next few days is a package that infuriates the right by raising the debt ceiling, disappoints the left by cutting Medicare, and gets passed largely by politicians who are willing to compromise.
"By achieving a grand bargain in which both sides have to give substantially, you reset the entire electoral playing field," said Jon Cowan, a Democratic strategist and former official in Bill Clinton's administration.
Mr. Obama has signaled a willingness to consider cuts to the entitlement programs that are sacrosanct among his most liberal supporters. And after a secret weekend meeting with the president, Mr. Boehner indicated an openness to as much as $1 trillion in new revenue.
It remains unclear whether such a bargain will be reached, and those positions could still crumble under pressure from the right and the left. But if they result in the kind of historic deficit-reduction deal that both leaders have said they want, it could dramatically rewrite the poltical calculus in Congress, on the Republican primary trail and for the 2012 general election next year.
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters Thursday that partisans on both sides should be "willing to move off of their desired position, their perfect outcome, and accept a less-than-perfect outcome because it will result in a bigger deal."
He added that "Americans, I think, overwhelmingly expect Washington to work for them and they're more concerned about that then they are about the specific issues that animate different constituencies and the two parties."
How could this new dynamic play out over the days a weeks to come? 
In the Congress, a deal like the one being talked about in Washington would almost certainly be rejected by many Tea Party lawmakers on the right and progressives on the left. Mr. Boehner would be forced to assemble a coalition of his more establishment Republicans along with moderate Democrats.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader in the House, warned on CNBC Thursday morning: "We're not for raising taxes. If there is a proposal to increase revenues outside of the potential we can increase them for more economic growth, I'm not for that."
And similar skepticism will surely come from the left. Representative Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, told Bloomberg that "there is a zero appetite in the Democratic caucus for looking at entitlement programs unless there is substantial revenue on the table."
In the Senate, where a bipartisan handful of lawmakers has already been working toward a compromise, the deal might be easier to sell to both sides. But it is also easier for one senator - from the left or the right - to hold things up if he or she objects.
Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat who has been part of the bipartisan talks, wrote on Thursday in The Washington Post that "we are waiting for politicians to quit drawing lines in the sand and admit that solving this gigantic problem in a time of divided government means that both sides will have to give ground."
On the Republican campaign trail, a grand compromise between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner would instantly become the defining issue of the campaign and would force difficult decisions on those running for the party's presidential nomination.
Each of them would have to choose sides - either endorse the deal, and risk alienating the Tea Party movement that has energized voters, or come out against it and put themselves in opposition to their party leadership in Washington (a choice which Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, found to be troublesome earlier this year).
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has already given her answer. In a new television ad set to run in Iowa, Ms. Bachmann said that she "will not vote to raise the debt ceiling." It's almost impossible to imagine her reversing that position if a deal is cut to do just that.
For the other Republican candidates, though, it might be a tougher decision. Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, portrays himself as the candidate of fiscal honesty and experience. It might be difficult for him to oppose a deal that his party leaders say will help solve the country's fiscal woes for decades.
Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, has campaigned as more of a moderate, so he might embrace a deal. But Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, has tried to seize the mantle of the Tea Party and might be tempted to use opposition to the deal as a rallying cry in Iowa.
In the end, the deal would almost certainly become the central opportunity for the candidates to distinguish themselves from one another. The next debate, on Aug. 11 in Iowa, might offer each of them a chance to explain his or her choice.
 The impact of a deal on the general election is more difficult to predict.
Mr. Cowan argued in an interview Thursday that a bargain like the one being envisioned could substantially help Mr. Obama get reelected by helping him make good on one of the fundamental promises he made during the 2008 campaign: that he would reject partisanship and work to get things done.
"Dealing with that would be the right thing to do and would be a substantial part of his legacy," Mr. Cowan said.
A grand deal would be a big gamble for Mr. Boehner. He could potentially inflame enough anger in the right wing of his caucus to face a challenge to his speakership. But, as Mr. Cowan said, he could also gain ownership of an historic reduction in the size and scope of government spending, while potentially winning lower tax rates for his party's business and corporate base.
"He gets to go to the Republican establishment and say, 'I am a big, bold, gutsy leader,'" Mr. Cowan said. "This is bigger than anything that Ronald Reagan did."

HEADLINE: Ethanol Industry Greets Compromise

BYLINE: CLIFFORD KRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: Even with ethanol subsidies cut, a consensus has arisen in Washington that as long as there is a renewable fuels standard that mandates the use of increasing amounts of biofuels, ethanol can prosper. 

 BODY:
Any other year, the ethanol industry would have declared a defeat, not a victory.
As I mention in Friday's Times, three senators -- one an ethanol opponent and the other two supporters -- came up with a grand compromise on Thursday that would end the $6 billion in annual tax credits that go to blenders of ethanol in gasoline and a tariff designed to keep Brazilian ethanol out of the United States. 
The deal would direct $1.33 billion of that unspent money toward lowering the federal budget deficit and $668 million to various subsidies to help develop advanced biofuels and promote the installation of pumps at gas stations that would offer drivers higher concentrations of ethanol.
 Ethanol executives and lobbyists praised the deal, which was brokered by Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, who are ethanol supporters, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, an ethanol foe. That's because the industry saw the writing on the wall last month, when the Senate passed an amendment to cut corn ethanol subsidies in a 73-27 vote. 
In Washington's highly polarized environment, that kind of lopsided tally usually involves honoring Abraham Lincoln or celebrating Mother's Day. But these days, the budget deficit trumps helping ethanol, even with presidential candidates already competing in Iowa. The agreement is not guaranteed to make it through Congress or to be adopted by administration and Congressional negotiators working on a budget deficit and debt deal. But there was no doubt that the ethanol industry favors it. "We don't care what train it's on," said Tom Buis, the chief executive of Growth Energy, an ethanol lobbying group, although he conceded it was "not perfect reform."
 A consensus has arisen in Washington -- one accepted by the ethanol industry -- that as long as there is a renewable fuels standard that mandates the use of increasing amounts of biofuels, ethanol can prosper. Ethanol is cheaper than gasoline in most markets, making it attractive to blenders even without the tax goodies. 
And Brazil does not have much extra sugar ethanol to export at the moment; in fact, it is importing corn ethanol from the United States to meet its needs. Perhaps corn ethanol is finally a victim of its own success.

HEADLINE: Lost Jobs, Lost Flights

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
The airlines' deep cutbacks in flights over the last three years have fallen unevenly across the country, largely sparing the nation's biggest airports but hitting midsize airports the hardest.
In the last five years, a review of government statistics shows, air service most often dropped at midsize airports and cities where jobs disappeared or housing prices collapsed. Las Vegas, Phoenix and Detroit, for instance, all lost flights in the 12 months that ended in March.
But traffic has risen at airports where the regional economies have fared better -- Denver, San Francisco and Charlotte, N.C., among them.
As a result, the cutbacks are redrawing the nation's air service map to reflect the industry's new priorities and changed economics. As recently as a decade ago, the airlines put a premium on growth, competed on every possible route and sought to connect to even the farthest outposts. Now, they are emphasizing fiscal discipline, which means paring back service to many cities and forgoing unprofitable destinations altogether as higher fuel prices weigh on their bottom line. 
''The airlines are shrinking and putting a premium on their core network,'' said Jeffrey Breen, the founder and president of Cambridge Aviation Research, a consulting firm. ''The bottom states have suffered most and have not kept up with the growth in the most robust airports in the country.''
Data collected by the Airports Council International, a trade group, found that the nation's smallest airports lost 10 to 15 percent of their scheduled flights from June 2006 through this June. Medium-size airports, meanwhile, lost 18 percent of their scheduled flights. But the biggest airports fared relatively better; their traffic dropped by only 2.3 percent over that same five-year period.
The top 50 airports now represent more than 80 percent of all passenger departures, while the 200 smallest airports account for less than 3 percent of passengers.
''How much air service do we really need in Kalamazoo, Mich., or Terre Haute, Ind., where manufacturing was once important?'' asked William S. Swelbar, an industry expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Do we really need airports there today? Sick economies and high fuel are not going to attract airlines.''
And because fuel prices remain high, the airlines may accelerate their cuts in capacity by the end of the year once the busy summer travel period ends. In the five months through May, the latest period with available figures, 295 of 500 airports in the nation had fewer flights than in the same period last year. In 2010, 315 airports reported fewer flights than the previous year, compared with 414 in 2009.
Nearly 200 airports, most of them tiny and many in remote places, have lost air service entirely since 2008.
''Airlines have made a deliberate decision to forgo certain markets,'' said Sunil Harman, who was recently appointed aviation director of the Tallahassee Regional Airport after 17 years as the director of planning for Miami International Airport. ''Their new business model is leaving communities disenfranchised and disconnected from the global marketplace.''
Spencer Dickerson, the senior executive vice president of the American Association of Airport Executives, said airline cutbacks were a major challenge. ''But in the end, the bottom line is the marketplace,'' he said. ''If the passengers aren't there, it's really hard for the airlines to justify the service.''
Smaller airports may continue to lose service in coming years, while the biggest hubs will become more crowded. The Federal Aviation Administration expects 550 million more passengers to be flying in 2031 than in 2010. It expects the biggest growth will be in the nation's top hubs.
While there are some broad trends behind the cuts in air service, there are also a variety of explanations of why some airports experienced deeper cuts than others. Although Delta Air Lines continues to use Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport as a hub, departures dropped, falling to 200 flights a day in June from a peak of 670 five years ago. The airport now serves 55 cities, down from over 130, and has only one international destination, Paris.
Businesses based in the region, including Procter & Gamble and Toyota North America's manufacturing operations, have felt the pinch. ''It's harder to get a seat on a flight,'' said Ellen van der Horst, president of Cincinnati's chamber of commerce.
The mergers among airlines in recent years have also contributed to the cutbacks. The drop in traffic in Cincinnati, for instance, came as Delta decided to focus on Detroit after its merger with Northwest Airlines.
Similarly, St. Louis suffered a major blow when American Airlines decided to shut down a hub operation it inherited when it bought the assets of T.W.A. Like most of the network carriers, American Airlines has decided to focus on its biggest hubs -- including Dallas/Forth Worth and Miami International.
''The public takes air service for granted, but with the mergers, there aren't that many airlines anymore, and there are fewer hubs,'' said Justin Meyer, the manager of air service development for the Kansas City Aviation Department. ''Just because you have a runway doesn't mean you deserve service.''
That means airports must compete more fiercely than ever for service, Mr. Meyer said, and must be willing to offer incentives to the airlines, including lower gate or landing fees.
Roger Cohen, who heads the Regional Airline Association, said airports should offer carriers a compelling reason to fly into their communities. ''It's like dating, where attitude is everything,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''You want to show you're interested in the relationship.''
Two years ago, the Port of Portland, Ore., which operates Portland International Airport, joined with local businesses to commit $5 million to offset losses that Delta might have on its flights to Tokyo so it would keep flying that route.
The financial help through the winter of 2009 persuaded Delta not to cancel the flight, said David Zielke, the general manager for air service development. Such international connections bring in about $100 million a year in economic investments to Portland businesses, he said.
The expansion of low-cost airlines has also hurt some airports, because the lower fares often make it worthwhile for passengers to drive longer distances. Since 1990, four of the top five airports with the biggest gains in traffic, including Baltimore/Washington, Salt Lake City and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., are served by low-cost airlines, according to Mr. Swelbar of M.I.T.
Smaller airports may also fall victim to the phasing out of regional airplanes, like the MD-80s, which many airlines are grounding or permanently phasing out. These smaller jets, for which there are no current replacements, cannot pay for themselves when fuel prices are high because they have too few seats to be profitable.
''The regional 50-seat aircraft is on everyone's deathwatch,'' said Mr. Breen, of Cambridge Aviation Research. ''We've reached a point where some types of aircraft that used to provide good service to smaller communities aren't economically viable anymore.'' One of those communities was Oxnard, whose small airport halfway between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, Calif., became a victim of the cutbacks last year when United Express discontinued service to the airport.
''Our selling point was that traffic from here to L.A.X. is horrible,'' said Jorge Rubio, the airport's manager. Now, residents of Ventura County face a grueling two-hour drive through traffic, instead of a 20-minute plane ride, to get to the Los Angeles airport.
Correction: July 19, 2011, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on July 9 about air service cutbacks at midsize airports and cities hit hard by the recession referred incorrectly to Delta Air Lines' operations at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Delta continues to use the airport as a hub; it did not shut down the hub in 2009.

HEADLINE: 3, 2, 1, and the Last Shuttle Leaves an Era Behind

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- There was a time, some of us remember, when a countdown at Canaveral stopped the world in its tracks. On television or at the launching, every breath was held at liftoff and every eye followed the fiery plume of ascent, up and away. Godspeed, said someone who was everyone.
That was a half century ago, when men first squeezed into their machines and, defying gravity, rode into a new dimension of human experience. Unbound to Earth, our species could imagine that an age of spacefaring was truly under way, the Moon and Mars within reach, maybe even an asteroid where the Little Prince awaited our visit. The promised new reality legitimized fantasies.
The atmosphere here on Friday at the launching of the space shuttleAtlantis was, in some respects, reminiscent of the old days. The crowd was the largest in years, attracted by the last chance for no telling how long to see astronauts in this country leave for space. 
Everything was class-reunion festive. The gray-hairs recharged memories from youth. Their grandchildren trooped along to see what had turned people on when there were just a few channels of black-and-white TV and the only telephone in the house was at the end of a cord -- and the only ones twittering were sparrows.
As rain clouds hovered ominously and the countdown began to the 135th departure in the 30-year-old shuttle program, the milling crowd grew still and anxious. There was concern for the four lives in the winged space plane, of course, and all eyes searched for the break in the clouds that finally came. But this time, more than ever, spectators and others who care about NASA worried for nothing less than the future of human spaceflight in the United States.
''We've come full circle since 1961, back to when we had yet to show we could launch people into space,'' said Steven J. Dick, a retired NASA chief historian. ''We will be hitching rides from the Russians to go to the space station that is mainly ours.''
The irony of having to send our astronauts up in Russian Soyuz capsules is as plain as cold war history. The Soviet Union's early dominance of space, manifested by the Sputnik surprise in 1957 and subsequent feats, prompted the United States to match and then surpass the Soviets in a program topped off by the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969. Human spaceflight would have come along anyway, but not with quite the urgency of the Soviet-American competition.
Foreseeing the end of shuttle flights, the Obama administration and NASA last year proposed new plans, approved by Congress, to develop heavy-lift rockets for sending people deeper into space, to be ready perhaps after 2020. Meanwhile, NASA has begun financing research for intermediate crew-only spacecraft to be produced and launched by commercial companies, probably no sooner than 2016. Such plans, of course, are at the mercy of the budget cutting and government downsizing spreading in Washington.
Lori B. Garver, the deputy administrator of NASA, insisted this week that the future was bright for human spaceflight. ''We are tapping into how we developed almost everything great in this country, through commercial enterprise and competition,'' Ms. Garver said.
Other NASA officials noted that Congressional support for the new programs was bipartisan. But they acknowledged that budget cuts were possible, and would ultimately take a toll on launching capabilities.
John M. Logsdon, a space policy expert and the author of ''John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon,'' said there had been gaps in human flight before, especially after Apollo flights ended in 1975 and the first shuttles flew in 1981. ''We can accept that as long as a replacement is in the pipeline,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''But we are ending programs with no sure follow-ons.''
Dr. Dick, the historian, questioned whether the barely started new programs would be ready to boost this country's astronauts into orbit in this decade. ''We're stuck in the short term, can't rouse ourselves to do much that's inspiring,'' he said.
Whatever happened to the space age as imagined back in the 1950s and early '60s, when science fiction writers and rocket scientists spun tales of travel out in the solar system and beyond? Propellants, oxygen and other good stuff never seemed limited, or radiation a risk, or Congressional budgets a curse. This alternate universe appealed to some in a society flush with confidence after winning the Second World War but feeling a bit confined in the postwar gray-flannel conformity. Americans seemed to have lost none of their can-do spirit.
No one disputes that the space age is here to stay. Think of how much our day-to-day lives depend on the herds of satellites occupying orbital space, the world community's commons. They are integral to communications, social media, business transactions, military operations and surveillance, surveys for charting world resources and climate and the G.P.S. devices that help us keep track of ourselves and others. As an inspiring bonus, other robotic instruments have extended human curiosity to the very edge of the solar system and out to the galaxies, close to cosmic beginnings.
This does not assuage the lingering disappointment of some of those who grew up with the space age, the countdowns, the Moon walks, the unpiloted encounters with other planetary worlds and the touchdowns on the russet plains of Mars. For various reasons, the spread of no-can-do limits has swept aside the optimism with which Americans met the initial challenges of the space age.
The Apollo lunar-landing successes, restoring national pride and asserting pre-eminence in space technology, reduced the immediate geopolitical pressures driving human space efforts. The Nixon administration rejected NASA's post-Apollo plans for permanent Moon bases, orbiting space stations and flights to Mars. Flying reusable space shuttles was NASA's consolation prize.
Although the vehicles had their triumphs servicing the Hubble Space Telescope and assembling the International Space Station, they never came close to living up to the extravagant promise to make spaceflight more efficient and economical, approaching the reliability of aviation. The Challenger and Columbia disasters set back the program, which never approached an early objective to fly every few weeks at a cost of only $7 million (it was more like $1.5 billion a mission).
The shuttles consigned American astronauts to low orbits, going round and round, unable to strike out to distant destinations. Spaceflight dropped off the front pages -- though on Saturday, all will report the successful launching of the Atlantis, at 11:29 a.m. Eastern time Friday, two and a half minutes behind schedule.
Studies of the effects of long-duration space travel by Russian and American scientists have introduced cautionary notes tempering the early enthusiasm for astronaut trips to Mars lasting several years. M. G. Lord , the author of a memoir, ''Astro Turf,'' on growing up in the aerospace culture in California, suggested that these findings contributed to a growing awareness that our bodies are far more fragile than science fiction writers thought when they concocted wide-ranging colonization scenarios.
''These days my pet fantasy for exploring the universe has to do with downloading human consciousness to machines -- silicon is more resilient than flesh,'' Ms. Lord said, her imagination by no means grounded.
Fifty-one years after the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, the Boeing 707 was rolled out as the first commercially successful jet airliner, as Howard E. McCurdy, a historian at American University and author of ''Space and the American Imagination,'' pointed out the other day. He was acknowledging that aviation offered no guidance for how space travel was likely to unfold.
The optimistic Dr. McCurdy noted that private entrepreneurs continued to invest in space technology and transport systems and that ''other nations clamor to join the spacefaring club.'' The persistence of this vision in the face of adversity, he said, suggests that space travel reflects ''an elemental need.''
After Atlantis lifted off on Friday, NASA replayed photography of the ignition and ascent over and over, from all angles, as if to hold on a little longer to this last parting of a space vehicle whose time had passed.
Other images, of the vapors drifting away and exposing the now-empty Launching Pad 39-A, evoked the sadness and uncertainty of what is left behind at the end of an era.

HEADLINE: Some Companies Want Gays To Wed to Get Health Benefits

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Now that same-sex marriage has been legalized in New York, at least a few large companies are requiring their employees to tie the knot if they want their partners to qualify for health insurance.
Corning, I.B.M. and Raytheon all provide domestic partner benefits to employees with same-sex partners in states where they cannot marry. But now that they can legally wed in New York, five other states and the District of Columbia, they will be required to do so if they want their partner to be covered for a routine checkup or a root canal.
On the surface, this appears to put the couples on an even footing with heterosexual married couples. After all, this is precisely what they have been fighting for: being treated as a spouse. But some gay and lesbian advocates are arguing that the change may have come too soon: some couples may face complications, since their unions are not recognized by the federal government. 
''Even with the complications, many people will want to get married for the reasons people want to get married,'' said Ross D. Levi, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda. ''But from our perspective, to hinge something as important as insurance for your family to what is still a complicated legal matter for same-sex couples doesn't seem to be a fair thing to do.''
He said that there were a variety of reasons -- legal, financial and personal -- that companies should keep the domestic partnership option at least until gay marriage was recognized at the federal level. Legally speaking, getting married could create immigration issues or it could potentially muddy the process of adopting a child. In some instances, he added, an employee may work in a gay marriage state but live in a neighboring state that does not recognize the marriage. The couple may want to wait to marry until they can be legally wed in their home state.
''There are certainly reasons why a couple may not wish to marry,'' added Camilla Taylor, marriage project director at Lambda Legal. ''People with certain immigration statuses might want to think very carefully before getting married. There are some types of visas that are meant to be temporary, and if you get married to someone who is a citizen, it could flag your renewal application and reflect your more permanent decision to stay.''
When it comes to adopting a child, couples may run into trouble if they are trying to adopt from a place that restricts same-sex married couples from adopting. Having one parent adopt while still single may be easier. ''If you want to be able to answer honestly in paperwork, multiple interviews and background checks, then you won't want to get married,'' Ms. Taylor said, adding that many foreign countries ban adoptions to same-sex couples.
Marrying could also have serious implications for couples who relocate to a nonmarriage state, and ultimately decide to split up. Getting a divorce can be complicated, since one member of a couple may have to return to the gay marriage state and live there before their split can be completed.
The employers making the changes said they spoke regularly with their gay and lesbian employee groups and planned to phase in the requirement. Corning, based in Corning, N.Y., said it would offer a reasonable grace period, though it had not completed the details.
''After waiting so much time for that right, we want them to have the opportunity to enjoy that,'' said Christy Pambianchi, a senior vice president for human resources at Corning, which put the policy into effect in New Hampshire and Massachusetts when gay marriage became legal there. She said employees did not raise concerns about the requirement. ''They are delighted,'' she said.
Raytheon, based in Waltham, Mass. -- another state where gay marriage is legal -- said it would give employees several months to comply with its marriage requirement. Like Corning and I.B.M., the company said domestic partner benefits would remain in states where couples cannot marry (Raytheon also has an exemption for active members of the military, so they are covered for benefits without having to marry. Getting married violates the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which is being phased out).
I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y., said its workers would have up to a year to get married to maintain their current benefits.
At least for now, these companies seem to be in the minority, though it is unclear whether more employers will follow their lead. Eastman Kodak, based in Rochester, said it would continue to offer domestic partner coverage to both same-sex and opposite-sex partners.
''My impression is that there has been lots of discussion about dropping domestic partner coverage when marriage is first opened up to same-sex couples, but very few employers actually end up taking this step,'' said Jennifer C. Pizer, legal director at the Williams Institute, which studies sexual orientation law and policy issues. ''Some employers initially believe that it is fairer of them to impose the same marriage requirements on all employees, regardless of sexual orientation. But then employees and others explain that employees with a same-sex life partner remain in difficult circumstances due to the continuing federal discrimination.''
Whether same-sex couples marry, they will still be responsible for paying federal income taxes on the value of their partner or spouse's benefits since they are not recognized by the federal government as an economic unit, unless the person covered is considered a dependent. Couples will not owe those taxes at the state level in places like New York that recognize gay marriage.
But it should become easier for gay employees who marry and live in New York to obtain insurance for their spouses. (There are an estimated 42,000 same-sex couples in New York, according to the Williams Institute.) Not only are the same-sex spouses of state workers eligible for spousal coverage, but the same goes for many people who work for private employers.
There could be some exceptions, however. Employers who do not contract with an insurance company but instead pay for health benefits out of their own assets -- so-called self-insured plans -- are not subject to the state's insurance laws but are governed by federal law.
Most large employers have self-insured plans, said Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, a membership organization that focuses on health policies for large employers. That means they can choose to cover same-sex employees, but they do not have to. While virtually all large company plans cover legal spouses, she added, some companies offer domestic partner benefits only to gay employees who do not have the option to marry. (Some companies also extend the benefits to heterosexual unmarried couples.)
''I am getting a lot of questions about what other employers are doing,'' Ms. Darling said. ''I see a movement coming where marriage will be a factor where marriage is possible.''

HEADLINE: It's Hard Out Here for a Reality-Show Celebrity

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA

 BODY:
As goes the economy, so goes the reality-television gravy train. Once it was possible to swan from one show to the next, start a rumble or two, collect a check, then repeat. Shows that collect second-generation D-listers -- like ''Famous Food,'' which begins Sunday on VH1 -- serve as after-care facilities for reality veterans, made on the principle that no reality star, once filmed, should go unfilmed.
But it's not like it used to be. Like most Americans, these celebrities now have to work harder, for less. ''Famous Food'' throws seven of them together for a month of actual work to open, from scratch, a restaurant on the Sunset Strip, with the winner to be given an ownership share. 
It's a prize earned through sweat equity, both in physical labor and in replaying personal highlight reels of earlier infamy. As these things go, ''Famous Food'' has an all-star team of misbehaviorists.
There's the ace yeller Danielle Staub, late of ''The Real Housewives of New Jersey,'' who does her best to ingratiate herself with a giant of the genre, the former ''Hills'' tragic villain Heidi Montag, here on her first extended TV outing without her husband, Spencer Pratt, and looking softer than she did in her Jocelyn Wildenstein-esque postsurgery period.
Ms. Staub knows which direction to climb and who to step on. She finds a willing antagonist in Vincent Pastore (''The Sopranos''), who holds forth on the conqueror Hannibal and gender relations in the Italian-American community. Meanwhile, especially grateful for the cameras are Juicy J and DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia, who ''still got the longest Oscar party going on right now,'' Juicy J says, referring to the bizarro five years since the group won a best-song Academy Award for ''It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp.''
The masterstroke is the inclusion of Ashley Dupre, of the Spitzer Dupres, finally accepting her reality-television birthright -- which is a step up from her former role as tabloid and cable news scourge.
For Ms. Dupre, ''Famous Food'' is a personal-makeover show, and compared with the seasoned barkers around her, she's reasonable and guileless. The only participant meeker is Jake Pavelka, the 14th ''Bachelor,'' wearing what appears to be the widest pointy-collared shirt available at his local Nordstrom. He's a babe among wolves, who doesn't wish to say the wrong thing or, more specifically, who understands that all things one could say are the wrong thing.
Quiet and cowed will not win this show, of course, especially since the real prize isn't the restaurant share -- at least two of the stars describe themselves as foodies, though no one reveals a Chowhound message-board handle. The goal is to be noticed enough to be invited to the next show. (If the restaurant doesn't open, no one wins.)
It's bumbling from the start. As a group, they propose naming the restaurant Fame, which no famous person would do. Mr. Pastore invites Richie Palmer, his erstwhile partner in the nightclub business, who arrives in all black, shirt tucked and half-buttoned, and skin ''orange,'' as Juicy J shouts. Mr. Palmer promises low-cost labor, and pulls off a hand kiss on Ms. Dupre so ornate it should have its own YouTube tutorial.
''Famous Food'' isn't much more than a huge advertisement for the Dolce Group, a Los Angeles consortium specializing in what might be called fine megamall dining, represented here by two of its partners, Lonnie Moore and Mike Malin.
They know their employee pool well: Mr. Malin is a smarmy veteran of the ''Big Brother'' franchise, and Mr. Moore was an especially loathsome participant on ''The Millionaire Matchmaker.''
But what these two lacked in small-screen appeal as protagonists, they have amply as managers. They appear to want to spend as little time as possible with their charges, lest they accidentally gift them with a worthy idea that would derail the sideshow. They come in and pass judgment, escapees in charge of convicts, before retreating to their more lucrative lives, far from the cameras.

HEADLINE: European Commission Explores Passage of a Consumer Rights Bill

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- In Austria, consumers can demand repairs, but not exchanges or refunds, when they receive a defective product. If a factory fire or strike in France delays delivery of a purchase by weeks or even months, some consumers must simply wait. They have no legal right to cancel the purchase.
When it comes to what is called contract law in the European Union, the single market is actually a patchwork of 27 national legal codes offering varying degrees of protection to consumers and merchants. Those differences, and the costs of overcoming them, have limited cross-border trade primarily to multinational companies with the legal staffs to negotiate the maze. 
This autumn, the European Commission is expected to propose creating a single European Union contract law that consumers and merchants can use to supersede national laws, in some cases offering better terms and more protection.
The author of the proposal, Viviane Reding, the commissioner for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship, said the alternative -- and optional -- legal regime would encourage cross-border purchases. Currently, only 7 percent of European consumers make purchases across borders.
That is usually because consumers are uncertain of their rights under foreign contract laws, or because many small and midsize businesses, wary of the costs of adapting their sales contracts to several national legal regimes, refuse to serve foreign markets, she said.
''We need to do something to give consumers more purchase options, and to give merchants greater access to more markets,'' Mrs. Reding, a conservative from Luxembourg, said in an interview. ''An optional E.U. contract law would have the effect of opening up the single market, giving traders and consumers the opportunity to transact in a secure environment.''
Mrs. Reding led the drive in 2007 to cap mobile phone roaming charges for consumers across the European Union. She said the new initiative was modeled in part on the Uniform Commercial Code used in the United States, the set of common rules that were initially published in 1952 and later adopted, with various amendments, by a majority of states in the 1960s.
Mrs. Reding said she developed the idea for the European proposal in part after consulting with experts at the American Law Institute in Philadelphia. ''We could learn a lot from America about how to utilize and develop a single market,'' she said.
But in Europe the proposal, which Mrs. Reding plans to present in October to the European Parliament and Council of Ministers, faces opposition from some lawmakers who question whether a new legal framework will cost more than it is worth. Associations representing contract lawyers and national consumer rights groups, whose livelihoods depend in part on advising on how to navigate the fragmented status quo, also say they are skeptical.
But the proposal gained momentum in May in a public consultation that attracted comments from 500 companies, governments and interest groups. Small-business groups, like the Federation of Small Businesses in Britain, spoke out in favor of the change, which they said would lower the costs of doing business and open new markets for small companies.
Mrs. Reding would need a majority of the Council of Ministers and the Parliament for the law to be enacted. If approved, it would be up to merchants to decide whether to offer it to consumers.
On June 8, the European Parliament, in a nonbinding vote, endorsed the concept. On July 7, the presidents of the 27 national supreme courts in the European Union sent a letter to Mrs. Reding in support of the approach. So did a German lawyers' group and the multinational companies Audi, eBay and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.
''The single market in Europe has been in place for many years, but only big businesses have been able to benefit, not small businesses, because they have the resources and legal staffs to navigate the fragmented landscape,'' said Andrew Cave, a spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, which represents more than 200,000 British companies. ''This would allow small businesses for the first time to take advantage of the E.U. single market.''
But even in Britain, one of the largest European exporters, the plan remains controversial. Mr. Cave said Britain's conservative-liberal government coalition, along with governments in Denmark and the Czech Republic, criticized the proposal during the commission's public consultation. Opposition in Britain, Mr. Cave said, is being led by the main lawyer's group, the Law Society, and the Confederation of British Industry, which represents large businesses.
Discussions to resolve the impasse are taking place with the government and relevant interest groups behind the scenes, Mr. Cave said. A spokeswoman for the Law Society and the Confederation of British Industry said the group was still soliciting its members to take a position on the issue.
''We are hopeful that we will be able to convince the government of the benefits of this proposal to British small businesses and exporters,'' Mr. Cave said.
Malcolm Harbour, the chairman of the European Parliament Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, one of several parliamentary panels that will consider the legislation this autumn, said he was skeptical the proposal would achieve its intended effect.
''My overall view about this is I am not sure that the cost-benefits of what are required to put this into effect are worth it,'' said Mr. Harbour, a representative from Woking, England.
Mrs. Reding said her staff was preparing the details of the proposal, which would emphasize the voluntary nature of the regime and its benefits. All European Union consumers, for example, would gain the right to refunds and exchanges, not just repairs, in the case of defective merchandise, and also the right to cancel contracts when merchants did not deliver on time, among other things.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 15, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about efforts by the European Union to unify laws on consumer protection misstated the history of the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States. The model code was initially published in 1952 and was later adopted with various amendments by each state, a majority doing so in the 1960s; it has not been used by all 50 states since 1952.

HEADLINE: Anthony Verdict Sets Off Spate of New Legislation

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
The jury has spoken, the public has seethed and now it is time for politicians to offer their opinions on the verdict that dominated the news.
Their view? Not in my state. 
Legislators in more than a dozen states have introduced bills that would make it a felony for a parent to not report the death or disappearance of a child within a certain window of time. Such legislation would have criminalized the behavior of Casey Anthony, the Florida woman acquitted on Tuesday of killing her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. Ms. Anthony did not report her daughter missing for 31 days.
''Justice did not prevail in Florida,'' said State Representative Richard Henderson, a Kentucky Democrat. ''Maybe this will change a deranged person's mind in the future. Or maybe it will just give the judicial system another weapon in its arsenal to seek justice.''
Following a longtime practice, the bills are named after the young victim in the case. Like Jessica's Law and Megan's Law, which punish sex offenders, and Kyleigh's Law, which promotes safe driving, these are called Caylee's Law.
''When lawmakers name it after a sympathetic figure, especially a child, it increases the likelihood that people will vote for it on an emotional level,'' said Kevin Underhill, a San Francisco lawyer and legal blogger. But he warns that the bills cover very rare situations and could be overused. He offered the example of a parent whose child runs away from home.
The push for Caylee's Law began hours after the verdict. A 30-year-old, unemployed woman in Durant, Okla., named Michelle Crowder created a petition on Tuesday on the Web site Change.org calling for action from everyone from state representatives to members of Congress to President Obama.
It has now received more than 700,000 signatures.
Ms. Crowder, who has two daughters, said in a telephone interview she could not believe it was legal for Ms. Anthony to not report her daughter's disappearance for a month. ''Abandoning a child is illegal. Abuse is illegal. But not reporting a child missing is somehow O.K.?'' she asked.
That was equally surprising to State Representative Michael Stinziano, an Ohio Democrat. At first, he worried about appearing to capitalize on public furor over the verdict, but he received so many e-mails from constituents that he said he felt compelled to act. Mr. Stinziano has been working on a bill.
''The question everyone keeps asking is: 'Is this bill just a fad?' '' he said. ''Having it named Caylee's Law captures attention. But this is something legislatively we should absolutely enact.''
In Maryland, State Senator Nancy Jacobs is also proposing a bill after receiving e-mails from constituents, Reuters reported.
At a federal level, legal experts say, Caylee's Law has little future. The Constitution prohibits Congress from intervening in a local matter like a missing child.
Not that it would matter in many cases. ''Most parents don't need a law of any kind telling them what to do when their child disappears,'' Mr. Underhill said.

HEADLINE: Weak Jobless Report Cuts Into Week's Gains

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stock indexes fell sharply on Friday, erasing much of the week's gains, after the government reported that employers had created the fewest number of jobs in nine months.
The 18,000 net jobs created in June were a fraction of what economists had expected and damped hopes that the economy was improving. Private companies added jobs at the slowest rate in more than a year. The unemployment rate edged up to 9.2 percent, its highest this year.
A broader measure of weakness in the labor market was even worse. Among Americans who want to work, 16.2 percent are either unemployed or unable to find full-time jobs. That is up from 15.8 percent in May. 
''There's just a lot more evidence than before that we're in an extended weak patch,'' said Brian Gendreau, market strategist for the Cetera Financial Group. He said private economists would most likely reduce their projections for overall economic growth this year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.42 points, or 0.70 percent, to 1,343.80. That eliminated the index's gains from Thursday and left it with a 0.3 percent gain for the week.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 62.29 points, or 0.49 percent, to 12,657.20. The Dow, which had been down as much as 150 points Friday, had only its second down day over the last nine. The Nasdaq composite dropped 12.85 points, or 0.45 percent, to 2,859.81. It was its first loss in two weeks.
The Dow rose 0.6 percent for the week, the Nasdaq 1.6 percent.
Companies whose business would be most affected by a weakening economy were hit hardest. Bank of America, General Electric and Boeing were among the biggest decliners in the Dow average.
''The chance of a July bounce-back in the economy looks pretty slim now,'' said Jay Tyner, president of Semmax Financial Group in Greensboro, N.C.
Expectations for Friday's jobs report were raised Thursday after the payroll processor ADP said that private companies added more than 150,000 jobs in June. While the ADP report does not always accurately predict the broader Labor Department report, some investors said that the apparent clashing pictures of the job market resulted from a jobs pickup in the last weeks of June.
Phil Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors, said he believed that manufacturers began rehiring workers in late June after signs that Japan's economy was improving. Hiring slumped in May, partly because of high fuel prices and disruptions of industrial supplies because of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
Traders rushed to the relative safety of government bonds. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 31/32, to 100 27/32, and the yield fell to 3.03 percent, from 3.14 percent late Thursday. Oil prices fell 2.5 percent. The slowdown in hiring suggested that demand for fuel would increase less than traders had expected. Lower fuel prices could eventually help the economy by giving consumers more money to spend.
Weak economic data this spring pushed stocks close to their lowest levels of the year two weeks ago. Markets recovered last week, giving the Dow its best week in two years, on signals that the economy was rebounding. Stock indexes closed near their 2011 highs on Thursday.
Despite the weak job market, analysts still expect earnings at big companies to be strong. Companies are benefiting from export growth as the weak dollar makes American goods cheaper, and therefore more competitive, in overseas markets. The aluminum maker Alcoa, one of the 30 companies in the Dow average, will be the first major corporation to report second-quarter financial results on Monday.
Mr. Orlando, the market strategist, said investors would be looking to see how companies had responded to higher commodity costs and a shortage of parts from Japan. ''It's not going to be an earnings season where you can have a blanket proclamation regarding how companies are doing this time around,'' he said.
In other company news, Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate the News Corporation fell nearly 4 percent as a phone-hacking scandal at its News of the World tabloid deepened.

HEADLINE: As Sales Decline, Wholesale Inventories Grow

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wholesale companies added to their stockpiles for a 17th consecutive month in May, but their sales declined for only the second time in the last 11 months, providing further evidence of the economy's spring slowdown. 
The Commerce Department said Friday that wholesale inventories rose 1.8 percent in May, the biggest gain since October. Some of that increase reflected an unwanted buildup of goods because sales declined.
Sales at the wholesale level fell 0.2 percent, the report said. The sales drop was led by a big decline in auto sales, and the inventory buildup also reflected a large rise in auto stockpiles.
The weakness in May sales offered the latest evidence that the economy slowed in the spring as consumers struggled with soaring gas prices and high unemployment.
Manufacturing has been one of the strongest sectors of the nation's economy since the recession ended two years ago; factory production has been supported by concerted efforts on the part of businesses to restock depleted shelves. With the May rise in inventories, stockpiles are now 18.9 percent higher than their lowest level, hit in September 2009.
Factory activity weakened this spring, in part because of temporary factors. High gasoline prices caused consumers to spend less elsewhere, which cut demand for factory goods. And the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan led to supply-chain disruptions that slowed manufacturing in the United States, particularly in the auto and computer industries.
There are signs that those impediments are lifting. Gas prices have dropped considerably since peaking in early May at a national average of nearly $4 a gallon. And manufacturing activity expanded in June at a faster pace than in the previous month, according to the Institute for Supply Management. That suggests the parts shortage is beginning to abate.
The economy grew at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the first three months of the year. Analysts are expecting similarly weak growth in the April-June quarter.
Growth is expected to pick up to a 3.2 percent rate in the final six months of the year, according to an Associated Press survey of 38 economists.
Still, growth must be stronger to significantly lower the unemployment rate. The economy would need to grow at a 5 percent pace for a whole year to significantly bring down the unemployment rate. Economic growth of just 3 percent a year will simply keep up with population growth and hold the rate steady.
In another report, the Federal Reserve said consumers took on more debt in May and used their credit cards more for only the second time in nearly three years.
The Federal Reserve said Friday that consumer borrowing rose $5.1 billion in May, the eighth consecutive monthly increase. It followed a revised gain of $5.7 billion in April. Borrowing in the category that covers credit cards increased, as did borrowing in the category for auto and student loans.
The overall increase pushed consumer borrowing to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $2.43 trillion in May. That was just 1.7 percent higher than the nearly four-year low of $2.39 trillion hit in September.
The increase in credit card borrowing marked only the second monthly gain since August 2008. Households began borrowing less and saving more when unemployment spiked during the recession. The category is down 4.4 percent over the last year and 18.5 percent from its peak in August 2008.

HEADLINE: Treasury's Unhappy Customers

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Pauline Gordon wants to know where her savings are.
Mrs. Gordon, an 85-year-old resident of Silver Spring, Md., was a satisfied, long-time user of the federal government's old Legacy Treasury Direct system, which allowed users to buy Treasury bills and other securities by mail or phone and receive paper statements.
But the Bureau of the Public Debt, the Treasury arm that handles the sale and redemption of Treasury bills and other government securities, is phasing out the system and will shut it down on Nov. 1, 2012. 
Users must switch to the newer, Web-based TreasuryDirect system. Or they can arrange to buy Treasury bills, notes and bonds through a bank or broker. That's what Mrs. Gordon tried to do. ''I'm 85 years old,'' she explained in a phone interview. ''I don't get much involved with electronics, if I can avoid it.''
So when she received a letter about the change from the Treasury Department on March 30, she enlisted the help of her son, Robert. He accompanied her to her bank and helped her get a signed affidavit, as required, authorizing the transfer of her securities to her broker. Then, they sent the paperwork to the Bureau of the Public Debt, which received the packet on April 27.
Four weeks later, the funds still hadn't been transferred to her brokerage account. Another two weeks later, Robert Gordon called the information number given by the Treasury Department. ''I left messages,'' he said. ''No one's ever called me back.'' When he did reach a person, he said, he was told the paperwork was received and was being processed.
Mr. Gordon knew his mother didn't want to sell any of her securities - she is partial to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities -- but asked what would happen if she did decide she wanted to do so. He was told, he said, that she could sell them through the old Legacy Direct system. But she's still worried. ''The anxiety it's causing her is considerable,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Gordon is fretting about what is happening with a large portion of her savings, and pesters her broker frequently about whether the funds have arrived. ''I'm very upset,'' she said. ''I can't understand the government being so slow. There's no reason for it. We filled everything out.''
Mckayla Braden, a bureau spokeswoman, said Wednesday that the bureau was ''overwhelmed'' by requests from users of the old system and is working on processing them. ''We were totally slammed,'' she said. ''Her request is not forgotten.''
Slightly more than 200,000 people are affected by the change, according to the Bureau of the Public Debt. Ms. Braden didn't have information immediately available about how many users have switched to the new system. The problem is that most users of the older system are elderly - their average age is 75, and many are over 80. Many, like Mrs. Gordon, lack computers, or the inclination to use one. They invest in Treasuries because they are very safe, and not knowing where their money is, is stressful to them.
Now, an update: On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Gordon called to say that after Bucks contacted the bureau, he and his mother received phone calls telling them that a portion of her securities would be transferred to her brokerage account on Thursday. The remainder, he was told, would be transferred at a later date, after pending interest posts. Mr. Gordon said he was grateful for the update, because if only some of the securities had been transferred without explanation, he and his mother would have been even more concerned. ''People need to know that it might go in stages,'' he said.
Are you trying to move your Treasury investments to an outside broker? Has the switch gone smoothly?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Advisers Keep Eyes on the Horizon in a Choppy Economy

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THE investment professionals I have consulted in each of the last two quarters are united today in one thing: taking the long view may be the best way to navigate a potentially bumpy second half of the year.
Given that this has already been a year of political and financial upheaval that none of these people had anticipated, this advice may be the only viable option. Still, each had his own take on how the long view would look.
Richard Cookson, chief investment officer at Citi Private Bank, has been the contrarian throughout. He admitted that he made the wrong call on the United States stock market this year, predicting that it would go down when, in fact, it went up. But he said that increase in value was meaningful only if you had invested in dollars.
''The U.S. is a wee bit like the emerging market countries in the 1990s in the sense that it has been debauching its currency,'' Mr. Cookson said. ''The stock market does well in the local currency, but it does very badly in any other currency's terms. If you bought it in euros or Swiss francs and didn't hedge it, you would have done appallingly.'' 
Niall J. Gannon, director of wealth management at the Gannon Group at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, has been the steady member of the group. He has continued to ignore the noise and focus on the data.
Mr. Gannon's preferred measure for his high-net-worth clients is to analyze the earnings yield of various securities. (This is defined as the earnings per share over the previous year divided by the current price, or the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio.)
Mr. Gannon said he was looking at stocks with earnings yields of 7.5 to 8 percent, which compare favorably with 4 percent on United States Treasuries and 4.65 percent on municipal bonds. ''We continue to stress that you have to extract value where the value is coming from,'' he said.
The five advisers were in accord on the outcome of the deficit talks between Congress and the White House. All predicted that the politicians would find a short-term solution that would leave the country in the same predicament a few years from now.
They also agreed that the politicians in Europe would probably come up with a short-term solution for Greece's debt problems, but they disagreed on the potential impact of Greece's situation on Europe and the rest of the world.
So let's look more closely at what the group thought was good and bad in the first half and what its concerns were for the future.
HALF TIME At the end of the last quarter, two unexpected events upended the group's predictions: the turmoil in the Middle East and what it might do to oil prices, and the tsunami and earthquake in Japan and how that disaster affected the global supply chain.
The price of oil spiked to $114 a barrel but is now back to about $96. (And while the price of gasoline has edged down in recent weeks, it is still higher than it was in December 2010.) Japan, meanwhile, appears to be on the road to recovery. But none of that could be known as it was occurring, and the way some investors panicked again showed just how fragile confidence was.
Mr. Cookson said he was proud of his call to buy Japanese stocks as a way to invest in the country's quick recovery.
Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, said the fall in gas prices had helped increase consumer spending.
Now, though, the group is making the case that investors need to remain confident about the United States stock market. Mr. Stern said that there had been five stock market drops of at least 7 percent since the March 2009 low, including the most recent one from April to June. But he argued that those drops were the results of broader economic shocks. Corporate profits remain strong.
''It's remarkable how companies are taking advantage of rising world trade, improved business opportunities and increasing capital availability,'' Mr. Stern said.
While this is good news for companies and their shareholders, it has yet to make a dent in the unemployment rate. No one had a firm prediction of when the rate might fall. Mr. Stern framed it as a chicken-or-egg case: companies will start hiring when other companies hire.
Mr. Gannon said high unemployment had not affected his investment decisions. Those decisions are focused on the growing middle class in other parts of the world, which is why he continues to invest in companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nike, which derive their revenue globally.
As a similar call on the slow pace of hiring in the United States, Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, continues to push dividend-paying stocks. ''We have cash pileups on corporate balance sheets,'' Mr. Stone said. ''On top of that, we have seen when the market sold off that this subset of stocks has not sold off.''
FUTURE FEARS The first half may have been bumpy, but investors with strong stomachs have done fine. What is the group concerned about for the next quarter? The two biggest fears involve the economies in the United States and Europe.
The professional investors agreed that despite prolonged negotiations over raising the federal debt ceiling, the issue will ultimately be resolved and have little impact on investors. (If by some chance it is not, Mr. Stern said, gold bugs will be completely vindicated.) What is not likely to happen is for policy makers to agree on a long-term solution for the country's deficit.
''All this talk about the debt ceiling has not led to borrowing rates going up,'' Mr. Stone said.
Still, he said the economy remained unsteady and unduly affected by individual reports of economic data like jobless numbers. ''People are still struggling to find the evidence of a rally,'' he said. ''Is it going to hold on or is it falling back again? It's a pretty volatile time.''
The continued negotiations in Greece do not help. While none of the professionals say they think Greece is economically significant enough to drag down the world economy -- it accounts for about a half of a percent of global gross domestic product -- they say they fear that a debt default may be a catalyst for other problems.
''Why it's important is what it says about the perilous state of the periphery of Europe in general,'' Mr. Cookson said. ''It's much likelier to me that they will default and that will create a chain reaction.''
Mr. Cookson said his biggest call now was for investors to buy dollars and long-dated United States Treasury bonds as protection against a Greek default spreading to Portugal, Spain and even Italy.
Yet other analysts cautioned against overreacting to the news. Richard Madigan, chief investment officer of J. P. Morgan's Global Access Portfolios, said this summer felt a lot like last summer. ''The problem with kicking the can down the road is that you eventually catch up to it and have to kick it again,'' he wrote in a report due out next week. ''That is about where we are midyear, with an eerie sense of deja vu that we are recycling last year's challenges yet again.''
Still, it is hard to blame investors who lost a lot in 2008 for being skittish. How do they know if the global economy is experiencing the aftershocks of a particularly fierce earthquake or about to be taken under by a new tremor?
If they underreact, and the risks from Greece and the debt negotiations in the United States are not resolved, they suffer another big loss. If they overreact, they could fall behind their peers who remain more aggressively invested. This is where the long view is supposed to offer consolation.

HEADLINE: The Boom and Crash Cycle of I.P.O.'s

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THE global market for initial public offerings of stock, which was hot in late 2010, has cooled.
In just a few months, the market has gone from raising record amounts of money to reaching a 10-year high in the number of proposed offerings withdrawn because there was no market. 
During this year's second quarter, 98 offerings -- which had been projected to raise $21 billion -- were withdrawn, according to calculations by Dealogic. The number of canceled offerings was the highest since 129 proposed offerings were canceled in the fourth quarter of 2000, as it became clear that the technology bubble had burst.
The recent boom in initial public offerings was spread much wider than the one that ended in 2000. The earlier boom was concentrated in the United States, but the latest included many more companies from booming developing markets, particularly in China.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, the total amount raised by I.P.O.'s hit $66.1 billion, which was then the highest level ever. More than three-quarters of that was raised in the American market and most of it was for technology companies. In the final quarter of 2010, $127 billion was raised and less than one-quarter of that was raised by offerings in the United States.
In the latest quarter, the total raised was about half the level of the fourth quarter of 2010, although the decline in the number of completed offerings, to 406 from 516, was not as sharp.
As can be seen from the accompanying graphic, the market for initial public offerings virtually collapsed in 2002 and 2003, but then began to recover as stock markets rose and many countries reported strong growth. Thanks to strong volumes of foreign offerings, the I.P.O. market had become strong before the financial crisis killed the market in 2008 and 2009.
The volume of withdrawn offerings provides a clear indication of rapid changes in markets. Those are deals that underwriters thought they could sell. They went to the expense of preparing offering documents but then were unable to sell, at least at prices acceptable to the companies.
The failed offerings cover the spectrum, both geographically and in the nature of the business. In June, three proposed I.P.O.'s that had been expected to yield more than $1 billion each were withdrawn. One was a Hong Kong company that mines iron ore in Australia, another a French company that makes glass containers and the third an Indian company that builds and leases communications towers for cellular telephone service providers.
Unlike the collapse of the market in 2000, the latest decline does not follow a widespread collapse in the prices of previously hot new offerings. During the final three months of 2010, when the total amount raised by new offerings set a record, Dealogic counted nine offerings that doubled in price on the first day of trading. This week, all of those stocks were still trading above the offering price, although only two -- Youku.com, a Chinese Internet television company, and TPK Holding, a Taiwanese maker of screens for smartphones and other devices -- traded for more than they did on the first day.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Pulling Back: The latest boom in initial public offerings has begun to fade, and the number of proposed offerings that were withdrawn -- presumably because buyers could not be found at acceptable prices -- rose to the highest level since late 2000, when the technology bubble was collapsing.

HEADLINE: 2nd Brazilian Official Quits in Graft Case, Giving New Leader a Chance to Clean House

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
SAO PAULO, Brazil -- The resignation this week of yet another minister in the government of Dilma Rousseff, the president of Brazil, may have added to the tumult of her nascent presidency, but it is also showing that her managerial push for efficiency could make it tougher for corruption to persist in her administration, analysts said.
The resignation of Alfredo Nascimento, the transportation minister, is giving Ms. Rousseff a chance to distance herself from the government of her mentor and predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. 
Mr. Nascimento, who had served in the same post under Mr. da Silva, resigned on Wednesday amid accusations of corruption involving overbilling and solicitation of bribes. He is the second official to fall for suspected corruption since Ms. Rousseff became president six months ago.
Last month, Antonio Palocci, the chief of staff and most important political adviser to the president, resigned amid accusations that he had illegally enriched himself with consulting work while a congressman and manager of Ms. Rousseff's presidential campaign.
Both officials were holdovers from the previous administration. ''She is gradually reducing the number of Lulalistas that he imposed on her,'' said David Fleischer, a political science professor at Brasilia University. ''She is branding her own government rather than making this a third term for Lula.''
While the president appeared to be caught by surprise in the Palocci case, this time it was Ms. Rousseff who was seeking answers for why the Transportation Ministry had appeared to increase the value of several contracts for highway and rail projects.
The scandal became public when the Brazilian magazine Veja reported that Ms. Rousseff had questioned the leadership of the Transportation Ministry, which controls important infrastructure projects for the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016, about the apparent overbilling.
The magazine reported that the ministry had solicited kickbacks from engineering and construction companies, and that the majority of the payments flowed to Mr. Nascimento's political party. In a statement from the ministry, he denied that he had done anything illegal, saying he hoped to clarify matters in an appearance before the Senate next Tuesday. Some analysts applauded Ms. Rousseff's supervision.
''This is a sign of progress, a sign of a president that is going to have less tolerance for this kind of behavior,'' said Christopher Garman, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy in New York. ''This is a government that is going to place a premium on efficiency, diminishing the space for corruption.''
But while the episode highlighted the managerial skills of Ms. Rousseff, a former chief of staff, it did little to assuage concerns that she lacks one of her predecessor's strengths: the ''political skill set to manage a coalition,'' Mr. Garman said.
Ms. Rousseff, who is in a battle to rein in spending to control inflation, needs to rally congressional support, which the scandal surrounding Mr. Palocci already cost her, analysts said.
Before joining the cabinet, Mr. Nascimento was president of the Party of the Republic, a midsize member of the governing coalition, which expects a certain level of representation in her cabinet. As of late Friday, Ms. Rousseff had not yet settled on a successor for Mr. Nascimento.
In announcing his resignation, Mr. Nascimento returned to the Senate and reassumed his post as president of the party.
At the president's urging, Mr. Nascimento established a commission to investigate the charges for 30 days. Ms. Rousseff suspended, by decree, the majority of the projects and auctions connected to the Transportation Ministry pending the outcome of the inquiry.
The latest revelations seemed to open the floodgates to even more questions about cozy government ties to contractors. The newspaper O Globo revealed that the transportation minister's son, Gustavo Morais Pereira, had increased his wealth to $32 million from $38,500 in five years, in part from contracts his construction company reached with public entities, including one tied to the Transportation Ministry.
Still, the government has emphasized that Ms. Rousseff moved swiftly to get to the bottom of the concerns about pricing in the ministry. Even before she took over as president in January, she had been questioning Mr. Nascimento in her role as chief of staff for unexplained additions to contracts by the Transportation Ministry.

HEADLINE: A Time to Talk About Debt and Taxes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''What Obama Wants,'' by Paul Krugman (column, July 8):
As a senior citizen enjoying the benefits of Medicare and Social Security, as well as the advantages of the Bush tax cuts, I could be quite content to leave all entitlement programs as they are. But as a proud American, and one who understands the ramifications of not only the country's defaulting on its obligations but also our exploding debt, I am more than willing to pay my share of the cost of Medicare and take a reduction in my Social Security benefits.
Huge spending cuts to programs that take care of children and people less fortunate than I, however, should be off the table. Not only are they unfair and reek of class distinctions, but they are also job killers, and job creation is indeed what America desperately needs to climb out of the doldrums. 
Mr. Krugman is 100 percent correct in his analysis of what immediate deficit reduction and huge spending cuts would do to the economy. President Obama should stand tough with respect to our desperate need to increase revenue before he gives away the store to the Republicans.
HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN New York, July 8, 2011
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman is correct.
We need to focus more on keeping existing jobs and on job growth -- both of which are linked to government spending -- and less on debts, balancing government budgets and budget cuts.
To paraphrase Henry Higgins, ''The reins on Keynes constrain sustaining gains.''
PHILIP FRANKENFELD Washington, July 8, 2011
To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristof's July 7 column, ''Taxes and Billionaires,'' contends that carried interest is a ''loophole'' that needs closing.
For more than 50 years, our tax system has rewarded those who invest expertise to grow a business and those who invest capital. As a result, the tax code treats carried interest and enterprise value as capital gains.
Taxing these gains as ordinary income would upend decades of settled tax law. Even worse, it would enshrine into law a policy that puts a higher value on the financial contributions of those with wealth than the contributions of vision and hard work from those who lack wealth and resources.
Carried interest is a profits interest obtained upon the sale of an operating business and carries far more risk than a regular salary, namely the risk that the profits will have to be returned to the investor if the company doesn't generate a significant profit. Does anyone who gets a salary have to return his or her wages if things don't go well?
By dramatically increasing the cost of capital, the carried interest proposal will discourage the risk-taking required to start, grow and save American companies. It will put the United States at a competitive disadvantage and draw capital -- and jobs -- from our shores to more friendly foreign markets.
Adding this proposal to a deficit reduction package intended to restore confidence in the American economy would do the opposite.
KEN SPAIN Vice President, Public Affairs Private Equity Growth Capital Council Washington, July 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Antitax Extremism in Minnesota'' (editorial, July 6):
The very first line of your editorial says it all, loud and clear: ''How far will Republican lawmakers go to protect millionaires?'' As a result of Republican extremism, the United States has become a divided nation, divided into haves and have-nots. The wealthy refuse to give up anything, and the have-nots want everything.
Two immovable, unyielding forces. It is no longer a matter of who will win, but of how much will be lost because of the lack of sacrifice by all.

HEADLINE: Jobs Report Reinforces Parties in Deficit Talks

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Carl Hulse and Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's drive for a supersize budget deal was further complicated on Friday by the release of unexpectedly weak employment figures, which Republicans seized on to bolster their arguments against possible tax increases and Democrats said were reason to limit painful spending cuts.
Heading into a crucial weekend of negotiations, Mr. Obama said the jobless numbers, and the fragile recovery they underscored, should give both parties even more incentive to strike a deal reducing the deficit and averting the risk of a government default early next month. But the president appeared largely alone in seeing the bad news as a call to boldness. 
Republicans cited the report in renewing their assault on Mr. Obama's stewardship of the economy, with lawmakers saying they would not accept tax increases at a moment when the economic recovery appears to be losing steam. And several Democrats said the continued economic hardship made substantial cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security even harder to contemplate, given that they would hit the poor and the elderly and further reduce whatever support government spending is providing to the economy.
A day after the White House and Congressional leaders pledged to pursue the largest possible budget deal -- one that could generate up to $4 trillion in savings over a decade -- there was already talk on Capitol Hill about the virtues of passing something more modest, in the range of $2 trillion or thereabouts.
Mr. Obama has summoned Congressional leaders to the White House on Sunday for another bargaining session, at which he said he expected both sides to present their bottom lines for a deal. But the White House is playing down expectations, saying the hard bargaining will happen only in the days after that.
On Friday, lawmakers from both parties dug in their heels on any major compromises, sounding familiar themes. Democrats were particularly rattled after reports this week that Mr. Obama was open to cuts in popular entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, in return for new revenues.
The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who met privately with Mr. Obama on Friday morning, told reporters later in the day that her position was firm: ''No benefit cuts in Medicare or Social Security.'' And, she added, ''There is serious concern about what's happening in Medicaid as well.''
Members of the House Democratic caucus were willing to ''cut the president some slack,'' said Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia. But he said they insisted that ''there will be no benefit cuts in entitlement programs.''
Republicans, some of whom have been unnerved by reports that Speaker John A. Boehner told the White House he would consider up to $1 trillion in new revenues, reiterated their opposition to tax increases.
''Raising taxes on our nation's jobs creators is yet another failed policy that will make the economy worse,'' Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, told reporters. ''Instead of looking at ways to raise taxes, we ought to be looking at the countless ways we could reduce federal spending and enact policies to grow the economy and create jobs.''
Mr. Boehner, several Congressional aides said, is aligned with Mr. Obama in the belief that a big deal is better than a midrange one. But he, too, blamed the president for the faltering job market, saying it ''is more evidence that the misguided 'stimulus' spending binge, excessive regulations and an overwhelming national debt continue to hold back private-sector job creation in our country.''
The speaker also dampened expectations for a quick budget deal, saying, ''This is a Rubik's cube that we have not worked out yet.'' He stretched his arms wide to illustrate the gulf separating the two sides.
The eye-popping numbers being bandied about attest to the complexity of the challenge. To reach $4 trillion in savings, economists said, the White House and Congress would have to make changes to the tax code -- a complex, politically fraught process that could take months, even years, rather than the two weeks the administration says it has to pass budget legislation before the government loses its borrowing authority on Aug. 2.
The size of the proposed package, officials said, is also inflated by including projected savings from the drawdown of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan -- a ''peace dividend'' that some in the White House and in Congress regard as spurious because the administration never planned to fight those wars for the next decade.
In one way, though, officials said the bad economic news might encourage lawmakers to act now. A multiyear deficit reduction package is likely to contain measures that stimulate the economy -- like an extension of the cut in payroll taxes -- in the first year or two, while deferring new tax revenues and spending cuts to later years.
''What you'd like to see under these circumstances is a big deal, but one that would not take down spending or raise taxes quickly,'' said Rudolph G. Penner, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. ''The problem with that is making it credible.''
The president also cast the issue in terms of credibility, arguing that a significant budget deal would give a lift to the job market.
Speaking in the Rose Garden, as storm clouds gathered above his head, Mr. Obama said, ''The sooner we get this done, the sooner that the markets know that the debt limit ceiling will have been raised and that we have a serious plan to deal with our debt and deficit, the sooner that we give our businesses the certainty that they will need in order to make additional investments to grow and hire.''

HEADLINE: Feeble Job Numbers Show Recovery Starting to Stall

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH; Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For the second consecutive month, employers added scarcely any jobs in June, startling evidence that the economic recovery is stumbling.
All levels of government shed workers, and hiring by companies continued to slow, resulting in a meager 18,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs last month, the Labor Department reported on Friday. The government also revised downward the small gain for the previous month to 25,000 new jobs, less than half the original estimate.
Although the government's survey of employers showed a slight expansion in jobs, a separate survey of households found that more people were searching for work than in the previous month, causing the unemployment rate to rise to 9.2 percent from 9.1 percent in May.
Economists were stunned. They had been expecting job growth to strengthen in June as oil prices eased and supply disruptions caused by the Japanese tsunami and earthquake receded. Instead, the government's monthly snapshot of the labor market showed that several industries, including construction, finance and temporary services, shrank. At the same time, leading indicators like wages and the length of the average workweek, which tend to grow before employers begin adding more jobs, actually contracted. 
''Even the wild-eyed optimists out there have nothing to grasp onto in this report except to say, 'Ah, this too shall pass,' '' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc.
Most analysts are not yet forecasting an outright slide back into recession, but at a time when President Obama and Congress are focused on spending cuts, Europe is in financial crisis and even China's growth is slowing, there is little expectation of anything other than a prolonged slog for the United States economy.
''Stimulus is fading, and we still have plenty of problems left over from the popping of the bubble,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''So it's going to be a touch-and-go, or a very subpar, situation for a very long time. The question is a matter of degree in terms of how soft or subpar it's going to be, as opposed to whether it's going to remain that way.''
Stock market investors largely shrugged off the bleak labor report, as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell less than 1 percent to close at 1,343.80 on Friday. They have taken comfort in relatively strong corporate profits, aided in no small part by global sales. The discordance between business strength and feeble hiring has raised concerns that companies will continue to rely on productivity gains and investments in equipment, as opposed to more workers, to fuel growth.
With Republicans and Democrats very much at odds over the budget, Mr. Obama said the jobless numbers should give both sides more incentive to strike a deal. Government and private economists have been lowering their forecasts for national output this year, with the Federal Reserve now estimating little improvement over last year's 2.9 percent growth rate.
In remarks in the Rose Garden at the White House on Friday, Mr. Obama went beyond counseling patience on the economy's long return to health and urged Congress to extend the payroll tax cut passed last December. He also said that legislators should sign pending trade agreements and pass bills that would establish an infrastructure bank and reform the patent process, all measures that he said would help create jobs.
''There are bills and trade agreements before Congress right now that could get all these ideas moving,'' Mr. Obama said. ''All of them have bipartisan support. All of them could pass immediately, and I urge Congress not to wait.''
Republicans blamed the president and Congressional Democrats for the weak job market, with John Boehner, the House speaker, saying that ending the ban on drilling for oil and lifting regulations would spur hiring.
Though all the job growth last month came from private companies, which expanded by 57,000 jobs, they have made a striking retrenchment from the average of more than 200,000 jobs a month added from February through April. The largest gains came from companies in health care and leisure and hospitality, while manufacturers, which lost jobs in May, added a mere 6,000 slots in June.
The economy needs to add about 150,000 jobs a month just to keep up with normal population growth. The protracted stretch of weak-to-moderate job creation over the last two years has left many of the people who lost jobs during the recession increasingly desperate. There are now 14.1 million unemployed, with 6.3 million of them having searched for work for six months or longer. Including those who are working part time because they cannot find full-time work and those who have stopped looking, the broader unemployment rate is now 16.2 percent, its highest level since December 2010.
Economists said that companies had been battered by a string of bad news throughout the spring and were reluctant to hire. ''Sentiment for businesses is on a knife's edge,'' said Omair Sharif, United States economist for the Royal Bank of Scotland. ''So that when you get a few negative data points, it's all doom and gloom.''
Budget strains were evident in the public sector as the federal government slashed 14,000 jobs, and state and local governments cut an additional 25,000. Nearly three-quarters of the job losses at the local level came in education.
The Labor Department report gave little hope for a quick turnaround. Temporary help services, which tend to expand before employers hire permanently, fell by 12,000 jobs.
Janette Marx, senior vice president for Ajilon Professional Staffing, a unit of Adecco, said that while companies in accounting and finance were making fewer requests for temporary workers, they were slowly recruiting permanent hires. But employers are still very jittery.
Companies are ''keeping themselves on the edge,'' said Jeff Joerres, chief executive of ManpowerGroup, a temporary staffing firm. ''As soon as there is any sense of confusion -- whether it be political, abroad, economic -- they can stop. They literally pick up the red phone and say, 'no more this week.' ''
For hopeful signs, some economists pointed to more recent data showing a pickup in retail sales at chain stores and a rise in an index of business hiring. In manufacturing, analysts expect an increase in auto production in the fall, partly because disruptions in supply will have diminished and partly because of built-up consumer demand.
Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist of the Manufacturers Alliance, a trade group, said consumers who had been delaying purchases of cars, washing machines, refrigerators and other big equipment that breaks down over time would eventually start buying again as they paid down debts.
''Spending was severely cut during the recession,'' Mr. Meckstroth said. ''Now, the longer you wait, the more pressure there is to make purchases. You can't postpone some things indefinitely.''
Steve Blitz, a senior economist for ITG Investment Research, countered that consumers were satisfying their need for autos by buying used cars. ''Just because Toyota didn't sell the car in May or June doesn't mean that they're going to sell it in September,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Trailing G.O.P. With Cameras, Seeking Gaffes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
AMHERST, N.H. -- Aaron Fielding quietly stalks his prey -- Republicans -- with his video camera, patiently waiting for a political moment worthy of YouTube.
At 27, he is a full-time ''tracker'' for American Bridge 21st Century, a new Democratic organization that aims to record every handshake, every utterance by Republican candidates in 2011 and 2012, looking for gotcha moments that could derail political ambitions or provide fodder for television advertisements by liberal groups next year.
The organization has hired a dozen professional trackers like Mr. Fielding, outfitted them with the latest high-tech cameras and computers and positioned them in key states where Republican candidates are busy chattering away to voters. If all works as planned, incriminating moments captured by American Bridge will quickly become part of the political bloodstream.
Combined with a team of 20 researchers in a Washington ''war room'' that has a large rack of computer servers, the effort is part of a push by Democratic groups to bolster their opposition research. Republicans also have trackers, but so far have not assembled the kind of centralized video archive of political caught-on-tape moments that their rivals envision. 
''Our obligation here is to get these guys on the record with what they really believe so they can't walk away from their record,'' said Rodell Mollineau, a former aide to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and the group's president. ''There are many opportunities for us to record Republicans showing their true colors.''
For Mr. Fielding, that has meant a month of crisscrossing New Hampshire to catch Republican presidential hopefuls at house parties, Main Street strolls, diner meet-and-greets and speeches to local chamber groups. He has filmed Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, more than a dozen times.
On Monday, his target was Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who was in town for the annual July 4 parade in Amherst. As Mr. Romney sprinted from one side of the parade route to the other, chased by reporters and TV camera crews, Mr. Fielding was there, too. Sporting an Under Armour baseball cap (on backward), a heavy backpack and sunglasses, he captured Mr. Romney's awkward handshake with Mr. Huntsman, the brief interviews with reporters and the occasional conversation with voters.
Hours later, when Mr. Romney appeared on the village green in Andover, about 55 miles north of Amherst, Mr. Fielding was waiting, camera in hand.
''I've seen most of these candidates multiple times,'' Mr. Fielding said. ''I know what they are saying. I know when they've changed. You have to just be with them the whole time, have the camera ready and make sure you have batteries.''
The ability to film a politician while walking backward is a must. So is a bit of chutzpah: The job calls for walking uninvited into New Hampshire house parties until you are asked to leave. (That has not happened to Mr. Fielding -- yet. ) He has gotten to know some of the Republican staff members, and they are beginning to know him.
Mr. Fielding is a descendent of sorts of S. R. Sidarth, the Democratic tracker who in 2006 captured Senator George Allen of Virginia calling him ''macaca'' -- a term critics viewed as a racial slur. That incident helped destroy Mr. Allen's re-election campaign and proved the power of the tracker. But Mr. Fielding is no mere volunteer. A veteran of campaigns in Louisiana and New Mexico, he is what American Bridge refers to as a ''seasoned political operative.''
''I pay attention to what the important issues are,'' Mr. Fielding said. ''This is where the meat of the campaign is.''
Mr. Fielding's efforts on July 4 produced no embarrassing moments. But officials at American Bridge insist that is not the point. Along with the video he uploaded, Mr. Fielding sent in detailed, time-coded ''field reports'' that will be entered into a searchable database and used to index the hours of video from the event.
If a Democratic group is ever looking for the image of Mr. Romney paying for a 25-cent lemonade with a $5 bill, it will know just where to go. If it wants a clip of Mr. Romney saying the president has made the economy worse, the archive will have one. Or if it needs Mr. Romney talking about World War II veterans, it will be able to find it.
''I can come up with the spin. I need the facts,'' said Paul Begala, a former top adviser to President Bill Clinton and a senior strategist for Priorities USA Action, an outside group that is working to re-elect President Obama. Mr. Begala said American Bridge would help fuel his group's ads. ''Let's go to the videotape!''
While the Democratic National Committee and Democratic candidates also have trackers, federal campaign laws prohibit the outside organizations from coordinating closely enough to use their videotapes in their advertising efforts.
American Bridge is the creation of David Brock, the founder of Media Matters for America, which critiques conservative media outlets, particularly Fox News. Once a leader of right-wing attacks on Mr. Clinton, Mr. Brock is a liberal convert, now seeking ways to have a bigger impact.
His initial plans to create a fund-raising group to produce television ads fizzled, forcing the more targeted approach that became American Bridge. While there is suspicion among some Democratic operatives that Mr. Brock is more interested in promoting himself than his cause, others are more optimistic.
Susan McCue, who heads Majority PAC, a group that will support Democratic Senate candidates, said of Mr. Brock and American Bridge: ''We talk all the time. The relationships are in place to avoid any strategic conflict.'' Mr. Brock declined to comment for this article.
By tapping into his network of Media Matters donors, American Bridge officials say they have raised several million dollars and hope to bring in $15 million to make the group part of a new liberal infrastructure that will last far beyond the 2012 cycle.
On the Republican side, which has no exact counterpart to American Bridge, strategists say they are not worried.
''In the age of cellphone cameras, everybody thinks of themselves as a tracker,'' said Carl Forti, who heads Crossroads GPS, the largest of the Republican superPACs.
Democrats, though, are hoping that American Bridge can give them an edge. ''It shouldn't be that when you watch 'The Daily Show' at night they have the best video footage of our candidates,'' said Bradley Beychok, the campaign director at American Bridge.
In New Hampshire, that is the goal that gets Mr. Fielding out of bed, sometimes as early as 5 a.m., and into his white Ford 500 for another day of chasing after candidates.
On Monday, he missed an opportunity when he stationed himself at the main parade stage, only to be out of position when Mr. Romney gave an impromptu speech elsewhere. But later, in Andover, Mr. Romney's advance team set up its portable stage right in front of him.
''Sometimes,'' he said, camera running, ''you just get lucky.''

HEADLINE: The D.S.K. Endgame

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
For almost two months now, the chattering classes in London, Paris, New York and the Hamptons have struggled to talk about anything but D.S.K. The old animalistic elements have exerted their magnetism: power, sex, violence and race.
The 20 minutes from 12:06 to 12:26 in suite 2806 of the Sofitel New York have become the object of a thousand theories and a French-American bust-up. Yes, there's talk of a U.S. default and Greece is a bottomless pit, but those 1,200 seconds spent together on May 14 by Dominique Strauss-Kahn and a Guinean housekeeper trump every geostrategic lurch. 
Race was long a subtheme in much of the breathless speculation on the encounter of a powerful white man with an African refugee woman from a country where 70 percent of the population lives on less than $1.25 a day. But of late it has merited some French philosophizing. Bernard-Henri Levy has suggested his friend Strauss-Kahn was the victim of ''lynching, in sympathy with minorities, by their supposed friends.''
Huh?
That's a convoluted formulation from a dashing philosopher.
The gist of Levy's theory is this: New York's travesty of justice cast Strauss-Kahn as the guilty guy because he was rich in post-crash New York, just as Dreyfus was once guilty in anti-Semitic Paris because he was Jewish, while the maid had right on her side because she was poor and black.
Sorry, cher ami, I don't buy it. Facts, not race or prejudice, have dictated events.
In those 20 minutes, Strauss-Kahn's semen ended up on the clothing of a bruised maid. She was in extreme distress, convincing to several Sofitel employees. New York prosecutors and police needed probable cause to arrest Strauss-Kahn before he left the country for France. They had probable cause.
Then came the infamous ''perp walk,'' to which New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken belated exception. But as Police Commissioner Ray Kelly noted, ''We have been walking prisoners out of the front doors of station houses for 150 years in this Police Department,'' adding, ''There is no back door.''
When there's power, sex and race involved and the guy in the drama walks out the front door, what you get in a free society is a ''media circus,'' or what French intellectuals now call the ''media guillotine.'' Strauss-Kahn got himself into that circus; nobody else did.
So began the cultural wars that, as usual, ended up reconfirming each nation in its preconceptions. To the French, Americans were brutal, uncivilized, brash savages subjecting an international public servant to humiliation that amounted to guilt by association.
To Americans, the French don't get what democracy means: everyone -- Strauss-Kahn, Madoff, some Bronx kid -- is equal before the law and a Manhattan district attorney does not hesitate to believe a maid over a managing director.
So the D.S.K. affair turned into a Rorschach test revealing old stereotypes. American ''freedom,'' to the scoffing French, was once again the law of the jungle. French ''egalite,'' to outraged Americans, was the usual baloney, a cover for inequality before the law and entrenched male privilege.
Let's get back to the 20 minutes and the facts. The district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., found that the maid had lied about her past (exaggerating or inventing incidents to make her case for getting into the U.S. more persuasive), kept dubious company and had dubious cash deposits. Her word against Strauss-Kahn's began to look like a tough case to make.
Guilt and the provability of guilt do not always coincide. That's how the presumption of innocence and trial by jury work. I don't see, given the facts as they now stand, how there can be any outcome other than a dismissal of the case.
But the story doesn't end there. Tristane Banon, a goddaughter of Strauss-Kahn's second wife, filed a criminal complaint in Paris accusing Strauss-Kahn of trying to rape her eight years ago. Her mother says he once confided: ''I don't know what came over me. I lost my mind.'' Questions about D.S.K. and women go well beyond 20 New York minutes.
Dominique Moisi, a distinguished French political scientist, told me: ''On the subject of men and women in France, there will be a before D.S.K. and an after D.S.K. Some behavior once deemed acceptable will no longer be. We may be seeing the last of the 'promotion canape' -- promotions through the couch.''
As my colleague Katrin Bennhold has noted, ''France ranks 46th in the World Economic Forum's 2010 gender equality report, trailing the United States, most of Europe, but also Kazakhstan and Jamaica.''
Vance may be stymied in New York, but he's hit home across the Atlantic. Strauss-Kahn cannot realistically run for president -- and won't. The French think it's enough already -- he's lost his job and been humiliated -- but they're not going to elect him.
He should quit politics and write a great memoir called ''The Temptations of Power.''

HEADLINE: Scandal Poses Defining Test for a Murdoch Son

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

 BODY:
On Thursday afternoon, James Murdoch assembled senior executives in the top-floor boardroom in the News Corporation's London headquarters and told them of a momentous decision: to shutter the 168-year-old tabloid at the center of a deepening phone-hacking scandal and the original heart of the Murdoch media empire in Britain.
Hours earlier, he had prevailed on his father, Rupert, and his chief lieutenant, Chase Carey, in a phone call from London to Sun Valley, Idaho, where they were attending a conference, according to two people briefed on the matter. Under pressure to quell the scandal and preserve a lucrative deal for a pay-television company, James Murdoch argued that closing the newspaper was necessary to restore respect to the company, they said. 
Now James Murdoch faces a new test as he jockeys to one day run his father's company and salvage the biggest deal in the Murdochs' history, a $12 billion takeover of British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB. With the scandal mushrooming as two former employees were arrested and new charges surfaced that executives had tried to obstruct investigations, he could emerge as the company's decisive new leader, or as the tainted son who mismanaged one of the greatest crises the family business has faced.
The struggle is both a generational shift and economic one: how best to respond to changes that face the news industry, and who at News Corporation is best equipped to decide.
Mr. Murdoch appeared to act quickly to close The News of the World, Britain's largest-circulation Sunday paper, which his father has owned for more than four decades.
Yet the decision was nearly four months in the making, and was as much an effort to shed jobs and save money in a beleaguered industry and shift resources to broadcasting as it was a response to the outcry over the scandal's new revelations, according to the two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal concerns. Some employees are expected to move eventually to the Murdochs' other tabloid, The Sun, when it expands to publish on Sunday, they said.
James Murdoch has already faced renewed criticism for the way the company has managed the investigation since 2007, when he was given oversight of News International, the News Corporation's British subsidiary. On his watch, the company blamed one ''rogue reporter'' for the scandal, and he approved payouts to some hacker victims.
He suddenly finds himself a target of the British political and business establishment that his father influenced by wielding the power of his newspapers to decide elections and tarnish -- or burnish -- reputations. When Prime Minister David Cameron was asked Friday if James Murdoch should be questioned by the police, he said anyone, ''no matter how high or low,'' was fair game for investigators.
The issues of dynasty and succession always surrounded the intermingling of scandal and commerce, as Mr. Murdoch, 38, sought to keep the slow-boil investigation from infecting the deal for BSkyB, where he served as chief executive from 2003 to 2007. (The News Corporation already owns a controlling 39.1 percent stake in the company.)
Over the past few years at its New York headquarters, the News Corporation has slowly purged executives, including Peter Chernin, the former president, and Gary Ginsberg, the top communications adviser, who were close to Rupert Murdoch and seen as stabilizing influences on him and a counterweight to his conservative politics. James Murdoch and a handful of executives close to him have sought to fill that power vacuum, with an abrasive style that has alienated many longtime associates of Rupert Murdoch.
''He has a very binary personality,'' said Claire Enders, a prominent media analyst in London, earlier this year. ''Love or hate.''
The closing of The News of the World carries the symbolic weight of transition from one generation of media mogul to the next. James Murdoch has never reveled in the tabloid culture his father adored; he is drawn to technology and pay television's dependable revenue streams.
''This is a grand gesture,'' said Emily Bell, a journalism professor at Columbia who used to cover the Murdochs as a reporter in London. ''It's trying to demonstrate that James is running a very different business -- that things will change in the future.''
Even before the latest revelations, the crisis was seen as the first great test of James Murdoch's career, approaching the magnitude of the great crises of his father's career: breaking the newspaper unions in London in the 1980s, and a point in the early 1990s when he was almost driven to the brink of bankruptcy.
Rupert Murdoch, at 80, is still in charge at the News Corporation. He does not often speak publicly about succession, but he has made it clear he wants his children to run the company one day. He has told executives close to him that he would prefer three of his children -- James, Lachlan and Elisabeth -- to do it together.
But Lachlan Murdoch resigned in 2005 after chafing at the interference of his father and other executives. Elisabeth Murdoch worked for the company briefly before establishing her own television production company, Shine, which the News Corporation bought this year.
In January, Rupert Murdoch visited James in London and conferred on the phone scandal. One night, while leaving Rupert Murdoch's apartment to dine out, father and son were accosted by a reporter for The Independent.
They said little, and Rupert Murdoch's presence that week at headquarters reassured anxious journalists. ''Rupert's confidence resonated in the building that day,'' Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International, said in an interview at the time.
In the reassuring manner of a man who has faced many scandals, he appraised the company's handling of the investigation by saying, according to Ms. Brooks's account: ''We know the facts. You guys are dealing with this as the cards are being dealt. The police have all the cards.''
Even now, all the cards have not been shown. What turns up could well determine succession at one of the world's largest media empires.

HEADLINE: Shutdown in Minnesota Ripples Out to Day Care

BYLINE: By TALYA MINSBERG and TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
LEXINGTON, Minn. -- Among the thousands of people struggling with the state government shutdown here, 14-year-old Skye might be among the most unlikely.
She is not a state worker, nor does she receive direct state aid. But because the shutdown has led Minnesota to cut her mother's child care subsidy, Skye has been drafted to be the family baby sitter. Afternoons formerly spent playing softball are now spent looking after two of her younger siblings.
''I mean, I went from seeing my friends every day and hanging out to being home every day to take care of my sisters -- it's hard,'' she said. ''It put a big down on the summer.'' 
For more than a week, Minnesota has stopped performing all services not deemed critical because Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, and the Republican-controlled Legislature have been unable to agree on a state budget for this fiscal year.
Though the shutdown meant that about 22,000 government employees became suddenly unemployed, the most significant impact so far for Minnesotans who do not work for the government appears to be in the sort of everyday thing, like child care for the poor, that had been easy to overlook for those not dependent on it.
About 21,000 families with a total of 37,500 children in Minnesota receive day care subsidies that pay about half of the cost of child care at centers or in private homes. An additional 4,000 families are on a waiting list.
''Of the things involved in the shutdown, this is the one that could grow into a crisis because of all the people who rely on it,'' said Senator John Marty, a Democrat who represents a suburban district north of St. Paul. ''This program has done tremendous things for women who had been on welfare.''
Mr. Dayton has also deemed the program to be critical enough to continue during the shutdown, and his request is being considered by Kathleen Blatz, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice and the court-appointed monitor who has been deciding during the shutdown what services are essential.
The loss of the subsidy, even after only a few days, has had an outsize impact on some of the state's day care centers, parents and staff members say.
At Creative Kids Academy in Lexington, a Minneapolis suburb, the number of children in day care has dropped to around 30, from 70 before the shutdown.
''It's like a ghost town,'' Gretchen Raymer, 29, the center's director, said Friday in a room full of toys and buckets with children's names on them that far outnumbered the children present.
Though the center is privately operated, most of the parents who use it receive the state subsidy. Without that stipend, a parent with two children, for instance, would have to pay $300 or $400 a week, a significant amount for women who often work jobs that pay less than $10 an hour.
''Most are single mothers; lots don't have a lot of family in the state, and they've been coming here a few years,'' said Ms. Raymer, who said she had twice gone to the Capitol in St. Paul to testify against proposed budget cuts. ''They have a limited support system.''
The center estimates it will lose $4,000 a week without the stipends. Employees are being encouraged to take vacations, Ms. Raymer said, and she has already laid off a part-time worker.
But she said she was mostly concerned about the parents and the children, whom she considers her extended family.
''It's stressful,'' Ms. Raymer said. ''We have a close relationship with families, and it's horrible to see what the families are going through. How long can they last?''
As for Skye, she is more interested in saving her summer than in budgets and politics.
Her mother, Keri Rosas, 35, a single mother of four, works the night shift at a group home and has depended on Creative Kids Academy to watch her younger children so she can sleep during the day. Ms. Rosas said Ms. Raymer had been very supportive, even providing updates on the shutdown for parents.
Ms. Rosas said that her younger children did not understand what was going on but were eager to be with their friends again, and that Skye, her oldest, was just ready to get back to being a teenager.
''She is extremely upset,'' Ms. Rosas said. ''She doesn't understand why the government can shut down the way it is.''

HEADLINE: Olmsted's Southern Landscapes

BYLINE: LOUIS P. MASUR


HIGHLIGHT: Before he devoted himself to designing parks, Frederick Law Olmsted wrote vividly about the South.

 BODY:
Frederick Law Olmsted is rightly remembered as an eminent landscape architect, but in 1861 it was his work as a journalist and an administrator that brought him acclaim. 
In February of that year, he agreed to edit his three earlier volumes, "A Journey in the Seaboard States" (1856), "A Journey Through Texas" (1857) and "A Journey in the Back Country" (1860) and reissue them as a two-volume work titled "The Cotton Kingdom: A Traveller's Observations on Cotton and Slavery in the American Slaves States." 
The idea came from his London publisher, who assumed that the secession crisis would create great interest in such a work in England; Olmsted's New York publisher quickly agreed. There was reason to believe they were right: one influential journalist and admirer later concluded that Olmsted's writing "was more powerful and convincing than 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.'" While that overstates the case, the book drew a wide readership keen to learn about the nature of Southern society. Born in Hartford, Conn., in 1822, Olmsted traveled widely from an early age. Educated at numerous locales, he led what he described as a "decently restrained vagabond life" that included, in 1843, shipping off to China. He ultimately found himself sitting in on classes at Yale, where his brother was a student. Olmsted became a surveyor and farmer on Staten Island. In 1850 he took a walking tour of the English countryside along with his brother John and best friend Charles Loring Brace, who would establish the Children's Aid Society in New York. On his return, Olmsted published "Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England" (1852).
In the aftermath of the compromise of 1850, Olmsted and Brace argued over slavery and the nature of the Southern economy. Brace suggested to Henry J. Raymond, editor of the New-York Daily Times ("Daily" disappeared from the title in 1857; the hyphen in 1896), that he send Olmsted south as a special correspondent to report his observations. 
Olmsted left in December 1852 and returned three months later. His dispatches appeared under the pseudonym "Yeoman" and ran until 1854. He revised them for his first book. From November 1853 through May 1854, Olmsted traveled again, this time with his brother, mainly to New Orleans and on to Texas, and again his reports, called "Letters from the Southwest," appeared in the newspaper and were revised for his second book. Finally, from May to August 1854, Olmsted traveled alone through the heart of the deep south. Articles from this journey, titled "The Southerners at Home," appeared in 1857 in the competing New York Tribune, but his third book he wrote from scratch. 
Approached in January 1861 to abridge the three volumes into a single work, Olmsted was eager to proceed, but his responsibilities as superintendent of Central Park, which had him overseeing implementation of the landscape design he and Calvert Vaux had submitted in 1857, prevented him from doing so. On Feb. 12, Olmsted asked Daniel R. Goodloe, editor of the antislavery newspaper The National Era and a North Carolinian who had written on slavery and the Southern economy, to take on the task. He offered to split the profits with Goodloe, and by return mail the editor accepted.
While not a slim volume, "The Cotton Kingdom" eliminated more than half of the material contained in the three previous volumes combined. What it lacked in narrative brio it made up for in expository detail. Olmsted reported facts, and he presented the stories of his travels through the South without much editorial comment. But then some accounts needed no embellishment: 
A negress was hung this year [1854] in Alabama, for the murder of her child. At her trial she confessed her guilt. She said her owner was the father of the child, and that her mistress knew it, and treated her so cruelly in consequence, that she had killed it to save it from further suffering, and also to remove a provocation to her own ill-treatment.
Recognizing that he needed to draw out his arguments about the Southern economy, he wrote an introductory chapter titled "The Present Crisis." The student of landscape began by observing that "an arbitrary political line may divide the north part from the south part, but there is no such line in nature ... the currents and counter-currents of trade, of love, of consanguinity, and fellowship, will flow north and south."
Olmsted's title, "The Cotton Kingdom," was a commentary on the bold claim made by Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina in 1858 that "you dare not make war on cotton; no power on earth dares to make war upon it. Cotton is king." In fact, Olmsted argued, the "cotton monopoly in some way did them more harm than good." Economically, it committed southerners to single-crop agriculture and made them reliant on imports; politically, it empowered and emboldened the slaveholding planter elite; morally, it led to their destitution. 
Olmsted drew a picture of a modernizing, developing North, characterized by everything from roads and canals to churches and schools to fine dress and first-rate education. Go away from the North for 20 years and return and the region was unrecognizable; leave the South for the same period and upon return there was nothing to show except the increased value of slaves. Whatever humanitarian reasons spoke against slavery ("I do not think . that there is any good reason to consider the negro, naturally and essentially, the moral inferior of the white"), it was the effect of slavery on the work ethic that most disturbed Olmsted. He encountered a culture that lacked industriousness and wasted time, and that, to him, was the greatest sin of all.
"The Cotton Kingdom" was well-reviewed on both sides of the Atlantic. London's Westminster Review declared, "it is impossible to resist his accumulated evidence." Another British periodical, The Eclectic Review, reacted to the evidence ("facts take fire") by expressing dread of "finding ourselves striking hands with Southern slavery." In Boston, the North American Review praised Olmsted's volumes "because they give us, not estimates or conjectures, but detailed facts." Another review concluded simply, "Mr. Olmsted is a classic."
By the time "The Cotton Kingdom" appeared at year's end, Olmsted took a leave from his responsibility overseeing Central Park for the position of general secretary of the United States Sanitary Commission. Established by Congressional legislation on June 18, 1861, the Sanitary Commission sought to organize support for soldiers in the field by furnishing medical care and supplies and supervising volunteer efforts. The Unitarian minister Henry Ward Bellows served as president, and the New York lawyer George Templeton Strong as treasurer.
From a base in Washington, Olmsted worked indefatigably to provide relief for the soldiers. It was a daunting task, creating hospitals, finding supplies, coordinating philanthropic efforts. He won few political friends with a report, issued after the battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, in which he claimed the soldiers suffered from a lack of food and water, exhaustion and various states of dissipation. A year later Strong noted in his diary that "when Olmsted is blue, the logic of his despondency is crushing and terrible," but he also believed that "Olmsted's sense, energy, and organizing faculty, earnestness, and honesty would give new life to the administration were he in it." 
His achievements were remarkable. Thanks to Olmsted, wounded soldiers after the battle of Antietam on Sept. 17, 1862, received supplies two days before the Army was able to get materials to the front. And after the battle of Fredericksburg, in December 1862, he established a relief depot at Aquia Landing to which wounded soldiers could be evacuated. One thankful soldier wrote, "What could we do here without the Sanitary Commission. Many of our medicines, our stimulants, blankets, bedding, etc., for the field hospital come from the S.C. I would rather have Mr. Olmsted's fame than that of any General in this war since the beginning."
Yet the more Olmsted did, the less he felt he had accomplished. Part of the problem was his need to maintain control over all aspects of the commission's work. He refused to delegate and he had an appetite for authority and power. Strong worried that a "crushing rupture" with the board was inevitable. In January 1863, he confided that "Olmsted is in an unhappy, sick, sore mental state. . . . He works like a dog all day and sits up nearly all night. . . works with steady, feverish intensity till four in the morning, sleeps on a sofa in his clothes, and breakfasts on strong coffee and pickles!!!" 
Exhausted, ill and having lost the support of the men who put him in charge, Olmsted resigned on Sept. 1, 1863. Two weeks later he left for California's Bear Valley, where he managed a gold mining company on the Mariposa Estate. He returned east in 1865, formed Olmsted, Vaux and Company, and devoted himself to designing parks. 
There were certain commonalities between shaping the landscape and helping men in battle: both endeavors required organization, discipline, energy and efficiency, qualities Olmsted had in abundance. In August 1861, Olmsted received a letter from the wife of a wealthy philanthropist, who declared that "if we can re-make the Government, abolish Slavery & get the Central Park well under weigh for our descendants, we shall have done a work worthy of the 19th century."

HEADLINE: What if the Debt Ceiling Isn't Raised?

BYLINE: DANIEL MCDERMON


HIGHLIGHT: One thing that most officials seem to agree on amid the conflict over debt is that failing to raise the federal debt ceiling will have undesirable consequences.

 BODY:
There are few signs of progress in the meetings between President Obama and Republican Congressional leaders about the need to raise the federal debt limit.
On Thursday, the president said the two sides were still "far apart," although he said recent meetings were "very constructive." For his part, the House speaker, John Boehner, said on Friday that no agreement was "imminent."
One thing that most officials seem to agree on, however, is that failing to raise the limit by the Aug. 2 deadline will have undesirable consequences. Here are some recent statements by American officials and others on the subject:"While some think we can go past August 2nd, I frankly think it puts us in an awful lot of jeopardy, and puts our economy in jeopardy, risking even more jobs." -- House Speaker John A. Boehner, July 8
"Potentially the entire world capital markets could decide, you know what, the full faith and credit of the United States doesn't mean anything. And so our credit could be downgraded, interest rates could go drastically up, and it could cause a whole new spiral into a second recession, or worse." -- President Obama, July 6."The United States would be forced into a position of defaulting on its debt. And the implications of that on our financial system, our fiscal policy and our economy would be catastrophic." -- Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, July 7.
"We don't need to tell the rest of the world that anytime people in Congress start throwing a tantrum that we're not going to pay our bills." -- Warren E. Buffett, July 7.
"The debt-ceiling trigger does offer a needed catalyst for serious negotiations on budget discipline, but avoiding even a technical default is essential. This is a risk our country must not take." -- A letter circulated by business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.
"There is no guarantee that investors would continue to re-invest in new Treasury securities. In fact, some market participants have already indicated that they would be disinclined to do so. As one of the major ratings agencies concluded in a recent report, failure to pay non-debt obligations 'would signal sever financial distress and potentially imminent debt default,' prompting the U.S. sovereign rating to be place on 'Rating Watch Negative.'" -- A letter from Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to Republican senators, June 29.A few prominent voices have suggested that raising the debt ceiling, while not ideal, would have acceptable consequences. Here are some of them."The Treasury takes in more than enough money from taxpayers to cover interest payments on the national debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office, tax revenue is estimated to be $2.23 trillion in Fiscal Year 2011 while net interest payments will only amount to $213 billion. Even if the debt ceiling remains where it is, there will be more than enough money in the Treasury to make the government's debt payments, thereby avoiding default." -- A letter to Secretary Geithner, signed by Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, and 16 other Republican senators, May 23.
"My guess is that the bond market would rally as long as it believed the ultimate outcome was going to be genuine entitlement reform - that we wouldn't even have to find out about a meltdown because it wouldn't happen." -- Stanley F. Druckenmiller, the retired manager of Duquesne Capital, May 14.Are there other prominent or notable figures who've gone on the record about the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling? Submit them in comments.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Stumbling

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
Today's Times The unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent from 9.1 percent in May, The Times's Motoko Rich reports. For the second consecutive month, employers added scarcely any jobs - startling evidence that the economic recovery is stumbling. Friday's unexpectedly weak employment figures added another layer of complication to President Obama's drive for a super-sized budget deal. While Mr. Obama hoped the number would give both parties added incentive to strike a deal before a government default, Republicans seized it to bolster their argument against tax increases while Democrats said it was reason to limit painful spending cuts. The president appeared largely alone in seeing the bad news as a call to boldness, The Times's Mark Landler reports. Democratic groups have begun amassing a centralized video archive of political caught-on-tape moments that could potentially be used against their rivals in the upcoming elections. American Bridge 21st Century has hired full-time "trackers" to record every handshake and utterance by Republican candidates in 2011 and 2012 looking for gotcha moments that could derail political ambitions or provide fodder for television ads by liberal groups next year, The Times's Michael D. Shear reports. 
Weekly Address President Obama noticed something during this week's Twitter Town Hall at the White House. While many Americans asked questions about education and energy, more wanted to know one thing: "When will both parties in Congress come together on behalf of the people who elected them?" Obviously, he said in his weekly address, Republicans and Democrats don't see eye to eye on a number of issues, but they all agree that the country cannot afford to default on its obligations. "The good news is, we agree on some of the big things," he said. "We agree that after a decade of racking up deficits and debt, we finally need to get our fiscal house in order. We agree that to do that, both sides are going to have to step outside their comfort zones and make some political sacrifices." Around the Web Representative Michele Bachmann became the first of her rivals to sign a pledge from Family Leader, an Iowa group that promotes Christian conservative social values. The group is threatening to withhold support from any candidate who does not sign the pledge in support of traditional marriage, Politico reports.Happenings around Washington President Obama will host another round of debt ceiling talks with Congressional leaders at the White House on Sunday.

HIGHLIGHT: It's all about the debt ceiling on the Sunday shows.

 BODY:
As President Obama convenes another round of debt ceiling negotiations with Congressional leaders on Sunday, lawmakers and administration officials will talk about what's at stake on the Sunday shows.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner will sit down with the hosts of CBS's "Face the Nation" and NBC's "Meet the Press" to discuss the latest on the talks as the deadline for raising the debt ceiling draws closer. Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley is on ABC's "This Week," weighing in on whether a deal can be struck in time to avoid defaulting on the government's debt.
Christine Lagarde, the new head of the International Monetary Fund, will also make an appearance on ABC, where she'll talk about the global reverberations of a United States default. In the wake of the scandal that pushed her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, to resign, she'll also address her plans to rehabilitate the I.M.F.'s image.
In addition to Mr. Geithner, two members of the Senate Budget Committee - Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, who is the committee's ranking member, and Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida - will join CBS to offer each party's perspective on the negotiations. And NBC will also feature the next segment in its "Meet the Candidates" series: Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty.
On "Fox News Sunday," Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate minority leader, and Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, will offer a glimpse of Sunday's meeting at the White House. Then Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, will give his take on what's happening in Washington and the 2012 presidential race.
CNN's "State of the Union" will bring in Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority whip, and the ranking member of the House Budget Committee, Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland.
Also on CNN: Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, talking about his campaign and next month's Iowa Straw Poll.
Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, will weigh in on the debt ceiling talks on C-Span's "Newsmakers." Mr. Jordan is chairman of the Republican Study Committee, which strives in part to promote the conservative economic agenda in the House.
Bloomberg's "Political Capital" will feature Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican freshman from Wisconsin who identifies with the Tea Party.
The conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart will join Univision's "Al Punto" this week to discuss the Hispanic community, immigration and whether the Tea Party is making strides to appeal to Hispanic voters. Also, Rene Jaquez, a special agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, will appear on Univision again to talk about the latest on the controversial "Fast and Furious" operation.
TV One's "Washington Watch" is on hiatus until the fall.

HEADLINE: This Sunday: Nocera Shoots, Scores

BYLINE: HUGO LINDGREN


HIGHLIGHT: Joe Nocera has his first cover story for us this week: an exclusive sit-down with Sheila Bair, the outgoing head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It's his customary stellar work.

 BODY:
If Joe Nocera had his way - and he usually does - it wouldn't be me writing this note, it would be him. Last fall, he was a top candidate for the job as editor of this magazine, and miraculously, I ended up with it instead. I didn't know him well at the time. In fact, the only real conversation I'd had with him before then was when I tried to lure him to come work with me at Bloomberg Businessweek. I liked him instantly, though, and before I even moved in to my new office here, we had lunch, and I asked him to be my part-time consigliere, while he kept writing his Saturday column for the business page.
This was, of course, completely self-serving on my part. I wanted Joe on my team. As a business journalist and a magazine maker, he has few peers. He has worked at a ton of top-notch places - Washington Monthly, Texas Monthly, Newsweek, Esquire, GQ and Fortune - and he's not even that old and creaky. Somehow he also found the time to write "All the Devils Are Here", an excellent account of the financial crisis, with Bethany McLean.
More impressive than Joe's resume is his winningly blunt, acerbic personality. He started coming to our weekly ideas meetings, and he shook them up every time. Few of us will ever forget the hourlong war of words he incited over the merits of Malcolm Gladwell's journalism. It was incredible fun. In private, Joe's counsel to me has been clear and consistent: Don't worry about the magazine other people want you to make. Make the magazine you want to read. Trust your instincts. Oh, and make sure to assign me lots of big features.
His involvement in the magazine has been curtailed somewhat by his new gig as a twice-a-week columnist for the opinion page, but in this issue, he has his first cover story for us: an exclusive sit-down with Sheila Bair, the outgoing head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It's his customary stellar work - knowledgeable and wise, assiduously reported and flawlessly written. If you want to understand the crushing power of the financial industry in Washington, this is required reading. I am proud to publish it in the magazine, and to have Joe as a trusted adviser and good friend.

HEADLINE: Inside the List

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
JERSEY GIRL: Janet Evanovich's ''Smokin' Seventeen'' jumps past Tom Clancy's ''Against All Enemies'' to give Evanovich her 12th straight No. 1 hardcover best seller in her Stephanie Plum series. Evanovich may have left her hometown, South River, N.J., for the more scenic climes of Naples, Fla., but her endearingly semi-competent bounty hunter heroine is still running around the Garden State chasing bad guys, juggling boyfriends and serving as a one-woman stimulus program for the used-car industry. Evanovich's Web site includes a memorial page for the ill-fated vehicles that have crossed Stephanie's path, from the Chevy Nova in ''One for the Money'' (''Left for dead, which is O.K. since it had already been vandalized and had no muffler, tailpipe or radio'') to the Carpet Car in ''Hot Six'' (''caught on fire from flaming dog poop in a bag''), the Honda CRV in ''Hard Eight'' (''firebombed by a rabbit'') and a maroon Econoline van from ''Fearless Fourteen,'' which ''wasn't really Stephanie's, but caught her bad car juju anyway, struck by a russet potato and exploded, as predicted by Gary the Stalker.'' Normally, Evanovich also holds a summerlong naming contest for next year's book (''Holy Cannoli Seventeen,'' anyone?) 
, but she recently announced her next title early, during an interview on the ''Today'' show. Yup, you guessed it: ''Explosive Eighteen.''
JERSEY BOY: Last summer's Plum caper, ''Sizzling Sixteen,'' pops up at No. 2 on the mass-market paperback fiction list, but Evanovich has a way to go before catching up in the world-domination department with her fellow Jersey native, George R. R. Martin, who grew up the son of a longshoreman in Bayonne. Three of the four installments thus far of Martin's ''Song of Ice and Fire'' fantasy series are on both the mass-market and trade fiction lists, thanks to the frenzy over the HBO adaptation ''Game of Thrones,'' named for the first book in the series. And the fifth installment, ''A Dance With Dragons,'' seems a sure bet to storm to the top of the hardcover list after its release on July 12. Martin's novels may be conspicuously lacking in cannoli and Springsteen references, but more than one reader has seen a bit of hardscrabble postindustrial America in the medieval realm of Westeros. The novelist David Benioff, one of the creators of the HBO series, has called it '' 'The Sopranos' in Middle Earth,'' while the humorist John Hodgman, writing recently in Time, compared the experience of reading ''A Game of Thrones'' to cramming the full run of ''The Wire,'' another HBO product that inspires cultish devotion. ''Both kidnapped me to intimately drawn worlds with stories of a grim conflict and characters so achingly human that you end up rooting, tragically, for both sides. And neither one has dragons in it -- at least, not at first,'' Hodgman wrote, before admitting an annoying compulsion ''to pull you aside and tell you that Tyrion Lannister is the best character in fiction since Stringer Bell and that if you have not read these books, you should be ashamed of yourself.''
ROAD WARRIOR: T. S. Eliot made headlines last month when a souped-up digital edition of ''The Waste Land'' zoomed past Marvel Comics and the Bible to become the top-grossing book app for the iPad. Now, it's Jack Kerouac's turn, thanks to an ''amplified edition'' of ''On the Road'' featuring video clips, slide shows and an interactive map of Kerouac's own road trips. It recently hit No. 2 on the iPad list, behind a tie-in with the Pixar movie ''Cars 2'' but ahead of ''Dora's Ballet Adventure,'' the latest from Dora the Explorer. Isn't she too young to drive?

 BODY:
THE WRECKAGE
By Michael Robotham
439 pp. Mulholland Books/Little, Brown & Company. $24.99.
On his Web site, the Australian novelist Michael Robotham is prominently identified as an ''international crime writer,'' but if you dig a little deeper, you'll discover that he worked as a journalist on Fleet Street before turning to novel-writing in 2004. Since then, he's written seven novels including his latest, ''The Wreckage.'' That's seven books in seven years: writer's block is one problem this guy doesn't have.
''The Wreckage'' turns out to be the kind of international crime thriller with short, punchy chapters that shift abruptly -- suspensefully, even -- from London to Baghdad to Washington and other locales, just like the movies. Robotham says in his acknowledgments that the book is ''based on many real-life events and documents.'' One such event is the disappearance, and presumed theft, of billions of dollars worth of cash that the Federal Reserve shipped to Iraq to help grease the country's wheels in the initial aftermath of the allied invasion. This really did happen. The nonfiction version was told a few years ago by the celebrated investigative team of Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele in Vanity Fair. 
Another event, though, was the financial crisis of 2008, which, until the book's denouement, hums quietly in the background. ''He's listening to the radio,'' Robotham writes of one of his characters, a retired detective in London. ''Stories about Iraq and Afghanistan. A U.S. Senate hearing into Goldman Sachs. Accusations of reckless greed.''
''Here you can shoot the bad guys,'' an American mercenary in Baghdad says in another early passage. ''In America we give them corporate bonuses and promote them to Treasury secretary.''
I read ''The Wreckage'' on vacation, on a beach in Mexico -- a good call on my part; it's nothing if not a summer read. Sitting under a beach umbrella, I knocked it off in a couple of days.
I don't say that disrespectfully. It's the kind of book that's meant to be knocked off. ''The Wreckage'' has the kind of crisp, mildly implausible dialogue that marks the modern commercial thriller. Its pleasantly convoluted plot makes sense so long as you don't examine it too closely. There are plenty of murders, chases, explosions and general mayhem.
Lots of one-sentence paragraphs.
You get the idea.
It's also got a fistful of main characters, from the journalist in Baghdad who decides he can no longer just sit on the sidelines to the sexy United Nations accountant who falls in love with him even as she uncovers the fate of the missing billions. In London, a young woman with a troubled past robs people to pay the rent, and is being pursued by the bad guys because of a document she has unwittingly stolen. After she robs the retired detective -- who is, of course, hard-bitten but with a heart o' gold -- he becomes her protector. There's a hit man. Some C.I.A. operatives. A few terrorists.
Is it unfair to describe the characters in ''The Wreckage'' as cartoonish? A little, maybe. But they're not George Smiley, either. Does it matter? Not really.
Given my background as a business journalist, I found myself particularly interested in the financiers. The Bach family -- Alistair, the father, and Mitchell, the son -- run Mersey Fidelity, a London firm meant to bear a passing resemblance to Goldman Sachs. Even as other firms were crumbling under the weight of the crisis, Mersey Fidelity came through not just unscathed but stronger than ever. Nobody quite knows how they did it -- and those who do know aren't saying.
In the post-crisis world, as one character puts it, ''Mersey Fidelity was being touted as the beacon of the new banking system. It's supposed to provide the Bank of England with a blueprint for new banking laws.''
I don't think it will ruin your enjoyment of the novel if I divulge that the Bachs are in league with the bad guys. It's pretty obvious from the start that's where ''The Wreckage'' is headed. Not only does it turn out that Mersey Fidelity is deeply involved in the theft of all that money in Baghdad, but there are also ''whispers'' about how it survived the crisis without needing a government bailout. Drug money was funneled into certain banks, keeping them alive. Regulators looked the other way, according to one character, ''because it helped keep bank doors open.''
This is where my credulity was stretched to the breaking point. It is certainly possible that some bank, somewhere, courted drug money during the financial crisis, but it sure didn't happen on Wall Street or in London. To Robotham's credit, though, this plot twist didn't prevent me from finishing the book. He'd succeeded so well at peeling the onion slowly -- it's one of his real strengths as a writer -- that by the time he trotted out this notion, I had too much momentum to stop reading.
Thus the real question becomes this: Will the firm get away with it, even after its crimes are exposed in the newspaper? To put it another way, is Robotham one of the tens of millions of people who are jaded and cynical and angry about the way the big banks brought the financial world to the brink of ruin, committed transgressions that were, if not illegal, certainly immoral, took bailouts from the taxpayers and then walked away scot-free, acting as if they had nothing to apologize for? Would he use his book to make a point about their mendacity?
I can't tell you that, of course. It would wreck the surprise.

HEADLINE: Where Classics Hold Court, a Change of Venue

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
THE headline-making classic-car events in the United States are generally taken to be the coastal affairs: the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance in March, on Florida's Atlantic coast, and the Pebble Beach concours, on the Monterey Peninsula of California, in August. 
Perhaps the most prominent event between those -- geographically and chronologically -- may have been, for the last 32 years, the Meadow Brook Concours d'Elegance. It took place in July at Meadow Brook Hall, the former home of Matilda Dodge Wilson, on the grounds of Oakland University in Rochester, Mich.
But amid the economic troubles of 2009, the event fell onto somewhat hard times. Concours thrive on corporate sponsorships, and that year they simply dried up.
This year, the show -- now called the Concours d'Elegance of America -- has moved an hour southwest to Plymouth.
The show's executive director, Jim McCarter, said the buzz surrounding the event and the corporate sponsorships were back, with Buick, Cadillac, Chrysler, Ford, GMC and Mercedes-Benz Financial Services all participating. The number of cars on display will be 330, up nearly 100 from last year. The 100 Years of Indy display alone includes 33 Indianapolis 500 racecars.
''The primary reason for the move was the on-site hotel accommodations, which give greater opportunity for the sponsors, spectators and exhibitors to mingle,'' he said. ''We essentially own the inn Friday, Saturday and Sunday and have multiple activities going on, versus just having the event on Sunday last year.''
The concours is July 31 at the Inn at St. John's at 44045 Five Mile Road in Plymouth, Mich. Admission is $25 for adults and free for children under 12. Information is at www.concoursusa.org. There will be a classic car sale by RM Auctions on Saturday.

HEADLINE: Somehow, the Unemployed Became Invisible

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
GRIM number of the week: 14,087,000.
Fourteen million, in round numbers -- that is how many Americans are now officially out of work.
Word came Friday from the Labor Department that, despite all the optimistic talk of an economic recovery, unemployment is going up, not down. The jobless rate rose to 9.2 percent in June.
What gives? And where, if anywhere, is the outrage?
The United States is in the grips of its gravest jobs crisis since Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House. Lose your job, and it will take roughly nine months to find a new one. That is off the charts. Many Americans have simply given up. 
But unless you're one of those unhappy 14 million, you might not even notice the problem. The budget deficit, not jobs, has been dominating the conversation in Washington. Unlike the hard-pressed in, say, Greece or Spain, the jobless in America seem, well, subdued. The old fire has gone out.
In some ways, this boils down to math, both economic and political. Yes, 9.2 percent of the American work force is unemployed -- but 90.8 percent of it is working. To elected officials, the unemployed are a relatively small constituency. And with apologies to Karl Marx, the workers of the world, particularly the unemployed, are also no longer uniting.
Nor are they voting -- or at least not as much as people with jobs. In 2010, some 46 percent of working Americans who were eligible to vote did so, compared with 35 percent of the unemployed, according to Michael McDonald, a political scientist at George Mason University. There was a similar turnout gap in the 2008 election.
No wonder policy makers don't fear unemployed Americans. The jobless are, politically speaking, more or less invisible.
It wasn't always so. During the Great Depression, riots erupted on the bread lines. Even in the 1980s and 1990s, angry workers descended on Washington by the busload.
''There used to be a sense that unemployment was rich soil for radicalization and revolt,'' says Nelson Lichtenstein, a professor of labor history at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ''That was a motif in American history for a long time, but we don't seem to have that anymore.''
But why? It's partly because of the greater dispersion of the unemployed, and partly because of the weakening of the institutions that previously mobilized them.
Unemployment doesn't necessarily beget apathy, Mr. McDonald says. Rather, demographic groups that are more likely to be unemployed also happen to be the same groups that are less likely to vote to begin with, such as the poor and the low-skilled.
Even so, numerousstudies have shown that unemployment leads to feelings of shame and a loss of self-worth. And that is not particularly conducive to political organizing. As Heather Boushey, an economist at the liberal Center for American Progress, puts it, rather bluntly: ''Nobody wants to join the Lame Club.''
That's not to say that disillusionment about the economy will just fade away. But unless something changes, the unemployed seem unlikely to gain real political potency soon.
''There's an illusion that grass-roots activity just begins spontaneously, that people get mad and suddenly say, 'I'm not going to take it anymore!' '' says Michael Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University. ''But that's not how it happens.''
Intellectuals used to play a big role in organizing labor. In the 1930s, Communists and socialists were a major force. Later, labor unions stepped in.
But today's unions are not set up to serve the unemployed; they generally organize around workplaces, after all.
Just ask Rick McHugh, who worked in Michigan as an employment lawyer for the United Automobile Workers from the 1980s through the 1990s. He represented workers who were appealing denials of unemployment insurance benefits. The union footed the bill for people he represented who were not, and had never been, U.A.W. members.
Today, however, many unions are fighting for their own survival. They no longer provide such support for nonmembers. ''They just don't have the staff and the resources to support these programs and the recipients like they used to,'' says Mr. McHugh, now a staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project.
Workers have also become suburbanized. Back in the 1960s or even the 1980s, the unemployed organized around welfare or unemployment offices. It was a fertile environment: people were anxious and tired and waiting for hours in line.
''We stood outside of these offices, with their huge lines, and passed out leaflets that said things like: 'If you're upset about what's happening to you, come to this meeting at this church basement in two weeks. We'll get together and do something about this,' '' recalls Barney Oursler, a longtime community organizer and co-founder of the Mon Valley Unemployed Committee in the early 1980s. ''The response just made your heart get big. 'Oh, my God,' they'd say, 'I thought I was alone.' ''
The Mon Valley Unemployed Committee, which is based in Pittsburgh, helped organize workers in 26 cities across five states, simply by hanging around outside t unemployment offices and harnessing the frustration.
Today, though, many unemployment offices have closed. Jobless benefits are often handled by phone or online rather than in person. An unemployment call center near Mr. Oursler, for instance, now sits behind two sets of locked doors and frosted windows.
In other countries, workers have mobilized online. Unions here, too, have reached out on the Web. They include groups like Working America (the community affiliate of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.) and UCubed (created by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers).
But many Web sites geared toward the unemployed aren't about mobilizing workers. Many instead provide guidance about things like posting resumes online, or simply offer the comfort of an online community.
It's not clear why this is the case, when social networks have been so essential to organizing economic protests in places like Britain and Greece, not to mention political movements in the Middle East.
''You have to remember that technology is not independent of social structures, motivations and politics,'' Mr. Kazin says. ''People can feel like they have their own community online, which is useful emotionally, but they also have to have the desire and demand to do something about their situation first before they start using that online presence to organize anything in person.''
To the extent that frustrations are being channeled at all, they are being channeled largely through the Tea Party. But the Tea Party is mostly against devoting government resources to helping the unemployed.
Tea Party activists, for example, are more likely to believe that providing benefits to poor people encourages them to stay poor, and to believe that economic stimulus has made the economy worse.
Why populist anger over the poor economy is leaning right, rather than left, this time around is a bit of a mystery. Perhaps it is because Democrats, traditional friends of labor, control the White House and the Senate.
Mr. Lichtenstein, the historian, notes that it took awhile for the poor to mobilize in the Great Depression. Many initially saw President Roosevelt as an ally and only later became disillusioned. As Langston Hughes wrote in a 1934 poem, ''The Ballad of Roosevelt'':
The pot was empty,
The cupboard was bare.
I said, Papa,
What's the matter here?
I'm waitin' on Roosevelt, son,
Roosevelt, Roosevelt,
Waitin' on Roosevelt, son.
For the moment, jobless Americans are waiting on President Obama. If unemployment stays as high as many expect, and millions exhaust their benefits, they may just find their voice in 2012.

HEADLINE: Playing Markets Others Shun

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
FRETFULNESS overtook optimism among stock investors in the second quarter. Many markets started the year strongly. Then, as spring turned to summer, recession worries rumbled back in the United States, debt continued to dog Europe, and inflation fears re-emerged in some emerging economies. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.4 percent for the quarter, and several key international markets, including China and India, also chalked up losses.
Amid the worry and woe, managers of three of the quarter's better-performing funds found opportunities in segments that some investors shun: hard-core value stocks, lesser-known Asian markets and biotechnology.
A Strict Focus on Value 
Few managers seem to take value-hunting as seriously as those at the Longleaf Partners Small-Cap fund: O. Mason Hawkins and G. Staley Cates. Their fund, which carries an expense ratio of 0.92 percent, returned 3.71 percent in the second quarter.
Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Cates like to buy the sort of dirt-cheap stocks that Warren E. Buffett has famously called ''cigar butts.'' These days, Mr. Buffett typically skips over castoffs, opting to buy pricier fare as long as he's confident that a company has a competitive advantage. But Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Cates still seek those half-smoked stogies. ''We'll never compromise the principle about buying really cheaply,'' Mr. Cates said.
Their refusal to consider anything but bargains means that their fund, which is closed to new investors, can build up a hefty hoard of cash. On May 31, in fact, cash accounted for about 15 percent of its $3.4 billion in assets. ''We demand high quality but want a great price, and there typically aren't a lot of those stocks around,'' Mr. Cates said.
The managers aim for shares that trade for no more than 60 percent of their estimate of value.
Often, that means betting on companies with overlooked assets. Consider Dillard's, the department store chain. When Longleaf bought in several years ago, the stock was trading in the teens, but its real estate alone -- Dillard's owns most of its stores' buildings -- was worth $60 to $70 a share, Mr. Hawkins says. The company was struggling but had laid plans for a turnaround, and the Longleaf managers believed that it could deliver. Their faith has begun to pay off: Dillard's ended the quarter at more than $50 a share.
Longleaf typically owns just a handful of stocks, and Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Cates stick with favorites for years. Thus, at the end of March, the fund had only 22 holdings and an average annual turnover of 17 percent, according to Morningstar.
All Eyes on Asia
Richard H. Gao and Sharat Shroff, co-managers of the Matthews Pacific Tiger fund, are similarly loath to shed holdings. Despite investing in a volatile region -- Asia, minus Japan -- they have been trading less often than the Longleaf managers do. The fund's average annual turnover, measured in March, was 11 percent.
Pacific Tiger's institutional shares returned 4.09 percent in the second quarter. The fund has an expense ratio of 1.09 percent and holds $5.5 billion in assets.
''Our underlying philosophy is that, if you can find solid businesses that can survive economic cycles, then the best way to create shareholder value is to stick with them over several years,'' Mr. Shroff said.
Tingyi, for example, is a company that Pacific Tiger has held through years of economic ups and downs, he said. A Chinese maker of instant noodles and ready-to-drink teas, it has faced ''inflation and commodity-price pressures in the past, and it has always gained market share,'' he said. ''It always manages to emerge stronger.''
The fund's investment in Tingyi aims to exploit China's evolution toward an economy geared more to consumption than to exports. In all of their Asia investments, Mr. Gao said, ''we don't have much exposure to manufacturing or to companies that rely on export growth or cheap labor.''
The fund also has holdings in sectors like health care, which aren't considered consumption plays per se. ''Consumption is about share of the consumer's wallet, where his money is going, and increasingly in Asia, that's to health care,'' Mr. Shroff said.
China and India, two of Asia's burlier economies, account for a big chunk of Pacific Tiger's assets, but Mr. Gao and Mr. Shroff have made outsize bets on other markets, like Indonesia. At the end of May, 8.6 percent of the fund's assets were invested there, more than twice the weighting of their benchmark index.
''We want to find companies that will deliver sustainable growth,'' Mr. Shroff said. ''If we find them in China, so be it. If we find them in Indonesia, so be it.''
Banking on Biotech
Like the emerging Asian markets, biotechnology has a reputation as a promising long-term place to invest, if you can stomach the risk.
For Rajiv Kaul, a strong stomach was a condition of employment. His fund, the Fidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio, must invest at least 80 percent of its assets in biotech. The fund, which has $1.3 billion in assets and an expense ratio of 0.87 percent, returned 10.17 percent in the second quarter.
Mr. Kaul says biotech investing has a riskier reputation than it deserves. Too many people equate the basic science -- which consumes much money and takes years to yield drugs -- with the established, cash-generating companies, he said. ''I don't view this as investing in scientific experiments,'' he said. ''I view it as investing in good businesses.''
And solid biotechs -- those with money-earning drugs and promising pipelines -- are arguably less risky than other companies because their moneymakers are typically protected by patents, he said. ''A lot of the larger biotechs can be pretty predictable because they're making medicines that people have to take,'' he said.
Consider Genentech, whose products include the breast cancer drug Herceptin. ''That's basically a cure -- patients can live normal lives,'' he said.
Similarly, Amgen, the largest holding in Mr. Kaul's portfolio on March 31, at 18.3 percent of assets, produces a raft of sought-after treatments, including the arthritis drug Enbrel. Mr. Kaul bet big on Amgen because of its healthy cash flows.
''If you look at the cash-flow generation of the industry, the top 20 companies probably account for 90 percent,'' he said. ''Biotech is perceived as risky, but for companies with cash flows, it's much less risky than the broader market.''

HEADLINE: Executive Pay, Revisited

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''We Knew They Got Raises. But This?'' (July 3), which offered updated figures on executive pay packages for 2010:
Having spent my entire working career in the elementary classroom, I know little about the business world other than what I read in the newspaper. Still, I must wonder whether any C.E.O.'s are worth the pay and bonuses they receive. Sure, in the competitive world of business, a skilled executive should draw more than those who work for him or her, but why do the awards have to be so astronomical?
As a retired California teacher, my pension is modest. Yet I have no complaints: this monthly retirement pay allows me to pay the rent, put food on the table. As skilled as C.E.O.'s must be in management, I wonder if any of them could manage a class of 32 active third graders, keep order, promote learning, teach how to behave and treat others fairly while maintaining his or her sanity in front of the class? Barney Scott 
Spring Valley, Calif., July 3
To the Editor:
There is a simple solution to the problem of executive pay that would also help balance the federal budget.
Not that long before Reaganomics, the highest income tax rate in the United States was in the area of 90 percent. If we now instituted a top rate of, say, 75 to 80 percent, adjusted downward for lower earners, we would not only raise badly needed government revenue but would also put an end to excessive executive pay.
Why? No corporate board would approve disproportionately high compensation while knowing that most of the money would go to the I.R.S. Corporate managers would consider that wasteful -- such is the psychology of many of the wealthy.
Runaway executive pay inflation is a fairly recent phenomenon, born of irresponsible tax cuts. Sound tax policy effectively curbs excesses while creating a prosperous society through public benefits.
Gretchen Kaapcke
Santa Fe, N.M., July 4
To the Editor:
My daughter just completed four years of college, graduating with honors. She is one of many graduates seeking employment in this difficult economy. I wonder if any of these extremely well-paid executives would consider giving up some $1 million or $2 million of their pay packages and creating a few entry-level jobs for these young people needing a break.
Such amounts from the executives' huge paychecks would surely not be missed. Cheryl Williams
Manila, July 4
To the Editor:
According to the theory of trickle-down economics, all of those at the bottom of the economic ladder now have something to cheer about: the steep climb in the pay of our high-end corporate leaders.
Those executives had a median pay gain of 23 percent in 2010, so if the trickle-down idea works, there will surely be plenty to trickle down to all of us. Or, instead, has our economic system evolved from a shared-wealth society into one that benefits the few at the top, while the rest, including many recent public employees, are humiliated by having their pensions, health care benefits, and salaries reduced or frozen by government edict? Morris Roth

HEADLINE: The Plunge: Richmond

BYLINE: By EVAN WAGSTAFF. 
ewagstaff@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
A point of pride in Point Richmond, the Plunge's big indoor pool has brought joy to residents for three-quarters of a century. After being closed for nine years, it reopened as a state-of-the-art facility in August 2010.EVAN WAGSTAFF 
Retro Style
The landmark 1926 building on the corner of Richmond Avenue and Dornan Drive features a sign that reads ''Municipal Natatorium'' (the Plunge's official name) in marquee style evocative of an old cinema. The Plunge features a 60-by-160-foot heated pool, a tiled outer fountain, an observation deck, and an open truss ceiling to let light and air into the space.
Taking the Plunge
Several other Plunges dotted the state at the beginning of the century. The Santa Cruz Plunge was opened in 1907, the San Diego Plunge made its debut in 1925, and the Hayward Plunge was built in 1936.
Nata-What?
Any swimming pool can be called a natatorium, but the word is typically used to describe a building that houses a pool, often with attached locker rooms and showers.
Everyone In!
Richmond's population was 20,000 when the Plunge was built but it increased tenfold with the influx of workers to the Kaiser shipyards during the war. Tensions flared in the newly racially diverse city, but the Plunge was known as a place where all residents could enjoy swimming together.
Sink or Swim
As Richmond faced increasing economic hardship, the Plunge struggled to stay afloat and suffered from years of deferred maintenance. ''Swim at your own risk'' signs were posted in 1997. The center shut down in 2001.
Coming Up for Air
Richmond community groups joined with the city to restore the facility. A combination of volunteer service, bond allocations, state endowments for historical preservation, and city support helped finance the $8 million renovation.
Making Waves
The Plunge is open seven days a week for swimming, aquatic fitness programs and water sports like kayaking. Admission for open swimming sessions is $6, with discounts for children and city residents.
Sun Kissed
The new pool is heated by solar panels; the water is sanitized with ultraviolet disinfectant and saline chlorination systems, which minimize the smell and burn associated with community pools. The water's salinity level matches that of teardrops. Todd Jersey, the architect, said the Plunge is one of the most environmentally friendly pools in the country.

HEADLINE: Action! Romance! Social Justice!

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
SUMMER reading often consists of mindless page-turners, equally riveting and vacuous. So as a public service I'm delighted to offer a list of mindful page-turners -- so full of chase scenes, romance and cliffhangers that you don't mind the redeeming social value.
These are 10 triumphs of fiction, both fun to read and significant for literary or historical reasons. I guarantee pleasure and also bragging rights at your next cocktail party. And if your kids read these, I bet they'll ace the SAT. 
I did lard my list with great novels relating to social justice: at a time when inequality in America has soared to historic levels, it seems useful to exercise the conscience as well as the imagination. So here's my quirky list: Best Beach Reading Ever.
''Germinal,'' Emile Zola's masterpiece, describes coal miners in France during a strike in the 1860s. Its description of the idealist Etienne and his love interest, Catherine, and of their struggles and dreams of a better life, makes this an enchanting read. You're transported back into one of the battlegrounds of the Industrial Revolution, and come to understand the labor movement's origins in a way that no history book could teach.
''Pale Fire'' isn't as well-known as the wickedly funny ''Lolita,'' also by Vladimir Nabokov, but it should be. ''Pale Fire'' is a dazzling feat of imagination and literature, unlike any other novel I know of. It's an epic poem, an adventure about the mysterious land of Zembla, and most of all a puzzle: Is a key figure insane?
''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' by Harriet Beecher Stowe, who was born 200 years ago this year, is the novel that made slavery impossible for America to tolerate any longer. It's a profoundly moving read, a tear-jerker, and a shattering window into one of this country's original sins. Some schools today ban it because of its use of the N-word, but it remains a powerful and illuminating exploration of the human dimensions of slavery in America.
''The Grapes of Wrath'' is John Steinbeck's legendary account of an Oklahoma family's struggles during the Great Depression. Tom Joad and his family abandon all that they have and make their way to California in hopes of a better life -- but find the playing field always tilted against them. With the nation still recovering from the Great Recession, this is the perfect time to read about Tom's travails.
''Wuthering Heights,'' by Emily Bronte, may be literature's greatest love story. Catherine must choose between her soul mate, Heathcliff, who lacks status and education, and the far more respectable Edgar. The characters are achingly luminous: they are shaped by 19th-century presumptions about class and male dominance, but are subject to irrepressible human emotions.
''Our Man in Havana,'' by Graham Greene, is a comedy and spy thriller that might seem a bit low-brow for this list. But two of the lessons we never quite learn in foreign policy are that nothing goes as planned, and that intelligence scoops are always suspect. Greene's story of a hapless spy in Cuba makes those points in an unforgettable way. The spy has nothing real to report, so he begins to make things up, and then the drama becomes deadly.
''All Quiet on the Western Front,'' by Erich Maria Remarque, may be the most renowned war novel ever. It tells the story of a young man and his school friends who join the German Army in World War I, and their discovery that war isn't glorious, it's a tedious nightmare.
''Les Miserables,'' by Victor Hugo, tells of Jean Valjean, who has just been released from prison for attempting to steal a loaf of bread to feed his sister's family. He is relentlessly pursued by Inspector Javert in a nail-biting yarn, with better chase scenes than anything in a James Bond movie. This is also a beautifully crafted exploration of social class, justice, redemption and mercy.
''The Mysterious Stranger'' isn't Mark Twain's most famous work, and it doesn't make you laugh out loud like ''The Prince and the Pauper'' or ''A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.'' But it is a short story that wrestles with questions of God and evil. It tells of a callous angel who drops in on a village and wreaks havoc. The angel makes tiny clay people come alive and then, for amusement, destroys them with a storm, a fire and an earthquake. Like all Twain, it's immensely readable -- and more than most short stories, it makes you think.
''Scoop,'' by Evelyn Waugh, is a hilarious dissection of the tabloid news business, centered on a nature writer who is mistakenly dispatched to cover a war in Africa. I wish I could say that ''Scoop'' is simply an absurd comic satire. But anyone who has covered Iraq or Afghanistan knows that it is still resonant -- and relevant. And if you read it, you'll get a sense of the uncertain and often unreliable path by which news coverage reaches you.

HEADLINE: Bubble? What Bubble?

BYLINE: By ANDREW GOLDMAN

 BODY:
Marc Andreessen, one of Silicon Valley's biggest venture capitalists, has no fear.
Contrary to all the recent hype about a bubble, you've said that tech companies are actually undervalued. So in true 1999 fashion, should I take my life savings out of mutual funds and toss it into tech stocks?
I'm certainly not an investment adviser, but on a 30-year basis, these things are cheap. If you compare how big industrial companies like G.E. are valued compared with big tech companies like Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Apple, tech stocks have never been valued more poorly in comparison. So not only is there no bubble -- these prices are reflective of the fact that the market still hates tech. This bubble talk is about everybody being unbelievably psychologically scarred from 10 years ago. 
Your venture-capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, is heavily invested in Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare. You're hardly an unbiased observer.
True, but the counterargument is I put my money where my mouth is.
The nearly $3 billion I.P.O. of Netscape, a company you helped found, has been cited as the beginning of the 1990s tech bubble. Do you recall a moment back then that felt like the last days of the Roman Empire?
There was a point in the late '90s where all the graduating M.B.A.'s wanted to start companies in Silicon Valley, and for the most part they were not actually qualified to do it. They brought the whole sideshow of the hype and parties and all that crap. M.B.A. graduating classes are actually a reliable contrary indicator: if they all want to go into investment banking, there's going to be a financial crisis. If they want to go into tech, that means a bubble is forming.
How has the M.B.A. migration been lately?
It's heating up again, but it's still not anything near like it was in '99. And even though people love to badmouth '99 and 2000, you also have to remember that's when Google got built.
After hearing a story about Foursquare's co-founder, Dennis Crowley, walking into a press event in athletic wear and eating a banana, I developed a theory that bubbles might be predicted by fashion: when tech founders can't be bothered to appear businesslike, the power has shifted too much in their favor.
Believe it or not, this goes deep into the interior mentality of the engineer, which is very truth-oriented. When you're dealing with machines or anything that you build, it either works or it doesn't, no matter how good of a salesman you are. So engineers not only don't care about the surface appearance, but they view attempts to kind of be fake on the surface as fundamentally dishonest.
That reminds me of Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of ''The Social Network.'' He said that ''filmmakers can't get their head around the idea that someone might build something because they like building things.''
Aaron Sorkin was completely unable to understand the actual psychology of Mark or of Facebook. He can't conceive of a world where social status or getting laid or, for that matter, doing drugs, is not the most important thing.
People view you as an oracle in the valley. I was hoping you'd blow my mind with something you see in the future. Gordon Bell at Microsoft is working on wearable computing, where it literally records everything around you all the time -- video, your conversations. He wants to get to where it's like a pendant around your neck. We also have a company called Jawbone that makes peripherals for smart phones and tablets. Today, they sell Bluetooth headsets and speakers, but soon they will sell all kinds of wearable computing devices.
Will we soon be dealing with antigaming laws so that drivers can't play wearable video games while driving down the highway?
That assumes they're driving. Google is working on self-driving cars, and they seem to work. People are so bad at driving cars that computers don't have to be that good to be much better. Any time you stand in line at the D.M.V. and look around, you're like, Oh, my God, I wish all these people were replaced by computer drivers. Ten to 20 years out, driving your car will be viewed as equivalently immoral as smoking cigarettes around other people is today.

HEADLINE: The Library Is Closed, but You Can Still Get Books

BYLINE: By JAMIE HANSEN. 
jhansen@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
At San Jose's Seven Trees Library, books are coming and going, even though the building is closed.
One of four new or soon-to-be-finished branches of the San Jose Public Library system, Seven Trees was completed last fall. It has new shelves and a technology center -- but no staff to run it until the financially pressed city can find a way to pay salaries. 
The four libraries amount to 68,000 square feet of library space, the product of a bond measure that passed in 2000 at the height of the Internet bubble. None of the libraries currently have a budget to hire employees.
Still, Seven Trees' shiny two-story building, which includes a first-floor community center that opened in October, attracts a steady stream of would-be library patrons. And community center workers have gotten used to redirecting them to a small corner room under a sign that says, ''Friends Book Sale.''
Last Tuesday morning, Wilma Hashii, the president of the Friends of the Seven Trees Library, was sorting a crate of donated books in the room, when a woman poked in her head.
''Do you have any Afro-American kids' books?'' she asked.
''No, we're out,'' said Ms. Hashii, gesturing to the slim stack of children's books on the bottom shelf and explaining that the section was hit hard during the holiday weekend. ''But I'll be at the King Library later, and I'll be sure to pick some up for you.''
Ms. Hashii was already president of Friends of Seven Trees when the original building closed in 2008 to make way for the new library. When San Jose passed its slim budget this June, it became clear that the library would stay closed.
San Jose is expecting up to a $100 million deficit in 2012-13. Mayor Chuck Reed has promised to open all four libraries by the time he leaves office at the end of 2014, but in the meantime Ms. Hashii and other volunteers are filling the gap.
Instead of just selling the donated books to raise money, as Friends groups usually do, the Friends of Seven Trees Library also decided to set up an informal book-loan operation.
Now Ms. Hashii, a retired library clerk, keeps a mental list of her readers' needs as she sorts donations. A man with white hair and thick glasses says he is on the lookout for large-print books. Mothers come to read with their children on the one folding chair in the little space, so Ms. Hashii looks for more picture books. A Spanish-speaking woman is teaching herself to read and has asked for easy Spanish books.
''It's something the community really seems to be taking to,'' Ms. Hashii said.
As Ms. Hashii prepared to leave, a local resident, Rudy Gonzales, wandered in to look over the selection.
''It's a nice thing you have here,'' he told her. ''And it will be really nice when the library opens in the near future.''
Ms. Hashii cast a doubtful eye at a sign saying the library would open in 2012 and returned to filling her few shelves with books.

HEADLINE: Shreds of NASA History, Going on the Block

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
It was two weeks before the liftoff of the Apollo 11 mission when Thomas Moser's boss walked into his office at NASA and announced, ''We're putting a flag on the moon.'' 
Mr. Moser, then a 30-year-old mechanical engineer, was put in charge of designing a flag mechanism that could not only fit into the lunar module and survive the flight, but also make the flag appear to fly on the windless moon.
His solution involved two sections of a staff, a telescoping tube and a nylon flag bought at a local housing goods store (Sears, he thinks). But in order for the flag to fit the staff, its edges needed to be trimmed. ''They were throwing it all in the trash,'' Mr. Moser recalled of the remnants in a recent interview, ''so I picked it up out of the trash can, mounted it and had Neil Armstrong sign it.''
Forty-two years later, Mr. Moser is auctioning off those flag remnants. The expected selling price: $100,000.
''There's so much attention on the manned space program right now that the timing may be good,'' Mr. Moser said, referring to the final launching of the space shuttleAtlantis on Friday.
Mr. Moser's flag shreds are the star lot of an extensive space memorabilia auction being held in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Sunday. Other notable items include the astronaut Deke Slayton's handwritten training notes from the Mercury program and dozens of heat shields, crew patches and other ephemera that once transcended earthly bounds.
For collectors, the remnants of the space flag are ''comparable to a Betsy Ross flag or the flag flying over the port in Baltimore in 1812,'' said Michael Orenstein, who is overseeing the auction for Goldberg Coins and Collectibles. Two days before the auction, online pre-bidding for the lot had reached $49,999.
But trading in space nostalgia can be a dangerous business. In June, investigators confiscated a triangular nub of transparent tape an eighth of an inch wide from an auction house in St. Louis because it contained tiny particles of moon dust. Selling moon rocks, no matter how small, is illegal, as is selling NASA property that the agency has not willingly disposed of.
Mr. Orenstein said that his auction contained no moon particles, and that all NASA property in the sale had been discarded by the agency long ago. A NASA spokesman declined to comment on the status of the items.
There are also economic concerns. The collectibles market tends to follow the overall economy; when money is tight, even avid collectors are less likely to spend money on memorabilia. But Mr. Orenstein said he believed that rule did not apply to one-of-a-kind items like the flag remnants. ''Just give me two flag collectors who can't live without it,'' he said.
As for Mr. Moser, he does not plan to attend the auction, but he was at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday to watch the Atlantis lift off. ''I spent most of my life developing the shuttle,'' said Mr. Moser, who retired from NASA in 1989 after 25 years with the agency. ''I was there from sketch pad to launch pad.''

HEADLINE: When S'Mores Aren't Enough

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
Greeley, Pa.
MICKEY BLACK, in khaki shorts and a polo shirt, is pacing the crossroads at Pine Forest Camp.
Up to the flagpole, down the hill to the dining hall. Up to the basketball court, down to the infirmary.
On this cloudless late June morning, here amid the knotty pine bungalows and the electric campfire, Mr. Black is anxious.
He has the right: about 450 children -- the happy and the homesick, the coiffed and the bed-headed, the hearty and the stuffy-nosed and the (God forbid) contagious -- are about to descend on him.
And those campers, for better and worse, are Mr. Black's customers, the under-10s and tweens and teens who will determine whether his multimillion-dollar-a-year enterprise prospers or, like so many others, struggles to survive. 
Pine Forest Camp is about to open for the summer.
''This is the lonely, awkward time for a camp director,'' Mr. Black says, as he awaits 18 busloads of campers from Philadelphia, Manhattan, New Jersey and beyond. Somewhere a woodpecker rat-a-tat-tats. A lawnmower executes a figure-eight.
The campers are due here in the Pocono Mountains in two hours. First impressions -- an enthusiastic welcome from a counselor, say, or an unhappy bus ride -- often determine whether a child goes home happy or disappointed, Mr. Black says. And that, in turn, can determine whether that camper, that customer, ever comes back.
The pressure is on as never before. The tight economy has made private traditional sleep-away camps like Pine Forest seem even more of a luxury, even for many upper-middle-class families who have sent their children to such programs for generations. All the usual business headaches -- personnel, logistics, marketing, customer service -- matter more than ever.
But beyond the slack economy is a profound change in the business of summer camp. As in just about every industry, slick, nimble upstarts are muscling in on the establishment. These newcomers hold out 21st-century promises: We can groom the modern organization kid, hone lacrosse skills, improve algebra, pad the high-school resume.
No more the quaint summer idyll of lake and volleyball and s'mores. Today, former Brazilian pros coach soccer camp, Oscar winners officiate at film camp, computer game developers teach tech camp -- all the better, the pitches go, to get Holly or Howie into Harvard, or at least to sharpen their skills.
All this at a time when the Pine Forests of the world are being squeezed on all sides. High or rising prices for basic items like food and gasoline are pinching profit margins. It is, industry analysts say, a matter of survival of the fittest.
Mr. Black, a lone figure in a temporarily unpopulated landscape, is waiting by the flagpole on this morning, the last Saturday in June, when the walkie-talkie on his belt crackles.
It's the front office: traffic police in Manhattan are threatening to arrest the driver of a Pine Forest bus who has parked near the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It seems that the location is a no-standing zone.
Mr. Black foresees a big fine. Worse, he worries that the campers may get off to a bad start.
''I don't even care about the money,'' he says. ''I just want to get them out of there.''
WHEN Mickey Black's grandfather, Hughie, opened Pine Forest in 1931, a two-month summer session here cost $85, about $1,264 in today's dollars. The Black family's camp survived the Great Depression and World War II, polio scares and hurricanes, Vietnam and Woodstock, its own Great Dining Hall Fire of 1984, 9/11 and now the Great Recession.
But in an age of hyperparenting, Facebook and Twitter, texting and sexting, running a traditional camp is far more complicated and expensive than it used to be.
This year, a seven-week session at Pine Forest costs $9,700, a big-ticket price for a rustic canoe-and-campfire experience. (Some camps charge even more.)
And many parents, Mr. Black says, want something more for their money. They want their children to come home with a better tennis serve, say, or a stronger backstroke, or perhaps a better technique for making chocolate souffle.
''It is not enough anymore to just go to camp to have fun and make friends and improve independence and self-esteem,'' Mr. Black says. ''Some parents want actual takeaways. They want to see skills, achievements, patches and certificates.''
And so traditional camps have had to step things up to compete with less expensive, specialized programs that run two or three weeks. That includes hiring professional athletics coaches.
''Expectations for a top-quality camp became higher,'' says Richard Gersten, the executive director of Brant Lake Camp, a boys camp in the Adirondacks, in upstate New York, that has been run by members of the same family since 1917. ''We had to hone our skills and teaching to match specialty camps.''
Established private sleep-away camps have enjoyed a built-in client base: the children of alumni. Many used to have waiting lists. But lately, many of the doctors, lawyers and small-business owners who make up this base have cut back, Mr. Black says. Some have turned to grandparents to help cover the cost of camp.
''You can't rest on your laurels anymore,'' he says.
More than 11 million Americans, primarily children, will attend camp this year, according to the American Camp Association. There are about 4,000 privately owned camps, the group says, and about 8,000 nonprofit camps nationwide. But since 2007, many camps, both private and non-profit, both overnight and day, have seen their enrollments dip, says Ann Sheets, an association spokeswoman. Around the country, she adds, a handful have closed.
Many camps that were struggling before the economic downturn now find themselves in even worse shape, says Daniel Zenkel, a camp owner and a partner in the Camp Professionals, a consulting firm.
''Some of those may not be able to get out of the negative spiral they got into,'' Mr. Zenkel says. But well-managed camps, he says, should prosper: ''If they are running well, they will survive and thrive.''
Mr. Black and his wife, Barbara, have fared better than some of their peers, but they still feel vulnerable. In addition to the co-ed Pine Forest, the Blacks own the nearby Lake Owego Camp for boys and Camp Timber Tops for girls.
All three were booked solid until 2008, when the economy teetered. Then, in 2009, enrollment fell 5 percent, Mr. Black says. This summer, he has seen a rebound to 98 percent enrollment -- with about 900 campers, ages 7 to 16, across the three camps.
''We've been able to keep it healthy and strong,'' he says. ''But it's fragile.''
ON the day before camp opens, Mr. Black checks in with his key staff members. Over at Camp Timber Tops, a counselor who wasn't the right fit has been let go. Here at Pine Forest, some of the paddle boats have not arrived. The music teacher, a classical pianist, wants a better electric piano.
Managing a summer camp might seem like running any other small business. But it's not quite the same. At camp, the management, the employees and the customers -- the campers -- live together for nearly two months. Some social engineering is crucial.
''You work together on sunny days and rainy days,'' Mr. Black says. ''You know who people are.''
In our litigious times, health and safety are Job 1. Staff training, for example, includes discussions about how to avoid body contact -- never initiate a hug with a camper -- and how to recognize an eating disorder.
It all used to be so simple. You shipped the kids off, dropped by on parents' day and welcomed them home in August. Now camp directors field phone calls and e-mails from helicopter parents. There is medication to manage and food allergies to accommodate.
In the first half of the 20th century, principals and teachers like Hughie Black started overnight camps all over the Northeast as a way of making extra money. For many of them, camp was a summer gig.
During its first summer in 1931, Pine Forest Camp had 25 children from the Philadelphia area, all of them Jewish and half of them related to the camp owners. Year by year, thanks to word-of-mouth, enrollment multiplied. Hughie Black expanded his camp as nearby land came up for sale.
In the late 1940s, Hughie's son, Marvin Black, and Hughie's son-in-law, Ted Halpern, both schoolteachers, joined the business. But the pair gave up their teaching jobs in the 1960s when they decided to open two new overnight camps: Lake Owego and Timber Tops. The camps offered what was, at the time, innovative pricing: full season or half-season.
Today, the three camps, each with its own lake, swimming pool, pine cabins and adventure climbing course, dot 1,000 acres of fields and forests.
When Mickey and Barbara Black joined the business in the 1980s, the camps offered 20 different activities, including tennis and riflery, arts and fishing. In the 1990s, they took out loans and used camp profits to pay for new cabins and to upgrade the bunks, dining halls, roads, swimming pools, tennis courts and waterfronts. Now, there are more than 40 activities.
All that is expensive. Here is a rough, annual breakdown:
Salaries. $1 million. The camps employ about 500 people, or roughly one adult for every two campers.
Food. $500,000. The dining halls feed 1,400 people, three times a day.
Maintenance. $600,000 to $700,000. This includes upkeep of the land and dozens of buildings.
And then there is capital investment. Last year, Pine Forest built an 8,400-square-foot indoor-outdoor gymnastics facility. This year, there is a new, even larger indoor-outdoor basketball center at Lake Owego.
When the economic downturn hit, ''we wanted to send a message: we were strong, we were here,'' Mr. Black says as he walks through the gymnastics hall. ''It's always good to build something big when you want to make a statement.''
With enrollment at the three camps nearly full, the business over all remains profitable, Mr. Black says. He declines to be more specific. But he does say that profit margins are narrowing in the face of increased expenses for new buildings and new programs, along with the rising cost of food and gas for water-skiing boats.
''Even though fees have gone up,'' he says, they have ''not kept pace with the increasing costs of running a camp.''
The economics may change, but the camp's culture essentially remains the same.
No swearing or bullying. No cellphones, iPads or Internet. Parents can call twice and visit once. Although the camp offers individual and team sports competitions, everyone is a winner.
It is the kind of old-timey experience that Michael D. Eisner, the former Disney chief executive, celebrated in a memoir titled ''Camp,'' about his summers at camp in Vermont. ''Nobody fails summer camp, a nice respite from winters of fortune and misfortune at school,'' he wrote.
In a sense, that view captures the ultimate marketing strategy of summer camp. For many, these camps sell future nostalgia, the prospect of happy memories, the promise of best friends maintained for decades to come. That, at any rate, is the value proposition that separates the endless summer of sleep-away camp from the skills and drills of their specialty counterparts.
THE traffic fine for the Pine Forest bus in Manhattan comes to $95. ''The cost of doing business,'' Mr. Black says. ''Who knew?''
It is a small price to pay to liberate a busload of kids. When they pull up a few hours later, he rushes aboard. Each child gets a pat on the back or a handshake, along with a personal greeting -- ''Happy birthday, Bella!''
Mr. Black seems so natural that it's easy to forget that camp is a business. But he can concentrate on the campers because he has hired managers to handle day-to-day operations. He spends time during the first few days meeting new campers, memorizing their names and calling their parents with updates.
''Frankly, I think that makes the difference between a successful camp and a camp spinning out of control,'' Mr. Black says.
By noon, the earlier morning calm has been broken by the shouts of hundreds of children. Counselors bellow welcomes and help new arrivals carry guitars and tennis rackets to the bunks. Returning campers see old friends and shriek.
Mr. Black senses the omens of a successful summer.
''Now,'' he says, ''it feels like camp.''
Down the hill, Jonathan Schwartz, the general counsel for the investment bank at JPMorgan Chase, is dropping off his daughter Lindsay, 9, for her first summer. He shows her ''The Old-Timers' Tree,'' a twisted trunk with nearly 400 metal plates bearing the names of children who attended camp for a decade or more. Mr. Schwartz, in a weathered T-shirt that says ''PFC Alumni, Circa 1980,'' points out his name and those of his friends.
''Sending Lindsay to Pine Forest is like sending her to extended family,'' he says.
Here at camp, Mr. Black says, it doesn't so much matter that Mr. Schwartz graduated first in his class at Stanford Law School. Or that he clerked for Thurgood Marshall at the Supreme Court. What matters is that, one summer, Mr. Schwartz served as a general in a sports contest known until recently as ''the color war,'' a three-day, all-out competition that splits the camp into two rival teams: blue and gold.
Mr. Black knows because he used to be Mr. Schwartz's bunk counselor.
Mr. Black estimates that as many as a quarter of the campers here are the children -- or grandchildren -- of alumni. He walks a delicate tightrope, looking for the right balance between innovations that draw new campers and traditions that alumni relish.
''You have to honor, respect and celebrate the fact that they are alumni,'' he says. ''But you can't become so insular and cliquish, because you need new families every year.''
THE sign on the table at the back of the bustling dining hall says ''Reserved for the Black Family.''
Mickey Black and his father, Marvin Black, 86, the camp's director emeritus, traditionally sit at the table with their backs to the wall, the better to monitor the controlled chaos before them.
Barbara Black, a cool blonde in a camp logo blouse, is stationed in the middle of the hall, ladling tomato sauce onto pasta for a crowd of girls in jean shorts and tank tops.
A blue and gold banner hangs nearby. ''Pine Forest Camp's 81st Summer,'' it reads. ''Same Family Ownership.''
If Mickey Black is the camp poet, responsible for campers' spirits and souls, his wife is the camp pragmatist, in charge of their stomachs. She directs the food program, overseeing purchasing, recipes, cooking and meal service at the three camps.
Last summer, the dining halls served more than 28,000 meatballs and 35,000 pizzas.
''It's like a cruise ship,'' says Ms. Black, the camp's co-director, pointing to the campers lined up at the all-you-can-eat buffet stations and salad bars.
Ms. Black has taken on the job of catering to increasing numbers of campers who have food allergies or special diets. The dining halls offer vegetarian options and gluten-free options and kosher options. Then there are special items for children who are allergic to onion powder or peaches, and for kids who won't eat anything but potato bread or croissants or organic granola bars.
A couple of girls approach Ms. Black at the salad bar, asking her to store salad dressing they brought from home. Earlier, one mother gave Ms. Black a hunk of Parmesan cheese for safe-keeping.
''We have noticed how many more dietary issues there are with campers -- allergies, special requests,'' Ms. Black says. Some other camps, she says, don't accommodate individual diets. But, she says, ''I think that's our job.''
Even with such personal attention, signing up new campers -- and keeping old ones -- takes some effort.
In the 1960s, Marvin Black visited prospective families at home in the off-season. He'd show up with a projector, show home movies of camp life and sign up new campers on the spot. ''In those days,'' he recalls, ''we did it the old-fashioned way.''
Now it typically takes five, six or seven separate encounters -- phone calls, camp tours, open houses, e-mails -- before a new family commits, Mickey Black says. After the economic downturn, he stepped up marketing efforts.
In the off-season, there are informational bowling nights and alumni get-togethers in various cities. In the summer, there's a new offering, ''Explorer Program,'' for prospective campers to stay overnight in a special bunk and kick the tires of camp life.
But, in today's world, Mr. Black may be swimming against the current. Campers, he believes, should experience life live -- rather than post a status update about it, or share a photo, or tweet. Going to Pine Forest is like entering a time warp. Mr. Black even drives around in a brown-and-ivory 1949 Willys Jeep station wagon.
Still, this is a bittersweet moment in the history of Pine Forest Camp.
Mickey and Barbara's daughter, Anna Black Morin, 28, a longtime senior staff member in the summer and a former schoolteacher, has officially joined the business full-time as assistant director. Their son, Lee Black, 25, who has also been involved with the camp, currently works as a marketing coordinator at the Independent Film Channel in Manhattan.
But the couple have conflicting emotions about the idea of the fourth generation eventually taking over.
''We would like it to continue on for the next generation, but only if it's good for them,'' Mr. Black says. ''We are not so sentimental about this business that we don't see that it has its dangers, that it has its challenges.''
AT dusk, Mr. Black makes his rounds. He visits the cabins and says good night to the youngest campers. Boys' bunks are named after trees (Birch, Linden, Aspen). The girls' cabins are named after flowers (Iris, Honeysuckle). Screams come from the basketball courts. Laughter rises along the footpaths.
''That sound you hear, of kids having fun, is a constant symphony,'' Mr. Black says. ''I love that sound.''
He walks up the steps and opens the screen door of Bunk Tulip, checking that everyone is tucked in under the pink and purple comforters.
''Did everyone brush their teeth, I hope?'' he says.
He stands at the steps of another cabin and yells up.
''Sunflower, is everybody dressed?'' he says. ''Can I come in and say good night?''
Good night, Bunk Petunia. Good night, Bunk Lilac. Good night, Bunk Rose.
All 18 buses have arrived -- even the one from Newark airport, with new campers from Spain. The nurses in the infirmary have sorted out personal medications. The night watchman is on duty.
''Good night, Bunk Fern.''
Mickey Black can relax for the moment. But the business of summer has only just begun.

HEADLINE: In Disaster's Wake, Game Shows Power to Heal

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Makiko Inoue, Harumi Osawa and Kantaro Suzuki contributed reporting.

 BODY:
OFUNATO, Japan -- Entering this port city by car these days means confronting nature's fury and its fickleness all at once. The tsunami that hit Japan's northeastern coast four months ago tore through the modest downtown, gutting buildings, crushing cars like beer cans and sweeping shops out to sea.
But in areas out of the wave's grasp, homes stand unscathed, rice paddies are still productive, and parks are filled with squealing children.
The awkward contrast is being played out across northeastern Japan, including at schools here. Perched on a hill overlooking the destruction, Ofunato High School is much as it was before March 11, save for a few broken windows. In the lobby are several glass cases that include trophies won by the school's baseball team. 
Less than two miles away, Ofunato Higashi High School's Kayanaka campus also escaped serious damage. But now the hallways are filled with many students from Takata High School in Rikuzentakata, which is 10 miles from Ofunato and was consumed by the tsunami. And because military jeeps and trucks are parked on Higashi's baseball field, Takata's team must train at another school in town.
Baseball, though, has been a way for players and coaches from damaged and undamaged schools to resume a predictable if arduous routine they followed before the waves arrived. Players are more focused because on Thursday, the regional tournament to determine who will represent Iwate Prefecture at the national high school championship in August will begin. That is helping some forget, at least for a few hours, that they lost an uncle, or that they are living in a refugee center.
''As you can see, when they are practicing on the field, everything is the same as before the disaster, and they seem to be getting excited as the tournament approaches,'' said Akishi Sasaki, the manager of Takata's baseball team. ''But once they go home, some students may pass the rubble. They probably feel down. I worry about those whose emotions soar and sink each day.''
There are 55 players on Takata's baseball team, and it is Masato Owada's job to speak for them. The wiry team captain and a first baseman, he carries himself like a yakyu jin, someone who devotes himself to baseball, not unlike a devotee of the martial arts. Owada has played baseball nonstop since elementary school.
With a straight back, he is unfailingly polite and, despite his circumstances, remarkably composed. About one-third of his teammates lost their homes, so he is relatively lucky to still be living with his family in Rikuzentakata, which had 23,300 residents before the tsunami. But to get to Ofunato, a city he rarely visited before, he must now commute on winding coastal roads clogged with construction crews.
Perhaps because the disruption in his life has been so acute, Owada appears particularly devoted to baseball, if only to escape the reality that his hometown has been irreversibly altered. Like every high school player, he dreams of playing in Koshien Stadium near Osaka, where the national tournament is held. But now he has extra motivation.
''My goal is to go to Koshien to make the people who are supporting us happy and to encourage Rikuzentakata to recover,'' Owada said. ''As a result of this experience, we became independent and our teamwork became better. And when we play as well as we can, people who see us will be thrilled.''
His sentiments are echoed by ballplayers across Japan, though they are especially poignant when uttered in this corner of the country this year. Rikuzentakata's waterfront took the tsunami's full force. About 2,000 residents died or are missing. More than 3,300 homes were destroyed, and nearly every building in the city center was wiped out. The mayor survived the tsunami by clinging to a railing on the roof of the city hall as the waves crashed over him.
Owada and his teammates escaped by running to a second ball field on higher ground. But their three-story school, which faces the water, was ruined. Four months later, its classrooms still have mounds of mud and waterlogged textbooks on the floor. Every window was smashed, and curtains flap in the wind.
On a ball field in front of the school, unmatched sneakers sit next to sweatsuits, a handful of aluminum bats and strands of paper cranes, their colors faded by the seawater. Albums with pictures of students are near a collection of medals won by various clubs. Computer motherboards shine in the sun.
Given the completeness of the destruction, it is hard to imagine how any school will be rebuilt there. Even if one is -- and that could take years -- it is unclear how many families with children will return to a city that has had its economy devastated. The only people who seem to be working in the city center are garbage haulers, a few gas station attendants and convenience-store clerks who sell their inventory from the backs of trucks.
''We hear from Iwate prefectural officials that Takata High School will be rebuilt in Takata at some point in the future,'' said Sasaki, the team's manager. ''That's the only moral support for us now.''
So, for the foreseeable future, Sasaki and his players will keep working, studying and playing in Ofunato, which had 40,700 residents before the storm. Like Rikuzentakata, the city is surrounded by steep mountains that are reminiscent of coastal Maine or Alaska. This topography created a funnel that accelerated the tsunami's waves and gave things in its path little chance.
That includes Keita Niinuma's grandmother, who died, and his house, which was destroyed. Like many players in Japan that afternoon, Niinuma, the pitcher on Ofunato High's team, was at practice. When the earthquake hit, the field cracked. The waves that followed washed away most of his belongings at home.
For three days, Niinuma wore his practice uniform because the police would not allow residents to re-enter their neighborhood. When Niinuma went to see what was left of his home, he picked through the rubble and found his game uniform, which he washed. It was an upbeat moment in an otherwise trying time.
''The students are positive, but I think they are getting exhausted,'' said Teruhiko Suzuki, the principal of Ofunato High School. ''We can hardly see the town recovering its rhythms, and students cannot help but feel the hardships their families are feeling. I think they are having a tough time.''
One of the tsunami's many cruelties is that in destroying cities, it ended up putting them on the map as well. Indeed, before March 11, few Japanese outside this part of the country would have found Ofunato and Rikuzentakata on a map. Now, their names make up a sad roll call.
But the tsunami also connected the Tohoku region to the rest of the country in other ways. For instance, Rikuzentakata's team was invited to play practice games against a high school in Gunma Prefecture, more than 300 miles away. Ofunato's team received 15 boxes of equipment from Mukawa High School in Hokkaido. Some students sent their worn-out practice caps. On the underside of the bills they wrote phrases like ''Don't give in to the disaster'' and ''Let's meet at Koshien.''
In late May, Ofunato's team also visited Kobe, through an old connection. In the summer of 1984, when Ofunato made it to the semifinals at Koshien, Ryuei Sato, the team's manager at the time, befriended Mitsuhiro Kitahara, the manager of Shinko Gakuen in Kobe.
Two weeks after the tsunami, Kitahara contacted Sato and invited Ofunato's team to visit. He wanted to give the boys from Ofunato a chance to take their minds off their troubles at home, but also to have his players -- some of whom were not born when an earthquake leveled Kobe in 1995 -- meet others now dealing with adversity.
''This is not something they can learn in classes,'' Kitahara said. ''They are lucky to be on the baseball team here to learn something they can hardly experience in other places.''
The local Rotary Club paid for a 15-hour bus trip from Ofunato to Kobe. Thrust together under the glare of television cameras, the boys were awkward around one another at first. But it rained the day of their exhibition game, which forced them to practice indoors together.
''I thought that they were down, and I wanted to encourage them,'' said Takuma Hatokawa, the captain at Shinko Gakuen, who exchanges text messages with Noriyuki Ujiie, Ofunato's captain. ''But it was the opposite. I was the one being encouraged by them. They were so cheerful, and we became good friends.''
Of course, no two-day excursion will rebuild Ofunato. But Toru Yoshida, Ofunato's manager and the captain of the 1984 squad that went to Koshien, said that the trip taught his players that cities could be rebuilt if the people in them persevered.
''Before the disaster, I told my players that we have to stick to baseball itself,'' he said. ''But things may be different this year. Facing a disaster of this scale, this is the year we have to be conscious of the people who are watching us and to encourage them.''
Rebuilt Seasons: In the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 and the nuclear crisis that has followed, several high school baseball teams have found that preparing for their regional qualifying tournaments has been a steadying factor in lives that have been forever changed.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about baseball's role in helping students in Japan resume a routine following the earthquake and tsunami this year misstated the given name of the baseball team manager at Ofunato High School 1984.

HEADLINE: Credit Unions Join the Fray

BYLINE: By MARYANN HAGGERTY

 BODY:
CREDIT unions, long a source for car loans and home equity lines of credit, have become a factor in first-mortgage lending, too.
While their mortgage rates aren't notably below the competition, some credit unions are aggressively pushing loans they say have lower fees or more flexible terms. In some cases, they have loose membership rules, making these loans available not just to people working with a particular company or labor union.
''The credit unions have emerged as fairly aggressive; mostly that's because they've decided it's a good use of their assets,'' said Guy Cecala, the publisher of the trade newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance. That is, rates paid to depositors remain low, and lending those deposits to home buyers remains profitable. 
''We look at first-mortgage lending as an opportunity to help our members achieve the American dream of owning their own home,'' said Robert Nemeroff, a spokesman for Melrose Credit Union in Queens, which is open to all. ''However, we maintain prudent lending policies that by nature maintain a sound mortgage portfolio for the credit union and create a healthy borrowing situation for the member.
''A byproduct of this philosophy,'' Mr. Nemeroff added, ''is the ability to offer attractive rates, thus attracting new members.'' In particular, he said, lower upfront fees can reduce borrowing costs.
It's all part of the continuing fallout from the credit crisis. From the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s, credit unions accounted for just 2 percent of the first-mortgage market, according to Bill Hampel, the chief economist at the Credit Union National Association, a trade group. But in 2008-09, that rose to 4.5 percent.
For the most part, credit unions didn't make subprime loans, Mr. Hampel said. So when others were crumpling under those loans, they kept on lending. (The National Credit Union Administration, the agency that regulates federal credit unions, last year bailed out the institutions called wholesale credit unions because of their money-losing subprime investments. These didn't make loans to individual customers.)
And when the financial crisis halted Wall Street mortgage securitization -- the system in which investment banks sliced and diced loans into securities -- credit unions weren't as affected as others. They held the loans in their own portfolios rather than sell them, and had been doing so for years. For instance, at Melrose, Mr. Nemeroff said, ''because part of our policy is to maintain a solid financial relationship with our members, we retain the majority of our portfolio.''
In New York in the last three to four years, there has been about a 15 percent increase in loans to home buyers, especially first-timers, said Richard Maxstadt, a senior vice president at the CUC Mortgage Corporation, established by the Credit Union Association of New York to service mortgages. CUC works with about 150 credit unions, most in New York state.
While Mr. Maxstadt said most of the loans he handles are ''plain vanilla 30-year fixed-rate mortgages,'' credit unions also offer loans tailored to market niches.
For instance, Pentagon Federal Credit Union, one of the nation's largest, focuses on 5-5 adjustable rate loans. The interest, currently 3.25 percent, remains fixed for five years; it then adjusts by no more than two percentage points and is fixed for five more years. The credit union's largely military membership tends to move every three to five years, rather than the national average of every seven, said James Schenck, an executive vice president. ''An ARM if done correctly and done conservatively can benefit the consumer,'' he said.
While the credit union's core membership is military, it is open to others through affiliation programs. Real estate loans account for about 70 percent of Pentagon Federal's $13 billion portfolio, according to regulatory reports. About 80 percent are ARMs, Mr. Schenck said. Mortgage lending has risen every year since 2007, he said, and is still growing.
Correction: July 17, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Mortgages column last Sunday, about credit unions lending to home buyers, misstated the surname of a senior vice president at the CUC Mortgage Corporation. He is Richard Maxstadt, not Markstadt.

HEADLINE: An Inflation Hedge Carries Its Own Risks

BYLINE: By JACK DUFFY

 BODY:
INVESTORS who placed bets on mutual funds specializing in inflation-protected Treasury securities were among the bond market's biggest winners over the last two years, even as other Treasury funds struggled.
This year, however, the winning streak has faltered a bit as inflation expectations have shifted radically. As the United States economy has slowed, European debt worries have revived and oil prices have fallen back from their recent highs, inflation expectations have moved downward.
For Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, that has not been good news. 
''TIPS have gone through a period where just about everything has gone right for them,'' said Robert Johnson, director of economic analysis at Morningstar. ''Now the situation has changed, and they are looking quite expensive.''
TIPS pay interest on a principal amount that rises with inflation, so investors are compensated as consumer prices rise. When the securities mature, the investor is paid the adjusted principal amount or the original principal, whichever is greater.
Investors have poured money into TIPS, particularly since last August, amid concerns that the Federal Reserve's plan to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities would fuel inflation. Those fears grew even more frantic early this year when turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa drove crude oil prices well over $100 a barrel, and gasoline prices in the United States began to climb.
According to EPFR Global, which tracks fund flows, investors added more than $7 billion to inflation-protected bond funds in the first half of this year, roughly equaling the amount for all of 2010.
The big swings in inflation expectations have been most evident in the so-called break-even rate -- which is the difference between yields on 10-year Treasury notes and 10-year TIPS and reflects trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt. That rate climbed to a high of 2.67 percent in April, just as crude oil prices peaked at around $114 a barrel, from 1.5 percent last August.
But in May, as signs of an economic slowdown appeared and investors began to anticipate an end to the Fed's bond-buying spree, inflation expectations collapsed. As measured by the break-even rate, expectations for consumer price inflation dropped to 2.14 and the TIPS market stumbled.
TIPS funds returned just 0.3 percent in May, before rebounding in June as worries eased about Greek debt and a sustained slowdown in the United States economy.
For the second quarter, inflation-linked bond funds returned about 3.1 percent according to Morningstar, compared with 3.6 percent for funds that invest in regular long-term government bonds.
Over longer periods, however, TIPS have sometimes outpaced the returns of regular Treasury funds. Over the last five years, inflation-linked bond funds have returned 6.36 percent, annualized, compared with 6.04 percent for intermediate government debt funds and 7.4 percent for long-term government bond funds.
''The TIPS market clearly got a bit exuberant going into the spring,'' said Daniel O. Shackelford, manager of the $387 million T. Rowe Price Inflation Protected Bond fund. ''Over the last several weeks, the market has made an adjustment to more modest inflation expectations,'' he said.
The T. Rowe Price TIPS fund returned 3.3 percent in the quarter, after gains of 6.29 percent in 2010 and 10.43 percent in 2009.
DESPITE the recent adjustment, analysts say TIPS remain expensive, particularly those with shorter maturities. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, and TIPS maturing in five years, for example, yielded a negative 0.37 percent at the end of the second quarter. That compared with a 1.76 percent yield on a regular five-year Treasury note. Ten-year TIPS yielded 0.69 percent, compared with 3.16 percent for noninflation-linked 10-year Treasury debt.
Managers of TIPS funds say the inflation protection offered by TIPS makes sense for a portion of a portfolio.
''If you buy a two-year Treasury note yielding 40 basis points while inflation is running at 2 percent, that is wealth destruction,'' Mr. Shackelford said. ''TIPS may not be a formula for building wealth; they will do what they were constructed to do, which is to compensate you for increases in consumer prices.''
Some money managers say they are shifting into the longer-term end of the TIPS market, where yields for 30-year maturities were 1.7 percent as of the end of June.
''We've been moving out of the intermediate sector of TIPS and buying the long end,'' said Martin Hegarty, co-head of global inflation-linked portfolios at BlackRock, the New York-based money manager, which oversees $3.6 trillion in assets. Mr. Hegarty said purchases of intermediate-term TIPS, those of 5 to 10 years, by foreign central banks had helped to depress yields in that sector.
The $4 billion BlackRock Inflation Protected Bond fund gained 2.6 percent in the second quarter and 4.66 percent this year through June.
Still, analysts said the current pricing of TIPS should raise at least one red flag. TIPS may be inflation-protected and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, but they are far from being risk-free.
''If the Fed were to make any pre-emptive move against inflation, TIPS could get killed,'' said Mr. Johnson at Morningstar. ''People tend to think TIPS have no risk, but if you sell them before maturity, or if you own a fund that it weighted with longer-term maturities, they can have substantial risk.''
Fund managers say that while these problems are real, TIPS may still be useful.
''Investors certainly should not judge TIPS by taking a backward view of how they have performed,'' said John W. Hollyer, a manager of the $35 billion Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund, which returned 3.4 percent in the second quarter. ''They are not a risk-free asset because they have a high sensitivity to changes in interest rates. But if inflation makes a sudden move upward, you will be compensated, and that's important.''

HEADLINE: I, Illegal Immigrant

 BODY:
In his article about his life in America as an undocumented immigrant, Jose Antonio Vargas addressed an issue that should upset us all. I knew Jose when I was his speech coach at Mountain View High School. I didn't know he was illegal but rather knew him as one of the hardest-working members of the team. I remember working with him to more clearly enunciate in a highly competitive endeavor. He was driven, and he was successful. Yes, he has broken our laws. So have many on Wall Street, who simply paid money, got a slap on the hand and went on to make a lot more money. Jose is a hero /-- my hero. He worked to be the best he could be, asking nothing of our country beyond the right to stay where his mother sent him as a young boy. He is another example of why we need to pass the Dream Act.
RICHARD HAAS, Sunnyvale, Calif. 
I was duped. I once hired an illegal immigrant to be a reporter for The Chronicle. . . . Jose lied to me and everyone else he worked for. . . . The force of his story /-- good reaction and bad /-- and his project just might lubricate the politically tarred-up wheels of government and help create sane immigration policy. If it has that effect, we should forgive him his lies.
PHIL BRONSTEIN, Editor at Large, The San Francisco Chronicle, 10:43 p.m., June 22, sfgate.com
The first part of Vargas's story -- a kid living in and loving America for years before his shocking discovery that he has been made complicit in a crime -- does indeed elicit sympathy. It's stories like these that make me open, at least in principle, to something like a narrowly tailored version of the Dream Act. But the second part of his story, in which a fear- and shame-driven Vargas, with the aid of his family, perpetuated and compounded those crimes (Vargas eventually got around to what you might redundantly call fraudulent tax fraud, repeatedly reporting himself as a citizen rather than a ''permanent resident,'' when in fact he was neither), elicits from me nothing like the outpouring of support Vargas is already enjoying on the left.
DANIEL FOSTER, 1:26 p.m., June 22, nationalreview.com
As in the Arab-Israeli dispute, there is a broad consensus among policy makers on the outlines of what should be done: we should provide some path to legitimate citizenship for the millions of people like Vargas who are here illegally but who contribute every day to our communities. We should tighten employer sanctions and law enforcement. Unfortunately, as in the Arab-Israeli dispute, knowledge of the general destination is not always sufficient to navigate large obstacles along the way.
HAROLD POLLACK, 4:52 p.m., June 23, TNR.com
You have to have rules. Rules are good. But all rules have exceptions. Vargas's story is the tip of an iceberg of unrecognized talent among children of illegal immigrants who are educated, bright, useful members of American society and should be accepted as American citizens.
CAROLYN WELCH, Indianapolis
This is a compelling article. Unfortunately, 16 million unemployed Americans have compelling stories. Illegal immigrants do not by dint of rule of law have the right to stay in the country, work, vote or serve as an endless bridge for more illegals. Human interest makes for compassion and not policy. It's time to look at this issue through the prism of the poorest of Americans, whose stories of competition with illegals is the saddest and most underreported story in journalism.

HEADLINE: Stepping (Carefully) Into Junk Bonds

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
AFTER posting impressive double-digit returns for the last two years, high-yield bonds rose at a much slower pace in the first five months of this year and stumbled in June, ending the second quarter with a gain of only 0.65 percent. .
Does that signal a buying opportunity, or is it time to exit an overbought market? There is no unanimity of opinion -- it's a bit like asking a Republican and a Democrat what to do about the budget deficit. And answers need to be tailored to individual investors' long- and short-term goals and risk tolerance. 
Still, some consensus exists. Despite the appealing term ''high yield,'' these bonds are often called junk. They yield more than investment-grade bonds because the issuers, both corporate and municipal, are considered risky by the rating agencies, so the issuers have to pay more to borrow. Despite the fact that interest rates are low on savings accounts and money market funds, advisers warn retirees who are desperately seeking yield not to put a big chunk of their nest eggs into them.
But for people, retired or not, who understand the market, putting a small part of a diversified, long-term portfolio into a high-yield fund can provide ''more kick,'' said Miriam Sjoblom, Morningstar's lead bond fund analyst. The funds are now yielding more than 7 percent.
The challenge for a fund manager is to figure out which issuers will be able to pay their investors and survive, and which may default on their debt. Consequently, Ms. Sjoblom recommended choosing an actively managed fund, rather than an index fund, for this category. ''Look for a stable, experienced manager with a good record over time,'' she said. ''Look at expenses as well.''
David P. Grecsek, director of fixed income at Aspiriant Investment Advisors, a fee-only wealth management firm, said that high-yield bonds ''should be part of every investment portfolio.'' He likes the JPMorgan High Yield Select fund for tax-deferred accounts, because of its seasoned management team and flexible style, and the Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond fund for taxable accounts.
He said high-yield bonds, which tend to move like equities but have a smaller loss potential, ''can serve as an equity proxy for more conservative investors'' and could enhance the yield in more aggressive investors' fixed-income portfolios.
On the other hand, Kurt Brouwer, chairman of Brouwer & Janachowski, an investment management firm in Tiburon, Calif., said, ''We don't use a dedicated high-yield fund,'' because of that market's volatility. Rather, he uses two Pimco funds -- Total Return and the Unconstrained Bond fund -- both of which let their managers make opportunistic trades in the high-yield market.
''Any time you're buying high yield, buy a little; dip a toe in the water,'' Mr. Brouwer said. But he warned against taking a plunge right now, given the economic uncertainties -- even though he saw another recession as unlikely.
MICHAEL BRANDES, managing director and global head of fixed income strategy at Citi Private Bank, was more optimistic, although he, too, cited a variety of economic problems -- high unemployment, the problems of Greece and the euro zone, American wrangling over the debt ceiling, and the possibility of earnings disappointments. And after high-yield gains in the last two years, ''the low-hanging fruit is gone,'' he said.
Nevertheless, ''we continue to be positive about prospects for the high-yield market'' over the coming year, compared with other asset classes, he said. ''When markets are skittish, it presents opportunity.''
Peter Plaut, a senior vice president at MF Global who focuses on fixed-income sales of distressed and high-yield companies, also sees good longer-term prospects. He expects ''a small pickup in economic activity'' and predicts ''second-quarter earnings that will meet or exceed Wall Street expectations.'' Both factors should help stabilize markets in general and presage low default rates among bond issuers.
One reason for the market's tumble in June, he said, was the Federal Reserve's auction of mortgage securities that the central bank assumed in the rescue of the American International Group. Weak economic data and floods and tornadoes in the Midwest also made investors anxious, he said, but those factors are past, and over time he expects that the junk bond markets' low overall default rates, as well as coupons paying an average of 7 1/4 percent, will win investors back.
Michael Stolper, head of Stolper & Company, an investment manager in San Diego, was far less sanguine. He said his firm did not use high-yield for clients' accounts because ''if people lose principal on a bond, it's like their children have been kidnapped.'' People expect stability from bond funds, he said.
''High-yield is really a tactic, not a strategy, for most investors,'' he said. There may be opportunistic trades that pay off, he added, ''but if credit markets are stressed, you don't want to be in junk bonds.'' He favors funds that hold high-quality bonds, preferably with maturities of 10 years or less.
Ms. Sjoblom of Morningstar, while favoring high-yield funds as part of a diversified asset allocation plan, warned in a recent report against expecting a replay of the last two years. The Barclays Capital U.S. Corporate High Yield Index gained a record 58 percent in 2009, she said, and 14 percent in 2010.
Some $11.6 billion in new money went into high-yield corporate bond funds during the first five months of this year, she said, well above the $7.6 billion intake for all of 2010.
Many buyers may not realize that capital appreciation made up much of the 2009-10 gains. The average price of bonds in the Barclays index rose in 2009 to $95 from $61, then to $102 by the end of 2010.
It stood at $102.31 at the end of the second quarter but ''there's very little room for prices to rise further,'' she said, because many of these bonds include call features, allowing issuers to call their bonds and issue new debt more cheaply.
''Unfortunately,'' she said, ''those who've waited until now to get in on the action may be left to clean up the detritus.''

HEADLINE: Tough Budget Calculus as Technical Schools Face Deep Cuts

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Despite a competitive economy in which success increasingly depends on obtaining a college degree, one in four students in this country does not even finish high school in the usual four years.
Matthew Kelly was in danger of becoming one of them.
Tests showed he had a high intellect, but Mr. Kelly regularly skipped homework and was barely passing some of his classes in his early years of high school. He was living in a motel part of the time and both his parents were out of work. His mother, a former nurse, feared that Matthew had so little interest he would drop out without graduating.
Then his guidance counselor suggested he take some courses at a nearby vocational academy for his junior year. For the first time, the sloe-eyed teenager excelled, earning A's and B's in subjects like auto repair, electronics and metals technology. ''When it comes to practicality, I can do stuff really well,'' said Mr. Kelly, now 19.
So well, that he has earned a scholarship to attend a community college this fall. He even talks of pursuing a bachelor's degree in engineering some day, and opening his own business. 
Now, federal funding to provide such vocational and technical education is at risk. President Obama has instead made it a priority to raise overall academic standards and college graduation rates, and aims to shrink the small amount of federal spending for vocational training in public high schools and community colleges. That aid comes primarily in the form of Perkins grants to states.
The administration has proposed a 20 percent reduction in its fiscal 2012 budget for career and technical education, to a little more than $1 billion, even as it seeks to increase overall education funding by 11 percent. The only real alternative to public schools for career training is profit-making colleges and trade schools, many of which have been harshly criticized for sending students deeply into debt without improving their job prospects. A little more than one in 10 students in higher education attend a profit-making institution.
Proponents of career education in public high schools and community colleges point to apparent successes like Mr. Kelly and other research to demonstrate that their courses serve a group of students at most risk of being left behind. Without high school, much less college, many young people -- particularly men and members of minority groups -- end up doing low-skill work, relying on their youth and brawn. Those types of jobs were slashed during the downturn, and job prospects often fade altogether as workers age.
In European countries like Germany, Denmark and Switzerland, vocational programs have long been viable choices for a significant portion of teenagers. Yet in the United States, technical courses have often been viewed as the ugly stepchildren of education, backwaters for underachieving or difficult students.
In a speech to the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in April, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said that ''at a time when local, state and federal governments are all facing tremendous budget pressure'' advocates for vocationally oriented education ''must make a compelling case for continued funding.''
In his camp are those who say students need to concentrate on basics like math, literacy and history to prepare for college and the jobs of the future, rather than learning a narrow technical craft. In this view, bright students like Mr. Kelly, who have the potential to do college-level work, should be put on that path, or schools will have failed them.
What's more, those in favor of academic reform worry that minority and low-income students will be automatically channeled into vocational courses. A rigorous academic curriculum, they say, is the best way to help all workers remain flexible, climb career ladders and prepare for a wider spectrum of jobs.
Recognizing that employment and income have expanded for those with college degrees, the president has said he wants America to produce the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.
Last year, fewer than a third of all 25- to 29-year-olds in the United States had earned a bachelor's degree or higher. Advocates say the most compelling case for vocational education is that it keeps students interested in school at all. According to data from the Department of Education, about 75 percent of students who start public high school graduate within four or five years. But more than 90 percent of those who concentrate in career-oriented courses, a definition that varies by state, do so, according to statistics compiled by the Office of Vocational and Adult Education. (Eventually, after more years of school or passing a General Educational Development test, about 87 percent of all students complete high school.)
Strong vocational programs that start in high school, advocates say, can help students make the leap to one- or two-year credentials that are increasingly the ticket out of low-skilled, lower-paying jobs. In fact, 27 percent of people who get a vocational license or certificate after high school, whether at a community college or a profit-making institution, earn more than the average for those with a bachelor's degree, according to the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University.
Career and technical education ''can prepare you for jobs in which you're going to earn a very solid middle-class income,'' said William C. Symonds, director of the Pathways to Prosperity Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. ''That's not to say that you're going to be a hedge fund manager making millions a year, but you will prepare for jobs that will pay more than a living wage.''
Mr. Kelly will transfer four vocational credits from Weaver Academy, a public high school in Greensboro that draws students from 15 traditional high schools around the county, to Guilford Technical Community College this fall. He figures that with a two-year degree in computer-integrated machining, he can qualify for jobs operating the sophisticated machines that manufacturers use to make metal parts for the aerospace, automotive, defense and medical industries.
In the Greensboro area, entry-level machining jobs pay $14 to $20 an hour -- roughly $30,000 to $42,000 a year. To Mr. Kelly, whose father, Farrel Kelly, lost his job five years ago repairing textile equipment, that sounds like a healthy wage.
If he can work part-time in college, the younger Mr. Kelly, who lives in a run-down bungalow with his mother and a roommate, is hoping to buy a car and hire an exterminator to eliminate the cockroaches that skitter around their living room floor.
''Depending on which job I get and how well I advance in the company, you can definitely live well,'' he said. Mr. Kelly recently met a fellow alumnus of Weaver who now works as a machinist at a local aeronautical repair company and was impressed to learn that at age 21, he has already signed a contract to buy a house.
In industries like manufacturing and health care, employers are calling for better career and technical education because they cannot find qualified candidates to fill their openings for machinists, welders and certain categories of nurses, among other jobs. As baby boomers retire and the economy picks up, analysts also expect more demand for medical technicians, dental hygienists and law enforcement workers.
Pushing all young people toward a bachelor's degree could be misguided, some employers say, depriving certain industries of much-needed future workers. ''I think there is a stigma in society that says if you don't get a four-year degree you have not achieved,'' said Matthew Edwards, manager of human resources at Machine Specialties in Whitsett, N.C., which makes precision parts for the aerospace and defense industries and is desperate to hire 10 new machinists. ''And I don't think that is true. There are not enough technical people in the workforce for us to grow.''
Others question whether the skills shortage is simply a matter of employers not paying enough for qualified workers. In fact, the skills that employers most frequently say are in shortest supply are critical thinking, the ability to work in teams and communication, not specialized training.
''Our clients tell us 'I've found somebody who is an electrician or a technician, but they don't have a global mindset or can't work with people in different cultures,' '' said Mara E. Swan, executive vice president for global strategy and talent at ManpowerGroup, a job placement firm. '' 'They can't think beyond what I tell them to do.' ''
Even as experts debate how to teach such intangible skills, more jobs demand much higher math and reading proficiency than in the past.
In manufacturing, for example, work once performed on low-skilled assembly lines has mostly moved offshore or been automated. The jobs that remain require workers who can interpret blueprints, program computerized machinery and solve problems on the fly. According to a report by the Pioneer Institute, a public policy group, manuals for auto mechanics, plumbers and those who repair appliances are written ''up to a Grade 14 reading level.''
Yet many young people are not able to compete for these jobs. Nearly two-thirds of students who enter a community college within a few years of high school graduation require remedial math and reading classes, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.
Students who have a hard time grasping academic concepts in a traditional lecture or textbook may learn better in a practical, hands-on setting.
In an analysis of testing data from Massachusetts, Alison L. Fraser, author of the Pioneer Institute study of 27 regional vocational and technical education high schools in the state, found that vocational students vastly improved their passing rates on English and math standardized tests between 2001 and 2007, a period in which the schools focused on integrating academic instruction into technical classes. In fact, by 2007, the vocational students were actually passing at higher rates than students in the rest of the state.
In another study of 200 teachers and 3,000 students in nine states, James R. Stone III, director of the National Research Center for Career & Technical Education at the University of Louisville, similarly found that high school students whose teachers were given specific training in how to incorporate academic concepts into vocational classes scored, on average, 17 to 21 percentile points higher on standardized math tests than students in classes where vocational teachers had not been trained in academic integration.
One group of schools consistently held up as a model are career academies that integrate academics into occupationally-themed courses. Graduates of such academies earned, on average, 11 percent more a year than students from similar backgrounds who graduated from traditional high schools, according to a study by MDRC, formerly the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation. The Obama administration says that overall, data about career and technical education is mixed. There are ''islands of excellence,'' said Brenda Dann-Messier, assistant secretary for vocational and adult education, but there is still ''uneven quality around the country.''
Weaver Academy serves about 700 students a year in everything from heating and air conditioning to computer graphics in north central North Carolina. As furniture and textile production have left the area for Asia, the county has aggressively wooed new industries. Most prominently, Honda Aircraft broke ground in 2007 on its headquarters and a manufacturing plant in Greensboro. The company plans to hire as many as 350 people within a year.
Still, Gene Holder, head of Weaver's metals technology department, has struggled at times to entice students to his classes. ''People think that blue-collar jobs are bad,'' said Mr. Holder, an oak tree of a man with a goatee and aviator glasses who spent 17 years in manufacturing before teaching. ''But it is no longer the dirty, wet sweatshop-type thing. You have to really have something going on up here,'' he added, tapping his head.
Mr. Kelly initially signed up for an automotive mechanics class at Weaver, and added a metals manufacturing class with Mr. Holder simply to fill out his schedule. Drilling small holes at tolerances within one-thousandth of an inch and punching in complex programming codes held his attention more than classroom lectures ever did. ''You have to focus on it,'' he said.
Mr. Kelly completed two industry certifications from the National Institute for Metalworking Skills, a trade group, before graduating in June. ''It was a miracle we got him through high school,'' said his mother, Cynthia Kelly.
Ordinarily, a student with Mr. Kelly's aptitude would have been guided down a more academic track. His guidance counselor, Susan Schirick, said she was grateful that he had found another path, though it was bittersweet.
''Matt came in with zero motivation -- let's face it,'' Ms. Schirick said. The technical courses, she added, were ''a route to get him to see his future.''

HEADLINE: A Bridge Too Low And a Lesson For Visionaries

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER. 
E-mail: metropolitan@nytimes.com; Ariel Kaminer is on leave.

 BODY:
I'm concerned that the Second Avenue subway project makes no allowance for personal teleportation modules. I'm worried that the new wing of the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, does not account for the possibility that films might someday be projected directly onto the backsides of our eyelids.
Such stuff is troubling me because of a lovely boat ride I took a few weeks ago: a Hidden Harbor Tour, an evening excursion intended to show people that the waterways around the city are home to more than just the Statue of Liberty. The tour did a great job of that, but it also made me wonder whether the visionaries shaping our future are visionary enough. A few generations ago, they weren't, and it's about to cost us $1 billion. 
The Hidden Harbor Tours, which depart from Pier 16 on the East River, were developed by the Working Harbor Committee, which wants to make sure everyone knows New York Harbor is still an active port that provides lots of jobs in shipping, marine maintenance and such. There are actually three tours, one in the direction of the former Brooklyn Navy Yard, one up the West Side of Manhattan and the one I took, which checks in on the Erie Basin in Red Hook, Brooklyn, before heading through the Kill Van Kull and into Newark Bay. (The next offering of that tour is Tuesday at 6:15 p.m.)
Capt. John Doswell, the genial host, likes to bring along a guest speaker. On my tour it was Robert LaMura, commercial director of Ports America, a shipping terminal operator in the harbor. During our two-and-a-half-hour trip on a good-looking yacht named the Zephyr, the two of them brimmed with tidbits of interest to landlubbers -- why tugboats generally push rather than pull (it gives the tug more control); how those boxy shipping containers get on and off the huge ships; which of the warehouses along the shore is full of beer.
But one thing in particular was preoccupying Mr. LaMura: the Bayonne Bridge. ''The hottest topic in the industry,'' he called it. In maritime terms, it's killing us.
That's because, with a 151-foot clearance at midspan, it's just not high enough for the giant cargo ships now on the seas. If we don't do something about it, those ships are going to go to Boston or Norfolk, Va., or some other port, and jobs with them, Mr. LaMura said.
The Bayonne Bridge was opened in 1931 and connects Bayonne, N.J., with Staten Island. I don't know why anyone would want to go from Bayonne to Staten Island or vice versa, and if I were in charge I would just rip the thing down and replace it with giant car-flinging catapults, a transportation solution I have long advocated for all the river crossings hereabouts in an effort to make commuting more festive.
But a study has already looked at various options for the Bayonne Bridge problem and presumably has rejected that one, because it has instead recommended raising the bridge's roadbed by 64 feet. Looking at the bridge as we passed under it, I was hard-pressed to imagine how that would be done, but the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has explained it all on a succinct Web page that uses impressive-sounding words like ''gantry'' and ''constructability'' and ''conceptual animation,'' so apparently it's possible.
What is both interesting and alarming is to look up the news coverage of the original dedication of the bridge back in 1931. The structure was designed by Othmar H. Ammann, whose credits also include the George Washington and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridges, so the guy was pretty good at what he did. And at the opening of the Bayonne Bridge that November, after remarking that its four-lane capacity would be sufficient for years to come, he said this:
''The bridge has ample strength, however, so that at any time in the future, two or three more vehicular lanes may be added, thus increasing the vehicular capacity to at least 25,000,000 vehicles a year.''
In other words, Ammann, a great mind in his field at the time, foresaw that the bridge might someday become inadequate, but his vision went only horizontally. (And it wasn't very accurate; the bridge is still just four lanes, and it sees only seven million or so vehicles a year.) Neither he nor anyone else appears to have thought vertically and asked whether a ship stacked 152 feet high with cargo might one day come along. Now, fixing this oversight carries a billion-dollar price tag, considerably more than the $13 million the original bridge cost (the Port Authority's figure), even adjusted for inflation. Oops.
Anyway, all this makes you ponder what we're not envisioning today when we build new subway lines, skyscrapers, sports arenas and so on. Did we adequately study whether the tendency of crowds to do the wave counterclockwise will eventually cause our new ballparks to tilt like the Tower of Pisa? Should the High Line park have been built with a second travel lane for people who prefer to traverse it by jet pack?
One final note in this meditation. In conjunction with the opening of the bridge, tolls on the various crossings were adjusted. Here is a slice of the New York Times article reporting that news: ''A single-seat passenger automobile will pay 50 cents, as will a horsedrawn vehicle. Sixty cents will be charged for a two-seat passenger car, including a rumble seat when occupied. A twenty-six trip monthly commutation ticket for both classes of passenger cars will cost $8.'' Today, of course, you pay $8 for a single trip through the Bayonne Bridge toll. Times, it appears, change.

HEADLINE: A Mandate? Not Really

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai is the chief political correspondent for The Times Magazine and columnist for the Caucus political blog.

 BODY:
YOU may remember a brief time in 2009 when Washington seemed once again to be the most consequential city in the political world -- a place where leaders might finally ''set aside childish things,'' as the young president urged, and set about dragging government into the future.
Here we are, though, with Washington still paralyzed by arch partisanship and lurching ever closer to self-inflicted catastrophe, as the time left on the debt ceiling ticks away. You have to look to a bunch of far less glamorous American cities -- Albany, Trenton, Columbus, Tallahassee -- to find politicians who, in a variety of ways, are furiously dispatching old notions of government.
In the old industrial redoubts of New York and New Jersey, two first-term governors, the Democrat Andrew Cuomo and the Republican Chris Christie, just closed out remarkable legislative sessions, with contingents in both parties cooperating to slash spending and, in New York's case, to legalize same-sex marriage. Despite the resistance of some of the country's mightiest unions, both governors managed to broker deals that will begin to remake the contract between public workers and the government, rolling back union benefits and spending. 
Why can the states see their way clear to resolving huge and divisive problems, some even in a bipartisan way, while Washington continues to flail?
Explanations abound. Some sharp political observers say that the redrawing of district boundaries along partisan lines has created a Congress that represents the extremes of the populace, rather than the broad center you find represented in most state legislatures. It's also true that states have little choice but to be bolder in bad economic times, since all but a few are forced to balance their budgets.
But there's another important answer to this question, and it has to do with what most politicians in Washington took away from the cathartic elections that brought them to power, versus what a lot of their counterparts in the states understood the message to be. It's about whether you think the voters were validating an ideological argument -- ''They want to see us return to a sense of limited government,'' Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican House majority leader, crowed the day after the 2010 elections -- or whether you think they were demanding the kind of systemic reform that some governors are after. ''It was a reform mandate,'' Mr. Cuomo said in an interview last week, speaking of his election last year. ''It was, 'Reduce the cost, increase the effectiveness and, in this state, reduce the scandals and the embarrassment.' ''
I asked Mr. Cuomo if he thought New York's voters had weighed in on the old ideological debate over more government or less. ''I don't see less or more,'' he told me. ''I see effective versus ineffective.''
The unprecedented succession of wave elections in 2006, 2008 and 2010 -- meaning, by one popular definition, that a party picked up a minimum of 20 House seats in each of those years -- were largely interpreted by both parties in Washington as the wild swings of a fickle electorate. Democratic leaders in Congress saw their 2006 and 2008 victories as proof that a long period of resurgent liberalism was finally at hand. When the voters apparently changed their minds again in 2010, jubilant Republicans rejoiced that we were now a nation of Tea Party sympathizers.
Mr. Obama searched early in his presidency and at other points for some bipartisan consensus; practically his first move in office was to offer Republicans a slate of tax cuts as part of a deal on stimulus spending. But neither side in Congress has seemed especially interested in compromise.
That's because Democrats assumed after 2008 that they now had a mandate to inflate the federal budget and pass a sprawling national health care system (even more sprawling than the one President Obama ultimately got behind), just as Republicans now believe they have a mandate to slash spending and possibly push the nation into default on its loans. And on goes the argument, to no one's lasting benefit.
In truth, though, none of these elections had all that much to do with the orthodoxies of liberalism or conservatism; they were, rather, the manifestations of long-building frustration with the status quo, and with whatever party happened to embody it at the moment.
For decades, going back to the rise of independent politicians like Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura, the most powerful theme in American politics has been the promise of nonpartisan reform. You can define this, roughly speaking, as the idea that government should be more responsive to voters and less beholden to entrenched lobbies. It's the pursuit of efficiency and integrity rather than the prosecution of any ideological brief.
In the states, a lot of recently elected governors have worked relentlessly to frame their agendas in terms of making government functional and modern. One of the first things that struck me about Mr. Christie's strategy when I spent time with him last winter was the royal blue banner that seemed to hover behind him wherever he spoke. ''Christie Reform Agenda,'' it said. ''Rethink, Reform, Rebuild New Jersey.''
By constantly harping on this theme of reform, Mr. Christie has been able, to a large extent, to reshuffle traditional alliances in the legislature. The dynamic is no longer simply about Democrats on one side and Republicans on the other, but rather about forcing lawmakers of both parties to choose between Mr. Christie's agenda and the large public unions he viciously excoriates.
''People don't want this Republican-Democrat thing anymore,'' Stephen Sweeney, the Democratic president of the State Senate, told me. Mr. Sweeney has partnered with Mr. Christie to pass several divisive measures that will remake pension systems and hold down property taxes -- although not without tension. Last week, reacting to Mr. Christie's budget, Mr. Sweeney publicly called him a ''punk'' and said he wanted to punch him in the head. ''People are at a point now where they're just going to keep changing politicians out,'' Mr. Sweeney said, ''until they get the combination that seems to work.''
Similarly, Mr. Cuomo struck the chord of nonpartisan reform in his inaugural speech, vowing to make government less bureaucratic and more accountable, and hasn't let up since. You could make a case that even on gay marriage, an issue that endeared him to liberal admirers, Mr. Cuomo reinforced this theme. While a previous bill died in the State Senate without a single Republican vote, Mr. Cuomo managed to win the backing of key Republican contributors and the votes of four Republican lawmakers to secure passage -- thus providing more evidence of a functioning government that wasn't deadlocked by partisanship.
Not all governors are more credible as reformers than as partisans. Take, for instance, Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Rick Scott in Florida, who have taken advantage of legislative majorities to ram through their agendas. Mr. Walker declared war on his state's public employee unions even though they had already agreed to compromises, and Mr. Scott summarily cut hundreds of millions of dollars from the budget while treating most reporters and Democrats as enemies of the state. In Minnesota, partisan rancor between the new Democratic governor, Mark Dayton, and Republicans in the legislature plunged the state into an ongoing shutdown.
But in New York and New Jersey, where both governors have credibly made reform their central premise, longstanding barriers to legislating have fallen mainly because lawmakers of both parties have to reckon with the resonance of that argument. In other words, legislators in a state where reform seems to be gaining momentum must think twice before letting themselves get left behind.
It's a whole other scene in Washington, where both sides talk mostly in terms of what their party believes versus what the other party believes. Recently, Mr. Obama and John Boehner, the House leader, angered their supporters by reaching out across party lines to signal that they were open to changes in Medicare, Social Security and new revenue as part of a comprehensive deal. These were bold moves, but the problem for both leaders is that both sides in Congress still believe their partisan arguments will ultimately win out and perhaps enable them to sweep the next election.
They might even be right. But as Mr. Obama seems to grasp, the party -- or the candidate -- that ultimately embodies a less predictable, less doctrinaire kind of reform will be the one that changes politics for good.

HEADLINE: Flamboyant Financier Refocuses After Fall

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH LESLY STEVENS. 
estevens@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Elizabeth Lesly Stevens writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
Victor B. MacFarlane was a winner. Then he was a loser. Now, like many others brought low by the financial crisis, he is intent on being a winner again, though on a much humbler scale.
For 18 years, Mr. MacFarlane's real estate development and asset-management firm in San Francisco invested huge sums for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund, and other institutional investors. 
His early dedication to urban real estate produced healthy returns and management fees. With his long friendship with the power broker Willie L. Brown Jr. and onetime partnership with the former basketball star Magic Johnson, Mr. MacFarlane became the most-prominent black financier in San Francisco.
Mr. MacFarlane rode the real-estate boom with flair, buying two private planes, a soccer team, and two penthouses at San Francisco's St. Regis (also the residence of Mr. Brown).
Then came the crash.
Mr. MacFarlane lost more than $1 billion of CalPERS's money on exurban housing developments in Southern California and Arizona. Unable to sell his St. Regis aerie for $70 million, he recently turned the penthouses over to his lender. CalPERS is no longer a client of his firm, MacFarlane Partners. Half of his employees are gone. Ownership of the soccer team, D.C. United, didn't work out, either.
Many investors, of course, lost big in the financial crisis. But few lost more publicly than Mr. MacFarlane. A recent Bloomberg headline reminded everyone that, thanks to him, ''Arizona Land Sells for 8% of Price CalPERS Group Paid at Peak.'' Mr. MacFarlane said he resigned his CalPERS account, and The Wall Street Journal heralded the news with ''CalPERS Cleans House, Finally.'' That $1 billion Mr. MacFarlane lost will haunt the state for years, since taxpayers are responsible for CalPERS's liabilities.
But now Mr. MacFarlane is mounting a comeback, announcing two developments in recent weeks. The rental-apartment and small retail projects -- one at what is now a pit at the corner of Market and Octavia, the other involving an old foam-cup factory in Corte Madera -- are quite a comedown from glamorous projects of yore like the Time Warner Center in New York.
Some might take Mr. MacFarlane's ability to get even small deals done as a sad indicator of a financial industry culture in which failure brings few consequences. But if this 60-year-old liver-transplant survivor can pick himself up and get back in the game, then perhaps it's a sign of something more hopeful -- that if you have the smarts and the moxie, you can pick yourself up and start afresh.
Sitting in his office in SoMa, framed by celebrity-friend photos and a commanding view of the Bay Bridge, Mr. MacFarlane doesn't seem to have put the past entirely behind him. The once-formidable investor has a haunted look about him, his broad, reflexive salesman's smile never quite making it to his eyes.
Spinning gamely, Mr. MacFarlane said he was simply returning to the strategies that brought him initial success decades ago.
''The market is moving back to what we do,'' he said, adding that while his firm was ''always well-known for our biggest investments, we have always done this range of deals.''
Mr. MacFarlane raised his current $211 million investment fund in 2009, from three unidentified European institutions, and Goldman Sachs now owns 20 percent of the firm. The two new projects will cost about $123 million.
Nori Gerardo Lietz, chief strategist for private real estate at the Partners Group, an investment-management firm, gives Mr. MacFarlane considerable credit for forging on. A self-made man, Mr. MacFarlane grew up poor in Middletown, Ohio, made it to a Presbyterian boarding school in Arizona and later earned an M.B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and a law degree from U.C.L.A.
''Victor is an interesting, complicated person,'' Ms. Lietz said. ''The real estate business in general is very clearly a white man's business. And so, he had to maneuver as an African-American man in that context, which certainly wasn't easy. Without a doubt he had to build a business with considerable headwinds against him.''
In that vein, Mr. MacFarlane explained that it was fine with him, at this point, to be dealing in much smaller deals.
In today's post-crash reality, ''much more important is your sphere of influence,'' rather than huge dollar figures attached to big developments, he said. ''That's usually enough to get by.''

HEADLINE: Throwing a New Curve At Small-Car Shoppers

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
TODAY'S youngsters might be forgiven for assuming that the television was born flat, that music always fit in a digital postage stamp or that economy cars have always been safe, stylish and stuffed.
These innocents have no reference point for the visual and mechanical calamities of yore. Names like Pacer and Escort, Omni and Citation, will be met with blank looks, as will tales of hardier generations sanding away rust or trudging through snow when another tiny junker died in the breakdown lane.
Coming from Hyundai, whose own small cars once seemed as disposable as butane lighters, the redesigned 2012 Elantra shows how thoroughly things have changed. As more Americans embrace small cars as a hedge against fuel prices, automakers are returning the hug with compacts that perform believable impressions of larger, pricier machines.
They're typically a tad slower and their 4-cylinder engines a bit louder; a passenger may suffer the indignity of having to manually adjust a seat. But details aside, these cars have really grown up. 
They've become larger and stronger, with remarkable levels of technology, equipment and crash protection. And while the Elantra doesn't shake up its class as thoroughly as the midsize Hyundai Sonata did last year, it challenges the leaders for the first time.
Without a doubt, and despite some flaws, the Elantra delivers the most adventurous styling, a leading warranty and the most features for the price.
Hyundai intends to fully redesign the Elantra every four years, illustrating the Darwinian competition among small cars. In the last year, four other all-new compact cars have come to market: the 2011 Chevrolet Cruze, Volkswagen Jetta and Honda Civic, and the 2012 Ford Focus.
The Toyota Corolla remains a quiet stalwart. For all-wheel-drive fans, a redesigned Subaru Impreza is about to pull into showrooms. And this fall, the Focus's sporty cousin, the Mazda 3, adds a slick Skyactiv engine that will lift its highway mileage to 40 m.p.g.
And 40 m.p.g. has suddenly become the sine qua non for small sedans and hatchbacks. The Elantra chins that bar as well, if only in the eyes of the Environmental Protection Agency, which rates the Hyundai at 29 miles per gallon in town and 40 on the highway.
With Hyundai rebuilding its lineup like a billionaire team owner on a free-agent binge -- bringing seven new models to market over 24 months -- the Elantra follows the recent Santa Fe and Tucson crossovers and Sonata and Equus sedans.
The Elantra has adopted, from the Sonata, the so-called fluidic sculpture design theme. The description is clumsy, but the results are handsome: from its friendly-alien face to its roller-coaster wheel arches, the Elantra's body has a cascading flow.
The swell-and-flow continues inside, in an expensive-looking cabin that shares class honors with the Chevy; it's also more youthful feeling and less monochromatic than the Cruze. Two big climate-control knobs are stacked like a pretty wedding cake, with blue- and red-frosted accents. The engine start button and driver's gauges glow in ice blue, and a piano-black finish plays over the shifter and its housing.
And where Hyundai used to crib shamelessly from Lexus for its interior styling, it has apparently raised its sights: the fan control knob, with its tactile knurled-metal finish, is straight from the Bentley playbook. All the controls, in fact, are pleasing to the eye, hand and brain, including Hyundai's fine touch-screen navigation system. (But the audio controls on versions without the nav system are hopelessly clunky.) There's notably good storage space, including a deep center console box, and 12-volt and USB/iPod connectors in an open cubby at the base of the dashboard
The head-scratcher is the absence of either power seats or automatic climate control, even as options. I had some trouble finding the just-right driving position, and a colleague found the driver's seat cushion too short for comfortable thigh support.
As with most new ''compacts,'' the Hyundai doesn't just push size boundaries, it demolishes them. The Elantra is only an inch longer and nearly two inches lower than before, riding a two-inch-longer wheelbase. Yet Hyundai has carved out more interior volume than in the larger Nissan Maxima.
The Elantra is classified by the E.P.A. as a midsize sedan, joining the Cruze, Jetta, Focus and Nissan Sentra. The result is a sedan with the most front legroom in the class and one of the roomiest trunks at nearly 15 cubic feet.
On paper, the Hyundai has its internals in order as well. You get four-wheel-disc brakes with brake assist, compared with cheaper rear drums on the Jetta and some other competitors. A new 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine delivers a healthy 148 horsepower. The engine is mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission developed in-house that is especially nimble and refined. And in a neat twist to the usual stability-control functions, the electric steering can automatically dial in a few degrees of countersteer to steady the car when it begins to lose traction or veer off course.
I drove a top-of-the-heap Elantra Limited, whose special PZEV version (for Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle) trims pollution levels to hybridlike lows. That PZEV model is offered in California, Oregon and several Northeast states that conform with California's stricter air-quality rules.
Once in motion, the Hyundai turns out to be slightly less than the sum of its parts.
The engine is an especially eager revver, but gets vociferous in its upper register. More distressing is the ride over rough stuff: the Elantra feels choppy, loud and unsettled compared with many of its rivals, especially the creamy-feeling Civic and Cruze.
The structure, too, can feel as jiggly as fresh panna cotta. Slamming the doors or trunk produces a hollow echo rather than a reassuring thunk.
Yet the steering is accurate, and I still enjoyed driving the Elantra and even tossing it around.
Since the E.P.A. adjusted its test procedures to deliver a closer real-world accounting, I've been able to achieve -- with only a little conscious effort -- the window-sticker mileage in almost every car I test. But these new 40-m.p.g. compacts seem to be gaming the system, using tricks like insanely tall overdrive gears that help to beat the test.
Hyundai, for its part, has trumpeted the fact that every version of the Elantra -- not just special models like the stick-shift version of the Cruze Eco -- is rated at 40 m.p.g. on the highway.
But Hyundai might want to turn down the volume: I couldn't get above 37 m.p.g. in the Elantra, even when observing a 55 m.p.h. speed limit, with or without cruise control. In typical highway driving, I got 31 to 34 m.p.g., which is reasonably good economy, but much less than advertised.
Yet for Hyundai, the bottom line is still the bottom line: the Elantra costs less than its main competitors in a budget-minded class where every dollar counts. Though it has more standard features than the Civic or Cruze, including those four-wheel-disc brakes, the Elantra costs about $1,000 to $2,000 less, depending on the model.
Starting at $15,955 for the GLS with a manual transmission, the Elantra rises to $23,305 for a loaded Limited. That price includes a single option, a $2,100 Premium Package whose features include that intuitive touch-screen navigation system, a backup camera, a 360-watt premium audio system and a proximity key that allows you to open the doors and start the engine with the key in your pocket.
Hyundai (and its Kia corporate cousin) easily wins the compact class warranty battle, with powertrain coverage for 10 years or 100,000 miles, bumper-to-bumper coverage of five years or 60,000 miles and unlimited roadside assistance for five years.
Elantra drivers will look good, but they will also look smart.
And despite some pesky ride-and-refinement issues, that's a formula for a successful small car.

HEADLINE: Not-So-Representative Investors

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
SHOW me a new study about water on the moon, or why pregnant women don't tip over, and I'm happy as a pig in whatever it is that pigs like. I'm just a big fan of science.
So I am thrilled by a recent learned paper that says quite a lot about money and the people who make it.
The study, ''Abnormal Returns From the Common Stock Investments of Members of the U.S. House of Representatives,'' is a real eye-opener. Using the financial disclosures of politicians, the research team built model portfolios and charted their performance. They found that House members ''earn statistically significant positive abnormal returns,'' outperforming the market by 6 percentage points.
Senators do even better, the authors say, citing their own earlier research from 2004. Senate portfolios ''show some of the highest excess returns ever recorded over a long period of time, significantly outperforming even hedge fund managers,'' with gains that are ''both economically large and statistically significant.'' 
They beat the market, my friends, by 10 percentage points a year.
Take that, Jim Cramer!
The authors suggest that members of Congress have access to ''nonpublic information that could have a substantial impact on certain businesses, industries or the economy as a whole,'' and that investing on that information ''could yield significant personal trading profits.''
In the study, the authors recommend all kinds of new disclosure and monitoring requirements to root out misconduct and shut the door on the Congressional casino.
Wonks!
The real lesson here, obviously, is an unbeatable investment strategy. To your impecunious correspondent, the path is clear: I need to be elected to Congress!
Over the years, my own strategy has produced abnormal returns, but in the wrong direction. Like a reverse Midas, I have a way of turning gold into stuff that pigs like. It's time for me to produce gains that are ''both economically large and statistically significant.''
I called one of the authors of the report, Alan J. Ziobrowski, an associate professor of business at Georgia State University, to learn more. He explained that he and the other researchers used the phrase ''abnormal returns'' to describe profits ''beyond the area that we would call normal good fortune,'' money so large that ''it's not rational to assume that they are just plain dumb-lucky.''
Professor Ziobrowski also gave one possible explanation for why the trading profits appeared to diminish the longer that someone served in office. ''At some point,'' he said, ''it could be that the risk isn't worth the return, if you know what I mean.''
About now, you are probably thinking, ''Schwartz, you idiot.'' And, if you've read this column before, it's not a new thought. But this time I really think I'm on to something. You run for office on other people's money. Once you win, you get the bits of information -- academics might call them the Ziobrowski Whispers -- that will bend the markets to your will.
What could possibly go wrong?
Well, Professor Ziobrowski's enthusiasm for my idea seemed somewhat muted, as if he actually did not appreciate its brilliance.
''The key is, you've got to get elected,'' he explained patiently. ''You may have to sell your soul to do that.''
I asked, ''And the problem with that is?''
He laughed. Considering what he knows about the possible returns, I asked, had he ever thought of running himself? ''No, I can't honestly say I did,'' he said. ''I'm a lowly little college professor.''
From Georgia, I pointed out. College professors from Georgia haven't done badly on the national stage. Newt Gingrich has had two lines of credit at Tiffany's worth more than a million bucks!
Mr. Ziobrowski, astonishingly, demurred. ''I'm not ready to trade my free time for money.''
Frustrated, I called a former member of Congress, Nick Lampson, a Texas Democrat who served from 1997 to 2009, with a break from 2005 to 2007 because of an electoral loss.
I told him that I was looking for a role model. ''You may have the wrong person,'' he said. Especially when he served in Congress, he said, ''I've always lived hand to mouth and didn't have disposable income to invest.'' Even now, he said, ''I don't have any stocks in anything of consequence.''
While he heard things while serving that might have made him some money, he said, ''I never felt comfortable doing things when I heard.'' His time in Congress did not make his family rich, he said, but he's not complaining. ''We're paying our bills, and I sleep well at night, and I'm reasonably happy,'' he said.
What's wrong with these people? That's certainly not the way I'd play the game. I disclosed to him my desire to cash in by getting in.
He said something that caught me by surprise. Though you couldn't tell it by looking at many of the members, it's actually not that easy to be elected to Congress. ''It's ugly,'' he said. ''It's hard.'' Party labels set voters against you, he said, and people say awful things about you. Still, he said, ''If you're there, and you're there for the right reasons, it's for me the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life.''
I don't think we have the same working definition of ''rewarding'' or ''the right reasons.''
This was starting to sound like a less attractive deal than I had thought. An opponent who wanted to say awful things about me probably wouldn't even have to lie, or to dig very deep. People have said awful things about me for most of my life, and to my face. They are called editors.
But I digress.
If I can't win, here's another thought: How about a mutual fund tied to senators' purchases? If their information is so good, let's all sign on.
The possible flaw in that plan, of course, is that information is only valuable if it's held by the few. Let everyone in on the secrets, and they aren't secrets any more. The senators and House members wouldn't make any more money in the market than the rest of us.
And the problem with that is?

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
THE fog had burned to tatters and the rain clouds turned shy at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pa., early one Sunday afternoon last month as 43 stock cars stormed toward the opening green flag of the Energy 500 at the track known as the Tricky Triangle.
Picking up speed, the cars, neon-splashed Chevys, Dodges, Fords and Toyotas competing in Nascar's Sprint Cup Series, neared a pavement-pounding 180 miles an hour -- all swaddled in a Phil Spector-style wall of sound.
And in a muddy field just beyond the track Mike Wells, director of Nascar races for TNT, was holed up in a dark production truck in a scene he later described as controlled chaos, his attention divided among the feeds from dozens of cameras, his staff and, in his earpiece, the voices of reporters, analysts, drivers and crew chiefs.
But Mr. Wells's job is much more than getting the right images on viewers' TV screens. He's trying as hard as he can to make the fan at home feel as if he's there at the track. 
Stock-car racing is a sensual sport. For fans in the grandstands and the infield nothing rivals the heady reek of hot high-octane fuel and smoldering rubber, or the gut-vibrating bellow of 750-horsepower motors. But for even the most devoted fan 200 laps on a TV screen can bleed into mind-numbing repetition.
''As good as the audio is, you can't recreate that noise, the feeling in that air, the pit stop, the wind, the vibration,'' said Steve Stum, managing director of operations for Nascar Media Group and the compound's de facto mayor. ''The hardest part is getting that atmosphere.''
That's where Mr. Wells comes in. ''It's a pressure cooker, but you just focus on what you do and you do it,'' he said. ''There's no break in the action, no timeout like football. When we go to commercial, those drivers aren't stopping, and we aren't stopping. At the end of the day we're really like a racing team.''
It takes a lot of work and coordination effectively to bring a Nascar race into the living room. Thirty-eight weeks a year the Cup Series, the peak of stock-car racing, journeys from Loudon, N.H.; to Homestead, Fla.; to Sonoma, Calif., and lots of points in between, dragging with it big rigs loaded with cars and equipment and the million-dollar motor coaches that house the drivers once they disembark from their private jets.
Behind the scenes, though, a different kind of race is taking place as a caravan of 37 tractor-trailers and some 500 employees crisscross the nation from track to track to erect the compound known in Nascar circles as the TV City.
A makeshift village of production facilities, satellite antennas, temporary offices and even a canteen, held together by miles of fiber-optic and electrical cables, the compound provides the technical wherewithal for Cup Series coverage by TNT, Fox, ESPN and ABC, which share the season's broadcasts.
''It's the Super Bowl every week,'' said Steve Herbst, the vice president for broadcasting and global media strategy at Nascar Media Group.
Made up of 22 mobile production units and 15 support trailers valued at nearly $50 million, the TV City will travel more than 35,000 miles this season. The entourage arrives at a speedway on a Monday or Tuesday, and it will take the crew 60 hours to prepare for a broadcast, usually on a Sunday, and six hours to break down the compound after the race and get it on the road again.
It's an exercise in constant motion, during which 250,000 feet of cable will be laid around the track and linked to the facility, connecting cameras, microphones and other technical components like car sensors that monitor performance and radio feeds of communication between drivers and teams. The production staff members, some with families in tow, stay in hotels, heading home for one day at the beginning of the week before setting off for the next racetrack. The long-haul drivers will park their trucks and fly to other jobs before returning to move their rigs to the next town. And the canteen staff will make sure everyone is fed three meals a day.
''It's like a traveling circus,'' said Jeff Behnke, executive producer and senior vice president of production for Turner Sports, which oversees the middle six races, including the Lenox Industrial Tools 301 at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway next Sunday. ''It takes seven to eight months of planning to put this thing together for our six weeks.''
These days a typical Cup Series broadcast can pull from as many as 80 cameras on the track and in the pits, the grandstand and even the cars, allowing for side-by-side and front-to-back vantage points similar to what the drivers see when they're careering at top speed just two inches -- or less -- from another vehicle.
Pit stops for split-second refueling, tire changes and chassis adjustments are clocked and their times compared on screen. One hundred microphones are located around the raceway -- and, new this summer, on crew chiefs -- ''to get that sound right in your face,'' Mr. Wells said.
And energetic music and graphics featuring real-time statistics and telemetry keep the excitement level high. So do Nascar tie-ins to television shows like ''The Glades'' on A&E and movies like ''Cars 2'' and ''Transformers: Dark of the Moon.'' ''It's about making the drivers bigger stars than they already are,'' Mr. Wells said.
After a decade in which Nascar grew as fast as Jimmie Johnson driving with open track in front of him, it hit a rough patch. The economy took its toll on Nascar, industry experts said of the dip in viewership and attendance in the last couple of years, and so did, just maybe, Mr. Johnson's five consecutive Cup Series championships.
There was also the nagging realization that Nascar's efforts at image control had created a sterile playing field. But lately the organization has loosened its own seat belt, starting with the edict of Robin Pemberton, the vice president for competition, who in January 2010 proclaimed, ''Boys, have at it, and have a good time.''
And, boy, have they.
Kyle Busch, a hot-headed, hard-driving 26-year-old, quickly emerged as this season's villain, sparring on the track and off this spring with Kevin Harvick, the series leader after the Coke Zero 400 at the Daytona International Speedway on July 3.
(Mr. Busch also earned the wrath of Richard Childress, a team owner, who was fined $150,000 for punching him in the face, twice, on June 4.)
When Brian Vickers blocked Tony Stewart on Lap 37 at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., on June 26, Mr. Stewart -- who earlier had complained that his colleagues were showing less respect for one another and driving ''like idiots'' -- wrecked Mr. Vickers. So on Lap 87 Mr. Vickers returned the favor.
''It's kind of a throwback to the old days,'' Mr. Stum said. ''A little controversy is always good for anything as long as you don't let it get out of hand.''
The anger, not unlike the semi-sanctioned skirmishes in the N.H.L., has helped re-energize Nascar. So has the success of fresh faces like Trevor Bayne, who on Feb. 20, the day after his 20th birthday, became the youngest driver to win the Daytona 500, and Joey Logano, who at 21 is the youngest driver to win in two of the top three divisions.
Rule changes that allow cars to resume full speed instead of sputtering across the finish line after a late-in-the-race caution -- the period when drivers are slowed by the pace car after a problem on the track -- have also heightened the competition.
The result is a spike in viewership in the coveted category of men ages 18 to 34, which so far has topped the 2010 average by 20 percent. (The median age last year, according to Nielsen, was 51.6 -- higher than the N.F.L., N.B.A., N.H.L. and Major League Baseball.) Fox, which broadcast the first 13 races of the season, averaged 8.6 million viewers, up 9.7 percent. TNT averaged more than 5.3 million viewers through the first four weeks of coverage, up 6 percent.
''We're pleased with the year so far, but there's a lot of work to do to keep that momentum going,'' Mr. Herbst said. ''We're not tricking anyone out there with any kind of newfangled ideas. The fans know that at the core of the broadcast is the racing.''
Still, Nascar has consistently improved the home viewing experience, said David M. Carter, executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California. ''They've redoubled their focus on delivering the best possible technology to their fans. They're giving them an immersive experience and making them feel like they're a part of that race.''
Now if Nascar could only find a way to bring the sweet reek of burning rubber into the living room.

HEADLINE: The Private Eye Wears a Skullcap

BYLINE: By JED LIPINSKI

 BODY:
JOE LEVIN, a private investigator in Brooklyn, was waiting to meet a new client in the parking lot of a kosher supermarket in Borough Park one recent morning. Glancing in the side-view mirror of his chauffeured sport utility vehicle, Mr. Levin said he liked this particular spot because he knew the manager, the delivery man and the security guard, who lets him borrow footage from the lot's surveillance equipment.
Most of the time, though, Mr. Levin does his own snooping. On his iPad, he scrolled through photographs of people he was being paid about $100 an hour to follow, including a rebellious Hasidic girl in a white miniskirt and a long-bearded rabbi lighting a cigarette on the sidewalk.
''He's a bad guy,'' Mr. Levin said, enlarging the rabbi's image. ''A very bad guy.'' 
Not your usual private eye, Mr. Levin is a practicing Orthodox Jew, a member of the Bobov Hasidic sect and the founder of T.O.T. Private Investigation and Consulting, a New York-based company that specializes in Orthodox-related cases worldwide. The company, whose focus is uncommon -- and perhaps unique in the United States -- hires forensic experts, former homicide detectives, photographers and even pilots, mostly on a per-case basis. Its services range from investigations into international banks and Israeli investment companies to local background checks for prospective Shidduchim, or Orthodox marital arrangements.
Since Mr. Levin started the business 12 years ago, his life has often resembled the plot of a TV crime drama. He has trailed unwitting subjects into synagogues and strip clubs, sat beside them on international flights and tracked them down in remote areas of Puerto Rico and Brazil.
While he usually wears the black frock coat and fedora of the Hasidim, when undercover he has donned stocking caps and Yankees jerseys to conceal his brown knit skullcap and tzitzit, the ritual fringes worn by observant Jews.
His organization's mission is encoded in the name T.O.T., an acronym for the Yiddish expression ''Tuchis afn tish.''
''It means 'Put your tuchis on the table,' '' said Mr. Levin, a bearded, powerfully built man in his late 30s, who shaved off his side locks years ago out of personal preference. ''In other words, 'Show me the proof.' And that's what I do. I bring my proof to the people.''
Mr. Levin has provided key evidence in dozens of high-profile cases. In November, he found Yitzhak Shuchat, a Hasidic man from Crown Heights whom the police were seeking as a suspect in the 2008 beating of a police officer's son, in a village outside Tel Aviv. Though Mr. Levin was hired by a member of a Hasidic volunteer crime patrol, he turned his information over to the Brooklyn district attorney's office, which has requested Mr. Shuchat's extradition.
Mr. Levin said that information he learned in April led to the indictment of Rabbi Samuel Kellner of Brooklyn on charges that he had bribed a witness in a child molestation case against Baruch Mordechai Lebovits of Borough Park in an effort to extort money from Mr. Lebovits.
Mr. Levin was hired by the family of Mr. Lebovits after he was sentenced last year to up to 32 years in prison on a sexual abuse conviction. Mr. Lebovits has been released on bail pending the outcome of Rabbi Kellner's trial.
Mr. Levin is intentionally vague about his background. He acknowledges that he served in the Israeli Army before moving to New York in 1994, but beyond that, he has managed to keep much of his life, and his livelihood, invisible.
''For years I tried to have not just a low profile, but no profile,'' he said. ''People would say to me, 'I haven't heard of you,' and I'd say: 'That's great! If you've heard of me, you must have been in trouble.' ''
Still, last year he started a Web site and began talking to the news media, figuring that he might as well capitalize on the publicized cases that had helped spread his name. But his main motivation, he said, was a growing concern for the safety of the Orthodox. Financial crime is on the rise in Orthodox neighborhoods, fueled, in Mr. Levin's view, by the recession, high birth rates and a lack of higher education that keeps young people from getting high-paying jobs.
In the Hasidic section of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for instance, police statistics show that while the number of violent crimes has fallen in the past 10 years, episodes of grand larceny have increased by more than 40 percent.
Unlike the retired government agents and police officials who often start their own private investigation companies, Mr. Levin can penetrate insular Orthodox strongholds without raising suspicion.
''There are a lot of intricate rules and coded behaviors that people from outside these communities don't understand,'' said Shmarya Rosenberg, a former Chabad-Lubavitch Hasid and the author of the muckraking blog FailedMessiah.com, who has interviewed Mr. Levin for several articles. ''You might think you blend in at the synagogue, for example, but to the Hasidim, it's as if a monkey in a spacesuit has just descended from outer space.''
As an Orthodox Jew, Mr. Levin is also allowed to testify in rabbinical court, where matters like divorces and business disputes are settled according to Jewish law. Rabbis who oversee these trials often refuse to look at the explicit evidence Mr. Levin collects, like photographs of a husband committing adultery. They will, however, take his personal testimony.
All the same, non-Jews come in handy on the Sabbath, when Mr. Levin is not able to work. ''Saturday is a very busy day for mischief inside the Hasidic world,'' he said, adding that he mainly hires off-duty police officers to cover for him until the sun goes down. ''Everyone thinks we're sleeping. But in reality we're wide awake.''
Mr. Levin outsources jobs that are beyond his expertise. Some Orthodox people come to him with marital problems because, he said, they do not know that therapists and marriage counselors exist. He recalled one client from Long Island who suspected her husband of infidelity. ''I asked if she still loved her husband, and she said yes,'' he recalled. ''So I told her, 'Don't hire me.' Because if I come back with the evidence, it's too late for the marriage counselor.''
When investigating Internet-related crimes like identity theft and e-mail harassment, he turns to a small cadre of computer forensics specialists.
In fact, the only time Mr. Levin sits at a computer is to post news stories of interest to Jews on his blog each morning. (Subjects of recent posts have included the Colombian singer Shakira's visit to the Western Wall and the Twitter scandal of Anthony D. Weiner, the former representative.) Mr. Levin spends most of his day driving around Brooklyn to consult new clients, meet with lawyers and potential sources, and deal with unexpected twists in his cases.
On a recent job in Borough Park, he stared through the tinted windows of his S.U.V. at a nervous-looking Hasidic man on the sidewalk. Days earlier, the man had claimed to possess a videotape of a rabbi having sex with two underage girls.
Mr. Levin, who was dressed in a beige topcoat, Burberry sunglasses and a Nike baseball cap, expressed skepticism. ''I'm not believing this baloney,'' he said as his driver snapped photographs of the man through the windshield. ''Look at how he's pacing, and smoking cigarettes one after one. He's not reliable, this guy.''
A few hours later, Mr. Levin met with the man and several others in an empty synagogue. It turned out that the videotape was actually held by a man who was not there, and who might hand it over in exchange for money, a prostitute and a new iPhone.
Back in the car, Mr. Levin said that because the holder of the tape was black, he would send a black off-duty police officer to try to recover it. ''An Orthodox guy knocking on his door would not be a good start,'' he said.
Though some members of the Orthodox faith say they have faced harassment or intimidation for committing even mildly subversive acts, Mr. Levin plays down the risks of spying and telling within the community. In rabbinical court, he said, the subjects of his investigations have become enraged. ''They scream at me,'' he said. ''But that's normal. Gradually they calm down.''
Nevertheless, Mr. Rosenberg of FailedMessiah said Mr. Levin faced a difficult choice when investigating big, newsworthy scandals. ''You don't want to draw bad publicity to the Orthodox faith,'' he said, ''but you also don't want to see the crime continue.''
As a religious man, Mr. Levin says the crimes he sees pain him deeply.
''When I wake up in the morning, I pray to God and I want to believe that there are good people in the world,'' he said. ''But when I go to work every day and I see what I see, it's a very big challenge for me.''
Mr. Levin's wife of 13 years, Ruthie Levin, 33, said he often has trouble sleeping.
''Last night he was up every hour,'' she said recently, sitting beside him outside their home. She added that the pressure of a new case involving two powerful rabbis was causing him stress.
Asked whether Mr. Levin had ever used his investigative skills in their relationship, she raised her eyebrows.
''Are you kidding?'' she said. ''Before we met, he knew all the boys I'd ever dated. He knew everything about me.''
How did he come to know these things? ''I'd been looking into it,'' Mr. Levin said, cracking a smile. ''Let's put it like that.''

POROUS AFGHAN-TAJIK BORDER
IS A WORRY FOR THE U.S.
An extremely poor, mostly Muslim nation of about 7.6 million people, Tajikistan shares an 870-mile border with Afghanistan. It is a porous and in some places intangible boundary that hews closely to the River Pyandzh, with a smattering of poorly trained, undereducated and easily corruptible guards deployed to protect it. Possible militant incursions into Tajikistan have put the Tajik government increasingly on edge. PAGE 10

HEADLINE: A Severe Case of Portfolio Whiplash

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
MARKETS continued to zigzag in the second quarter as investors sought risk, then shunned it, then sought it again -- depending on whether they were unnerved by economic and political developments or hopeful for benign resolutions to them. Ultimately, not much was resolved, but there may have been more sleep lost than money, as stocks were little changed and bonds recorded modest gains.
There were also many other sorts of changes during the quarter. Credit conditions in southern Europe deteriorated, with Greece barely managing to avoid default. Uprisings spread in the Middle East and North Africa, and the Chinese economy showed signs of cooling off.
Evidence of flagging momentum was also seen in the United States, prompting economists to shave growth forecasts. As the quarter wound down, investors learned that they and the economy would be getting less help from the Federal Reserve; the Fed confirmed that it would stop being a net buyer of Treasury bonds at the end of June through its quantitative easing program. 
Maybe some quieter rhetoric from Washington about narrowing the nation's immense fiscal deficit would have lifted investors' spirits. Instead, the debate grew more acrimonious. The quarter ended with no agreement and the prospect of a standoff on raising the debt ceiling. If no action is taken in coming weeks, the government's ability to borrow additional money and pay existing debts could be limited.
For all the unpleasantness, difficulty and doubt that investors endured in the second quarter, a sharp rebound in its last few days left the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down only 0.4 percent for the period and cut the loss in the average domestic stock mutual fund in Morningstar's database to 0.2 percent. United States general stock funds dropped 0.1 percent, however.
The strongest market sectors were health care and consumer staples, while funds with a focus on energy or other commodities performed poorly.
Funds specializing in foreign stocks also rose, with an average increase of 0.6 percent, despite economic, financial and political turmoil abroad. The average bond fund rose 1.5 percent, as yields fell on Treasury and many corporate bond issues. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell to 3.16 percent from 3.45 percent.
Investment advisers are expressing little confidence about what comes next, as many of the catalysts for the big ups and downs of the last few months continue to lurk. But if apprehension is widespread, so, too, is a desire to be invested in stocks, especially domestically.
''Global markets and the global economy are facing headwinds'' from ''the mosaic of macro events that have come together,'' said Christopher Conkey, chief investment officer for global equities at John Hancock Asset Management. ''Are we out of the woods? It's not likely.'' Nevertheless, he sees ''the prospect for a reasonable equity market going forward.''
Henry Herrmann, chief executive of the fund management firm Waddell & Reed, pointed out that many of the headwinds have been blowing for a long while.
''The market pulled back because things that were likely to happen, in fact, happened,'' he said. ''I think it's justified. I was surprised that the market looked through a lot of these things earlier in the year.''
Mr. Herrmann anticipates a continued shaky stock market until fiscal and credit issues are ''resolved one way or the other'' in the United States and Europe. He says he does not expect stocks to ''go down dramatically'' or ''make a lot of progress'' in the months ahead.
Stocks went down sharply for several weeks in the quarter -- and by more than developments warranted, some investors say.
''Bottom line, we feel that there's not going to be a double-dip recession, so this is an overreaction,'' Bob Turner, chief investment officer at Turner Investment Partners, said of the decline, especially in sectors like technology and commodity production that are most sensitive to economic developments.
Mr. Turner recalled that the same thing happened a year ago, when stocks went on a summertime swoon that served as the prelude to a sharp rally.
''I think that's going to happen again this year,'' he predicted, although he foresees something more muted than that 30 percent-plus gain.
MR. TURNER considers the market declines an overreaction, but Simon Hallett, chief investment officer at the Harding, Loevner Funds, is surprised that the reaction wasn't stronger.
''I find it remarkable that the markets have taken so much in their stride,'' said Mr. Hallett, whose firm concentrates its investment abroad. ''Imagine that you had asked me before Christmas to forecast what the market would do,'' knowing that there would be political upheaval in the Middle East, a tsunami in Japan and oil above $100 a barrel. ''I would have got it wrong,'' he said. ''This year has been a lesson in the folly of making forecasts.''
And it remains a futile undertaking, in his view, because of the efforts to support markets, especially in bonds, around the world. Such ventures as quantitative easing and the attempt to rescue Greece obscure the true value of assets, he says.
''We're living in an extraordinary world where prices of so many things are being manipulated by central banks and politicians,'' Mr. Hallett said. ''Bond prices bear no relation to supply and demand.''
Duncan Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, counters that such measures may be necessary, particularly to help Greece stave off default. Those moves in turn help protect European banks and American money market funds that are exposed to European debt instruments.
''It's in no one's interest for it to become a Lehman type of situation,'' he said, referring to the collapse of the Wall Street firm that was a catalyst for the 2008 crisis.
Mr. Richardson would also like to see a spirited effort in Washington to arrange a long-term plan to sort out the deficit. He anticipates a deal calling for cuts in the next few years totaling $2 trillion to $3 trillion and allowing the debt ceiling to be raised before the deadline later this summer.
''There has been some progress on having a conversation about long-term issues,'' he said. ''There is not a whole lot of expectation in the market that there will be a compromise, but I think there will be. That would be good for the dollar and for U.S. assets in general and would make the U.S. attractive relative to markets around the world.''
Mr. Richardson recommended shares of large American multinational companies, especially in sectors like tech and health care. Such companies have financial strength, he said, and their exposure to emerging economies offers growth potential.
MR. CONKEY, at Hancock, expressed similar sentiments, describing American multinational blue chips as ''extraordinarily well positioned, with strong balance sheets.''
With his international focus, Mr. Hallett highlighted the prospects of European companies that do much of their business in the developing world. He also puts an emphasis on quality, encouraging investors to look for companies with strong profit margins, low debt and leadership positions in their industries.
Mr. Turner, who seemed more bullish than his peers, made the case for technology stocks. They offer a means to capture the trend toward cloud computing, he said. Also, he observed, ''everyone wants a device in their hand that acts like a computer.''
Less trendy right now are Treasury bonds and other high-quality debt issues. The stock market's zigzags have been unsettling, but with interest rates low and quantitative easing eased out, advisers find the risk-reward balance more favorable for stocks than bonds.
''It's a tricky time,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''People really need to think about where they have their assets and their risk exposure. The stock market could continue to correct, but I'd rather own large U.S. equities than run for the hills looking for something safer.''

HEADLINE: The Madrid Waterfront: Who Knew?

BYLINE: By ANDREW FERREN

 BODY:
WOULD it be unpatriotic to assert that the Big Dig in Boston was small potatoes compared with Madrid Rio? The pharaonically scaled waterfront revitalization that opened on April 15 is rapidly shifting Madrid's recreational axis from Retiro Park to the once-forgotten western edge.
Who knew Madrid even had a river? Unlike Seville or Bilbao, whose early fortunes were inextricably linked to their waterways, Madrid began as a hilltop fortress that conveniently had a little river, the Manzanares, winding lazily through the plain below (to the west of the Royal Palace, which stands on the site of the fortress). But for decades, not even the royal family could claim a water view, as the river was choked by two ribbons of the M-30 freeway, which rings the city. 
It took just seven years for the Madrid Rio project to go from conception to inauguration. Four miles of the six- to eight-lane M-30 were tunneled underground and the land above was reborn as a picturesque 300-acre riverside park. It cost 400 million euros (about $574 million), required the planting of 33,000 trees and 470,000 shrubs and plants, and took a lot of wrangling with environmental and neighborhood advocacy groups to create a sprawling esplanade that now runs through six municipal districts. Where traffic used to snake and snarl, people now stroll, jog, bike and splash.
The park includes 17 new playgrounds (including fitness areas for grown-ups with what look like stone-age gymnastics equipment made out of logs and ropes) as well as running and bike paths, a skate park and an almost-100-foot-high climbing wall.
What's more, the new park is revitalizing city attractions that have languished off the tourist radar but now suddenly seem at the center of the action. The fledgling multidiscipline arts center known as Matadero Madrid in the old slaughterhouses anchors the park to the south and has been swarming with people since Madrid Rio's opening weekend. Now that the highway and its tangle of access ramps no longer run between them, several once-isolated parks like the Casa de Campo, Campo de Moro and Parque del Oeste now practically meet at the river's edge.
Reuniting the city center with its southwestern neighborhoods (area real estate prices have skyrocketed accordingly), the park's 33 bridges range from Renaissance-era to right now. The time warp is nowhere more visible than at the early-18th-century Puente de Toledo. Its harmonious rhythm of arches and curved bulwarks is echoed just a bit farther downstream in the corkscrew-shaped cylinder of steel designed by Dominique Perrault for the Puente de Arganzuela, the new bridge that is rapidly becoming Madrid Rio's most popular photo backdrop.
Nearby, the new Parque de la Arganzuela is already a neighborhood favorite. It features a quirky playground with giant sliding boards -- some wide enough for parents and kids to slide side-by-side -- and other novel amusements, like a tirolina (similar to a zipline, it transports riders, one at a time, about 100 feet across the park). As the summer starts to heat up, visitors can cool down on the new urban ''beaches,'' large elliptical fountains designed for frolicking in jets of water and clouds of refreshing mist. At night, the Puente de Arganzuela lights up like a piece of an alien rocket fallen to earth.
Taking in the scene, Ana Martinez, a local architect who has worked with both private and municipal clients, said that unlike the new sports arena La Caja Magica and other recent public projects that require admission tickets, ''the river park is something that anyone in the city can enjoy every single day of the year.''
Maps of the new park are available from the city's tourist information kiosks (there is one near the Puente del Rey) and also online at esmadrid.com/madridrio.

HEADLINE: Struggle Over, Independent South Sudan Rejoices

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Josh Kron contributed reporting.

 BODY:
JUBA, South Sudan -- The celebrations erupted at midnight. Thousands of revelers poured into Juba's steamy streets in the predawn hours on Saturday, hoisting enormous flags, singing, dancing and leaping on the back of cars.
''Freedom!'' they screamed.
A new nation was being born in what used to be a forlorn, war-racked patch of Africa, and to many it seemed nothing short of miraculous. After more than five decades of an underdog, guerrilla struggle and two million lives lost, the Republic of South Sudan, Africa's 54th state, was about to declare its independence in front of a who's who of Africa, including the president of the country letting it go: Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan, a war-crimes suspect.
Many of those who turned out to celebrate, overcome with emotion, spoke of their fathers, mothers, sons and daughters killed in the long struggle to break free from the Arab-dominated north.
''My whole body feels happy,'' said George Garang, an English teacher who lost his father, grandfather and 11 brothers in the war. 
By sunrise, the crowds were surging through the streets of Juba, the capital, to the government quarter, where the declaration of independence would be read aloud. Thousands of soldiers lined the freshly painted curbs, tiger patches on their arms, assault rifles in their hands. This new nation is being built on a guerrilla army -- the Sudan People's Liberation Army, whose field commanders are now South Sudan's political leaders -- and the amount of firepower here is unnerving.
By 9 a.m., the sun was dangerous. The faces, necks and arms of the people packed thousands deep around a parade stand built for the occasion were glazed with sweat. A woman abruptly slumped to the dirt and was whisked away.
''She fainted because she's happy,'' said a man in the crowd. ''There will be many others today.''
In a column of black polished steel, one brand-new Mercedes after another, came the African leaders: Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president; Jacob Zuma, South Africa's; Meles Zenawi, prime minister of Ethiopia; Teodoro Obiang, Equatorial Guinea's president and chairman of the African Union; Mwai Kibaki, Kenya's president; and Yoweri Museveni, president of Uganda, among others.
But, almost inexplicably, Mr. Bashir, who for years prosecuted a vicious war to keep the south from splitting off and to prevent this very day from happening, drew the loudest burst of applause when his motorcade rolled in.
''It is not happiness,'' explained Daniel Atem, dressed in a suit and tie for the occasion, a miniflag flying from his lapel. ''If you are talking to your enemy, you cannot say, You are bad.'' But, he added, ''you know what is in your heart.''
From the mid-1950s, even before Sudan shook off its colonial yoke in 1956, the southern Sudanese were chafing for more rights. Sudan had an unusually clear fault line, reinforced by British colonizers, with the southern third mostly animist and Christian and the northern part majority Muslim and long dominated by Arabs.
The southern struggle blew up into a full-fledged rebellion in the 1960s and then again in the 1980s, and the Sudanese government responded brutally, bombing villages and unleashing Arab militias that massacred civilians and enslaved southern Sudanese children. Many of the same scorched-earth tactics associated with the crisis in Darfur, in Sudan's west, in the mid-2000s, were tried and tested long before that here in southern Sudan. (The International Criminal Court has indicted Mr. Bashir on genocide charges for the Darfur massacres.)
The central government also sowed divisions among the southerners, turning ethnic groups against one another. Some of the most unspeakable violence, like the Bor massacre in 1991 when toddlers were impaled on fence posts, was internecine.
Christian groups had been championing the southern Sudanese since the 19th century. And their efforts paid off in 2000 when George W. Bush was elected president of the United States. He elevated Sudan to near the top of his foreign policy agenda, and in 2005, the American government pushed the southern rebels and the central government -- both war weary and locked in a military stalemate -- to sign a comprehensive peace agreement that guaranteed the southerners the right to secede.
On Saturday, one man held up a sign that said ''Thank You George Bush.''
The American-backed treaty set the stage for a referendum this January in which southerners voted by 98.8 percent for independence.
At 1:20 p.m. on Saturday, the southerners officially proclaimed their freedom.
''Recalling the long and heroic struggle of our people,'' began the legislative speaker, James Wani Igga.
A few minutes later, the flag of Sudan was lowered and the new South Sudan flag (actually quite similar, plus a star) was raised. The masses exploded in one loud roar.
''Mabrook Janoob Sudan!'' they yelled. ''Congratulations South Sudan!''
South Sudan's president, Salva Kiir, wearing his signature black cowboy hat given to him by Mr. Bush, signed the interim Constitution. Then the speeches began.
''This is a beautiful day for Africa,'' said Joseph Deiss, president of the United Nations General Assembly. ''This is a remarkable achievement, a longstanding conflict has been stopped.''
Perhaps. But South Sudan -- Texas-size and with about eight million people -- is already plagued by ethnic tensions and rebellions. More than a half-dozen renegade groups are battling the government, some with thousands of fighters. And relations with the north are still dicey. Negotiators have yet to agree on a formula to split the revenue from the south's oilfields, which have kept the economies of both southern and northern Sudan afloat. And Mr. Bashir's army has been pounding southern-allied rebels who have refusing to disarm just north of the border in the Nuba Mountains, which some analysts worry could drag the whole region back into a full-scale war.
This is why Mr. Bashir's presence here was such a curiosity. He did sign the peace agreement in 2005, and many southerners, however mixed their feelings are, are grateful to him for that.
He seemed in a magnanimous mood on Saturday.
''This moment came through peace,'' Mr. Bashir said. ''We must respect it.''
He even thanked the United Nations for its hard work and said he wanted to bring peace to Darfur, though he did slip in, ''Sudan's unity would have been better,'' but ''I convinced myself that unity shouldn't be through war.''
Mr. Kiir then shared a few words.
''We have waited for more than 56 years for this,'' he said. ''It is a dream that has come true.''
''This land has seen untold suffering and death,'' he added, somberly. ''We have been bombed enslaved and treated worse than a refugee in our own country. We have to forgive, though we will not forget.''
The independence ceremony then wrapped up much in the way the struggle began: with a barrage of very loud cannon shots. The crowd pumped their fists in the air and hollered, ''South Sudan, oh yay!''

HEADLINE: Gen. Tso's Default Chicken

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER. 
Chief Washington correspondent of The New York Times.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
FINALLY President Obama and Congressional leaders began engaging in serious discussions last week over the trillions in cuts it would take for a deal to raise the debt ceiling before the default deadline of Aug. 2.
But the most important meetings on the subject may be sessions President Obama is not holding -- at least not yet -- with America's lenders, starting with residents of Zhongnanhai, the tranquil-looking leadership compound next door to the Forbidden City in Beijing. It would not be politically wise for either Democrats or Republicans to suggest that the Chinese have any voice in how deeply Medicaid or Social Security is cut, or whether taxes should be raised on wealthier Americans.
But one senior American Treasury official noted the other evening, as his colleagues engaged in their giant game of default chicken, that sooner or later whatever agreement goes through the House and the Senate will have to pass muster, at least informally, in the Great Hall of the People. ''You know how the generals always say that when it comes to our strategy in Afghanistan, the enemy has a vote?'' he asked. ''Well, when it comes to borrowing a few trillion dollars, the Chinese have a vote, too.'' 
The nature of that Chinese vote is frequently mischaracterized. It's not as if the Chinese are about to sell the several trillion dollars in United States Treasury bills they already hold; the last thing they want to do is devalue one of their own biggest assets. But in ways that were inconceivable just a few years ago, the Chinese have used both formal and informal meetings with their American counterparts to explore whether America's plan for reducing its debt is credible -- and to remind American officials that they have options to gradually shift their money, say, to oil wells in Africa or real estate in the Middle East.
Two years ago, at the first big annual ''strategic and economic review'' between the Obama team and Chinese officials, the Chinese asked Peter Orszag, then the head of the Office of Management and Budget, to explain in agonizing detail how the administration planned to pay for its health-care overhaul. The Chinese were not particularly interested in whether Americans used a single-payer option or insured children around the land; they wanted to know how it would affect the deficit.
Subsequent sessions have not been as specific. But the Chinese have hinted that if Americans think they can borrow forever without paying higher interest rates, they should think again.
Much of this is chest-pounding, of course. The Chinese see a moment of strategic advantage as America devolves into a hard-to-comprehend debate about whether its Congress will authorize paying back money it has already borrowed and spent. Most countries, one senior Chinese financial official noted with a touch of sarcasm, think about how much they want to pay back before they borrow, not after. (Perhaps that explains why the concept of a ''debt limit'' is a purely American invention.)
Robert D. Hormats, a former top executive at Goldman Sachs, and now under secretary of state for economic affairs, notes a deeper paradox: America's message to the Chinese, and other Asian partners, may cut down on how much America can borrow. Its message to surplus countries like China is, ''You should consume more and save less,'' he said. If they listen, ''there will be fewer funds available to buy bonds and other assets here.''
In fact, the Chinese are coming to that conclusion all by themselves. Though the country is experiencing a construction boom at home, many of their cities and towns are deeply in debt, and may need bailouts. Same for the banks in an overheated Chinese property market.
All this is making the Chinese a bit more cautious. Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said, ''The Chinese are understandably anxious about having so many eggs in one currency basket'' -- meaning dollar-denominated assets. ''They don't need all those dollars to control their exchange rates,'' he said (but they need some to manipulate rates enough to keep their exports cheap).
The good news is that even for the Chinese, the United States is a more attractive place to park surpluses than Greece-obsessed Europe or a tsunami-racked, politically paralyzed Japan.
But as the United States heads into one of its periodic flirtations with isolationism -- to bring home the troops and batten down the hatches -- it is worth remembering that whatever spending-and-revenue plan emerges must pass an unspoken credibility test abroad.
No lender, not even the mandarins of Zhongnanhai, can dictate how much America spends. But they can influence how much America will have to pay to borrow the cash -- and that is the giant, unpredictable variable in whether Americans can bring a record debt load under control.

Mr. Geithner will also talk about the debt on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS, with Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama.
8 P.M. (CBS) BIG BROTHER The show picks up from its 13th-season opener Thursday night, when the eight people moving into the reality TV domicile met some returning inhabitants for the first time. Tonight, the lease might be up for those who are nominated for eviction.
8 P.M. (VH1) MOB WIVES We aren't saying the women of this show are married to, or are the daughters of, men who are involved in mob-related activities, but we are saying it is fortunate that this network picked the show up for a second season. In tonight's reunion special, the producers wrap up some unfinished business and dole out never-before-broadcast scenes from the recently completed first season. At 9, the reality TV star Jessica Kiper checks in to the Pasadena Recovery Center, where Bai Ling was last seen teetering on its roof and Sean Young leaves a bundle of embarrassment on Dr. Drew Pinsky's doorstep, to treat her addictions to alcohol and marijuana on ''Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew.''

10 P.M. (USA) IN PLAIN SIGHT Mary Shannon (Mary McCormack), a United States marshal working in a branch of the witness protection program that helps relocate federal witnesses, keeps at her job while pregnant. Though her commitment is admirable, it does put her unborn child at risk as she deals with a set of twins, one good and one bad, who not only are fighting their enemies, but also each other.
10 P.M. (NBC) THE MARRIAGE REF The comedians Kathy Griffin and Brian Regan join the actress Ellen Pompeo to take a turn on this panel show that uses humor to help settle disputes between real-life married couples. The audience votes to decide where one man will keep his scrap metal, how much a woman will spend on a dollhouse and whether a husband will continue to talk to strangers. CHRIS HARCUM

HEADLINE: Shocker! Tabs Won't Change!

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS. 
A media reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
AS anyone in Congress or corporate America can attest, nothing spurs reform like a good old-fashioned crisis. But will the upheaval in Britain over illegal hacking of voice mail by The News of the World lead to any buttoning up in the Dumpster-diving, cash-for-trash world of tabloid media?
Don't bet on it. 
Not just the stuff of supermarket tabloids and blogs, celebrity gossip gathering supports a vast economy in which everyone -- from major media executives to nightclub doormen -- has a stake.
For proof of how much it has bled into major media, look no further than TMZ, the Web site that draws some 20 million visitors a month for news of celebrity divorces and D.U.I.'s. Its owner? Time Warner, the media conglomerate that owns Warner Brothers, whose movie stars are often featured in various states of inebriation and undress on TMZ. Time Warner also owns Time Inc., the country's largest publisher of magazines.
And what is Time Inc.'s most profitable magazine? Not Time, the reason the company exists at all. It's not even Sports Illustrated, with its circulation of three million. The top earner by far, accounting for about half of Time Inc.'s $515 million operating profit last year was People magazine.
''This is mainstream media economics here,'' said Tom Wolzien, a former NBC News executive and Wall Street analyst who now advises media companies.
The News Corporation's decision to shut down The News of the World was surprising partly because of the money the paper brings in -- about a billion dollars a year in revenue. With a circulation of 2.7 million, it is the best-selling Sunday newspaper in Britain. And so even as competitors might be worried about being implicated next in the hacking investigation -- the police searched The Daily Star on Friday -- they are also probably looking at ways to grab market share.
''There's probably less soul-searching and more jubilation that one outlet is out of the competition,'' said Michael Lewittes, who made a living as a gossip columnist for The New York Post, a producer for ''Access Hollywood'' and the news director for US Weekly.
As if to illustrate the gossip economy's depth, Mr. Lewittes has found a new prospect: there's business in making the gossip business look bad. He left it to start Gossip Cop, a Web site that polices the veracity of stories in the tabloids and reports its own celebrity news.
It takes a lot for the public to sour on tabloid shenanigans, suggesting little financial incentive for gossip news gatherers to rein in their tactics. The British public has known about the hacking since 2006, when the breaches were thought to have affected only celebrities and members of the royal family. But last week, it was revealed that The News of the World had accessed voice mails of a murdered girl and family members of dead soldiers.
''It ceases to be a game when it impacts on people who have no power and no money and have suffered enormous misfortune,'' said Emily Bell, a professor at Columbia University's journalism school and a former top editor at Guardian News and Media, the British newspaper company.
No one has suggested that tabloids in the United States have done anything as egregious as hacking into private voice mails. American gossip reporters seem content with methods that are tame by comparison, like hiring private investigators, sending photographers with zoom lenses onto private property or paying associates of celebrities for tips and private information.
But there have been some notable breaches of the law in recent years. The National Enquirer found itself under scrutiny after it published details on Farrah Fawcett's cancer that seemed to come straight from her medical records. A hospital worker later pleaded guilty to a felony for accessing her file. It is common practice at The Enquirer to pay sources thousands of dollars, and sometimes tens of thousands of dollars, for such information.
United States law also affords publications far more protection than British law when it comes to specious stories, which could mean that reporters for American publications have less need to get information they can prove is true.
''The tabloid writers have become very skilled over the years at conveying the impression that something happened while at the same time protecting the outlet they work for,'' said Mr. Lewittes of Gossip Cop, pointing to headlines like ''Drug Shocker'' that tease and imply rather than state something as fact.
''They'll use phrases like 'heart-attack drama,' which leaves the impression that the celebrity had a heart attack,'' said Mr. Lewittes. The National Enquirer did that with Oprah Winfrey last week, he said, noting that her heart appeared to be working perfectly fine.
Not everyone is convinced there won't be some chilling effect from the News of the World fracas. Steve Coz, the former editorial director at American Media, which owns Star and The National Enquirer, said that lawyers for tabloids would wise up.
''The U.S. tabloids -- print, online and broadcast -- all cross over into a gray area of newsgathering at times as they compete for ever more exclusive information,'' Mr. Coz said. ''Now that the Murdoch hacking scandal has erupted, there will be instant review of these gray areas by the tabloids' lawyers.''
But how long does he expect that caution to last? ''A month or two.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: Many of us wouldn't be caught dead reading The News of the World, the racy British tabloid being shuttered by the Murdoch media conglomerate today, amid a phone-hacking and police-payoff scandal involving its journalists. Good thing we're alive, though. On a visit to its Web site last week, it was sorely tempting to click on these headlines, recent and past (SR4)

HEADLINE: Candidates Warn About Debt-Deal Compromise

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and CARL HULSE

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- The decision by House Speaker John A. Boehner to scale back budget talks with President Obama unfolded as Republican presidential candidates were campaigning against any outcome that smacks of compromise, underscoring divisions in the party over whether to raise the federal debt limit.
The action by Mr. Boehner, which was announced Saturday night, illustrated just how difficult negotiations had become in this political climate to reach agreement on a sweeping plan to lower the deficit without an infusion of new tax revenues. 
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota seized on the issue and used the first television commercial of her campaign to highlight her opposition to raising the debt ceiling. She drew enthusiastic applause on Saturday as she amplified her position.
''It's time for tough love,'' Mrs. Bachmann told supporters at a rally. ''Don't let them scare you by telling you that the country's going to fall apart.''
Tim Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor, who was critical of the deal brokered this year between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner that averted a government shutdown, said he was not convinced of the dire consequences predicted by Democrats if no deal was reached and the government lost its authority to borrow on Aug. 2.
''I hope and pray and believe they should not raise the debt ceiling,'' Mr. Pawlenty told voters here last week. ''These historic, dramatic moments where you can draw a line in the sand and force politicians to actually do something bold and courageous are important moments.''
The sharp stances, which have been building for days, complicated efforts to reach an agreement by Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican; Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader; and Mr. Obama, who were scheduled to resume deliberations at the White House on Sunday evening. The Republican leaders faced the prospect that their party's presidential candidates were criticizing their efforts, which could complicate the leaders' efforts to find the votes they would need.
With their own campaigns only a year away, many Republicans in Congress are turning to the party's presidential candidates for an early sign of how the budget issue is playing in the minds of voters. The grass-roots conservative opposition to a deal that includes any kind of tax increase or fails to cut government spending substantially has been frequently aired at town-hall-style meetings with the candidates and in calls to talk radio programs, and it has overshadowed discussions of the potential economic fallout should the government actually default.
Fellow Republicans say Mrs. Bachmann's position would influence House colleagues who see her as a reliable measure of the Tea Party zeitgeist.
''Michele is a good barometer,'' said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia. ''The Tea Party really likes her.''
Despite the effort that Mr. Boehner had been putting into structuring a deal that Republicans could support without breaking any no-tax-increase promises, his announcement Saturday evening underscored the political reality that many Republicans in both houses were opposed to increasing the debt ceiling no matter what concessions they might win.
On the presidential campaign trail, Representative Ron Paul of Texas said Republicans should not accept any deal that includes a tax increase, calling it a ''ploy.'' While Mrs. Bachmann has suggested that virtually no bipartisan deal would be acceptable, Mr. Pawlenty told voters last week that ''if it comes to a point where they feel that they must,'' he said a balanced-budget amendment was an essential trade-off.
Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, has said he would agree to increasing the debt limit only if a deal was ''accompanied by a major effort to restructure and reduce the size of government.'' Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah, has said spending cuts must be equal or greater than the value of any debt ceiling increase but told reporters Saturday in Florida: ''I have every confidence that cooler heads are going to prevail.''
Nearly three dozen House Republicans and another dozen in the Senate have joined most of the Republican presidential candidates in signing a pledge that they will not vote to support the debt limit increase unless Congress approves a balanced budget-amendment to the Constitution, which is unlikely. (Mrs. Bachmann declined to sign the pledge, because she wanted to include a repeal of the Obama health care plan.)
Much of the freshman class that provided the party with its majority in the House has been skeptical of warnings about economic upheaval that would follow a government default, as well as of the Treasury Department's insistence that there will be nothing more it can do to keep the government solvent after Aug. 2.
Republicans could face harsh consequences if they oppose a debt ceiling increase, the government defaults on some of its obligations and there are calamitous financial repercussions.
But many Republicans see supporting any agreement as carrying more political risk. Put into power in part by the Tea Party movement, Republicans who vote to raise the debt limit could suddenly find themselves looking at challenges from within.
The relative newcomers to Congress say they are weighing the issue extremely carefully and are awaiting the specifics of any deal. They know the hazards and are comparing it to the vote in 2008 to approve the bank bailout, a vote that has come to haunt some Republicans.
''This, I think, will be one of the toughest votes that any member of Congress is going to have to take,'' Representative Aaron Schock, Republican of Illinois, said in a recent speech.
The situation in the Senate is markedly different from the House. Senate Republicans are in the minority, which is something of a luxury because Democrats will be called upon to produce most support for a debt deal.
Seeing themselves within reach of winning the Senate majority in 2012, Republicans are eager to watch threatened Democratic incumbents forced to vote for a package that could represent a politically unappetizing trifecta: a debt ceiling increase, reductions in popular social programs like Medicare and possible tax increases.
The importance and the intensity of the budget debate was clear in interviews with Republican voters last week who came to see some of the presidential contenders speak in Iowa. Whenever a candidate spoke about the debt limit, crowds expressed dismay at the idea of raising it.
At a rally on Saturday afternoon, the crowd cheered when Mrs. Bachmann declared her intention to vote against any compromise. She referred to Congress as ''a dysfunctional family.''
''We need a new day in Washington,'' she said. ''We need a new sheriff.''

HEADLINE: Sheila Bair's Bank Shot

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
'They should have let Bear Stearns fail,'' Sheila Bair said.
It was midmorning on a crisp June day, and Bair, the 57-year-old outgoing chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- the federal agency that insures bank deposits and winds down failing banks -- was sitting on a couch, sipping a Starbucks latte. We were in the first hour of several lengthy on-the-record interviews. She seemed ever-so-slightly nervous. 
Long viewed as a bureaucratic backwater, the F.D.I.C. has had a tumultuous five years while being transformed under Bair's stewardship. Not long after she took charge in June 2006, Bair began sounding the alarm about the dangers posed by the explosive growth of subprime mortgages, which she feared would not only ravage neighborhoods when homeowners began to default -- as they inevitably did -- but also wreak havoc on the banking system. The F.D.I.C. was the only bank regulator in Washington to do so. During the financial crisis of 2008, Bair insisted that she and her agency have a seat at the table, where she worked -- and fought -- with Henry Paulson, then the treasury secretary, and Timothy Geithner, the president of the New York Federal Reserve, as they tried to cobble together solutions that would keep the financial system from going over a cliff. She and the F.D.I.C. managed a number of huge failing institutions during the crisis, including IndyMac, Wachovia and Washington Mutual. She was a key player in shaping the Dodd-Frank reform law, especially the part that seeks to forestall future bailouts. Since the law passed, she has made an immense effort to convince Wall Street and the country that the nation's giant banks -- the same ones that required bailouts in 2008 and became known as ''too big to fail'' institutions -- will never again be bailed out, thanks in part to new powers at the F.D.I.C. Just a few months ago, she went so far as to send a letter to Standard & Poor's, the credit-ratings agency, suggesting that its ratings of the big banks were too high because they reflected an expectation of government support. If a too-big-to-fail bank got into trouble, she wrote, the F.D.I.C. would wind it down, not bail it out.
As an observer of the financial crisis and its aftermath, I have frankly admired most of what she tried to do. She was tough-minded and straightforward. On financial matters, she seemed to have better political instincts than Obama's Treasury Department, which of course is now headed by Geithner. She favored ''market discipline'' -- meaning shareholders and debt holders would take losses ahead of depositors and taxpayers -- over bailouts, which she abhorred. She didn't spend a lot of time fretting over bank profitability; if banks had to become less profitable, postcrisis, in order to reduce the threat they posed to the system, so be it. (''Our job is to protect bank customers, not banks,'' she told me.) And she was a fierce, and often lonely, proponent of widespread mortgage modification, for reasons both compassionate (to help struggling homeowners stay in their homes) and economic (fewer foreclosures would help the troubled housing market recover more quickly).
I thought something else as well: with her five-year term as F.D.I.C. chairwoman drawing to a close -- her last day was July 8 -- she never really got her due. The rap on her was always that she was ''difficult'' and ''not a team player.'' There were times, in Congressional testimony, when she disagreed with her fellow regulators even though they were sitting right next to her. Her policy disputes with other regulators were legion; in leaked accounts, Bair was invariably portrayed as the problem. In ''Too Big to Fail,'' for instance, the behind-the-scenes account of the financial crisis by the New York Times business columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin, Bair is described as one of Geithner's ''least favorite people in government.'' As Paulson, Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, raced to bail out banks and companies like A.I.G., Bair resisted, fearing that they were being overly generous by putting the interests of bondholders over those of taxpayers. I couldn't help recalling that the last female financial regulator to be labeled difficult was Brooksley Born, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the mid-1990s. Fearful that derivatives were becoming a threat to the financial system, Born wanted to regulate them but was stiff-armed by Alan Greenspan and Robert Rubin.
It wasn't just that the men controlled the narrative; it was also that Bair was a classic Washington policy wonk, far more comfortable discussing the fine points of regulation than backroom politics. Interviewing her could be an exercise in frustration. She was only too happy to talk about capital requirements, say, but even off the record she wouldn't tread where most journalists, myself included, wanted her to go -- into the boardrooms at Treasury and the Fed where decisions were hashed out. In 2009, The New Yorker published a short profile of her in which she refused to be drawn out about one of the many bureaucratic fights over too-big-to-fail. Her response was classic Bair: ''It's a very difficult task to try to balance all the different perspectives and come up with a package,'' she said diplomatically, ''and every compromise is going to have people who are unhappy about various parts of it.'' You can almost hear the author sighing.
Not long ago, I approached her with the idea of doing an extended exit interview. I thought it was important to get her perspective on the last five years. I also thought, to be honest, that her impending retirement might loosen her tongue a little. After thinking it over, she agreed to talk to me, with the stipulation that nothing be published until she left office.
And so there we were, talking about Bear Stearns, the investment bank whose near failure marked the beginning of the crisis. Even knowing that her views of the financial crisis were at odds with many of the others who were involved, I was taken aback: I had never heard anyone involved in the crisis criticize the government's decision to help Bear Stearns avoid certain bankruptcy.
For a moment, Bair seemed a little surprised, too, by the words that had tumbled out. She took a sip of her latte and looked straight ahead, deep in thought.
''Do you really think they should have let Bear fail?'' I asked.
When she put her drink down, her hesitation was gone. ''Let's face it,'' she said. ''Bear Stearns was a second-tier investment bank, with -- what? -- around $400 billion in assets? I'm a traditionalist. Banks and bank-holding companies are in the safety net. That's why they have deposit insurance. Investment banks take higher risks, and they are supposed to be outside the safety net. If they make enough mistakes, they are supposed to fail. So, yes, I was amazed when they saved it. I couldn't believe it. When they told me about it, I said: 'Guess what: Investment banks fail.' ''
I first met Sheila Bair in November 2005, during one of her rare breaks from government service. A longtime aide to Bob Dole, the Republican senator from Kansas -- Bair grew up in the small town of Independence, Kan., and attended the University of Kansas -- she had also been a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and an assistant secretary in George W. Bush's Treasury Department. In 2002, she left Treasury to join the faculty of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where she taught regulatory policy at the business school. Three years later, she invited Senator Paul Sarbanes, the former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to speak to her class. His visit to Amherst happened to coincide with a column I was writing about him. I sat in on the class.
At the time, all I really knew about Bair's background was that she was a Republican. Which kind quickly became clear. She and Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland, obviously shared a great deal of mutual respect and affection, despite spending their lives on different sides of the aisle; she turned out to be a member of that dying breed, the Republican moderate. In our recent talks, she described herself as someone who believes in ''regulations that reinforce economic incentives.'' That came through, too; she praised Sarbanes's signature law, Sarbanes-Oxley, which established new accounting rules to combat corporate fraud -- and which most Republicans still denounce nearly a decade after its passage.
Because I was living nearby at the time, I would bump into her occasionally. Sometime late in the spring of 2006, she and her husband invited me to dinner; toward the end of the evening, she pulled me aside and told me that she was about to be nominated to be the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C. The offer came out the blue, she said, and though she was reluctant to move her family back to Washington, she didn't feel she could say no. The Bush administration had planned to nominate Diana Taylor, the former New York State superintendent of banks -- and also Mayor Michael Bloomberg's girlfriend -- but then decided not to. The administration needed a Republican who could gain a quick confirmation. Bair fit the bill.
Arriving at the F.D.I.C. that summer, Bair found an agency that was floundering. ''There hadn't been any bank failures in a long time,'' she said. ''We were in this so-called golden age of banking, regulation had fallen out of favor and the F.D.I.C., which had a reputation as a tough regulator, had fallen on hard times.'' Its budget had been slashed, employees had been let go and morale was terrible. Except for a 10-second handshake, she never even spoke to Henry Paulson her first year or so in office.
Alone among the regulators, though, the F.D.I.C. began to home in on subprime lending. By 2006, the subprime industry was running amok, making loans -- many of them fraudulent, with hidden fees and abusive terms -- to just about anyone with a pulse. Most subprime loans had adjustable interest rates, which started low but then jumped significantly after a few years, making the monthly payments unaffordable for many homeowners. The lenders didn't care because they sold the loans to Wall Street, which bundled them into mortgage-backed bonds and resold them to investors.
Curbing subprime-lending abuses should have been the job of the Federal Reserve, which has a consumer division. But the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, with his profound distaste for regulation, could not have been less interested. The other bank regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees national banks, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates the savings-and-loan industry, should have cared, too. But their responses to the growing problem were at best tepid and at worst hostile. (The O.C.C. actually used its federal powers to block efforts by states to curb subprime abuses.) By the time Bair got to Washington, the O.C.C. had spent a year devising ''voluntary subprime guidance'' for the banks it regulated, but it had not yet gotten around to issuing that guidance.
The F.D.I.C. jumped into the breach. Bair knew the issue well, because during her time at Treasury, when the industry was much smaller, she tried, unsuccessfully, to get the subprime lenders to agree to halt their worst practices. Now she was hearing that things had become much worse. Bair instructed the F.D.I.C. to buy an expensive database that listed all the subprime loans in the mortgage-backed bonds that Wall Street was selling to investors. She was shocked by what she saw. ''All the practices that we looked at back in 2001 and 2002, which we thought were predatory -- things like steep payment resets and abusive prepayment penalties -- had gone mainstream,'' she said.
By the spring of 2007, she was holding meetings with industry executives, pushing them to raise their lending standards and to restructure -- that is, modify -- abusive mortgages so homeowners wouldn't lose their homes when the housing bubble burst and large numbers of loans were bound to default. ''There is nothing unusual about this,'' she told me. ''Restructuring is one of the tools the banking industry has at its disposal.''
One thing she learned from those meetings was that the mortgage servicers, generally divisions of the big banks, had the legal right in most cases to modify mortgages they managed for the investors who owned mortgage bonds. They just didn't have the will. After doing some arm-twisting, Bair felt she had extracted a commitment that the mortgage servicers would do so.
She also pushed the O.C.C. to issue its voluntary guidance, even though it would help only marginally. The vast majority of subprime loans were issued by institutions outside the regulated banking system, out of the reach of the O.C.C. or the F.D.I.C. But those nonbanks depended on the regulated banks for their own financing. As a way to get at the unregulated lenders, Bair came up with the idea of applying the government's subprime guidance to any company that was financed by a regulated bank. The banks, she says, ''fought us tooth and nail.'' She lost.
At the same time, she was fighting a rear-guard battle on another critical banking issue -- so-called capital requirements, the amount of capital banks must hold as a cushion against losses. Banks always want their capital requirements to be as low as possible, so they can take more risks, which can enable them to make more money -- and reap bigger bonuses for executives. In 2004, an international group called the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed rules that would allow banks to hold capital on a ''risk-weighted'' basis, meaning that assets with lower risk would require less capital. (As it turned out, triple-A-rated mortgage bonds stuffed with bad subprime mortgages were considered very low risk under the Basel proposal. That is why so many banks loaded up on them in the years leading up to the crisis.) To make matters worse, the Basel II accords, as they were called, permitted banks to evaluate their assets with their own internal risk models.
Most European countries quickly adopted Basel II. In the United States, the Federal Reserve was strongly in favor of doing so, too, as was the O.C.C. But the F.D.I.C., fearing that lower capital requirements and the self-selection of risk models would increase the risk of bank failures, opposed Basel II. This meshed perfectly with Bair's own instincts, and once she arrived at the F.D.I.C., she became the standard-bearer in opposing the new rules. The Fed, in particular, pushed her to sign on; it didn't need the F.D.I.C.'s approval, but it is politically important for all the regulators to be aligned when instituting such an important change. Instead, Bair conceded, ''we dragged it out and dragged it out.'' She dragged it out so long, in fact, that the financial crisis arrived before Basel II was ever implemented in the United States.
Foot-dragging is not the sort of bureaucratic tactic that draws praise or even much notice. But I've long believed that her opposition to Basel II has been a hugely underappreciated factor in helping to save the financial system when the crisis came. The European banks, lacking adequate capital, were crushed by the financial crisis. Big banks in places like Ireland and Iceland collapsed. Germany doled out hundreds of billions of dollars to shore up its banks. Even today, banks in Europe are in far worse shape than they are in the U.S. American banks didn't have enough capital, either, but they had a lot more than their European counterparts, and for all their ongoing problems, they are much healthier institutions today.
By the summer of 2007, the subprime bubble had burst. Just as Bair expected, the default rate on subprime mortgages was rising quickly. Looking ahead, it wasn't hard to see that all those adjustable-rate mortgages written in 2006 and early 2007 were going to reset in a year or two. During the bubble, when housing prices were rising, homeowners avoided the higher rates by refinancing. Now that was no longer possible. Disaster loomed, as millions of Americans would no longer be able to make their mortgage payments. Yet only the F.D.I.C. seemed to take this possibility seriously -- and to fear the consequences. Paulson and Bernanke, for their parts, maintained that the damage from the bursting of the subprime bubble would be ''contained,'' as they liked to put it.
That fall, Mark Zandi of economy.com published a survey of mortgage servicers. ''It showed that like 1 percent of those reset mortgages were being restructured,'' Bair said. ''They would just push people into foreclosure.'' Bair was furious and felt that she had been lied to. All those promises made in the spring turned out to be nothing more than ''happy talk,'' in her words.
So she turned her attention to the Treasury Department, hoping to persuade Paulson and others to put the weight of Treasury -- an agency with far more clout than the F.D.I.C. -- behind her push for mortgage modification. Although there were sporadic efforts at Treasury to do something for homeowners, they never seemed to gain any traction.
There are certainly arguments against modifying mortgages. One is that doing so creates moral hazard -- if some people struggling to stay in their homes get lower monthly payments, then everybody will want a similar deal, and they'll stop making their mortgage payments even when they can afford them. Another is that many people in default will end up redefaulting on a modified mortgage. A third rationale is that the foreclosure process itself is necessary for any eventual recovery of the housing market. Lastly, designing a mortgage-modification plan that works for a large number of people is excruciatingly difficult, maybe even impossible. I have heard all these arguments from Treasury officials over the years.
In the cool light of day, however -- with two million Americans having already lost their homes and another two million in serious default, and with one out of every five homes worth less than the homeowner's mortgage -- this thinking has been shown to be horribly shortsighted. Had the federal government emphasized mortgage modification early on, it could have prevented a lot of pain and might have helped stabilize the economy a lot sooner.
Bair, however, has always thought there were other reasons behind the general resistance to modifying mortgages. The government, she said, ''thought maybe I was overstating the problem and that it wasn't going to be that big a deal.'' As for those in the industry, she added: ''I think some of it was that they didn't think borrowers were worth helping. There was some disdain for borrowers.''
In October 2007, she made a calculated decision to go public. In an op-ed article in The New York Times, she called on mortgage servicers to reset adjustable-rate mortgages en masse. ''These borrowers would still be required to make their monthly payments,'' she wrote, in an implicit response to the moral-hazard argument. She concluded: ''Avoiding foreclosure would protect neighboring properties and hasten the recovery.''
Although she made no mention of the Treasury Department, everyone in the bureaucracy knew that it was her real target. It was now official: Sheila Bair was difficult.
That reputation was only made worse by the financial crisis.
The essential brief against her was that she refused to adopt the all-hands-on-deck mind-set required to deal with the unfolding emergency. At every step along the way, whenever she was asked to participate in one rescue program or another, she balked. As Sorkin put it in ''Too Big to Fail,'' the other regulators viewed her as parochial and small-minded and thought her ''only concern was to protect the F.D.I.C., not the entire system.''
When I asked Bair about the charge that she cared only about the interests of her agency, she scoffed. ''First of all,'' she said, ''protecting bank depositors is important. So is protecting the taxpayer.'' As she saw it, there were too many times when she was the only one trying to do both. (When I spoke to Paulson, he defended Bair's work during the crisis: ''Sheila came to play every day,'' he said. As for the criticism that she cared only about bank depositors, he added, ''That was her job.'')
''They always had the view that the F.D.I.C. was not in the same league as Treasury and the Fed,'' she told me. ''As a result, we were rarely consulted. They would bring me in after they'd made their decision on what needed to be done, and without giving me any information they would say, 'You have to do this or the system will go down.' If I heard that once, I heard it a thousand times. 'Citi is systemic, you have to do this.' No analysis, no meaningful discussion. It was very frustrating.''
Too often, she felt, their requests were excessive, putting taxpayers at risk while bailing out undeserving debt holders. For instance, during the peak of the crisis, with credit markets largely frozen, banks found themselves unable to roll over their short-term debt. This made it virtually impossible for them to function. Geithner wanted the F.D.I.C. to guarantee literally all debt issued by the big bank-holding companies -- an eye-popping request.
Bair said no. Besides the risk it would have entailed, it would have also meant a windfall for bondholders, because much of the existing debt was trading at a steep discount. ''It was unnecessary,'' she said. Instead, Bair and Paulson worked out a deal in which the F.D.I.C. guaranteed only new debt issued by the bank-holding companies. It was still a huge risk for the F.D.I.C. to take; Paulson says today that it was one of the most important, if underrated, actions taken by the federal government during the crisis. ''It was an extraordinary thing for us to do,'' Bair acknowledged.
Citigroup was another example. No bank needed more federal assistance than Citi -- it required three separate bailouts. And yet, in Bair's view, no bank was treated as solicitously, especially by the New York Fed. She felt pressured by the Fed to allow Citi to buy a failing Wachovia -- which she suspected was a kind of backdoor way to strengthen Citi by giving it access to Wachovia's stable deposit base. To make the deal work, the F.D.I.C. agreed to absorb some of Wachovia's losses. When the F.D.I.C. accepted the Citi offer, Geithner felt that a deal had been made. But before Citi could close the deal, Wells Fargo, a much stronger bank, made a better offer -- one that didn't require government assistance. Bair leapt at it. Geithner was furious, complaining that Bair's action was sending the wrong signal at the wrong time: that the federal government couldn't be trusted to stick to its word. Bair didn't care; she clearly got the right outcome for taxpayers and bank depositors, even if it didn't help Citigroup.
As she thinks back on it, Bair views her disagreements with her fellow regulators as a kind of high-stakes philosophical debate about the role of bondholders. Her perspective is that bondholders should take losses when an institution fails. When the F.D.I.C. shuts down a failing bank, the unsecured bondholders always absorb some of the losses. That is the essence of market discipline: if shareholders and bondholders know they are on the hook, they are far more likely to keep a close watch on management's risk-taking.
During the crisis, however, Treasury and the Fed were adamant about protecting debt holders, fearing that if they had to absorb losses, the markets would be destabilized and a bad situation would get even worse. ''What was it James Carville used to say?'' Bair said. '' 'When I die I want to come back as the bond market.' ''
''Why did we do the bailouts?'' she went on. ''It was all about the bondholders,'' she said. ''They did not want to impose losses on bondholders, and we did. We kept saying: 'There is no insurance premium on bondholders,' you know? For the little guy on Main Street who has bank deposits, we charge the banks a premium for that, and it gets passed on to the customer. We don't have the same thing for bondholders. They're supposed to take losses.'' (Treasury's response is that spooking the bond markets would have made the crisis much worse and that ultimately taxpayers have made out extremely well as a consequence of the government's actions during the crisis.)
She had a second problem with the way the government went about saving the system. It acted as if no one were at fault -- that it was all just an unfortunate matter of ''a system come undone,'' as she put it.
''I hate that,'' she said. ''Because it doesn't impose accountability where it should be. A.I.G. was badly managed. Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns were badly managed. And not everyone was as badly managed as they were.''
Grudgingly, Bair acknowledged that some of the bailouts were necessary. There was no way, under prevailing law, to wind down the systemically important bank-holding companies that were at risk of failing. The same was true of a nonbank like A.I.G., which the government wound up bailing out just two days after allowing Lehman Brothers to fail. An A.I.G. bankruptcy would have been disastrous, damaging money-market funds, rendering giant banks insolvent and wreaking panic and chaos. Its credit-default swaps could have brought down much of the Western banking system.
''Yes, that was necessary,'' Bair said. ''But they certainly could have been less generous. I've always wondered why none of A.I.G.'s counterparties didn't have to take any haircuts. There's no reason in the world why those swap counterparties couldn't have taken a 10 percent haircut. There could have at least been a little pain for them.'' (All of A.I.G.'s counterparties received 100 cents on the dollar after the government pumped billions into A.I.G. There was a huge outcry when it was revealed that Goldman Sachs received more than $12 billion as a counterparty to A.I.G. swaps.)
Bair continued: ''They didn't even engage in conversation about that. You know, Wall Street barely missed a beat with their bonuses.''
''Isn't that ridiculous?'' she said.
John Podesta, who headed the Obama transition team, was another Democrat that Bair had known forever. In one of her early conversations with him, she volunteered the name of Paul Volcker as a possible Treasury secretary. Volcker was most famous for taming inflation as Federal Reserve chairman in the 1980s, but he was also someone who didn't think like a big banker. On the contrary, he was highly critical of the banks. ''I just thought there had been too many people who had been too close to the financial situation for too long,'' Bair told me. ''I thought we needed a fresh perspective.''
Instead, Obama turned to Geithner. It was no secret by then that Bair and Geithner had a frosty relationship; inevitably stories leaked out that Geithner was trying to push her out. But the stories were wrong: Bair's support for mortgage modifications made her enormously popular with Democrats; when she told Podesta that she would step down early if that's what the president wanted, he said no: Obama wanted her to stay. (For his part, Geithner told me: ''Even though we didn't always agree, I greatly admire Sheila for her early recognition of the severity of the crisis and for her creative use of the F.D.I.C. to stem the panic.'')
What has been discouraging is that the Obama administration hasn't done much better on the loan-modification front than the Bush administration did. Early on, the president told his staff to talk to the F.D.I.C. about how to set up a loan-modification plan. The F.D.I.C. had a wealth of experience, in part because it operated IndyMac for nine months until a buyer was found. It used that time to work on mortgage modifications with IndyMac borrowers and came up with a template for a program it felt could work nationwide. ''They did talk to us,'' Bair said of Obama's staff, ''but I always had the sense they were talking to us because the president wanted them to.''
Getting the banks to make large-scale mortgage modifications is no different today than it was in 2007 -- next to impossible. The servicers still lack the economic incentives to modify mortgages; it's easier in most cases for them to foreclose, which also generates fees, while modifications don't. As Bair herself discovered during the IndyMac experience, changing that attitude requires dogged effort. ''I ended up having calls with our servicers every Friday, to get a status report on what they'd done that week on loan modifications, just to keep the pressure on,'' Bair said.
Without question, it is difficult to get mortgage modifications right. But many Democrats originally voted for TARP because it contained a provision mandating that $50 billion of the $700 billion in bailout money go to mortgage modification. The Paulson Treasury ignored that part of the law -- and the Geithner Treasury has barely touched that $50 billion.
Still, a Democratic administration had to do something. Bair offered up the F.D.I.C.'s ideas, which involved, among other things, some government insurance protection for redefaults that took place after three months. She was sure her plan had better economic incentives for servicers than anything else under consideration. But the Obama administration went with a plan that didn't fundamentally change the incentives, and that was not much different from what the Treasury under Bush did after the financial crisis.
When Bair was shown the plan, literally hours before it was announced by the president, she told them, ''That's fine; I'm not going to speak out against this, but don't expect me to marry up to it either, because I don't think it will work.'' She told me: ''They wanted my name and reputation on it.''
Sure enough, the Home Affordable Modification Plan has not exactly been a rousing success. Although some 700,000 homeowners have gotten modified mortgages through the program, that number is dwarfed by the millions of foreclosures that have taken place and the millions of homeowners in default today. Too often qualified borrowers have sought HAMP modifications only to be turned away by their servicers. Foreclosure remains their preference.
''I think the president's heart is in the right place,'' Bair told me. ''I absolutely do. But the dichotomy between who he selected to run his economic team and what he personally would like them to be doing -- I think those are two very different things.'' What particularly galls her is that Treasury under both Paulson and Geithner has been willing to take all sorts of criticism to help the banks. But it has been utterly unwilling to take any political heat to help homeowners.
The second key issue for Bair has been dealing with the too-big-to-fail banks. Her distaste for the idea that the systemically important banks can never be allowed to fail is visceral. ''I don't think regulators can adequately regulate these big banks,'' she told me. ''We need market discipline. And if we don't have that, they're going to get us in trouble again.''
In the early wrangling over what became the Dodd-Frank bill, ''resolution authority'' was not a prominent part of the agenda. Then in March 2009, A.I.G. filed documents showing that it had set aside $165 million in bonuses for its traders. The public anger over these bonuses was enormous. One day in the middle of the furor, the president summoned Bair to the White House. When she arrived at the Oval Office, Geithner and Lawrence Summers, Obama's top economic adviser, were sitting on the couch -- and the seat next to the president was empty. That was where she was supposed to sit.--As the president vented his frustration over the A.I.G. bonuses, Bair saw her opportunity. ''This doesn't happen with our process,'' she told the president. ''We have a resolution process that we've used for decades, and when we put a bank into receivership, we have the right to break all contracts, we can fire people, we can take away bonuses and we don't get into this kind of problem.'' The president quickly signed on to the idea of having Dodd-Frank include the ability to resolve giant bank-holding companies and other systemically important financial institutions like A.I.G.
That was the easy part. Dealing with the Treasury Department was, as usual, the hard part. The original white paper the administration produced that outlined the financial reforms it wanted from Congress included a section calling for the government to be able to legally ''resolve'' the big banks. It had the F.D.I.C. running the process, which clearly made the most sense; the agency had been doing it for so long, it had the process down to a science. That's why bank depositors scarcely notice when the F.D.I.C. shuts down their bank on a Friday and reopens it under new management on a Monday morning.
Weeks passed. About an hour before the president was set to announce the reform package, F.D.I.C. officials, including Bair, were shown the latest copy of the white paper. According to Bair, ''The resolution authority had completely changed.'' While the F.D.I.C. still had an important role, its authority had been seriously diluted -- now the Treasury and the Federal Reserve would also have to sign off before a bank could be wound down. From Treasury's point of view, this was completely reasonable. After all, any wind-down would require short-term lending from the Treasury, so it wanted some say in the process. But Bair felt strongly that this was yet another example of her -- and her agency -- being undercut by other regulators.
So she fought back; and in typical Bair fashion, she did so publicly. When called to testify before the House Financial Services Committee about the new resolution authority, she bluntly told Barney Frank, then the committee chairman, that, as she put it to me: ''It still doesn't resolve the large bank-holding companies. We would like the authority to do that.'' In the final Dodd-Frank bill, Treasury's oversight role was diminished -- and the F.D.I.C. had the authority to manage a failing too-big-to-fail bank.
Even so, there are many people who remain convinced that the government will never have the nerve to let an important institution actually fail. Indeed, the big banks currently have a much lower cost of capital than their smaller brethren precisely because the bond market doesn't believe they will ever be allowed to fail.
Bair has spent much of the last year trying to convince the country -- and Wall Street -- that the F.D.I.C. is up to the task. Most people remain unconvinced. But she insists, thanks to the new resolution authority, ''I think we are in a lot better shape than we were.'' The truth, of course, is that nobody can possibly know what the government will do. The only way to find out is to have an institution fail -- not exactly a prospect to relish. But that will be a problem for someone else, not for Sheila Bair. She has done her part.
''I didn't start off being assertive and going public with concerns,'' Bair said as our second interview was winding down. ''But we were being ignored, and we had something to bring to the table. There's been speculation: maybe it was gender or that I'm not an Ivy League person. It could be; everybody has their biases. But I found I had to become assertive when they just wouldn't listen.''
My own view is the country would have been far better served if more people in positions of power had been willing to listen to her as the financial crisis unfolded. Hers was a voice of common sense, trying to protect the taxpayer, the bank depositor and the homeowner. If other regulators had taken her early subprime concerns seriously -- to cite just one example -- the financial world might be a different place today.
''We always saw ourselves as the champion of the little guy,'' she continued. ''The other regulators never saw the pain of a bank closure, because that was our role. We were the ones that saw people losing their jobs when we had to shut down a little bank. They never understood the unfairness of the way little banks were treated versus big banks. Some of the other regulators have an institutional mind-set that the big banks have to always be with us.''
Which brings me back to where we began, with Bear Stearns. As I've thought about it in the weeks since our interviews, I've come to the view that she was absolutely right. ''I think that the Bear deal set up an expectation for government intervention that was not really helpful,'' she told me. Letting Bear Stearns fail would most likely have sent the right message to the rest of Wall Street, while there was still time, and without creating the kind of chain reaction that the Lehman failure caused. ''I've always thought,'' she said, ''that it was really important for everybody to have to play by the same set of rules.''
That didn't happen in 2008. Fighting the good fight, Bair has tried to make sure that it will happen the next time there's a crisis.

HEADLINE: Honolulu

BYLINE: By JOCELYN FUJII

 BODY:
HONOLULU has never been hotter, and not just because it's July. The city's ''it'' factor has been on the rise since President Obama announced, two years ago in Singapore, that his self-described ''home state of Hawaii'' would host the 2011 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. This November, the 21-nation Pacific Rim summit may bring as many as 10,000 people to Waikiki, the renowned Honolulu destination on Oahu's south shore. While the city primps for the media glare, it also brims with summer's delights. Mangoes and sweet summer fruit add splashy colors to the market stands. Pikake, puakenikeni, gardenia and tuberose grace Chinatown lei stands, and Hawaiian music spills onto beaches from sunset-drenched oceanfront lounges.
Friday
4 p.m. 1) A SPA WITHOUT WALLS 
There's nothing better than a summer moment at Kapiolani Park, the 300-acre recreational magnet at the foot of Diamond Head, the volcanic tuff cone and landmark the Hawaiians named Leahi. Work up a sweat with the joggers and rugby players while white terns soar above the ironwoods. Top that off with a sunset swim across the street, at the beach fronting the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel.
6 p.m. 2) HAWAIIAN TUNES
Sandy feet are not an anomaly at Duke's Restaurant and Barefoot Bar (2335 Kalakaua Avenue; 808-922-2268; dukeswaikiki.com), where the stars of Hawaiian music play nightly at sunset. Maunalua, a trio offering contemporary Hawaiian music, usually plays on Fridays, and the guitarist-vocalist Henry Kapono, the self-proclaimed ''wild Hawaiian,'' is the Hawaiian-rock attraction on Sundays. The open-air spot has a vintage surfer feel and wall-to-wall tributes to the Olympic swimming legend Duke Kahanamoku. Parking is expensive, but there's no cover charge.
7:30 p.m. 3) THE PALATE-PLEASER
Philippe Padovani, one of the 12 original founders of Hawaii Regional Cuisine, opened Padovani's Grill earlier this year, just in time for the 20th anniversary of the culinary movement. Fans love him for his designer chocolates, masterful sauces, signature clam chowder (Manila clams, sweet corn from Oahu's north shore and a soupcon of island seaweed) and risotto (truffle oil and several types of mushrooms). There are special touches across the board, including made-to-order sauces for the seafood and Black Angus beef dishes. The chef pays equal respect to vegetarians, with an excellent goat cheese ravioli and fricassee of mushrooms. For dessert, try the tarte Tatin and bourbon creme brulee. A three-course dinner without drinks costs $55 to $65.
9:30 p.m. 4) FROM TATTOOS TO DRAGONS
The indie jazz scene is thriving at the top of a steep stairway in Chinatown, in a former tattoo parlor the size of a cozy living room. Some of the best musicians in town gather at the Dragon Upstairs (1038 Nuuanu Avenue; 808-526-1411; thedragonupstairs.com) to jam and entertain in grand bohemian style. Most nights it's the spectacular Japanese/local contemporary jazz pianist, Satomi Yarimizo, with her drummer and bass player. Because many in the audience are musicians, there are surprise performances galore in a seriously music-loving room.
Saturday
9 a.m. 5) DIAMOND HEAD FOOD FEST
Yes, it's possible to have breakfast on the slopes of Diamond Head, at Honolulu's busiest farmers' market. A bonanza for early-bird foodies, the Saturday farmers' market at Kapiolani Community College (4303 Diamond Head Road; 808-848-2074; hfbf.org) is the raison d'etre for many a local food lover. Take your own bag and go early to find parking: it's worth it. Everything there is local. The rainbow of products is edible Hawaii in full color, whether it's persimmons, homemade ginger and guava drinks, mangoes, goat cheese, local honey or scones and banana bread.
11 a.m. 6) IT'S ALL ABOUT ART
With the merger this summer of the Contemporary Museum and the Honolulu Academy of Arts (900 South Beretania Street; 808-532-8700; honoluluacademy.org), and a new director, Stephan Jost, the buzz is all about art. A $25, two-and-a-half-hour tour of Shangri La, the Islamic museum founded by the Doris Duke estate, begins and ends at the Academy, which runs the Shangri La tours. A 20-minute shuttle ride takes you to the 1930s oceanfront mansion-turned-museum with its Iznik tiles, Central Asian textiles and 13th-century prayer room. When you return to the Academy, leave time for the Hawaii collection in the John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery, with works by Jules Tavernier, Lionel Walden and other Hawaiian masters.
1:30 p.m. 7) ART AND THE PLATE
The Pavilion Cafe (900 South Beretania Street; 808-532-8734; honoluluacademy.org/394-pavilion--cafe), the restaurant for the Academy of Arts, scores high points for its Mediterranean menu and its alfresco location next to a waterfall and Jun Kaneko sculptures. The menu, while not fancy, is ideal: white bean salad with arugula and wilted radicchio ($12.95), hearty sandwiches (feta, tapenade, tomato; chopped salmon steak), a pasta of the day and desserts like chocolate pot de creme and fresh fruit crisp ($5.95 each). At the Academy boutique a few steps away, books, cards, textiles and handmade jewelry make it one of Honolulu's stellar shopping attractions.
5:30 p.m. 8) SUNSET SERENADE
Halekulani's House Without a Key (2199 Kalia Road; 808-923-2311; halekulani.com) is a magnet at sunset. A century-old kiawe tree is gracefully backlighted by the late afternoon sun, the mai tais ($12) are heroic, and the views of the ocean and Diamond Head make you forget about the neighboring high-rises. When the hula dancer Kanoe Miller takes the stage, small talk ceases. It could be a postcard from the 1940s, the heyday of Waikiki. On Ms. Miller's nights off, Debbie Nakanelua fills the stage with her own brand of hula magic.
8 p.m. 9) THE RAW RAGE
Last year, Masaharu Morimoto, a star of the program ''Iron Chef America,'' opened his first Hawaii restaurant, Morimoto Waikiki. Sharing a pool and lounge with the Waikiki Edition hotel, the sleek, high-concept restaurant offers yacht-filled harbor views, indoor-outdoor dining, a fire pit, a sushi bar and a bar. Outdoors, lanterns light poolside picnic tables where urbane networkers linger over designer cocktails and tapas. Coral sculptures and panels of green algae encased in acrylic are a bold interior statement by the designer Thomas Shoos. Raw dishes, such as sashimi, toro tartare and the popular lamb and wagyu carpaccio, are classic Morimoto ($13 to $30), but the noodle dishes ($10 to $18), occasionally too salty and overcooked, are less successful. The wagyu steaks have a reverential following ($50 to $85), and the light-as-air tofu cheesecake ($12) is a favorite.
Sunday
10 a.m. 10) THE TURNING POINT
The Makapuu Point Trail, at the easternmost part of the island, is the tour de force on a drive full of special moments. Pack sunscreen and a hat as you head south along Kalanianaole Highway past Hanauma Bay and Sandy Beach. Koko Head Crater on the left has created striated cliffs that nearly run into the lava shoreline, and you're driving between them both. Once past Sandy Beach, park at the Ka Iwi State Park lot and follow the trail to Makapuu Point along a two-mile 500-foot ascent. The 1909 Makapuu Lighthouse completes the package with views of the eastern coast and small offshore islands.
12:30 p.m. 11) THE BUZZ ABOUT BURGERS
Continue the drive along the windward coast, where sea turtles feed among fishermen and snorkelers. About 20 minutes from Makapuu, you'll reach Kailua Beach, lined with ironwoods and dotted with paddlers and windsurfers. The local watering hole, Buzz's Original Steakhouse (413 Kawailoa Road; 808-261-4661; buzzssteakhouse.com), is across the street with a charming veranda, and a tree growing through the center of the dining room. While it's basically a burger joint, there are some standouts, including the kiawe-grilled fresh fish burgers ($11.95). Bloody Marys and beer flow freely from the koa and bamboo bar.
IF YOU GO
The year-old, style-centric Waikiki Edition (1775 Ala Moana Boulevard; 808-943-5800; editionhotels.com) has 353 rooms on 17 floors; rates range from $379 to $995. At the Diamond Head end of Waikiki, the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel (2863 Kalakaua Avenue; 808-923-1555; kaimana.com) has a sleeker look with its refurbished interiors. Rooms start at $150.
Outrigger Reef on the Beach (2169 Kalia Road; 808-926-1959; outriggerreef-onthebeach.com) is on Waikiki Beach, with online summer rates from $179 to $369.
Specials and promotions are ongoing, so be sure to ask. Nightly Hawaiian music at the Kani Ka Pila Grille is a find for any music lover.

HEADLINE: Subway Crush No Longer Gets Weekends Off

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
New York City slows down on the weekends, and its subway is no exception: long waits, jumbled routes, trains that skip stops and sometimes never appear.
Except these days, even if the trains do not show up, riders still do. The weekend subway experience now entails crowded platforms, sardine-tight train cars and a rising tide of complaints as the system struggles with its biggest weekend passenger load in several decades.
Weekend trips have doubled in the past 20 years, far outpacing the growth of ridership during the workweek. Last year, the subway had 5.36 million rides on average during weekends, one of the highest counts on record, transit officials said. 
''You would probably have to go back to close to World War II -- when people were working six days a week -- to find a similar trend,'' said William M. Wheeler, the director of planning at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The new weekend rush speaks to significant improvements in a transit system that was once seen as a national symbol of urban blight. But it also points to the shifting cultural and economic picture of New York, where changing work habits, population patterns and generational attitudes have helped turn the subway into the default mode of transportation at any time of day.
Dozens of residential developments have sprouted up around subway stations in once-desolate parts of Brooklyn and Queens. And the rise of a service-oriented city economy means many workers report to jobs on the weekends or at off hours.
Just 10 years ago, the transportation authority was running advertisements that encouraged riders to take advantage of extra space on weekend trains. Today, in nightlife-heavy neighborhoods like the Lower East Side, the subways move nearly the same number of riders on weekends as they do during the week, a phenomenon once considered unthinkable.
At the Bedford Avenue stop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which serves about a third of the L train's passengers, an average weekend day retains 90 percent of the ridership of a weekday. At Prince Street in SoHo, recently recast as an upscale shopping mecca, the retention rate is 85 percent.
A few minutes before 1:30 a.m. on Saturday, Sean Hennigan, 39, ventured onto a crowded L train at the Bedford Avenue stop. He gestured around the noisy train car, which at that point was standing room only.
''You ride the subway at 2 o'clock on a weekday afternoon, it looks just like this,'' he said. ''Just less drunk people.''
Mr. Hennigan was in the early stages of a roundabout commute home: because of weekend service changes, he had to return to Manhattan before doubling back to Brooklyn on a different line.
It was a vibrant late-night scene on the Bedford Avenue platform, where an amateur guitarist belted out ''Hotel California'' for tips and cuddling couples stared longingly down the tracks, seeking the lights of the next train.
''The subways cleaned up their act a little bit,'' said Danielle Lanzet, 22, a student at the Columbia Publishing Course waiting for a train to Manhattan. A couple of weeks ago, she and a friend rode an uptown No. 1 train at 4 a.m. on a Saturday. ''There were hundreds of people on it,'' she said. ''The platform looked like a morning rush.''
In the past five years, weekend trips have grown at twice the rate of weekday rides. At the same time, weekend service has been reduced; because of budget cuts last year, many trains during the weekend now run once every 10 minutes, up from eight minutes, forcing more passengers into fewer cars.
As crime has receded and an older fleet gave way to brighter, newer trains, a generation of city dwellers has never experienced the subway's darker, grittier era. Many do not think twice about a wee-hour ride after a night on the town.
Ms. Lanzet, on the platform at Bedford Avenue, said she felt safer taking the subway on weekends than she did five years ago. ''More young people take the subway,'' she said. ''When you're with people of similar age, you feel more comfortable.''
The advent of the unlimited MetroCard in 1998 also prompted a big leap in the number of weekend rides, by making it far easier financially and logistically for New Yorkers to take leisure-time trips.
An increase in riders means much-needed revenue for the transportation authority, which faces perpetual financial strains. But the sharp rise in weekend demand also poses an increasingly urgent challenge: how to maintain a creaking, century-old system that now knows no respite.
Unlike most major systems, the New York subway runs 24 hours a day, leaving little time for transit officials to schedule maintenance. The bulk of repair work has traditionally been staged on the weekend.
''It used to be, 'Oh, we can do the work on the weekend because nobody cares,' '' said William A. Henderson, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, a state-financed transit riders' advocacy group. ''Well, now, more and more people do care.'' He added, ''There are no answers that are going to be painless.''
Subway officials say they have no qualms about continuing to schedule maintenance work on weekends, when overall daily ridership is about half of that on a weekday. ''This is the only time available to get these projects completed,'' Charles F. Seaton, a New York City Transit spokesman, wrote in a statement.
While the agency has floated ideas like shutting down an entire line for several weeks to expedite repairs, officials say their focus now is on finding better ways to keep passengers informed about the inevitable disruptions on weekends.
Redesigned posters, audio announcements, in-station LED signs and various digital outlets, including Twitter and a revamped Web site, allow riders to check the status of their train before reaching the platform.
It is not clear whether these tactics will improve riders' morale. In a recent podcast on the agency's Web site, an announcer said cheerfully that weekend disruptions on 12 subway lines may require commuters ''to ride backward just to go forward, or change your traveling pattern altogether.'' The sound of jackhammers chipping concrete could be heard in the background.
''The M.T.A. can no longer have the luxury to think that weekends are expendable; weekends are commuting days now,'' said John C. Liu, the city comptroller, whose office is conducting an audit of the agency's weekend service. ''People who commute Monday to Friday say nice things about the subways. But the complaints about weekend service resound all throughout the city.''

HEADLINE: Cautionary Lessons From State's Shutdown

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
ST. PAUL -- The shutdown of the State of Minnesota has forced the opening of a new hearing room here, where pleas have flowed forth, one after the next, for a week.
May local officials dredge so barges can get through here along the Mississippi River even though laid-off state officials are not around to watch? Might 41 State Patrol officers not quite done with field training be deemed essential and sent back to work like others in the patrol?
Could state workers sign the adoption forms for a Minnesota couple who had been sitting in a Texas motel room with their new baby for the last week, unable to cross state lines without the paperwork? (''So our petition would be, um, could we please come home?'' the woman asked the ad hoc court on Friday in the latest such hearing, conducted, in her case, by speakerphone.) 
If the outlines of a government shutdown are simple -- politicians cannot agree on how to spend money, so everything stops -- the details are not. Since Minnesota officially closed its doors on July 1, the deadline by which the state's political leaders were required to settle on a budget for the fiscal year, officials here have found themselves wandering a new labyrinth.
With the broadest shutdown in state history entering its second full week and no sign of a compromise on the horizon, political leaders in Washington, facing their own standoff and looming deadline, may want to ponder Minnesota -- one cautionary reminder, if on a smaller scale, from the nation's middle.
In many ways, of course, the situations are distinct, but Minnesota's essential impasse sounds familiar: Republican lawmakers who control St. Paul want to rein in state spending and have rejected calls from Mark Dayton, the Democratic governor, to raise income taxes on the wealthiest Minnesotans.
Leaders in Washington disagree on what passing an August deadline without raising the debt ceiling would really mean (it has never happened), but some experts say it could result, along with devastation to the nation's ability to borrow and to the broader economy, in a confusing, partial halt to some programs as the government has to pick and choose what it has enough cash to cover.
In Minnesota, carrying out a shutdown -- and a relatively ordinary one, as these things go -- has turned out to be a whole new, time-consuming government function, including convening the special hearings to weigh exceptions to the shutdown rules. The costs of closing (who knew it cost money to halt spending?) are themselves swiftly rising. And, puzzlingly enough, the shock of a shuttered Capitol, of 22,000 laid-off state workers and of barricaded state parks in the heart of Minnesota's camping season seems, so far, not to have introduced urgency to the political negotiation.
No one knows exactly what the shutdown is costing Minnesota. For one thing, a final tally will depend on how long it lasts; for another, some of the people who might be estimating the extra costs and lost revenue in various state departments right now are laid off.
''There's nobody there to answer the phone call,'' said John Pollard, a spokesman for Minnesota Management and Budget.
But whatever the precise numbers, the counterintuitive truth is that freezing nonessential state services costs money. For instance, the state had to pay the postage to send layoff warnings to 36,000 people as the new budget deadline grew close. The 22,000 workers who were ultimately sent home are expected to receive unemployment benefits, which will cost the state.
And Minnesota is losing revenue it would otherwise be collecting, including $1.25 million a day in lottery sales (the lottery is closed), an unknown amount in parking and licensing fees the Departments of Health, Education and Administration are not getting, and about $52 million a month that the Department of Revenue would ordinarily be bringing in if its compliance officers (now laid off) were scrutinizing tax payments.
By the end of last week, there were other hints of financial repercussions for the state. Fitch Ratings lowered the state's bond rating, noting the budget impasse, meaning that it will be more expensive for the state to borrow money.
Plenty of people here did not think things would actually come to this. The threat of a shutdown (exaggerated, in the eyes of some, until it happened) would be enough to force some last-instant compromise, as it usually does.
But that did not happen. Nor did an actual shutdown, and the immediate frustration of residents, state workers and others, seem to create any new rush to make a deal.
In a week of shutdown, Republicans and the Democratic governor appear to have gotten almost nowhere. In the middle of the week, Governor Dayton announced two offers: one that would temporarily increase income taxes on Minnesotans making more than $1 million a year, and another that seemed to cede his income tax idea and instead to accept an increase in the cigarette tax as a way to raise revenues.
Republicans rejected both, saying that there were simply ''not the votes'' in the Legislature for any sort of tax increase. No talks have been held since, and recommendations from a group of Minnesotan elder statesmen, organized by Walter Mondale, the former Democratic vice president, and Arne Carlson, a former Republican governor, went nowhere either.
In fact, rather than seeming closer to resolution, the dispute has grown only more polarized, and outside groups are stepping in. The Alliance for a Better Minnesota has begun running radio ads blaming Republicans for the shutdown. The Minnesota Majority has bought billboards reminding motorists that the state's rest stops closed when the state did. ''Next rest area 138 miles, exit 214 -- Iowa,'' one billboard reads, ''Thanks a lot Governor Dayton.''
Some of the smaller problems appear to be getting sorted out. The couple adopting a baby, for instance, was assured of a quick solution; though a package delivery service had said it was unable to deliver the needed adoption paperwork to the closed Capitol, top state officials said on Friday afternoon that they would work around that, offering to drive to the delivery company themselves, if need be, to find the package.
But broader issues seem barely to move.
''That Minnesota would have a protracted government shutdown -- I never thought that was possible,'' said Lawrence Jacobs, a political scientist here. ''The big lesson from Minnesota is that the unthinkable is possible. You have a tendency to think in these sorts of situations it's just a game of chicken, that there will be a resolution, that the debt ceiling will be lifted. But sometimes a game of chicken ends in a car crash.''

HEADLINE: Economy Faces a Jolt as Benefit Checks Run Out

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
An extraordinary amount of personal income is coming directly from the government.
Close to $2 of every $10 that went into Americans' wallets last year were payments like jobless benefits, food stamps, Social Security and disability, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics. In states hit hard by the downturn, like Arizona, Florida, Michigan and Ohio, residents derived even more of their income from the government.
By the end of this year, however, many of those dollars are going to disappear, with the expiration of extended benefits intended to help people cope with the lingering effects of the recession. Moody's Analytics estimates $37 billion will be drained from the nation's pocketbooks this year.
In terms of economic impact, that is slightly less than the spending cuts Congress enacted to keep the government financed through September, averting a shutdown. 
Unless hiring picks up sharply to compensate, economists fear that the lost income will further crimp consumer spending and act as a drag on a recovery that is still quite fragile. Among the other supports that are slipping away are federal aid to the states, the Federal Reserve's program to pump money into the economy and the payroll tax cut, scheduled to expire at the end of the year.
''If we don't get more job growth and gains in wages and salaries, then consumers just aren't going to have the firepower to spend, and the economy is going to weaken,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, a macroeconomic consulting firm.
Job growth has remained elusive. There are 4.6 unemployed workers for every opening, according to the Labor Department, and Friday's unemployment report showed that employers added an anemic 18,000 jobs in June.
In Arizona, where there are 10 job seekers for every opening, 45,000 people could lose benefits by the end of the year, according to estimates from the state Department of Economic Security. Yet employers in the state have added just 4,000 jobs over the last 12 months.
Some other states will also feel a disproportionate loss of income unless hiring revives. In Florida, where nearly 476,000 people are collecting unemployment benefits, employers have added only 11,200 jobs in the last year. In Michigan, employers have added about 40,000 jobs since May 2010, but about 267,000 people are claiming jobless benefits.
Throughout the recession and its aftermath, government benefits have helped keep money in people's wallets and, in turn, circulating among businesses. Total government payments rose to $2.3 trillion in 2010, from $1.7 trillion in 2007, an increase of about 35 percent.
While some of that growth was in Social Security and disability benefits as the population aged, the majority resulted from payments to people continuing to suffer from the recession, said Mr. Zandi. Unemployment benefits, including emergency and extended benefits, are more than three times their prerecession level, he said. The nearly 20 percent of personal income now provided by the government is close to a record high.
Approved by Congress last December, the final extension of jobless benefits -- for a maximum of 99 weeks for each unemployed person -- is scheduled to conclude at the end of this year. A handful of states, like Wisconsin and Arizona, have already cut off weeks 80 through 99 for their residents. Meanwhile, more of the long-term unemployed are bumping up against the 99-week limit.
Consumers account for an estimated 60 to 70 percent of the country's economic activity, but two years into the official recovery, businesses are still complaining that people simply are not spending enough.
''Regardless of why people have less money to spend, it affects all retailers in all industries,'' said Michael Siemienas, spokesman for SuperValu, which operates grocery chains including Cub Foods, Shop 'n Save and Save-A-Lot. Mr. Siemienas said that the number of SuperValu's customers using electronic benefit transfers to pay bills had grown over the last year.
Because benefit payments tend to be spent right away to cover basic needs like food and rent, they provide a direct boost to consumer spending. In a study for the Labor Department, Wayne Vroman, an economist at the Urban Institute, estimated that every $1 paid in jobless benefits generated as much as $2 in the economy.
For many of the nearly 7.5 million people collecting unemployment benefits, those payments are keeping them afloat. Laura Metz, 42, was laid off from a clerical job paying $15.30 an hour at a home health care provider near her home in Commerce, Mich., nearly 15 months ago. She has been collecting $362 a week in unemployment insurance and about $50 a month in food stamps.
That covers the basics. But Ms. Metz stopped making her mortgage payments last year on the modest home she shares with her 19-year-old son. A program that allowed her to make a lower monthly payment has expired, and she is waiting to see if the lender will modify her loan. She can no longer make her student loan payments for her bachelor's degree or master's in business administration, and she has downgraded her Internet and cable service and cut back on car trips and snacks.
Ms. Metz, who has been applying for administrative jobs, has been shocked at the dearth of opportunities. A decade ago, when she applied for clerical jobs, ''as soon as I walked up, there was a sign saying 'We're hiring,' but it's not like that now,'' she said. ''It's really, really difficult.''
Businesses that rely heavily on low-income shoppers worry that their customers will have little to spend. Najib Atisha, who co-owns two small grocery stores in Detroit, said people receiving government assistance made up about a third of his customers downtown and as much as 60 percent at his store on the west side of the city.
''Of course, we're hoping that things will turn around, but it's always easier to lose jobs than it is to gain jobs,'' Mr. Atisha said. ''I think it's going to take twice as long to rebound as it took to get where we are now.''
Some business groups argue that extending unemployment benefits has had deleterious effects on employers and potential workers.
''It's having a chilling effect on hiring,'' said Wendy Block, director of health policy and human resources at the Michigan Chamber of Commerce. ''At one point, our unemployment taxes were just a blip on the balance sheet, but when you're talking over $500 a head, this is significant.'' Last year, Michigan spent $6.2 billion on jobless benefits, according to the National Employment Law Project.
Some economic studies show that people who collect unemployment benefits are less likely to look for or accept work until their benefits are close to running out.
''Unemployment insurance extends the typical amount of time that people will spend off the job and not looking for work,'' said Chris Edwards, an economist at the Cato Institute, a libertarian organization.
In Michigan, Ms. Metz said that if all else failed, she would have to move in with her parents, who live on a fixed income. But she is determined to find work before her benefits run out and plans to expand her search to include light industrial manufacturing. ''It's getting close to the end,'' she said. ''And I got to do what I got to do.''

HEADLINE: Despite Violence, Mexico Plants Hum at Border

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
MATAMOROS, Mexico -- When the latest bloody headlines from the drug war in Mexico reach headquarters in New York, Ken Chandler, the manager of an American electronics manufacturing plant here, jumps on the phone.
He is not begging to come home. He is begging to stay.
''We try to put them at ease, to say it is not time to pack up,'' said Mr. Chandler, who oversees the company's operations in this border city, where the military arrived last week to help purge drug cartel members from the police department.
Not that his employer, Spellman High Voltage, needs much assurance. Like a crop of other manufacturers at the border, including six companies in this city alone, Spellman is expanding its operations, with a new plant under construction after making a calculation that offers one of the starker paradoxes of these violent days in Mexico.
Despite the bleak outlook the drug war summons, the Mexican economy is humming along, not without warning signs, but growing considerably faster than that of the United States. 
Even as drug organizations battle for turf around them, more TV sets are being assembled, car parts boxed up and electronic widgets soldered together in the large manufacturing plants here known as maquiladoras. The result is a boomlet in jobs in some of Mexico's hardest-hit cities, a bright spot in an otherwise bleak stream of shootouts, departing small businesses and fear of random death.
Over all, jobs in Mexico's manufacturing sector increased 8.2 percent to 1.8 million as of January, the most recent figures available, driven mostly by what Mexican officials called regaining health in the auto and electronics industries, the engine of the economy along the border. Even Ciudad Juarez, which has both the highest level of violence and the largest number of maquiladoras, added 1.3 percent more jobs, to 176,824.
Mostly American-owned and in border states, the plants import raw materials duty free and export assembled products, lowering the cost of goods in the United States and providing jobs that pay more than the Mexican average (typically $8 to $16 per day on the assembly line) but a lot less than American wages.
Some of the new or expanding plants come at the expense of plant closings in the United States. Electrolux, which makes washers, dryers and other home products, closed a plant in 2009 in Iowa but opened one in Juarez last month that is expected to employ 400 people.
Others are from investors farther afield. Foxconn, a Taiwanese firm that makes iPhones, Dell computers and other electronics, is one of several Asian companies taking root. It opened a plant in Juarez last summer. Down the coast from here, Posco, a Korean steel manufacturer, has announced plans to expand its operations with a second plant that will employ 300 people by 2013. Several other companies plan to built or expand in other states as well.
The gains have not made up for losses during the global recession; many plants closed or have shed jobs for good, focusing on making their operations more efficient through automation and other measures, analysts said.
Still, border towns are showing some of their biggest signs of economic life in months. Over all, the Mexican economy, the second largest in Latin America after Brazil, grew 5.5 percent last year, its fastest pace in a decade, and is expected to grow 4.5 percent this year, driven largely by manufacturing as well as internal growth from an expanding middle class. The American economy, by contrast, is expected to grow between 2.7 percent and 2.9 percent in 2011, the Federal Reserve projected late last month.
Economists say Mexico's growth would be even stronger without the cartel violence, which in the last five years has left more than 40,000 people dead, according to the count by national newspapers.
And given how central the American economy is to its welfare, Mexico could suffer if the recovery in the United States does not pick up speed. While trade with the United States hit a record last year of nearly $395 billion, foreign investment has lagged, suggesting that much of the job and economic growth is depending on existing businesses expanding or restarting production lines that had been waylaid by the recession.
The Bank of Mexico reports foreign investment was $17.7 billion last year, far off pre-recession levels of $25 billion and fed in good measure by a single transaction, the purchase of a one of the country's largest beer companies by Heineken.
Monterrey, the country's business and industrial hub, has exploded with violence in the past year, though even there, in the suburbs, some plants have expanded or announced plans to open. For better or worse, the plants are at once part of and apart from the communities that surround them, protected by tall fences, armed guards and cameras galore.
The violence has largely spared the plants, though workers have been caught up in it. Last fall, gunmen apparently looking for a rival fired on a bus carrying maquiladora workers near Ciudad Juarez, killing four people. Higher-paid supervisors and managers, American and Mexican, tend to commute from the American side of the border.
Security costs are rising to protect property and shipments, and safety remains the top concern expressed by potential investors, said Bob Cook, the president of the El Paso Regional Economic Development Commission, which helps recruit businesses to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico's most violent city.
''But we are still working with more companies now than we did three years ago,'' he said.
Business is business, and the proximity to the United States is hard to pass up. The rising cost of labor, transportation and the renminbi have made some companies reconsider Mexico instead of China, he contended. Despite several murders a day, trade between Juarez and Texas rose 47 percent last year to $71.1 billion, he said.
''Central location, great infrastructure, suppliers and labor pool,'' he said. ''Those things haven't been tampered with by organized crime.''
Industry promoters argue that the additional jobs may help dampen crime, with more people working and able to support their families. But cities that have benefited from manufacturing have often been slow to help workers and their families.
''The maquiladoras may be growing again, but there is still not much of an effort to address the social needs of the workers and their families outside the plants,'' said Cirila Quintero, a sociologist at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a research group based in Tijuana, Mexico. ''What investment has been made in schools and social centers has been minimal. The governments say they don't have money and the plants say they are there to create jobs and help industry.''
But workers like Rosalia Carrasco, 41, who has worked at Spellman here for two months, said they are relieved to have steady work, with benefits. ''I am hoping to improve myself and get ahead, like anybody else,'' she said.
Loren Skeist, the president of Spellman, said he frets over security. The plant took additional safety measures after robbers stole an automatic teller machine last year. A few clients have refused to visit the plant, citing the violence. (The Mexican military this month moved in to police the streets.)
But over all he embraces Matamoros as a smart investment.
''Relatively speaking it is reasonably safe,'' he said by phone from Hauppauge, N.Y. ''There are compelling reasons, if you are willing to do it with reasonable security, to want to be in Mexico.''

HEADLINE: Selling Dog Food

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
Quidsi, the company that started Diapers.com, is doing all it can to make sure people can run their errands without getting off the couch. Next up: Wag.com, which sells pet supplies. 
Wag.com, introduced Wednesday, sells 10,000 pet items like food, litter, toys, clothing and grooming supplies. Quidsi, which was acquired by Amazon.com for $500 million last year, also runs Diapers.com for baby supplies, Soap.com for drugstore items and BeautyBar.com for cosmetics.
The sites, especially Wag.com, bring to mind Pets.com, a company that came to epitomize the last tech bubble. It also delivered pet supplies and, like the other bubble-era failures Kozmo.com and Webvan.com, lost money on each customer because it spent so much on inventory, warehouses and shipping.
But technological developments in the last decade and an emphasis on reining in costs have changed the e-commerce model, say Vinit Bharara and Marc Lore, Quidsi's founders. Quidsi obsesses about logistics and built warehouse technology like robots that choose the size of box an order requires and fill it from the warehouse. And Quidsi only offers free shipping above a certain price.
The economics of selling pet food online have also improved, Mr. Lore said. People buy more organic pet food now, which costs more per pound, so shipping costs as a percent of revenue are lower.
Still, shipping bulky items at low prices ''has always been expensive and it still is,'' Mr. Bharara said. To make up for that, Quidsi focuses on nurturing long-term customers. ''That pays out much more in the long run than the transient connection you may acquire when you make a ton of money by delivering one product to one customer once,'' he said.
For instance, Diapers.com and the other sites pride themselves on a large selection, easy shopping and customer service perks like round-the-clock representatives available by phone and overnight or two-day shipping.
As a result, the sites have built an impressive audience since Diapers.com started in 2005. Meanwhile, their competition has shrunk. Walmart.com remains a competitor, but Amazon bought Quidsi and Drugstore.com was gobbled up in March by Walgreens.
Since buying Quidsi, Amazon has let the company continue to operate mostly on its own in Jersey City, but Quidsi has benefited from things like Amazon's lower shipping rates, Mr. Lore said.
Quidsi tried to make Wag.com easy to navigate, Mr. Lore said. For instance, once pet owners indicate what type of pet they have, they only see products for dogs or fish on the site. Customers can shop across all Quidsi's site and make the purchase from the same online shopping cart.
Quidsi plans to keep expanding. It is building Yoyo.com to sell toys and other sites to appeal to busy mothers, Mr. Lore said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Despite High Suicide Rate, South Koreans Resist Therapy

BYLINE: By MARK McDONALD; Su-hyun Lee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SEOUL -- It can sometimes feel as if South Korea, overworked, overstressed and ever anxious, is on the verge of a national nervous breakdown, with a rising divorce rate, students who feel suffocated by academic pressures, a suicide rate among the highest in the world and a macho corporate culture that still encourages blackout drinking sessions after work.
More than 30 South Koreans kill themselves every day, and the suicides of entertainers, politicians, athletes and business leaders have become almost commonplace. The recent suicides of four students and a professor at Korea's leading university shocked the nation, and in recent weeks a TV baseball announcer, two professional soccer players, a university president and the former lead singer in a popular boy band killed themselves.
And yet Koreans -- while almost obsessively embracing Western innovations ranging from smartphones to the Internet to cosmetic surgery -- have largely resisted Western psychotherapy for their growing anxieties, depression and stress. Talk-therapy modalities with psychiatrists, psychologists and other types of trained counselors are only slowly being accepted, according to mental health experts here. 
''Talking openly about emotional problems is still taboo,'' said Dr. Kim Hyong-soo, a psychologist and professor at Chosun University in Kwangju.
''With depression, the inclination for Koreans is to just bear with it and get over it,'' he said. ''If someone goes to a psychoanalyst, they know they'll be stigmatized for the rest of their life. So they don't go.''
Mental health experts said many troubled South Koreans seek help from private psychiatric clinics (and pay their bills in cash) so their government-insurance records do not carry the stigma of a ''Code F,'' signifying someone who has received reimbursement for such care.
Even when Koreans do seek out counseling, the learning curve can be steep.
A prominent psychiatrist with a practice in Seoul, Jin-seng Park, said it was not uncommon for some new patients to come to his office, talk over a problem for 40 minutes and then be shocked when they're presented with a bill.
''They'll say, 'I have to pay? Just for talking? I can do that for free with my friend or my pastor,''' said Dr. Park.
Patients also balk, he said, at the idea of spending more than a couple sessions on talk therapy. Instead, most patients simply ask for, and expect, medication, said Dr. Park, whose Web site advises that ''nearly all of the medications used in the U.S. are available here, too. So don't worry about getting those medications in Korea.''
About a third of his patients come for counseling, Dr. Park said, and the rest rely on medication.
''Koreans are getting more comfortable with Western psychotherapy, but this is limited to the highly educated and those familiar with Western ways,'' said Dr. Oh Kyung-ja, a Harvard-trained professor of clinical psychology at Yonsei University in Seoul.
Meanwhile, the suicide rate in South Korea is nothing short of alarming, nearly three times higher than in the United States. The rate here doubled in the decade between 1999 and 2009. Suicide pacts among strangers who meet online is a growing phenomenon. Suicides by drinking pesticides, hanging or jumping from tall buildings are the most common.
''We have seen a rapid increase in depression, and I'd say 80 to 90 percent of our suicides are byproducts of depression,'' said Dr. Kim. Government mental health clinics have proved effective in helping with basic family or marital problems, he said, ''but they're not getting at depression.''
''That issue is still very closed. We still conceal it.''
South Korean society has traditionally been underpinned by Buddhist and Confucian values, which emphasize diligence, stoicism and modesty. Individual concerns are secondary. Preserving dignity, or ''face,'' especially for the family, is paramount.
Some experts trace South Korea's emotional malaise to the decline of these traditional values and the rise of the country as a modern industrial power, starting in the 1980s. South Korea, once even poorer than woeful North Korea, now boasts the world's 13th-largest economy.
''As the society became more oriented toward materialism, people started to compare themselves,'' said Dr. Park. ''There's a lot of competition now, even starting in childhood, and the goals of life have moved. We have a saying, 'If one cousin buys land, the other cousin gets a stomachache.'''
With Confucian values on the wane, Koreans use a variety of ways -- short of prescribed medications -- to wick off the stresses of the hectic pace of urban life. Consulting shamans, outdoor exercise like golf and hiking, alcohol, organized religion, the Internet and travel are common outlets now.
Christian pastoral counseling can be a support for some patients, said Dr. Park, who has tutored ministers on therapeutic techniques, although he cautioned that this was no substitute for professional therapy. ''Pastors try to treat patients themselves,'' he said, ''and this can have serious and dangerous complications, even deaths.''
Consulting a shaman is still common among many Koreans, usually when they come down with the blues, the odd illness or a run of bad luck. Indeed, shamanism has made something of a comeback in South Korea in recent years, with an estimated 300,000 shamans ministering to clients.
Many shamans, known as mudang, even operate sophisticated Web sites these days (complete with online fortunetelling), even as they continue to strangle chickens, walk barefoot on razor blades and commune with dead relatives whose spirits reside in trees, chimneys or woodland creatures.
''More Koreans see fortunetellers than psychiatrists,'' said Dr. Yoon Dae-hyun, a psychiatrist at Seoul National University Hospital and an official with the Korean Association for Suicide Prevention. ''Our biggest competitors are fortunetellers and room salons. They certainly make more money than us.''
Room salons are after-work clubs frequented by hard-drinking businessmen who select from a bevy of personal hostesses who ply them with expensive drinks and listen to their problems over the course of an evening.
Yu Jeong is a fortuneteller at Daily Motion, a cafe in Seoul that features 15-minute readings (and a free waffle) with the purchase of a coffee.
''Psychiatrists treat patients like patients, so the people don't tell them every bad thing,'' she said. ''Young people come in here and tell me everything, even the things they won't tell their parents.''
Young people in South Korea are certainly unhappy, even chronically so, in part because of ferocious academic pressures that begin early on. A recent survey here found that young Koreans -- for the third straight year -- were the unhappiest youngsters in a subset of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.
Ms. Yu said she counsels about 50 people a day, usually couples or small groups of friends who are seeking advice on romance, marriage or changing jobs.
''Koreans are trying to find their own 'package,' their own set of remedies -- and they're doing this very intensely, of course,'' said Dr. Oh, the Yonsei professor. ''They are desperately searching for things to do to divert themselves from stress. They just don't have a good model.''

HEADLINE: Weak Results Are Projected For Wall Street

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Only a few short months ago, JPMorgan Chase traders were on such a roll that they did not have a single losing day in the first quarter.
But when the bank reports its second-quarter results this week, that hot streak will have come to an end. Analysts expect JPMorgan to count an almost 20 percent drop in its sales and trading revenues, reflecting a slowdown in investor activity and the dismal performance of its fixed-income and commodities groups.
Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are expected to report similar news. After helping prop up Wall Street during the financial crisis, core trading revenue is projected to drop, on average, by as much as 25 percent from the first quarter, according to Credit Suisse research.
That will put further pressure on the banks' growth prospects, which are already strained by stagnant loan growth and more stringent regulation. It is also prompting nearly every major Wall Street firm to contemplate another round of layoffs amid growing concerns that at least part of the weak results are permanent. 
''We are undoubtedly being impacted by lower levels of activity,'' said William Tanona, a financial services analyst with UBS. ''There is a lot of uncertainty out there.''
Together, the five Wall Street banks are still going to take in more than $20 billion from their core trading operations, largely from business done on behalf of clients. For example, the banks routinely help airlines hedge oil prices or bring together buyers and sellers of stock, bonds and other complex securities -- often putting their own money on the line to facilitate a trade. But during the second quarter, the business was particularly hard hit.
Trading volumes fell sharply as investors became unnerved by the running debt crisis in Europe, the political standoff over the debt ceiling in the United States, and lingering concerns over the anemic growth of the broader economy. Even when investors did place their bets, they were far more hesitant to take big risks -- something known on Wall Street as lacking conviction. That meant the banks missed out on the lucrative fees they can generate by selling more high-octane products, like complex options and derivatives.
Fixed-income traders, among the biggest moneymakers for Wall Street, faced a bruising market. In the commodities business, for example, oil, gold and other metals prices had been rising quickly during the early part of the year as investors anticipated high demand for materials to keep the global economy humming. But as cracks in the recovery kept surfacing, prices headed south -- and traders raced to the sidelines. That left most Wall Street desks, which had stocked up on inventory to facilitate trades, holding losing positions.
At JPMorgan, for instance, energy traders were having a gangbuster year, earning several hundred million dollars for its burgeoning commodities unit. Yet when the market turned in early May, they gave back some of those gains, according to market participants. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suffered tens of millions in losses on its interest rate desk when a bet on lower inflation turned against the bank's position.
Mortgage trading did not fare much better. After rallying from highly depressed values for much the last two years, mortgage-backed securities prices fell sharply during the second quarter. The reason? The government started dumping into the market its vast portfolio of mortgage bonds acquired from its rescue of the American International Group, and investors believed the outsize supply would cause values to plummet. (Only recently, when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced it was halting auctions of the A.I.G. mortgage bonds, did prices start to stabilize.)
Although the banks have slowed the spill of red ink from troubled mortgages and other bad loans, they are struggling to increase revenue in their more traditional banking businesses, too.
New financial regulations have chipped away at once-lucrative sources of income, like overdraft charges and credit card penalty fees. Starting this fall, banks are expecting to absorb a multibillion-dollar hit when they are forced to sharply lower the fees they charge each time consumers swipe their debit cards. Higher capital requirements, meanwhile, could further depress profits if some banks are forced to lighten their balance sheets or exit certain businesses altogether.
At the same time, the fragile economy has undermined the banks' bread-and-butter business of lending. Both consumers and businesses have been reluctant to take out new loans. Meanwhile, the surge in mortgage refinancing last year has petered out, even though interest rates remain at historically low levels.
The upshot is that trading, which has long been one of the biggest drivers of revenue at Wall Street firms and a crucial growth engine at financial conglomerates, has become even more critical.
At Goldman Sachs, for example, trading-related businesses made up almost 79 percent of the bank's total revenue in the first quarter of 2011, up from 73 percent in 2007, according to UBS financial research. At a big diversified bank like JPMorgan Chase, sales and trading made up about 21 percent of the bank's total revenue in the first quarter of 2011, up from 14 percent in 2007.
''It's gotten bigger, partly because other businesses aren't firing as vibrantly,'' Howard Chen, a financial services analyst at Credit Suisse.
This quarter, trading revenue will be up about 10 percent from a year ago. But it is expected to fall sharply from the first quarter, when market conditions were more favorable.
Bank of America hinted at its second-quarter trading results late last month when it announced plans to take a $20 billion hit to help clean up its troubled mortgage business.
Based on the bank's comments, Credit Suisse analysts are forecasting that sales and trading revenues will be down 23 percent from the first quarter, largely from a falloff in the fixed-income businesses. Those figures exclude certain one-time items and accounting charges tied to hedging the bank's own debt and other credit exposures that fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
JPMorgan and Citigroup, meanwhile, could have core sales and trading decline around 20 percent from the first quarter, according to the Credit Suisse research. Morgan Stanley could record a 25 percent drop, while Goldman Sachs, which has a huge fixed-income business, could have core sales and trading revenue fall around 36 percent.
To make up some of the difference, both firms plan to start swinging the corporate ax. Morgan Stanley, which has added hundreds of workers over the last two years in an effort to rebuild its trading franchise, has turned its attention to cuts in its wealth management unit. It announced plans to slash $1 billion in noncompensation expenses over three years and eliminate several hundred low-producing brokers.
Goldman, meanwhile, is planning to announce layoffs as it cuts about 10 percent, or roughly $1 billion, of noncompensation expenses over the next 12 months, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Rory McIlroy's religion was, until a few days ago, a mystery to Barry McGuigan.
''Is he Catholic? Really?'' McGuigan said. ''I didn't know that. I thought he was a Protestant young guy.''
McGuigan was a precursor of a kind to McIlroy, the young golfer who has become Northern Ireland's latest sporting hero in the wake of his United States Open triumph last month.
But the differences in the stories of the two men are as illuminating as the similarities, especially when it comes to the changing nature of their homeland.
McGuigan, a charismatic boxer, rose to become a world featherweight champion in the mid-1980s. A Roman Catholic born and raised in a small town just over the border in the Republic of Ireland, he threaded his way through the political and cultural minefield of the time to become beloved by almost everyone. 
Back then, the three-decade violent struggle that tore Northern Ireland apart -- known euphemistically as the Troubles -- had settled into a dismal pattern.
Pro-British paramilitary groups, who labeled themselves loyalists, and their Irish republican opponents, most notably the Irish Republican Army, engaged in killings that were as savage as they were futile. Bodies were found in city back alleys and on damp country roads with numbing regularity. The gloom was all-encompassing and, it seemed at the time, endless.
McGuigan's broad popularity was a sizable achievement, pulled off only through repeated and ostentatious displays of neutrality. He refused to have national flags accompany his entrance into the ring. In place of a national anthem, he would have his father sing ''Danny Boy'' before his bouts. Even his shorts were adorned with a dove of peace.
McIlroy enjoys a similar cross-community appeal. But, tellingly, he has acquired it without advertising his impartiality in blazing neon. He has, so far, dodged questions of political affiliation with a shoulder-shrugging casualness that no one from McGuigan's era could have gotten away with.
In the 2009 World Cup of Golf, he represented Ireland. When the sport returns to the Olympic Games in 2016, after more than a century of absence, he has said he ''probably'' will play for Britain. Asked in an interview with the PGA Tour Web site last year whether he considered himself more British or Irish, McIlroy answered, ''Pass.''
In the 2009 interview with London's Daily Telegraph in which he said he would choose to play for Britain in the Olympics, McIlroy noted that he held a British passport and acknowledged that all of this was ''a bit of an awkward question, still.''
At one time, that would have been putting it mildly. To many Northern Irish Catholics, such an approach would have seemed traitorous; a siding with the enemy. They chose an Irish passport as a point of principle. Representing Britain would have seemed tantamount to backing a state that they regarded as oppressive.
Now, only a very few seem to object to the golfer's approach. McIlroy himself seems to look wryly, and fleetingly, at the questions that took his country to the edge of the abyss and say: No big deal.
Which, given Northern Ireland's history, is a very big deal.
Identified by Religion
I grew up in Belfast during the Troubles. I was on the cusp of high school when Barry McGuigan defeated the great Panamanian Eusebio Pedroza to become a world champion in 1985.
As I was the product of a family that identified primarily as Irish rather than British -- and that was nominally Protestant, yet in reality secular -- McGuigan's Catholic background carried no negative connotation for me. But I was still aware of it. So was everyone else.
At that time, in that place, everyone I knew could identify in an instant the religious affiliation of even the most apolitical people who had propelled themselves from Northern Ireland onto a bigger stage. Van Morrison was Protestant. Liam Neeson was Catholic. George Best, perhaps the finest soccer player of his generation: Protestant. Dennis Taylor, a snooker world champion: Catholic. And on and on.
McIlroy isn't like that. The only reason I was able to inform McGuigan of the golfer's religion was because I had made a deliberate effort to discover it.
Of course, McIlroy's United States Open win was the second in a row for Northern Ireland. The year before, Graeme McDowell had claimed the title at Pebble Beach. McDowell was raised as a Protestant, a religious identity that he wears with just as little ostentation as McIlroy's Catholicism. But McIlroy is on his way to becoming a global superstar, which makes his case all the more intriguing.
''Isn't it funny?'' McGuigan said, reflecting upon the focus on religion. ''People our age always want to find that out. It's the same way that there used to be all that stuff about 'How do you spell your surname?' or 'What newspaper do you read?' That is going to take time to eradicate.''
He's right -- for our generation. For those who are younger, the change is already under way. John Stevenson was McIlroy's principal at his high school, Sullivan Upper, just outside Belfast. There, as well as witnessing the teenage golf prodigy demolishing much older, bigger boys in inter-school games, he also saw what he terms ''the first post-Troubles generation'' come to maturity.
''They seem much more interested in their economic future than anything else,'' he said. ''You could press them as to whether they want to live in an all-Ireland state, and some of them would have different views. But it doesn't seem to be locked into their identity, as it maybe was for a previous generation. There is an energy about the place, and Rory is leading that, to a certain extent.''
Eamonn McCann, a veteran civil rights activist and journalist, agreed, and he, too, seems struck by the lack of clarity regarding McIlroy's identity.
''It is very, very unusual that someone comes to prominence in Northern Ireland without it being clear from the outset what religion they are,'' McCann said in a telephone interview. ''The fact that Rory McIlroy is not seen as part of either camp reflects something that is far deeper in this society.
''He certainly challenges the notion that you had throughout the Troubles -- even though I would argue that it was never entirely true -- that religion in Northern Ireland dictates politics, dictates identity. He has come to the fore at a very interesting time.''
After a Victory, Violence
In Northern Ireland, the old enmities have a habit of bursting back into awful, vigorous life, just when serenity seems to have been secured.
Last month, the very day after McIlroy's United States Open victory, sectarian violence broke out in the Short Strand neighborhood of East Belfast, five miles from his childhood home. Bricks and Molotov cocktails flew for two nights. At least three people sustained gunshot injuries. Police estimated that 400 to 500 people were involved in the disorder.
On Tuesday, as McIlroy fine-tunes his game for the British Open, which begins Thursday at Royal St. George's in England, swaths of his homeland will shut down for the celebrations held every July 12, led by the exclusively Protestant Orange Order organization. Defended as an outpouring of cultural expression by some, ''The Twelfth'' looks more like a festival of bigotry to others, McIlroy's fellow Catholics in particular.
McIlroy's apparent lack of interest in the North's old squabbles is surprising in at least one respect. The Troubles touched his family -- once, but deeply.
A pro-British paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, murdered the golfer's great-uncle in 1972. According to previously published reports, the great-uncle, Joseph McIlroy, moved into a Protestant area of East Belfast when the Troubles were at their height. Presumably, he had faith in the essential reasonableness of his neighbors. It was misplaced. He was shot dead in his kitchen. No one was convicted.
I could find no evidence that Rory McIlroy has ever publicly commented on his great-uncle's murder. His agent declined to make McIlroy or his father, Gerry, available for this article.
A much milder reminder of the treacherous currents that swirl just beneath the surface of Northern Irish life came at the moment of McIlroy's greatest glory.
As he walked, victorious, off the 18th green at Congressional Country Club last month, a spectator tossed a green, white and orange tricolor in his direction. The tricolor is the national flag of the Irish Republic and, as such, has a deeply contentious status in the North. From the television footage, it was not clear exactly what happened to the flag, but it disappeared swiftly.
Many people in Northern Ireland, perhaps most, did not care. Some did.
The debate took on a feverish air, especially on Internet discussion forums. Had the flag been thrown for McIlroy, in support, or at him, as if to claim him as Irish property? Had it merely fallen by the wayside, or had McIlroy consciously spurned it? If he did, was this a signal of neutrality on his part or an expression of de facto pro-British sentiment?
A Facebook page was swiftly erected. Its title, ''Rory McIlroy Turning Down the Tricolour,'' seems to have chiefly attracted pro-British fans celebrating what they saw as a slap in the face to Irish nationalists. Almost 7,000 people have expressed their liking for the page -- not a big number by Facebook standards, but not negligible, either. Look at the vicious back-and-forth comments, mostly from Northern Irish teens and 20-somethings, and it is as if the peace process never happened.
Integration of Golf
There is, of course, another, more optimistic way to look at the incident with the flag. At one level, the new sporting star was successfully escaping attempts to define and confine him.
As McIlroy continues to navigate all this, he has one considerable advantage: his chosen sport.
The mere fact that golf is an individual sport inures it, to some degree, from the displays of communal passion and tribalism that are commonplace in soccer, in which Northern Ireland's sectarian divisions are more clearly and deeply reflected.
Golf, at least by Northern Irish standards, is reasonably well integrated in religious terms. It was traditionally seen as a ''respectable'' pursuit of affluent Protestants -- something which may partly account for the doubts about McIlroy's religious identity -- but this has dissipated over time. McIlroy's home club, Holywood, is in a prosperous, majority-Protestant area. Its membership, locals say, is mixed.
The economic stratification of golf in Northern Ireland has proven more enduring than the religious brand. Clubs and public courses exist in working-class areas, but the sport's dominant image remains one of relative gentility. Generally speaking, the higher up the North's social scale one goes, the more frowned upon are full-throated expressions of militant politics or naked prejudice.
Other sports have had to make much more concrete, and sometimes painful, accommodations with Northern Ireland's new political reality than has golf. The all-Ireland Gaelic Athletic Association, set up decades before the 26 southern counties of Ireland won their freedom from Britain, has always had a clear political component. Its purpose from its conception has been, in essence, to promote distinctively Irish games as a way to roll back the colonial influence of the English.
In recent years, however, the G.A.A. authorities have ended the ban on Croke Park, their gleaming stadium headquarters in Dublin, being used for ''foreign games.'' The Irish rugby and soccer teams have played there. Back in 2001, the G.A.A. ended another ban, on members of the Northern Ireland security forces becoming members.
Progress has sometimes been halting. Trevor Ringland is a former Irish rugby international who ran unsuccessfully as a pro-British Ulster Unionist Party candidate in the last election for the House of Commons in London.
Sport, and the patina of celebrity it leant to Ringland, provided him with an entree into the political world. But it also led the way to the exit. He ultimately resigned from the U.U.P. when its leader, Tom Elliott, held fast to his refusal to attend G.A.A. matches.
Ringland argues that the G.A.A.'s efforts to be more inclusive demand reciprocation.
''To have a leader who was actively promoting not going to a game was just a step too far,'' he said in an interview. ''Tom Elliott is a good guy, and I think he will eventually come around to that direction. But it was a step backward.''
This brings us back to Rory McIlroy.
The neatest, most potent encapsulation of his significance in the land of his birth concerns a flag, but not the tricolor thrown his way at the United States Open.
Atop McIlroy's official Web site sits the flag of Northern Ireland. It was for many years considered an exclusively loyalist symbol, an emblem of raw hostility to Catholics.
At its center is the Red Hand of Ulster. The same logo was once seen as sufficiently bellicose to form the focal point of another crest -- that of the Ulster Volunteer Force, the organization that murdered McIlroy's great-uncle.
For a Catholic to endorse the Northern Ireland flag would once have marked him out as a quisling in the eyes of many. It would have amounted to an endorsement of an entity where religious discrimination was commonplace.
Some still don't like McIlroy's choices. But the grumbles are mostly confined to the shrinking band of irredentist Irish republicans. For the first time, a Northern Irish identity that can be embraced by almost all the residents of that patch of earth may be arriving.
''You can be different things at different times,'' Trevor Ringland insisted. ''Here, there is sometimes the pressure to be just one thing. In fact, most of us are mongrels. You can be both Irish and British. It is not one thing or the other.''
The issues of politics and religion have mattered for a very long time in Ireland, north and south. They have served as badges of pride or belonging for some. But they have felt like traps or prison cages to others.
''When the soul of a man is born in this country, there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight,'' James Joyce had his hero Stephen Dedalus say in ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.''
No individual, least of all a 22-year-old golfer, can dissolve those nets single-handedly. But Rory McIlroy and his generation are making them looser and less suffocating than ever before.
It's no mean feat, and for many of us, it's good enough for now.

HEADLINE: A Yankees Team That Is Powerful, Yet Vulnerable

BYLINE: By BEN SHPIGEL

 BODY:
Perhaps nothing symbolizes the Yankees' successful first half better than a quip made by their general manager, Brian Cashman, on the morning of June 16: ''They got Cliff Lee, we got Brian Gordon.''
The Phillies, who added Lee to their stable of aces, own the best record in baseball. The Yankees, who went bargain-hunting to fill out their rotation, have the second-best record in the American League. Consider their injury-ravaged bullpen and substitute Freddy Garcia or Bartolo Colon for Gordon in Cashman's quotation, and the answer to what seems like a fanciful and patently ridiculous question becomes rather obvious: yes, a team whose payroll exceeds the gross domestic product of some Caribbean nations can overachieve, and without shame.
After defeating the Tampa Bay Rays, 1-0, Sunday, the Yankees entered the All-Star break at 53-35, in strong contention for the A.L. East title, though their long-term prospects would improve if they could, you know, beat Boston. They are powerful but flawed, exciting but aging, and the surprises that buoyed them in the first half could undermine them in the second. 
If the Amazing Kreskin, Miss Cleo and the ghost of Carnac the Magnificent were put in a room with a Magic 8 ball in January, none would have predicted that Bartolo Colon would be the Yankees' de facto No. 2 starter behind C. C. Sabathia, the indispensable ace. All good sense suggested that they would be starved for pitching, desperate for help at the July 31 trade deadline, but the 38-year-old Colon (6-4, 3.20 earned run average) and Freddy Garcia, 34 (7-6, 3.13), have added heft and reliability, fending off the skeptics -- for now, at least. A late-season physical breakdown by either would elicit a chorus of I-told-you-sos, and increase the pressure on ...
PHIL HUGHES, the Yankees' great second-half unknown. His shoulder woes solved, will he regain his form of last spring, when he started out 5-0 with a 1.38 E.R.A., or revisit his subsequent struggles, a 4.98 E.R.A. over his final 25 appearances? A popping fastball that generates swings and misses, a pitch that was absent in his return to the starting rotation Wednesday, is essential. If it comes back, so will Hughes. He would serve as the team's July acquisition. The Yankees need him -- in their rotation, not in ...
THEIR LOCKDOWN BULLPEN, which has been rebuilt roughly every month since December. Two stalwarts, Luis Ayala and Cory Wade, did not even pitch in the majors last season. Ayala rediscovered his sinker in winter ball in Mexico, working with his old pitching coach. Wade, after opting out of his deal with the Rays last month, quickly earned Joe Girardi's trust. Dave Robertson began the season as the fourth right-handed option and developed into an All-Star. Would the Yankees rather have Joba Chamberlain, Pedro Feliciano and Rafael Soriano? Of course. But without them, the Yankees' relievers entered Sunday with a 3.11 earned run average, the second best in the A.L. They owe some degree of thanks to ...
RUSSELL MARTIN, who has offset his meager offensive contributions -- .220 average, .323 on-base percentage -- with a steely toughness behind the plate. If you drew a Venn diagram charting the Yankees' free-agent signings and injured players, the circles would almost overlap: Feliciano, Eric Chavez, Soriano, even Colon. Then there is Martin, whose adjustment to a new league, a new staff, a new city, a new pitching coach, has not befuddled him. Girardi, a former catcher, raves about Martin's blocking abilities, and pitchers adore working with him. Even ...
MARIANO RIVERA, who really just needs someone to hold up a glove behind the plate. At 41, Rivera is averaging fewer walks and more strikeouts than last season, but for how much longer? The Yankees hope that his recent soreness in his triceps does not develop into a recurring problem, as damaging as the meniscus tear that has compro-
mised ...
ALEX RODRIGUEZ's right knee. His power production diminished, Rodriguez is unlikely to record a 14th straight season with at least 30 homers and 100 runs batted in. The tear has also impaired his running, highlighting the perils of relying on an aging roster. Surgery on Monday that will sideline him for four to six weeks will create a void at third base and once again thrust into the spotlight ...
EDUARDO NUNEZ, who has lifted the Yankees to victory and dropped them to defeat. When Derek Jeter was on the disabled list, Nunez played with energy and verve and flair, which the Yankees needed, but was prone to making mental mistakes and base-running blunders, which they did not. He could be their shortstop of the future, but for now he is the utility player of the present, a role that will surely take on greater resonance with Rodriguez's absence. But when Rodriguez returns Nunez could also spell ...
DEREK JETER, provided he has not surpassed 4,000 hits by August. On Saturday, Jeter proved that he still has a sense of occasion, going 5 for 5 and collecting his 3,000th hit on a home run. Once the afterglow fades, the attention will shift back to his viability as a leadoff hitter, a genuine issue as the Yankees pursue a 28th championship. Until last week, his .270 average had been devoid of extra-base power, and his on-base percentage (.330) -- crucial for the run-producers batting behind him -- is worse than last season, when he set a career low (.340). When Brett Gardner, speedy and patient, led off in Jeter's absence, the Yankees glimpsed how dangerous their offense could be. It would have been poor timing for Girardi to consider dropping Jeter down the lineup as he chased a milestone. But if Jeter's struggles resume, Girardi could have an uncomfortable decision to make. Even more uncomfortable than losing a ninth straight game to ...
THE RED SOX, who have dominated the Yankees, winning all six games in the Bronx. If the Yankees, who are 1-8 against Boston and 52-27 against everyone else, finish with more victories, it will mean little. But if they do not -- and if Boston's supremacy continues -- their failures could loom large in the postseason, when, of course, they could meet Boston again. With the Red Sox pummeling right-handed pitching, the Yankees could benefit from acquiring another effective left-handed reliever to neutralize Jacoby Ellsbury and Adrian Gonzalez, Carl Crawford and David Ortiz. Such a move could even prove the difference in a return trip to the World Series and a possible date with Philadelphia and Cliff Lee. Brian Gordon would not be there. The Yankees released him Friday.

HEADLINE: How Seawater Can Power the World

BYLINE: By STEWART C. PRAGER. 
Stewart C. Prager is the director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, a Department of Energy national laboratory, and a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton.

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
DEBATE about America's energy supply is heating up: gas prices are rising, ethanol is under attack and nuclear power continues to struggle in the shadow of the Fukushima disaster in Japan.
But an abundant, safe and clean energy source once thought to be the stuff of science fiction is closer than many realize: nuclear fusion. Making it a reality, however, will take significant investment from the government at a time when spending on scientific research is under threat.
Harnessing nuclear fusion, the energy that powers the sun and the stars, has been a goal of physicists worldwide since the 1950s. It is essentially inexhaustible and it can be created using hydrogen isotopes -- chemical cousins of hydrogen, like deuterium -- that can readily be extracted from seawater. 
Fusion energy is created by fusing two atomic nuclei, in the process converting mass to energy, which appears as heat. The heat, as in conventional nuclear fission reactors, turns water into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity, or is used to produce fuels for transportation or other uses.
Fusion energy generates zero greenhouse gases. It offers no chance of a catastrophic accident. It can be available to all nations, relying only on the Earth's oceans. When commercialized, it will transform the world's energy supply.
There's a catch. The development of fusion energy is one of the most difficult science and engineering challenges ever undertaken. Among other challenges, it requires production and confinement of a hot gas -- a plasma -- with a temperature around 100 million degrees Celsius.
But potential solutions to these daunting technical challenges are emerging. In one approach, known as magnetic fusion, hot plasma is confined by powerful magnets. A second approach uses large, intense lasers to bombard a frozen pellet of fusion fuel (deuterium and tritium nuclei) to heat the pellet and cause fusion to occur in a billionth of a second. Whereas magnetic fusion holds a hot plasma indefinitely, like a sun, the second approach resembles an internal combustion engine, with multiple mini-explosions (about five per second).
Once a poorly understood area of research, plasma physics has become highly developed. Scientists not only produce 100 million-degree plasmas routinely, but they control and manipulate such ''small suns'' with remarkable finesse. Since 1970 the power produced by magnetic fusion in the lab has grown from one-tenth of a watt, produced for a fraction of a second, to 16 million watts produced for one second -- a billionfold increase in fusion energy.
Seven partners -- the European Union, China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States -- have teamed up on an experiment to produce 500 million watts of fusion power for 500 seconds and longer by 2020, demonstrating key scientific and engineering aspects of fusion at the scale of a reactor.
However, even though the United States is a contributor to this experiment, known as ITER, it has yet to commit to the full program needed to develop a domestic fusion reactor to produce electricity for the American power grid. Meanwhile other nations are moving forward to implement fusion as a key ingredient of their energy security.
Indeed, fusion research facilities more modern than anything in the United States are either under construction or operating in China, Germany, Japan and South Korea. The will and enthusiasm of governments in Asia to fill their energy needs with fusion, as soon as possible, is nearly palpable.
What has been lacking in the United States is the political and economic will. We need serious public investment to develop materials that can withstand the harsh fusion environment, sustain hot plasma indefinitely and integrate all these features in an experimental facility to produce continuous fusion power.
This won't be cheap. A rough estimate is that it would take $30 billion and 20 years to go from the current state of research to the first working fusion reactor. But put in perspective, that sum is equal to about a week of domestic energy consumption, or about 2 percent of the annual energy expenditure of $1.5 trillion.
Fusion used to be an energy source for my generation's grandchildren; now, plans across the world call for a demonstration power plant in about 20 years. Fusion has the potential to help with all the emerging challenges of this still-new century: energy independence, national economic competitiveness, environmental responsibility and reduction of conflict over natural resources. It is a litmus test for the willingness of our nation to tackle the tough challenges that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help.

HEADLINE: No, We Can't? Or Won't?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
If you were shocked by Friday's job report, if you thought we were doing well and were taken aback by the bad news, you haven't been paying attention. The fact is, the United States economy has been stuck in a rut for a year and a half.
Yet a destructive passivity has overtaken our discourse. Turn on your TV and you'll see some self-satisfied pundit declaring that nothing much can be done about the economy's short-run problems (reminder: this ''short run'' is now in its fourth year), that we should focus on the long run instead. 
This gets things exactly wrong. The truth is that creating jobs in a depressed economy is something government could and should be doing. Yes, there are huge political obstacles to action -- notably, the fact that the House is controlled by a party that benefits from the economy's weakness. But political gridlock should not be conflated with economic reality.
Our failure to create jobs is a choice, not a necessity -- a choice rationalized by an ever-shifting set of excuses.
Excuse No. 1: Just around the corner, there's a rainbow in the sky.
Remember ''green shoots''? Remember the ''summer of recovery''? Policy makers keep declaring that the economy is on the mend -- and Lucy keeps snatching the football away. Yet these delusions of recovery have been an excuse for doing nothing as the jobs crisis festers.
Excuse No. 2: Fear the bond market.
Two years ago The Wall Street Journal declared that interest rates on United States debt would soon soar unless Washington stopped trying to fight the economic slump. Ever since, warnings about the imminent attack of the ''bond vigilantes'' have been used to attack any spending on job creation.
But basic economics said that rates would stay low as long as the economy was depressed -- and basic economics was right. The interest rate on 10-year bonds was 3.7 percent when The Wall Street Journal issued that warning; at the end of last week it was 3.03 percent.
How have the usual suspects responded? By inventing their own reality. Last week, Representative Paul Ryan, the man behind the G.O.P. plan to dismantle Medicare, declared that we must slash government spending to ''take pressure off the interest rates'' -- the same pressure, I suppose, that has pushed those rates to near-record lows.
Excuse No. 3: It's the workers' fault.
Unemployment soared during the financial crisis and its aftermath. So it seems bizarre to argue that the real problem lies with the workers -- that the millions of Americans who were working four years ago but aren't working now somehow lack the skills the economy needs.
Yet that's what you hear from many pundits these days: high unemployment is ''structural,'' they say, and requires long-term solutions (which means, in practice, doing nothing).
Well, if there really was a mismatch between the workers we have and the workers we need, workers who do have the right skills, and are therefore able to find jobs, should be getting big wage increases. They aren't. In fact, average wages actually fell last month.
Excuse No. 4: We tried to stimulate the economy, and it didn't work.
Everybody knows that President Obama tried to stimulate the economy with a huge increase in government spending, and that it didn't work. But what everyone knows is wrong.
Think about it: Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr. Obama took office.
So what happened to the stimulus? Much of it consisted of tax cuts, not spending. Most of the rest consisted either of aid to distressed families or aid to hard-pressed state and local governments. This aid may have mitigated the slump, but it wasn't the kind of job-creation program we could and should have had. This isn't 20-20 hindsight: some of us warned from the beginning that tax cuts would be ineffective and that the proposed spending was woefully inadequate. And so it proved.
It's also worth noting that in another area where government could make a big difference -- help for troubled homeowners -- almost nothing has been done. The Obama administration's program of mortgage relief has gone nowhere: of $46 billion allotted to help families stay in their homes, less than $2 billion has actually been spent.
So let's summarize: The economy isn't fixing itself. Nor are there real obstacles to government action: both the bond vigilantes and structural unemployment exist only in the imaginations of pundits. And if stimulus seems to have failed, it's because it was never actually tried.
Listening to what supposedly serious people say about the economy, you'd think the problem was ''no, we can't.'' But the reality is ''no, we won't.'' And every pundit who reinforces that destructive passivity is part of the problem.

HEADLINE: An Aggressive Ruling on Clean Air: Tough new limits on power plant emissions will improve lives and save money

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday issued a welcome and overdue rule compelling power plants in 27 states and the District of Columbia to reduce smokestack emissions that pollute the air and poison forests, lakes and streams across the eastern United States. The regulation reflects the E.P.A.'s determination to carry out its mandates under the Clean Air Act despite fierce Congressional opposition, and bodes well for progress on a host of other regulatory challenges the agency faces. 
The rule, which takes effect in 2012, would cut emissions of sulfur dioxide, a component of acid rain, and nitrogen oxide, a component of smog, by more than half by 2014 compared with 2005 levels. The E.P.A. administrator, Lisa Jackson, said the rule would improve air quality for 240 million Americans in the states where the pollution is produced and in areas downwind.
As is true of nearly every regulation spawned by the landmark 1970 Clean Air Act, the rule's benefits will greatly outweigh its costs to industry -- a truth routinely ignored by the act's critics, most recently the Tea Party supporters in Congress. The E.P.A. estimates annual benefits at $120 billion to $240 billion, mostly from fewer premature deaths, hospital visits and lost work days associated with respiratory illnesses.
By contrast, the costs of new pollution controls and plant retirements are estimated at $800 million annually, on top of about $1.6 billion in capital improvements already under way in anticipation of the rule.
There were predictable complaints from industry lobbyists and some in Congress that the rule would impede economic growth. Those groups are likely to be even more critical of the rest of the agency's clean-air agenda.
Over the next few months, the E.P.A. will propose new ''performance standards'' governing largely unregulated greenhouse gas emissions from power plants; issue a final rule mandating reductions in toxic pollutants like mercury; and propose new state and local health standards for ozone.
In addition, President Obama has asked that the agency, in conjunction with the Department of Transportation, set new mileage and emission standards for cars and light trucks manufactured from 2017 to 2025. An earlier round of fuel efficiency standards in 2009 remains Mr. Obama's single most impressive environmental achievement, but he and the auto industry are nowhere near agreement on what the new standards should be.
Taken together, these rules should lead to cleaner air, a reduction in greenhouse gases and, in the case of the automobile standards, reduced dependence on foreign oil. Given the political obstacles, completing all these will be a remarkable achievement. The new power plant rule is a promising start.

HEADLINE: Carmakers' Goals Stretch Credulity

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
The world's carmakers are indulging in pipe dreams again. Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's chief executive, predicted in June that the company would sell 82 percent more vehicles globally in 2016 than last year. Alan R. Mulally, the chief at Ford Motor, earlier projected a 50 percent bump, while Ferdinand Piech, chairman of Volkswagen, is shooting for just a tad less growth than that. If the rest of the industry is as optimistic, in about five years manufacturers will be producing almost 20 million more cars than market forecasters expect will be sold.
In the plans unveiled last month, Nissan and Ford pegged their numbers to 2016 worldwide car sales of around 95 million vehicles, in line with estimates from the likes of IHS Global Insight. Even that is about a third more than last year's 72 million, which set a record for global sales. 
But Ford and Nissan are suggesting they can grow faster than the market -- as is VW, which is probably hoping to hit its 10 million sales goal a couple of years before its official 2018 target.
Aside from believing a subdued American market will recover, Ford and Nissan are both aiming at emerging markets, particularly China, for most of their growth. Nissan wants to increase its market share in China by almost two-thirds, to 10 percent, in five years. Ford also has great expectations in China.
The trouble is, so do most other manufacturers. General Motors, VW and Hyundai won't want to give up their leading positions as foreign carmakers in China. Other western rivals like Fiat-Chrysler want to bulk up as well. And thanks to crisis restructuring, many now have healthier balance sheets and plenty of cash to put to work. Meanwhile, Chinese domestic carmakers are flexing their muscles, too.
Suppose other carmakers cook up similar predictions to the three companies that have made their hopes public. That would mean cranking out 114 million vehicles a year in five years, a fifth more than predictions for the total market by 2016. A couple of manufacturers are likely to outperform the pack, but only at the expense of others. Disappointment awaits for some -- and their shareholders.
Best and Worst Paid
Of all industries, it is real estate that somehow just pushed the limits of executive pay. Last week, Simon Property Group gave David Simon, its chairman and chief executive, shares worth about $120 million to stay until 2019. The company is America's biggest mall owner, co-founded by Mr. Simon's father and uncle. It has rebounded well from the recession, but Mr. Simon already has a fat pay package. Top executives don't deserve extra bonuses just for showing up.
Keeping good managers around is a good idea. Mr. Simon is one such chief -- and, at 49, a relatively young one at that. Shareholders of the company, which is based in Indianapolis, have seen their investment grow nearly ninefold since he took the top job in 1995, weathering two tough recessions.
Last year, for this good work, Mr. Simon was paid $7.1 million in salary, bonus and long-term incentives. An additional $17 million in equity was awarded, subject to the company's performance. This should be enough to keep Mr. Simon cheerfully coming to the office to sustain the legacy of what his relatives built and to keep doing his best on behalf of shareholders.
Certainly the board could have found a cheaper way to keep him. His surname is emblazoned on the company headquarters. And Mr. Simon's family controls more than 11 percent of the equity. That makes the prospect of his leaving Simon Property a conceivable, but not compelling, possibility.
Worse, the company was lax with the details of Mr. Simon's package. For example, if he is terminated without cause, or even if he resigns with ''good reason,'' in less than two years, half the retention bonus shares vest immediately. In such an event after July 2013, they all vest. Simon Property's relocating the company offices by more than 35 miles is among the hardships that would constitute a good enough reason for Mr. Simon to pack up and collect his ''retention'' bonus.
Viacom handed Philippe P. Dauman, its chief executive, almost $85 million last year, making him the country's highest-paid C.E.O. And Citigroup gave its boss, Vikram S. Pandit, a lavish retention bonus of at least $16.7 million over four years atop his standard pay package. Simon Property nevertheless managed to hit a brazen new high, and low.

HEADLINE: The Method To Their Madness

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
The Republican Party's strategy in the debt-ceiling negotiations has baffled centrists and vindicated liberals. For months, the party's leaders have repeatedly turned down deals that would cut spending significantly because their members won't compromise on taxes. To moderates, this intransigence is inexplicable: Are they crazy? To the left, it's all-too-predictable: See, we told you they were crazy!
But there is a method to the Republicans' madness, and it rests on four things they know (or at least sense) about the deficit debate that the rest of the political class often ignores. 
Barack Obama wants a right-leaning deficit deal. For months, liberals have expressed frustration with the president's deficit strategy. The White House made no effort to tie a debt ceiling vote to the extension of the Bush tax cuts last December. It pre-emptively conceded that any increase in the ceiling should be accompanied by spending cuts. And every time Republicans dug in their heels, the administration gave ground.
The not-so-secret secret is that the White House has given ground on purpose. Just as Republicans want to use the debt ceiling to make the president live with bigger spending cuts than he would otherwise support, Obama's political team wants to use the leverage provided by those cra-a-a-zy Tea Partiers to make Democrats live with bigger spending cuts than they normally would support.
Why? Because the more conservative-seeming the final deal, the better for the president's re-election effort. In that environment, Republicans have every incentive to push and keep pushing. Since any deal they cut will be used as an election-year prop in 2012, they need to make sure the president actually earns his budget-cutting bona fides.
Tax increases are lurking just over the horizon. The White House hasn't made spending concessions just because the president wants to campaign as a deficit cutter next year. It has made concessions because it knows that taxes are already scheduled to go up when the Bush-era tax rates expire at the end of 2012.
If Obama gains a second term, Congressional Republicans will have to choose between a deal that lets the top rate go back to 39 percent (a $700 billion tax increase over 10 years) or no deal at all (a $3.8 trillion tax increase). Obviously, this dilemma won't exist if President Mitt Romney occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But Obama's re-election is the more likely scenario, meaning that any deal struck this summer comes with a very large asterisk attached: *Includes tax increases to be named later.
Bipartisan budget deals usually deliver fewer spending cuts than they promise. The grand bargains of the past haven't been as bad for conservatives as right-wing mythology sometimes makes them out to be. As a share of G.D.P., federal spending fell faster in the decade after George H. W. Bush broke his ''read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge and cut a deficit deal with Congressional Democrats than it did during the Reagan era.
But in absolute terms, no bipartisan bargain in the last three decades has delivered anywhere near the spending reductions that it promised. (As The Washington Examiner's Philip Klein notes, by 1995 actual spending was $58 billion higher than it was projected to be when Bush the Elder and the Democrats reached their 1990 agreement.) Bipartisan tax increases, by contrast, always seem to happen as scheduled.
The long-term deck is stacked in favor of tax increases. For decades, the tug-of-war between left and right has kept government's share of the economy nearly constant, around 19 percent of G.D.P. But in what you might call the revenge of Lyndon Johnson, the ballooning cost of Medicare is poised to tilt the debate decisively toward liberalism.
For now, tax increases and entitlement cuts are equally unpopular. But with every passing year, the constituency for letting Medicare grow as scheduled gets bigger and bigger, and the clout of working-age taxpayers diminishes. Already, even a relatively radical proposal like Paul Ryan's budget seems compelled to exempt current retirees from its Medicare reforms. Imagine how the landscape will look in a decade.
These are the realities driving Republican intransigence. Past experience, present politics and future trends all suggest that conservatives should be aiming for the nearly perfect in the current negotiation, rather than the merely good.
But this logic also cuts both ways. Precisely because conservatives have a window of opportunity that they may not have again, there's also a strong case to be made for striking the biggest possible deal -- even if that deal requires concessions that a smaller deal does not.
At the moment, Republicans seem to be moving toward a smaller, purer bargain. Depending on what's being offered, that may be the right course. But self-described ''constitutional conservatives'' should remember that Mr. Madison's ingenious system doesn't just require compromise. Sometimes it rewards it as well.

HEADLINE: On the Road to Better Gas Mileage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama Seeking a Steep Increase in Auto Mileage'' (front page, July 4):
The new standards proposed by the Obama administration to increase the mileage of all American cars to an average of 56.2 miles per gallon by 2025 are important and necessary legislation. The automakers have said this is possible, but are concerned about the cost of implementation, electric filling stations and what the public can afford. 
All reasonable concerns and ones to be mindful of. But reducing our dependence on foreign oil and decreasing greenhouse gases make this legislation affordable even if cars cost more.
It is time for Americans to realize that we must not continue to assume that we are privileged to consume more energy than the rest of the world. Not only are we not that entitled, but our country also cannot afford the costs to our citizens, or to our environment if we wish to maintain our living standard.
CINDY LAY Wheat Ridge, Colo., July 4, 2011
To the Editor:
In the quest for better auto gas mileage, let's not forget the role of the driver.
If every new car included an indicator on the dashboard that reported current gas mileage, it would have a dramatic influence on how cars are driven. Having recently rented a hybrid with such a system, I became very mindful of how my driving habits affected my gas mileage.
The technology is readily available, would not require additional investment by the car companies, and could be made available in new cars almost immediately.
PATRICK BACHLER Wilmette, Ill., July 5, 2011
To the Editor:
When it comes to autos, the differences between the United States and Europe go far beyond fuel economy.
Consumers here and there have differing preferences and tastes. Gasoline is much more expensive overseas. Earlier this year, gasoline in Europe cost about $8 a gallon. At that price, consumers are willing to pay more up front for advanced fuel-saving technologies or forgo size and power in favor of fuel economy.
Energy policies are different, too. Europeans are encouraged to use more efficient diesel fuel; governments tax it 8 percent less than regular gas. Here in the United States, it's the opposite: we tax diesel 28 percent more than we do gas. These policy decisions have resulted in about half of new European autos being diesel, compared with less than 1 percent here in America.
One thing that European and American consumers share is the choice to buy a wide range of fuel-efficient autos that manufacturers are producing. In fact, this year there are more than 160 models that get more than 30 miles per gallon for sale in the United States.
JOHN T. WHATLEY Interim Chief Executive Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers Washington, July 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Regarding a mileage increase to 56.2 miles per gallon by 2025, unnecessarily worried automakers can achieve this gain way ahead of time by sharply increasing hybrid and all-electric vehicle production.
This would speed up technical advances in these cars, bring a larger array of models, permit lower prices and spur production of energy from the sun and wind.
Well before 2025, oil use would deeply drop, and the air would be cleaner.

HEADLINE: Obama and G.O.P. Remain at Odds On Deficit Deal

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Carl Hulse and Gardiner Harris contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama tried on Sunday to revive the chances for a sweeping budget agreement to reduce the nation's deficit and repair its perilous finances, but Congressional Republicans continued to balk, insisting on a more modest deal to avert a default on the national debt.
Mr. Obama, meeting with leaders from both parties at the White House, bluntly challenged Republicans a day after Speaker John A. Boehner pulled back from a far-reaching agreement aimed at saving as much as $4 trillion over 10 years, officials briefed on the negotiations said. The meeting ended after an hour and 15 minutes with little progress, but the two sides agreed to resume talking Monday, and every day after that, until a deal is done.
White House officials said Mr. Obama was still determined to pursue the boldest package possible -- one that would require new tax revenue as well as cuts in Medicare and other entitlement programs -- but he faces steadfast opposition from Republicans and growing qualms among Democrats.
''Congress has to act,'' Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.'' ''If they don't act, then we face catastrophic damage to the American economy, and the leadership, to their credit, and I mean Republicans and Democrats, fully understand that.'' 
Mr. Geithner, noting that the Treasury issues 80 million checks a month, including Social Security payments to 55 million Americans, warned that failure to reach an agreement within the next two weeks could be calamitous. Delivering a version of the lecture he gave to the lawmakers at the White House last week, Mr. Geithner said a default would unhinge financial markets, drive up interest rates, and derail the economic recovery.
Mr. Obama, who arrived from Camp David shortly before the Sunday evening session, appeared to have made headway in at least one regard: lawmakers from both parties pledged not to let the United States default on its debt. That is what the Treasury said would happen after Aug. 2, when the government would lose its authority to borrow.
''Nobody is talking about not raising the debt ceiling; I haven't heard that discussed by anybody,'' the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said on ''Fox News Sunday,'' adding that he had an unspecified ''contingency plan'' to raise the ceiling if the talks fell apart.
Just as Mr. Obama was sitting down with Mr. McConnell and other leaders shortly after 6 p.m. on Sunday, with the men wearing open-collar shirts and blazers, he was asked whether he could get a deal done in 10 days, leaving enough time to draft and pass legislation before Aug. 2.
''We need to,'' he replied.
The problem for Mr. Obama is that Republicans are not budging on their demand that any deal include no tax increases. The administration also needs Democratic lawmakers, but for many of them, it will be impossible to vote for a package composed entirely of spending cuts, especially to popular programs.
In a statement after the meeting, Mr. McConnell's spokesman, Don Stewart, said, ''It's baffling that the president and his party continue to insist on massive tax hikes in the middle of a jobs crisis.''
The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, said she favored a large deal but that it ''must do no harm to the middle class or to economic growth. It must also protect Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries.''
It was not clear that the president would be able to reconcile these positions, especially after Mr. Boehner set a lower bar for a deal that both parties might find more palatable. In a statement issued after the meeting, Mr. Boehner said the leaders should aim for a midrange deal that would build on spending cuts identified in talks led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Such a deal might produce savings of $2 trillion to $3 trillion over a decade.
Mr. Boehner appeared subdued at the meeting, officials said, letting the House majority leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, do most of the talking. Mr. Cantor reiterated his opposition to a bigger deal.
Privately, some in Congress expressed regret at Mr. Boehner's decision on Saturday to walk away from an agreement that they said would have been a rare opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to radically restructure the government's finances, rewrite the tax code and fix longstanding problems with Medicare and Medicaid.
In the end, officials briefed on the talks said, ideological differences over a tax overhaul bogged down the bigger agreement. Mr. Boehner, they said, was open to letting Bush-era tax cuts for wealthy people expire, while maintaining the cuts for middle-income wage-earners. But Democrats briefed on the talks said he made that contingent on rewriting the tax code by the end of this year, so that the loss of the cuts would be offset by lower overall tax rates.
The White House, officials said, was willing to put a deadline on a tax overhaul. But it rejected Mr. Boehner's formula, arguing that it would place too much of a burden on the middle class while protecting the rich.
A Republican official familiar with the negotiations said Mr. Boehner ''would only discuss new revenues if they came from economic growth and tax reform instead of tax increases.'' And he insisted on a ''trigger'' that would set off deep spending cuts and other measures if the tax changes were not implemented before the end of 2011.
Mr. Boehner and the White House, Democratic officials said, also disagreed over the scope of cuts to entitlement programs, with the speaker demanding deeper cuts in Medicare and Medicaid than the administration was willing to accept.
Mr. Obama is pushing for a bigger deal on the argument that it will, paradoxically, be easier for Democrats and Republicans to sell to their rank and file, because they could present it as a historic effort to begin undoing years of deficit spending.
As Mr. Geithner said on ''Face the Nation,'' ''It's not clear that it's easier trying to do less.''
Indeed, the hurdles to even a $2 trillion deal are numerous and significant, officials briefed on the negotiations said. During several rounds of talks led by Mr. Biden, the two sides identified spending cuts, and lower interest payments that would result from a reduction of the debt, which would have saved about $1.8 trillion over 10 years. But officials cautioned that there was never a deal.
Republicans, led by Mr. Cantor, rejected proposals to close loopholes or other tax breaks for owners of corporate jets, oil and gas companies and hedge funds. They said these measures, which would have raised about $130 billion, amounted to tax increases.
The administration has also proposed limiting deductions for high wage-earners, which the White House says would raise $290 billion. But there is little support for that in Congress. And if there are no tax measures in the deal, the leaders say, they will not be able to corral enough Democratic votes to pass it.
Mr. Geithner's warnings about the high stakes were echoed by Christine Lagarde, the newly appointed managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Speaking on ''This Week'' on ABC, Ms. Lagarde said that a default by the United States would cause ''interest hikes, stock markets taking a huge hit, and real nasty consequences, not just for the United States, but for the entire global economy.''

HEADLINE: A Magazine Serves as a Compass To the Conservative Ins and Outs

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Without the soupy South Florida humidity and the fastidiously clipped lawn, the Newsmax headquarters here would be a lot like one of those diners in New Hampshire and Iowa where autographed pictures of politicians cover the walls.
But in those pictures, instead of a short-order cook, the smiling proprietor standing next to Donald Trump, Sarah Palin and Haley Barbour is Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of the small but influential media company that has established itself as a potent force in conservative politics.
Newsmax, the magazine and Web site that Mr. Ruddy founded more than a decade ago, is the right-wing populist's Time or Newsweek. With a paid circulation of 230,000, the magazine reaches more homes than The Weekly Standard or National Review, two of the higher brow pillars of American conservatism, by offering what Mr. Ruddy says is ''news that Americans in the heartland would like to see.''
He and his editors mix cover pieces with articles like ''The Jesus Question: Will He Ever Return'' and ''Heartland Warrior: Michele Bachmann's Passionate Stand for American Values'' alongside items about Ann Coulter's decision to turn down ''Dancing With the Stars.'' 
Among news sites that draw large conservative audiences, only FoxNews.com has more visitors, according to Nielsen, and Newsmax's e-mail alerts go out daily to 3.2 million people.
''I think we're part of the conversation,'' Mr. Ruddy, 46, said in an interview, dropping the names of conservative stalwarts who have paid their respects to Newsmax. ''That's why Boehner -- I met with him when he was down here.''
And: ''Trump realized this,'' Mr. Ruddy insisted. ''He realized the power of Newsmax. We sort of gave him legitimacy.''
And: ''Rush has mentioned Newsmax many times through the years. Many, many times over the years.''
Republicans have good reason to want to reach Newsmax's audience. According to an outside survey of magazine readers, 55 percent of Newsmax readers have made political donations. The average donation amount was $2,930.
''Every major Republican committee has advertised at one point or another using our e-mails or Web sites,'' he said as Fox News played at a low volume on a large flat-screen television a few feet away. ''We're really the 800-pound gorilla if you want to reach Republican donors in the country. We've got the list.''
Mr. Ruddy's path to Republican power player is an unlikely one. He does not declare a party on his Florida voter registration. He has sharply criticized George W. Bush's execution of the war in Iraq and praised Bill Clinton's presidency, despite having helped sow some of the conspiracy theories around the suicide of Vince Foster, a former Clinton aide, with his 1997 book ''The Strange Death of Vince Foster'' (Simon & Schuster/Free Press).
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Ruddy have since had a rapprochement, and Newsmax even put the former president on the cover in 2007 with the headline ''He's Back!''
An autographed copy hangs on the wall in Mr. Ruddy's office with a note from Mr. Clinton that reads, ''I hope this doesn't destroy your circulation.''
''Chris is a masterful networker,'' said Cable Neuhaus, Newsmax's creative director. ''He never stops talking to people on the phone or sending them notes. And over time that has paid dividends. He just keeps networking.''
Newsmax's success -- it brought in $52 million in revenue last year, up from $34 million the year before -- in large part lies in the way Mr. Ruddy has leveraged his politically plugged-in, over-50 audience. Want to reach potential donors directly in their in-boxes? For around $30,000, political campaigns can rent Newsmax's list, giving them in effect a direct conduit to a large swath of the Republican base. Newsmax will then send ''special messages'' from sponsors like Mrs. Bachmann and Rand Paul that allow recipients to donate directly to a candidate's campaign committee.
''You click on it if you're a fan of hers, and then you donate,'' Mr. Ruddy said in his office in West Palm Beach. ''We are the No. 1 leader in this field for candidates and committees.''
Want to move copies of your political memoir? Newsmax will do that directly through its Web site, as it has for Ms. Palin. Copies of ''Going Rogue'' and ''America by Heart'' have been offered free with new Newsmax subscriptions. People on the Newsmax list also frequently receive sales pitches from makers of weight loss supplements, retirement planning specialists and companies that cater to people of faith, like one recently called Medi-Share, a health care cooperative that bills itself ''for Christians who want their health care dollars to help fellow believers.''
And every major Republican presidential hopeful has granted an interview to Newsmax -- almost all of them making the pilgrimage to West Palm Beach to meet with Mr. Ruddy and pose for the obligatory photo. At a news planning meeting recently, editors gathered in a conference room and talked about a recent interview one of their reporters, David A. Patten, had conducted with Mrs. Bachmann. The conversation shifted to another rising Republican presidential hopeful, Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor.
''He wants to visit Newsmax,'' the editorial director, Steve Coz, interjected. ''They're definitely coming through.''
Dick Armey, one of the many leading conservatives who writes an occasional column for Newsmax, said his articles always drew notice.
''That's the audience that I want to talk to,'' he said. ''I run into it all the time around the country: 'Oh, I saw your piece in Newsmax.' ''
It wasn't always this way.
''Five years ago we would have been privileged to have a South Florida mayoral candidate drive by the building and nod,'' Mr. Neuhaus said.
After graduating from the London School of Economics, Mr. Ruddy briefly taught high school in the Bronx and served as an official in the United Federation of Teachers, the union routinely demonized by conservative politicians and commentators.
He edited The New York Guardian, a conservative alternative monthly, before being hired by The New York Post in 1993 as an investigative reporter, where he pursued the Vince Foster case. He wanted to pursue the Foster story further; his editors felt differently. So he left The Post. The conservative financier Richard Mellon Scaife hired him for the right-wing Pittsburgh Tribune-Review in 1995.
He branched out on his own to start Newsmax in 1998 after seeing how the Internet, particularly the Drudge Report, had helped drive the story of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. A friend, Bernadette Casey, daughter of a former Reagan associate, William J. Casey, helped provide $25,000 in seed money.
The staff is now 140 people, large enough to have overtaken several floors in their West Palm Beach office complex. Newsmax's online offerings have expanded into Web video and separate Web sites for financial news and health tips.
Its circulation is growing, a rarity among magazines. Mr. Ruddy credits that partly to the gifts it offers with subscriptions, like an emergency world band radio and a Reagan-themed deck of cards featuring quotes from the former president. The jokers have quotes from Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale.
''We're a business,'' he said unapologetically, ''not an ideology.''

HEADLINE: A Lofty Vision Vs. Realpolitik

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At a private meeting about deficit reduction at the White House last week, Speaker John A. Boehner told his fellow Congressional leaders and President Obama that he did not spend 20 years working his way up to the top job on Capitol Hill just for the cachet of the title -- he wanted to accomplish something big.
So he and the president pursued an ambitious plan that would have reduced spending by as much as $4 trillion over 10 years. It was a transformative proposal, with the potential to improve the ugly deficit picture by shrinking the size of government, overhauling the tax code and instituting consensus changes to shore up Medicare and even Social Security. It was a once-in-a-decade opening. 
But the speaker's lofty ambitions quickly crashed into the political reality of a divided, highly partisan Congress. His decision on Saturday night to abandon the comprehensive deficit-reduction package, citing the White House's insistence on tax increases, was a sharp reversal. It highlighted the challenge he faces in persuading his party to tolerate any compromise on government spending and exposed the fissures within his own leadership team over how to proceed.
Had Mr. Boehner forged ahead with a plan that fell flat with his rank and file, it could conceivably have led to a challenge of his leadership position, and it would certainly have undermined confidence among conservatives in his ability to lead the Republicans. Even opening the door to increased revenues as part of a deal with Mr. Obama and the Democrats struck many Republicans as a profound misreading of what conservatives, in Congress and at the grass-roots level, would tolerate.
Yet in his push for a sweeping deal, Mr. Boehner may also have underestimated the willingness of Mr. Obama to make concessions on traditional Democratic priorities and to challenge Congressional Democrats to give ground on programs like Medicare and Social Security, an approach that put pressure on Mr. Boehner to cede territory as well.
By pulling the plug on those negotiations, Mr. Boehner no doubt reduced the prospect of a messy fight within his party. But he also disappointed those -- including some Republicans -- who had hoped lawmakers and Mr. Obama could defy the odds and deliver a budget deal of historic consequence.
As a negotiator, Mr. Boehner operates in a laid-back style that belies canny instincts honed during a previous run in leadership after the Republican takeover in 1995 and his time as chairman of the Education and Labor Committee.
He has cut deals with Democrats in the past, including the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and he and Mr. Obama hammered out the 2011 spending deal in a showdown in April. Given the rapport he appears to be developing with the president, it seemed they might have a chance to reach a broad agreement despite the tremendous difficulties.
Mr. Boehner had good reason to pursue such a so-called grand bargain beyond the matter of his own legacy. A big deal could have resolved some of the most stubborn fiscal issues, freeing his ambitious majority to take on new matters while giving a lift to the economy and demonstrating the power of conservative Republican ideals.
From one political angle, it had special appeal. By persuading Democrats to endorse Medicare cuts, the speaker could have neutralized an issue that Democrats have been bludgeoning Republicans with since the House budget this spring called for converting that government insurance program into one subsidizing older Americans in private health plans.
But his motivations to back away were evidently stronger. The deal, which required roughly $1 trillion in new revenue, represented a serious political risk for Mr. Boehner, who found himself caught between the push for a legislative achievement and the Tea Party sentiments of his new majority and ambivalence of his top lieutenants.
By all accounts, the agreement taking shape called for closing corporate tax loopholes. And it was linked to a broad tax overhaul that could have left uncertain the fate of tax breaks for the nation's affluent, which are due to expire after 2012. That was going to cause serious trouble with Republicans who are wedded to those Bush-era tax cuts and who consider allowing them to expire equivalent to a tax hike.
Mr. Boehner and the White House were engaged in delicate talks on the timing of the tax changes and how to package the plan so that it could be seen as not raising taxes to gain new revenue. The speaker argued that the tax rewrite would produce new revenues through economic growth and an expansion of the tax base. And he was pushing a legislative trigger to make certain that the tax changes occurred.
But fellow Republicans were not on board. At the White House meeting where Mr. Boehner said he wanted to go big, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, threw cold water on the idea, saying the negotiations should focus on a midrange deal like the $2 trillion one that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had been leading. Those earlier negotiations broke down over potential tax increases as well.
''As Eric has said for weeks, tax increases that the Democrats are insisting upon cannot pass the House and are the last thing Congress should be doing with so many people out of work,'' said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for Mr. Cantor. ''Eric has always believed the Biden group identified between $2 trillion and $2.5 trillion in spending cuts that could represent the framework for an agreement.''
Other Republicans saw the Boehner idea as a political disaster in the making. Not only would it potentially hand Democrats a major victory by conclusively extending the Bush tax cuts for only the middle class, they said, it could cost House Republicans the majority in 2012 by throwing doubt on the tax breaks for wealthy Americans and angering voters who expected them to keep their pledge not to raise taxes.
Mr. Cantor and the speaker had been dancing around each other on the debt talks for a few weeks, and Mr. Cantor's call at the White House for a more modest plan seemed an attempt to put some distance between himself and the speaker should Mr. Boehner get too far ahead of House Republicans. Mr. Cantor does not appear eager to directly challenge Mr. Boehner's leadership, but he wants to be in the right spot if things veer off track for the speaker.
Democrats say that because of Mr. Boehner's retreat, they will now be able to portray Republicans as refusing major Democratic concessions on spending in order to protect tax breaks for big businesses and rich Americans. Whether that works depends on how the debt fight plays out.
But one lesson has emerged: going for the rewards offered by a big deal requires the willingness to take big risks -- and such political nerve seems to be lacking in Washington at the moment.

HEADLINE: Banks Preparing for (and Fearing) Derivatives Rules

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: As regulators hammer out new rules for the $600 trillion derivatives market, the banking industry is collectively spending billions of dollars to comply with the overhaul, according to a new study.

 BODY:
Wall Street is giving a long-anticipated makeover to its derivatives business, a major profit center that played a leading role in the financial crisis. 
As regulators hammer out dozens of new rules for the $600 trillion market, the banking industry is collectively spending billions of dollars to comply with the overhaul, according to a new study by Thomson Reuters. 
But some large Wall Street firms are better prepared than their smaller brethren.
"Our research found that the banks greatly vary in their levels of preparation for the implementation of regulatory changes," Jas Singh, global head of treasury for Thomson Reuters, said in a statement. "The smaller, non-U.S.A. domiciled banks have generally adopted a 'wait and see' approach to regulation, whereas the majority of larger banks are proactively lobbying, planning, prioritizing and building the necessary capabilities."
The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law requires companies to trade most derivatives contracts through regulated exchanges or a new creation known as a swap execution facility. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, credit default swaps and many other derivatives deals must also go through clearinghouses, which act as a backstop in case one party defaults.
The nation's biggest banks are particularly focused on the broad new clearing requirements, said Thomson Reuters, a research firm that also operates electronic trading platforms. 
"Clearing is intrinsically linked to the pricing" of derivatives, said Thomson Reuters, which surveyed dozens of senior managers at top global financial firms for its study. Banks are gearing up to route the complex securities through a collection of new clearinghouses, the study said, adding that financial firms also are identifying which derivatives must be cleared and what information they will need to turn over to regulators. 
Still, Wall Street must wait for Washington to spell out the new rules. Regulators have fallen behind on several rule proposals, as industry lobbyists and Republican lawmakers complain that the regulations could stall an economic recovery. In response, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in June that it would not complete many of its new derivatives regulations until the end of the year, a nearly six-month delay. 
Regulators abroad are taking even longer. Under an agreement at the Group of 20 summit meeting in 2009, regulators planned to require clearing and exchange trading for derivatives by the end of 2012.
Until then, the uncertainty surrounding the derivatives industry has caused some anxiety on Wall Street. Banks, according to the study, worry they will have to put aside additional capital as a safety net and manage an array of new costs. 
Regulators defend the overhaul, saying the new rules will increase transparency in the derivatives market, which has gone largely unregulated for decades. At the height of the financial crisis, the industry wreaked havoc on Wall Street and nearly caused the downfall of the American International Group, which had sold billions of dollars in troubled credit default swaps. 
Thomson Reuters said its own trading platforms would be ready for the wave of new rules by mid-2012. "At a time of regulatory uncertainty we feel it is important to take a lead and help our customers navigate the maze," Mr. Singh said.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Fat, Flat and Falling

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Are you glad you have a partner?

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
Jobs: Ugh!
Unemployment rises to 9.2 percent and weekly unemployment claims exceed 400,000 for the 13th week in a row. The National Federation of Independent Business says small-business hiring in June was "a bust" and another survey shows wages rising (and here's why my kids have jobs this summer). A Bloomberg opinion piece argues that as bad as the employment picture looks, "the official Labor Department figures understate the magnitude of the crisis." A few bright spots: The auto industry, seeing new life, is on a hiring spree. ADP says private hiring jumps. Gallup's job creation index is the highest since 2008. And Harry finally defeats what's his name (oh, come on, as if you didn't know!).
The Debt Ceiling: Working Toward Compromise
Things are getting so tense that President Obama cancels his vacation and gets aggressive in less than 140 characters. Scott Grannis reports an unusual pickup in the money supply. Conan starts car-pooling with staffers. An investor tells us what we need to know and Bruce Bartlett offers five myths about the debt ceiling. Here's one economist who's not so gloomy: "I think what's going to happen will be that the debt ceiling crisis will be resolved without upsetting financial markets or depressing the economy in the near term."
The Data: Flat, Fat and Falling
The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index shows a slower expansion in June. The office market vacancy rate was flat in the second quarter compared to the first. Americans are getting fatter. Factory orders rose in May. Consumer bankruptcy filings fall 8 percent in the first half of 2011. Mall vacancies rise. The Los Angeles Times reports that gas prices are unlikely to rise much more this summer.
The Economy: It's No Joke
Female business owners show cautious optimism about the recovery. Analysts at an investment firm say "hasta la vista, soft patch (PDF): "It's no surprise to us that the Dow has now fully recovered back to where it was when the soft patch started to materialize. Stay long and stay positive, the soft patch is fading into the pessimistic abyss." Kevin Spak says that even in this economy corporate profits are soaring. Meanwhile, Scott Shane reports that small-business owners are working harder for less. Smallbizlabs says the small-business economy is finally improving. An editorial says the stimulus was a joke for small business.
Red Tape Update: I Demand That You Audit Me
The New York Post predicts that in six short months, a new dark age will descend on America. Wayne Crews of the Competitive Enterprise Institute says "a simple perusal of the Federal Register shows over 430 rules costing over $65 billion so far this year alone." Representative Sam Graves says we can't create jobs without lifting the weight of regulations. Holly Sklar and Scott Klinger say that real patriots pay taxes. A business owner loses his fight to get audited. The recent dip in commodity prices could begin to act as a delayed tax cut. Does the United States have the second lowest corporate tax burden in the developed world? According to Ezra Klein this is the most important graph in health care policy: "It shows that we pay more than any other health care system and, to add insult to injury, have ended up with more government than most of our competitors, too." Writing for Forbes, Sally Pipes says the small-business health care tax credits are having a minuscule impact.
Marketing: The Greater Good
Ever wonder what are the top 20 brands on Facebook? A new report says that 22 percent of small businesses use Facebook ads. Doug Ross lists 10 great rules for attracting people to your blog. Rene LeMerle shares her top five free social media automation tools. Roost's survey of small businesses found that almost three-quarters believe social media to be a more effective marketing activity than paid search. Heidi Cohen gives us five ways to improve our social media marketing. For example: "One of social media's unstated rules is the focus on the community and the greater good. If you're only thinking about how to promote the next product or sale, you've missed the point of social media." Michael Fauscette explains the business uses of Google+.
Management: It's Magic!
Jamahl Keyes, the "Magic Motivator," gives some business growth tips. Matthew DeLuca explains how a boss can take a summer vacation. These chief executives have a special advantage.
Success Strategies: Drinking and Puppies Don't Mix
Flying cars are approved by the Department of Transportation. A Toledo small business wins the cupcake wars. A design firm proposes changes to how sales receipts look. Pet stores ban drunk puppy buying. The mobile payments market is expected to reach $670 billion by 2015. The N.F.I.B. celebrates the next generation of entrepreneurs with scholarships. What is the most important question a start-up looking for money should ask? An inventor takes it one step too far. And a little squirrel shows that sometimes you just have to be lucky.
Your People: The Advantages of Not Making Too Much Money
Regina Woods lists five ways to motivate employee bloggers, such as, "Share the results regularly. Hold your bloggers accountable for their work by posting their progress." Entrepreneur's Carol Tice thinks that owners who don't pay themselves too much have an advantage -- "putting their pay on a more even keel with workers. That likely also helps as owners are usually there on the front lines, looking workers in the eyes every day." A guy eats 69 hot dogs. Eric Pages breaks down the 1099 economy: "Based on my experience, I see several segments within the broad category of the 1099 economy: the reluctant 1099ers, the entrepreneurial 1099ers, and the 'gig economy' work force."
Around the Country: Virginia Is for (Old) Lovers
A sandstorm hits Phoenix. West Michigan veterans can get free business training. New York State thinks that fracking can save it. Virginia men live longer than Mississippi men. Austin tops the list of the 50 cities of the future -- but my vote is with Denver.
Around the World: I'm With Switzerland
China raises interest rates. Namibia strikes black gold. The world's youth would rather be in Australia or New Zealand. Britain's best-selling newspaper closes. London has $34 billion of luxury homes currently in development. A Swiss political party tries to ban PowerPoint.
Finance: Hey, I'm No Squelcher
Mortgage applications fall. The Troubled Asset Relief Program makes a $10 billion profit. Office Depot offers a small-business loan program. Time's Roya Wolverson wonders if small businesses will squelch the recovery: "For many economists, small-business lending is the safest gauge of the economic recovery's strength. Too bad it's headed in the wrong direction." Investment advisers' use of social media may spark regulation.
Technology: Keep The Faith In I.T.
Facebook teams up with Skype. New cyberattacks are aiming at small businesses. The software giant SAP focuses on smaller companies. Chief financial officers don't have faith in information technology people, but boards do. Verizon is the latest to end unlimited data. ComputerWeekly has a case study showing how a business can benefit from software-as-a-service. Score's Ken Yancey offers five commonly held beliefs about using technology in your business. Amazon invests big in a data start-up.
The Week Ahead: Trade, Retail, Geekness
A ton of new data hits us this week: Trade numbers, retail sales, producer and consumer prices, inventories and the Empire State Manufacturing Survey. And Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke gives midyear testimony to Congressional committees, once he's done embracing his geekness.
This Week's Bests
Connection Between Small Business And Libya A Harvard professor, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, lists three reasons everything goes better with partners. For example: "There truly is strength in numbers. Lining up others who feel the same way about a barrier or an obstacle makes change more likely. Coalitions lend credibility. They provide cover for controversial decisions, so that you're not a target for retaliation, or at least not alone - a principle used in the air cover around Libya. In Nigeria recently, I was asked what small and mid-sized businesses can do to behave responsibly in the face of government corruption. The answer: Companies should get together and meet with officials as a group. A multinational has decided to take the lead."
Reason To Outsource The Under30CEO gives us four reasons why every business should outsource. For example: "Outsourcing gives you access to experts in fields related to your business. Marketing gurus, certified public accountants, certified human resource professionals, and customer service coordinators are ready and waiting to help you grow your business. Outsourcing puts you in a unique position to stay informed as well as learn and gather information from industry experts."
Marketing Lessons StartupSmart's Jason Rose gives us six marketing lessons in six months: "Lesson four: Don't do everything. You need to set realistic expectations around what you can do from one day to the next and that requires discipline as well as self-confidence. You will inevitably hear what other companies are doing and read the advice of marketing gurus, and the impulse to copy and obey will be immense. But before you do that, work out what is achievable and more importantly what your priorities are."

HEADLINE: Unemployment? Who Cares?

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: To their shame, policy makers have neglected the nation's most important economic problem -- creating jobs -- an economist writes.

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
High unemployment has become the new normal. Two years after the official end of the recession, the monthly refrain of poor jobs reports showing an unemployment rate stalled at about 9 percent does little to increase any sense of political urgency.
The monthly employment numbers, released Friday, were more bad news, showing that for the second month in a row, employers added barely any jobs in June.
The sound of indignation can be heard outside of Washington. Twenty-six percent of Americans surveyed in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll named unemployment the most important problem facing the country (27 percent cited the economy in general).
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other unions keep demanding "Good jobs now!" Progressive think tanks like the Economic Policy Institute carefully monitor employment trends. Many economists, including the professionally prominent members of the Employment Policy Research Network, insist on the need for more attention to the issue. As Till von Wachter of Columbia University put it, "Unemployment is the No. 1 economic problem facing the country today."
Some business leaders have spoken up. Last summer, Andrew Grove, the former chief executive of Intel, wrote a passionate commentary for Bloomberg BusinessWeek calling for a "job-centric" economy.But this is not something the country can achieve with jobs-oblivious politicians. Why isn't unemployment reduction front and center on the policy agenda? More specifically, why has the debate over deficit reduction shoved it aside?
Here are three possible reasons.
First, unemployment is concentrated among the less educated, blacks and Hispanics who lack political or economic clout.
Second, high unemployment is not hurting overall business profits, which have soared to historic heights. In the 1930s, joblessness reduced the demand for consumer goods, idling many businesses as well as workers, creating economic incentives to support public job-creation efforts.
Today, our largest corporations and richest investors are well positioned to take advantage of growing demand in emerging markets far from our shores, whether in the form of increased exports or new investment opportunities.
As a small-business owner explained in a recent Wall Street Journal article, he only sells domestically and does not have the opportunity to "exploit foreign markets that are growing faster."
Third, the jobless individuals, public employees and small-business owners who could, in theory, form a strong political coalition to support more active job creation are constantly subjected to a barrage of arguments that we should do nothing but cut government spending and hope for the best.
A recent Bloomberg BusinessWeek article, for example, asserted, "There's vanishingly little that policy makers can do to create jobs for their citizens." Yet solid research based on analysis of differences in state and county spending shows that some components of President Obama's initial fiscal stimulus were quite effective at creating jobs. Unemployment would have soared higher without them.
A conspicuously large repertoire of more targeted job-creation proposals could significantly lower unemployment, including public investments in energy-saving projects and cheap credit for small businesses (both developed by economists at the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts, my academic home) and increased investment in infrastructure (advocated by the Economix blogger Laura D'Andrea Tyson, among others).
But political interest is low among most Democrats, and Republican governors and Republicans in Congress are pushing to cut unemployment insurance benefits, proclaiming that this would help the economic recovery. I've tackled this argument before, and a detailed critique can be found in this article by David R. Howell, an economist at The New School, and Bert M. Azizoglu, a graduate student there, forthcoming in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy.
On the state level, many efforts to expand employment involve attempts to woo businesses from other states with tax breaks, hardly a process that is likely to increase jobs for the nation as a whole. A fascinating "This American Life" episode on public radio, "How to Create a Job," describes a special government office in Arizona that does nothing but try to persuade California businesses to relocate.
How can advocates for public job creation reach a wider audience? We need to keep making the case wherever and whenever we can.
If you or someone else you know (employed or not) needs some fun summer reading, I recommend the new graphic novel, "The Adventures of Unemployed Man." It describes a heroic search for work that requires an epic battle against the Just Us League.

HEADLINE: Are Jobless Benefits Keeping the Unemployed Complacent (and Invisible)?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Jobless workers may not be living comfortably, but they are at least able to get by. That means they have less need to resort to more radical political activities -- for now.

 BODY:
In an article on Sunday, I wrote about why our unemployment crisis has been largely ignored by Washington. Among the major factors I cited were that unemployed workers are less likely to vote than their employed counterparts. Additionally, the jobless are not as politically organized as they once were because they are more geographically dispersed and because the institutions that organized them have become weaker.
Several readers wrote to me emphasizing another factor that I had nodded to only briefly in the article: that many unemployed people are still receiving benefits nearly two years into their unemployment spell, whereas in the past benefits typically lasted a few months. While jobless workers today may not be living comfortably, they are at least able to get by, meaning that they have less need to resort to more radical organizing.
Some of the community organizers I spoke with for the article agreed with this argument.
"I've been involved with the unemployed since the mid-'70s, and this is the least amount of organization we've seen," said John Dodds, director of the Philadelphia Unemployment Project. "In every other recession it was a major struggle to extend unemployment benefits. This recession came on as we went into the 2008 elections, and everybody was bending over backwards to help the unemployed and offer benefits."That sentiment has obviously changed, of course. Today much of the conversation about unemployment benefits is focused on whether they discourage workers from getting jobs. In some states politicians have decided not to receive additional federal money for benefits because they believe benefits are turning the unemployed into complacent, lazy couch potatoes, thereby delaying job growth. (See my colleague Motoko Rich's article today on how the exhaustion of jobless benefits may actually hurt, rather than help, hiring growth.)
There has been so much skepticism about the utility of jobless benefits that last year Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican, even suggested drug-testing people before giving them benefits.
Over the coming months, millions more unemployed Americans will start losing benefits, partly because states are cutting back the number of weeks people can receive checks, and partly because many people have been unemployed so long that they're no longer eligible for even the maximum duration of benefits.
If people like Mr. Dodds are right, this mass benefit exhaustion may become a tipping point into greater political organization and radicalization of the unemployed, along the lines of what was seen during the Great Depression. As the bread and circuses run out, workers become more desperate, and desperation may lead to more political instability.

HEADLINE: Media Culpa? Coverage of Jobs vs. Deficit

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Readers write to argue that news organizations are responsible for politicians' inattention to the unemployment issue.

 BODY:
I've suggested several different explanations for why the jobs crisis has gotten so little attention in Washington, especially compared to the deficit. In response, a lot of frustrated readers e-mailed me to argue that I'd left out one other explanation: the media. Major news organizations have devoted much more air time, ink and pixels to America's debt concerns than to the 14-million-person army of jobless workers, they argued.
As a reader named Cindy writes:If any of these big media conglomerates really cared about the millions of people that are being tossed like road kill, they would be doing something to help us organize and give us the coverage we need to be heard once and for all.Another reader, Virgil, writes:People hear in the media that it is not that bad out there, so they turn on their friends that are unemployed and call them deadbeats and state that their taxes are so high because they have to pay for those that won't get a job.Complaints about media coverage do appear to be supported by a cursory review of articles from the last two years.In May, the National Journal published a report on economic coverage in the five largest newspapers in the country by print circulation: The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times, USA Today and The Washington Post. They did this by searching for the words "unemployment" and "deficit" (excluding articles that also used the words "Europe," "European," "Greece" or "Greek"). This was not the most scientific (or comprehensive) study ever conducted, but it did show that over the last two years, the number of articles on "unemployment" had fallen while those on the "deficit" had exploded.
One can argue about the extent to which policy makers guide news coverage, and whether news coverage guides policy makers. Whichever way (or ways) you think that relationship works, it appears that both Washington and news organizations have been emphasizing long-term debt reduction over near-term job growth.
That balance may change, though, in light of Friday's weak employment report, and as more workers exhaust their jobless benefits.

HEADLINE: Community College as a Bridge to New Skills

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Vocational training at community colleges can help workers who have lost what were once steady blue-collar jobs requiring only a high school diploma.

 BODY:
The recession hastened a trend that has been under way for at least a decade: the disappearance of jobs paying middle-class wages that required no more than a high school education. 
 On Sunday, I wrote about how vocational programs could help keep students in high school, and in turn, engage them enough to continue to college. 
 But in the course of the recession and its aftermath, many of those who have flocked to community college programs in health care, manufacturing, aerospace, biotechnology and other vocational subjects are those who lost their jobs during the downturn. 
Mark McSweeney, a 34-year-old former welder featured in a report from the video journalists at Purple States, started out trying to improve his skills to find work in a new sector. Halfway through his studies, he lost his job.
 After two years, he obtained an associate's degree in applied science in the metals engineering technology program at Forsyth Technical Community College in Winston-Salem, N.C., where about three-quarters of the students are people who had been working before returning to college. After Mr. McSweeney completed his degree, he landed a job inspecting electronic parts. 
"Individuals that did not have high-end skills were the first to be hit" during the recession, said Gary Green, president of Forsyth Tech. "And they are having the most difficulty in the job market today."Although hiring is still sluggish, those employers who have openings say they often have a hard time finding qualified applicants, because many of the workers who are currently unemployed don't have the skills that employers require.
 Mr. Green said the college's biggest challenge was money. The federal government provides Perkins grants to states to help finance improvements to vocational programs at both the high school and community college levels. Such resources often help technical departments buy new equipment to keep up with changes in industry. But for the fiscal year 2012, the Obama administration has requested a 20 percent cut in funds for career and technical education.
 "Programs that are needed in today's economy are often high cost programs that have high personnel costs for people who have the special skills and high equipment costs," Mr. Green said. In addition to the cuts in Perkins funding, he said, "you are having state budgets being strapped. We're getting squeezed from all sides at a time when, with the right capacity, there are opportunities to put people to work."

HEADLINE: Behind an Unmarked Door, the Party Guests Are in the 1930s

BYLINE: ADRIANE QUINLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Shanghai Mermaid, which has word-of-mouth parties with a cabaret setting, marked Bastille Day.

 BODY:
Late on Saturday night, Marie Antoinette had not yet been beheaded, and it did not look as if it would happen anytime soon. The queen, in a lacy white gown that frothed at her feet, was sitting for a portrait before the artist Toulouse-Lautrec. She sipped a martini, batting false eyelashes long as bird wings. 
Tolouse-Lautrec was actually a student at the School of Visual Arts. Marie Antoinette was portrayed by the performance artist Sequinette. And the club they were in was no Moulin Rouge or wing of Versailles, but rather a 6,000-square-foot warehouse behind an unmarked door in Crown Heights, which hosts the monthly underground costume party Shanghai Mermaid. 
Saturday's theme was Bastille Day. And no one seemed to find it ironic to celebrate a riot that marked the end of decadence with decadence. An aerialist painted his body to resemble the Bastille, a jail. A social studies teacher knitted endlessly, in the spirit of Dickens' Madame Defarge. 
"Here in Crown Heights on this sketchy block, there's some desire for the exotic," said Juliette Campbell, who founded Shanghai Mermaid in 2007 with the idea of recreating the red-walled 1930s cabarets she had always read of. As the recession rolled on, with speakeasies and burlesques becoming mainstream, the party became more popular, settling into its current space in 2009. 
In the spirit of the times, it remains illegal and unlicensed. 
"There's something about the hush-hushness of it," Ms. Campbell explained. "That this is a party behind a roll-out gate." 
There was a dancer from the troupe The Love Show, and there were aerialists swinging from the ceiling. One burlesque artist swirled fans before a sea of tables populated by men in suspenders and women wearing the ridiculously ornate hats known as fascinators. Lee Chappell, a party promoter, stopped a woman dressed in a gold bikini and dozens of necklaces of varying lengths, a look that screamed vaudeville belly dancer. "That's just fabulous," Mr. Chappell, 53, said. "Isn't it fabulous?" 
"There's something about the 1930s," Ms. Campbell said. "That the underground created this grand glamor, in opposition to what was happening in the real world." 
In opposition to the historical accuracy of the evening, digital cameras flashed endlessly. David F. Slone, 43, who wore a top hat and vest, noted that the flashes weren't entirely a-historical, just slightly off. "I should design an iPhone app that smells like sulfur," he said.

HEADLINE: Sheila Bair to Write Book on Financial Crisis

BYLINE: JULIE BOSMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Sheila C. Bair, who ended a tumultuous five-year term as chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation this month, has landed a book deal to give her inside account of the financial crisis.

 BODY:
Sheila C. Bair has landed a book deal to give her inside account of the financial crisis, just as her tumultuous five-year term as chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has ended.
Ms. Bair's book, "Bull by the Horns: What Main Street Must Do To Fix Wall Street," was sold to Free Press, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. It will be published in 2012, before the presidential election.
Martha K. Levin, the publisher of Free Press, said that Ms. Bair's book would stand out as one of the few stories of the crisis told by a high-ranking woman.
"Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of the people from whom we've heard have all been men," Ms. Levin said. "This isn't meant to be a feminist perspective on the banking crisis, but this is the first time that we're going to hear from one of the very few women who was involved at a very high level of the banking crisis."In a 14-page proposal circulated to book editors, Ms. Bair described herself as a lifelong Republican who has become known as someone with common sense and independence.
"I've always tried to play it down the middle and do what I think is right, and this book will capture that spirit," she wrote. "As one who has been 'inside' the regulatory process for the past five years, this book will provide unique access to the power and the problems of the government's financial regulatory apparatus. Drawing from personal e-mails and notes kept throughout the crisis, I will share perspectives on the problems of regulatory capture and the continuing reluctance of bank regulators to fully acknowledge current problems in the financial sector, which are substantial."
Ms. Bair also warned that the United States is facing its most serious problems since the Great Depression, is at the risk of another financial crisis and requires "more forceful action" to stabilize the financial system.
She also said that the book would be laced with personal anecdotes about her role as "the only woman among the principal government players during the crisis" and her relationships with Henry Paulson, Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner.
In 2006, Ms. Bair, a 57-year-old Kansas native, was appointed by George W. Bush to run the F.D.I.C. and was one of the first government regulators to warn of the impending housing crisis.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Ms. Bair was represented by Jennifer Rudolph Walsh, a co-head of the literary department at William Morris Endeavor Entertainment.

HEADLINE: Obama and the Capital Flow Fallacy

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: We don't want inflows!

 BODY:
Obama's press conference wasn't as bad as it could have been; he actually more or less said that stimulus should be sustained, except it isn't politically possible. But he also invoked the confidence fairy - and introduced another fallacy, showing that he and his advisers still don't get the essence of macroeconomics in a liquidity trap:
 I do think that if the country as a whole sees Washington act responsibly, compromises being made, the deficit and debt being dealt with for 10, 15, 20 years, that that will help with businesses feeling more confident about aggressively investing in this country, foreign investors saying America has got its act together and are willing to invest. And so it can have a positive impact in overall growth and employment. 
OK, so that's the confidence fairy at the beginning. But the "foreign investors" thing is actually worse.
Think about it: U.S. interest rates are low; there's no crowding out going on; we are NOT suffering from a shortage of saving.
So if foreign investors decide they love us, what does it do? It drives up the value of the dollar, which reduces exports, which leads to fewer jobs.
Does this sound familiar? It's closely related to the reasons Chinese accumulation of dollar reserves unambiguously hurts the US economy when we're in a liquidity trap. And what we just learned is that the White House still doesn't get it.
Mind you, this failure to comprehend is minor compared with what's going on across the aisle. But it's still disappointing and depressing.

HEADLINE: Using Clawbacks to Punish Bank Executives

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: As it pursues its case against Washington Mutual's former executives, the F.D.I.C. has adopted a new clawback rule for failed banks to reclaim executive compensation.

 BODY:
A common complaint has been the absence of prosecution of financial executives for their role in the economic crisis in 2008, but what is equally striking is the large compensation those executives received while their companies pursued increasingly risky policies that led to the collapse. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has taken small steps to address this issue. It is pursuing claims for damages against former top executives at Washington Mutual, which became the largest bank failure in history. The F.D.I.C. has also adopted a new clawback rule for failed banks that would allow it to try to reclaim two years worth of executive compensation.
The F.D.I.C. is pursuing its case against Kerry K. Killinger, Washington Mutual's onetime chief executive, and two other executives at the bank for risky lending practices that led to its shutdown in September 2008. The complaint alleges they were grossly negligent, negligent and breached their fiduciary duty for undertaking a so-called "higher-risk lending strategy" that increased the bank's exposure to subprime mortgages concentrated in California and Florida, undermining its capital base when the housing market collapsed.
The defendants have assailed the F.D.I.C. claims as a public relations move, asking for dismissal of the lawsuit because they exercised reasonable business judgment in shifting the bank into subprime loans. A brief filed by Stephen J. Rotella, Washington Mutual's former chief operating officer, contends that the case "amounts to a pure public relations stunt designed to deflect criticism away from the F.D.I.C., which has been -- and continues to be -- under fire for its regulatory failures with respect to WaMu and refuses to take any responsibility for its central role in the financial crisis."
A key issue in the suit is whether the executives are protected by the "business judgment rule," which prevents a corporate officer or director from being held liable for poor decisions that end up harming the company so long as the person acted with due care. Chancellor William B. Chandler III of the Delaware Chancery Court summarized quite well how the rule protects executives from judicial second-guessing in In re Citigroup Shareholder Derivative Litigation:
Whether a judge or jury considering the matter after the fact, believes a decision substantively wrong, or degrees of wrong extending through "stupid" to "egregious" or "irrational," provides no ground for director liability, so long as the court determines that the process employed was either rational or employed in a good faith effort to advance corporate interests.
Mr. Killinger led Washington Mutual's corporate strategy to concentrate on subprime mortgages in the apparent belief that as more loans were made, they would actually lower the bank's risk by spreading it across a large base of borrowers. Unfortunately, that approach depended on the real estate market continuing its upward price trend indefinitely, so that when the housing bubble collapsed the bank suffered rapidly increasing losses across its portfolio. 
It is not clear where on Chancellor Chandler's spectrum of bad decisions the high-risk lending strategy fell, probably somewhere between stupid and irrational, but it certainly appears to be something that came within the discretion of corporate managers, no matter how ill-fated it was.
Washington Mutual was based in Seattle, so F.D.I.C.'s suit is governed by Washington State's business judgment rule. If the subprime mortgage strategy was undertaken in good faith and on the basis of some investigation by the executives, then regardless of how disastrous it was there is a good chance the claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty will be dismissed. This would be another example of what the Deal Professor pointed out recently, that corporate executives "have about the same chance of being held liable for their poor management of a public firm as they have of being struck by lightning." Mr. Killinger received more than $65 million in compensation from 2005 to 2008, a significant sum for presiding over an institution that ultimately failed. Under rules completed by the F.D.I.C. last week, the agency can recoup two years worth of executive compensation for banks that fail in the future under authority granted by the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law.
The new rules allow the F.D.I.C. to reclaim compensation from senior executives if they were "substantially responsible" for the bank's failure. An important facet of the rule creates a presumption that the chairman of a company's board, the chief executive, the president and the chief financial officer, or someone removed from one of those positions by the F.D.I.C., is substantially responsible for the bank's demise if the person had authority over "strategic, policymaking or companywide operational decisions." The presumption can be rebutted if the executive shows he or she performed with the "requisite degree of skill and care required by the position." This effectively turns the business judgment rule on its head by requiring the executive to show that due care was exercised, not that the decisions should be protected from after-the-fact second guessing regardless of how stupid it was.
Shifting the burden to an executive to show that this person did not contribute to the failure will be difficult -- maybe even impossible -- because the fact that F.D.I.C. took over the bank goes a long way toward showing that questionable decisions were made.
Unlike the suit against the Washington Mutual executives, which puts the burden of proof on the F.D.I.C. to establish a lack of due care, this new authority means reclaiming two years of executive compensation will be the default option. And the business judgment rule will no longer shield decisions from subsequent scrutiny by the courts assessing whether an executive was substantially responsible for a bank's demise because now the person must show he or she acted with due care.
Stupidity is not a federal crime, which may well explain why there have not been any prosecutions of bank and Wall Street executives to this point. While the business judgment rule protects executives from being held liable for bad decisions under state corporate law, those who work for banks now face a bit more risk of being struck by lightning by the F.D.I.C.

HEADLINE: Repeal Vote Set on Light Bulb Standards

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans want to reverse a measure that required incandescent bulbs to be more efficient. Foes of their effort point out that consumers will save money over all if the rule stays in place.

 BODY:
The House is expected to vote as early as Monday night on a measure to repeal efficiency standards for light bulbs that are scheduled to take effect at the beginning of next year.
5:55 p.m. | Updated The vote is now anticipated on Tuesday.
The Republican-sponsored repeal bill, H.R. 2417, would undo part of a 2007 energy bill that passed with broad Republican support and was signed into law by former President George W. Bush. 
The primary author of the light bulb provision in the 2007 law was Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, now the chairman of the Energy and Commerce committee and the scourge of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Mr. Upton reversed his position on light bulb efficiency late last year while campaigning for the chairmanship of the powerful Energy and Commerce committee. The bulb standard, which does not ban incandescent bulbs but requires them to be more energy-efficient, was opposed by Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and other conservatives as an assault on personal choice.
Mr. Upton said that his support for the original measure had been misinterpreted.
"It was never my goal for Washington to decide what type of light bulbs Americans should use," he said in a statement. "The public response on this issue is a clear signal that markets -- not governments -- should be driving technological advancements. I will join my colleagues to vote yes on a bill to protect consumer choice and guard against federal overreach."
The sponsor of the measure to repeal the bulb law, Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, argues that the new incandescent bulbs, as well as compact fluorescent bulbs and light-emitting diodes, will be far more expensive than traditional bulbs.
"We don't think the federal government should tell people what kind of lighting to use in their homes," he said on Fox News last month.
The repeal measure will be brought up under a House rule that requires a two-thirds vote for passage, and it is far from clear that enough Democrats will join a near-unanimous Republican caucus to ensure its passage. But even if the House approves the measure, its prospects in the Democratic-run Senate are dim.
Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, said that consumer choice would be preserved and households would see considerable savings in their electric bills when the new bulbs are fully in use.
"These standards do not ban incandescent bulbs," Mr. Chu said in a conference call with reporters on Friday. He said the new bulbs look like current bulbs, turn on instantly and can be used with dimmers, unlike some compact fluorescents.
"The only difference is they will help American consumers save more money," he said.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said that the average American family's energy costs would be reduced by 7 percent, or about $85 a year, when the new light bulb standards are fully in place.
In a study released last week, the group said that replacing inefficient old bulbs with new units would eliminate the need for 33 large power plants, lowering electricity costs and harmful pollution.
"Clearly, consumers, the economy and the environment will suffer if these standards are repealed," said Jim Presswood, the group's federal energy director. "It also will send the wrong signal to the lighting industry, which has already started making better bulbs."
One manufacturer of LED lighting systems vigorously defended the new bulb standards, saying they would help create jobs, lower electricity costs and keep the United States competitive with other nations.
"Improvements in energy efficiency can reduce the need for investment in energy infrastructure, cut fuel costs, increase competitiveness, improve consumer welfare and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions," said Jim Haworth, chief executive of Lighting Science Group, a Florida based manufacturer.
"Lighting is the low-hanging fruit in reducing energy consumption: it accounts for 19 percent of the world's energy use," he added. "There are 4.4 billion traditional light sockets in the United States alone, offering a rapid and practical path for billions of dollars in energy savings through the installation of more efficient lighting."
