HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS 

 BODY:
Basic to Congress's rewriting of Federal obligations to help the poor, disabled, sick and elderly are some assumptions about religion and religious organizations in the United States. The new wisdom in Washington is this: Religious institutions, along with other charitable organizations, can provide the nation with a social and economic safety net as well as a moral and spiritual one.
This conviction takes several forms. One envisions that, using voluntary contributions, religious congregations and existing religious and charitable organizations will fill in for much of the aid that, if Congress has its way, will not be provided by the Federal Government. Although the numbers shift a bit every day, that sum would add up to about $400 billion over the next seven years. 
 It is useful to get some perspective on what is involved here. According to Independent Sector, a coalition of not-for-profit foundations and charities, there are 258,000 religious congregations in the United States, from storefront churches to cathedrals, well-enough established to have telephone numbers. Divide that $400 billion among them over seven years. Each congregation would have to generate a little over $220,000 a year.
Remember that more than 70 percent of these congregations have fewer than 400 members (20 percent have fewer than 100) and that their average revenue is well under $100,000 a year.
What about private charities, religious ones included? Since many of them already use Federal funds along with private giving and money from state and local governments, they will probably be doing less rather than more under the new arrangement. Independent Sector issued a painstaking study last summer showing that the new Federal spending limits would mean that many charitable programs would have to increase their contributions by an unlikely 40, 80 or even several hundred percent -- or sharply reduce visits to the homebound, and other services.
But lobbyists for religious charities are being told in many Congressional offices that those charitable contributions would surge with the new budget's tax cuts, especially cuts for the wealthy.
Lobbyists, however, are skeptical. They know, for example, that between 1980 and 1993, when tax law changes produced dramatic growth in the number of people reporting more than a million dollars on their tax returns, the average charitable contribution per millionaire dropped from $207,000 to $108,000.
"Patterns of Generosity in America," a recent Twentieth Century Fund study, found that, through boom and bust, donations to charities have remained at a fairly constant 2 percent of personal income.
"If the level of giving could be raised to 5 percent -- an implausibly high figure," wrote the report's author, Julian Wolpert, a professor of public policy at Princeton, "that would still fall far short of matching" currently proposed cuts.
The study also challenged the notion that lower Government spending leads to higher personal giving.In reality, they follow the same curve: "Where state and local governments are generous," Professor Wolpert wrote in The Washington Post, "donations are highest."
But there is another approach to the role of religion and the safety net that dismisses all these figures as just so much charity-as-usual. Its basic principle was enunciated by Marvin Olasky, a scholar and journalist whose 1992 book, "The Tragedy of American Compassion" (Regnery) was hailed by Speaker Newt Gingrich.
What the author calls Olasky's Law says that "Bad charity drives out good" -- and by bad he means giving aid simply on the basis of need, unaccompanied by religious or moral instruction and without the personal involvement of the aid-giver in the life of the recipient.
Mr. Olasky and his allies see the current abolition of entitlements, reductions in Federal spending rates and the return of programs to the states as the first step toward a sweeping "charity revolution" that will eventually find churches adopting families in need; small groups of people forming religiously based "compassion circles" to shelter and counsel unwed mothers, and addicts and the mentally disturbed homeless being treated with "tough love" and appeals to religious conversion.
This approach anticipates two massive changes in American conduct. One is a drastic reduction in the number of single-parent households, which those in Mr. Olasky's camp tend to attribute almost entirely to illegitimacy. The other is a vast outpouring, from millions of Americans, of personal commitment, face-to-face involvement, out-of-pocket expenses, patient and skillful guidance and huge expenditures of time.
It is an inspiring vision, but is it realistic?
Mr. Olasky says that "journalistic and historical evidence" is on his side: His book argues that 19th century charity workers, armed with the Bible and the work ethic, succeeded where today's welfare fails. To this Mr. Olasky adds his own discovery of "a lot of effective community-based charities."
Representatives of existing Protestant, Catholic and Jewish social services say this is a slim reed on which to overhaul even a seriously dysfunctional welfare system. And one of Mr. Olasky's admirers, Doug Bandow of the libertarian Cato Institute, said, "Certainly there is a risk involved." It is probably the one statement in this debate that no one will challenge.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Benefits From Recoveries In Mexican Peso and the Franc

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher yesterday, benefiting from recoveries in the Mexican peso and the French franc.
The dollar rose in early New York trading after a report showed that the United States economy grew more strongly than expected in the third quarter. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product expanded at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, well above analysts' expectations of 2.6 percent. 
 Currency traders bid up the dollar on the view that strong economic growth would attract investors to American assets. The report was "dollar positive," said Earl Johnson, currency adviser at Bank of Montreal/Harris Bank.
But bond traders saw the report as evidence that the economy was too strong for the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates again this year, and Treasury prices initially fell. The dollar followed the bond market lower, though both bounced back later.
The dollar's rebound was helped by the recoveries in the French franc and Mexican peso and speculation in the market that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia would resign because of his health problems. Political uncertainty in Russia typically weakens the German mark, thus helping the dollar, because Germany is Russia's largest trading partner.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.4090 German marks from 1.3915 marks on Thursday. The dollar edged up to 101.93 Japanese yen from 101.43 yen. The British pound slipped to $1.5765 from $1.5831.
The French franc rose against the mark after President Jacques Chirac ruled out a devaluation of the franc and said cutting the budget deficit was his top priority.
When the mark weakens against European currencies, it usually falls against the dollar, too, as speculators seek all opportunities to sell the mark.
"The Chirac comments this morning helped the dollar stabilize," said Karl Halligan, currency trader with CIC Bank in New York.
The mark was last quoted at 3.4736 francs, down from 3.5180 francs late yesterday in New York.
The dollar benefited as the Mexican peso recovered from a tumble on Thursday. The peso was helped by higher Mexican interest rates, which make bank deposits denominated in the currency more attractive. The dollar, which rose to 7.2350 Mexican pesos from 6.7850 pesos on Thursday, retreated to 7.0650 pesos yesterday.
Changes in the peso's value affect the dollar because of the close ties between Mexico and the United States.

HEADLINE: Doctors Say Yeltsin Will Need At Least 6 Weeks to Recover

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 27

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin's doctors said today that the Russian leader, in the hospital after an episode of heart disease on Thursday, must remain under "close medical supervision" through the end of November but that he is conscious and his condition is stable.
Kremlin officials today canceled a meeting scheduled for Tuesday in Moscow with the Presidents of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia before they travel to the United States to begin peace talks. Mr. Yeltsin has been pushing for a Moscow meeting on Bosnia to underline Russia's importance in the search for peace there. 
 The American and Russian defense ministers, William J. Perry and Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, today went into a second day of delicate talks in the United States about how Russian troops can help carry out a peace accord in Bosnia without being directly under NATO command.
But some Western diplomats and analysts suggested that the Bosnia peace plan is "a house of cards," in the words of Andrew Pierre, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. They said Mr. Yeltsin's hospitalization, which has brought instability and uncertainty in Moscow, could complicate the Bosnia issue.
With decision-making so personalized in Russia, any serious incapacity by Mr. Yeltsin could prevent Moscow from making important decisions on Bosnia or erode the willingness of Serbia, a cultural ally of Russia, to agree to a deal. Mr. Yeltsin has undermined his Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, by talking of replacing him, and few Russian officials will be eager to take responsibility for any decision that will may be viewed as a compromise to Western or NATO interests.
There are also signs of increased warfare in Chechnya, the separatist southern republic.
Officials said today that Mr. Yeltsin had received no visitors in the hospital except for the doctors, his wife, Naina, and his longtime friend and chief bodyguard, Gen. Aleksandr V. Korzhakov.
There was little medical information available today, and it was all filtered through Yeltsin spokesmen. Doctors were quoted as saying that the supply of blood to Mr. Yeltsin's heart "is still unstable" but that "there have been no signs of heart insufficiency up until now."
As the chief spokesman, Sergei Medvedev, interpreted this, "That means the blood pump is working O.K." Mr. Medvedev then added, "I stress 'up to now.' "
Officials have already canceled state visits to China and Norway scheduled for November.
Mr. Yeltsin's second attack in the last four months of myocardial ischemia, an insufficiency of oxygenated blood to the heart, will also undermine any campaign plans he had for the parliamentary elections Dec. 17. Mr. Yeltsin had talked of marshaling forces against the challenge from the revived Communist Party.
The attack also puts his own chances of re-election into further doubt. Presidential elections are scheduled for June.
The December elections now take on added importance as an indicator of the strength of other presidential hopefuls, like Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin; a former general, Aleksandr M. Lebed, and a liberal economist, Grigory A. Yavlinsky, all of whom are leading political parties into the parliamentary vote.
Diplomats and analysts suggested that despite Mr. Yeltsin's efforts to preserve his political clout by keeping open a bid for re-election, this second bout of heart trouble will be harder to shrug off politically.
"There are a lot of people today who will be recalculating their political positions," one diplomat said. "It's important to keep an eye on the relations between the Yeltsin entourage and the Chernomyrdin Government, to see if anyone's edging that way."
If Mr. Yeltsin suffers prolonged incapacity or dies, Mr. Chernomyrdin becomes Acting President and must call new presidential elections within three months.
When Mr. Yeltsin appears hearty, his loyalists have worked to undermine Mr. Chernomyrdin's political position. But if Mr. Yeltsin cannot run again, they may quietly edge toward Mr. Chernomyrdin -- or to another political heavyweight, like Mr. Lebed's ally, Yuri Skokov -- as a bet on the country's future stability.
Mr. Medvedev and the doctors, led by Sergei P. Mironov, the chief Kremlin doctor, gave no information about what kind of treatment Mr. Yeltsin is getting, other than calling it "active therapy." They did say Mr. Yeltsin had never lost consciousness and retains control of Russia's nuclear launch codes.
Diplomats from three countries said their private briefings from Russian officials had produced no further information on Mr. Yeltsin's condition. Doctors have never explained what kind of treatment they provided Mr. Yeltsin in July, when he had his first episode of ischemia (pronounced iss-KEE-mee-ah).
"Proceeding from the adopted measures of treatment, physicians believe that through the end of October and all through November, Yeltsin must remain under close medical supervision," said a statement from the President's press service.
Mr. Medvedev implied that medical supervision need not take place in the Central Clinical Hospital, which is supervised by the Kremlin. But it may mean that Mr. Yeltsin will go to work at a slower pace outside the Kremlin, perhaps at the Barvikha sanatorium, where he recuperated in late July.
Mr. Medvedev did complain about the abundance of "rumors and inventions" in the Western press about Mr. Yeltsin's condition. "I assume these rumors are used in both political and financial games," he said, referring to currency speculators.
Some legislators speculated that Mr. Yeltsin's illness might be used as a pretext to postpone the December and June elections, and others called for experts outside the Kremlim to examine the state of the President's health.

HEADLINE: Clinton Enters Battle Over Telecom Bill

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
President Clinton personally entered the battle over telecommunications today, attacking numerous features in the bill now pending before a House-Senate conference committee. At the same time, his top economic adviser emphasized the Administration's threat to veto the measure.
In a letter to Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina and ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, Mr. Clinton attacked four major sections of the measure: 
 *Provisions that allow the regional Bell companies to enter the long-distance telephone business without needing specific approval from the Justice Department.
*The deregulation of cable television rates.
*Permission for telephone companies to buy up to 49 percent control of local cable television companies.
*Provisions that greatly relax restrictions on the ability of a company that already owns a newspaper to own television stations and radio stations in the same city.
Meanwhile, in an attempt to counter rumors that the Administration would limit its fight to issues about media concentration and cable television prices, the President's chief economic adviser, Joseph Stiglitz, said he would strongly urge a veto unless the bill that finally passes contained tighter restrictions on letting local telephone companies enter the long-distance market.
Both the House and Senate have passed roughly similar bills that would each overhaul the nation's telecommunications laws and are intended to deregulate the telephone, cable television and broadcasting industries.
In recent weeks, many lawmakers and lobbyists have speculated that the Administration would not pick a real fight over the issues of telephone deregulation, which are far more impenetrable to voters than provisions that allow companies to greatly expand the number of television and radio properties they own.
"I want to denounce the idea that telephone issues are not important," Mr. Stiglitz, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview today. "They are important -- so important that I would urge a veto unless they are fixed. In terms of long-term economic impact, this is where the action is."
Both bills would allow the regional Bell companies to enter the long-distance market, from which they have been barred since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, once they meet a "checklist" of requirements to open their networks to competition in the local market.
The Bell companies argue that they must be freed, because their traditional monopolies are under increasing attack from cable television operators, long-distance carriers and other competitors. But more than 99 percent of all local telephone lines, particularly those for residential customers, still go through traditional telephone companies.
Mr. Stiglitz said he would recommend a veto even if the final bill resolves all the Administration's objections about media and cable television issues.
The broad goal of the legislation, which the Administration supports, is to overhaul the nation's communications laws and encourage greater competition among local telephone, long-distance and cable television industries.
But the bill, as it has passed both the House and Senate, goes further and greatly relaxes a host of other restrictions on the number of media properties a single company can own; it also would largely deregulate cable television prices.
The dispute between local and long-distance companies, although it generates far less interest among voters, almost certainly involves the greatest amount of money. The local telephone business represents roughly a $100 billion market, while the long-distance business generates about $70 billion a year.

HEADLINE: Life in Iowa May Not Have Changed, But the Political Turf Is Another Story

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: SIGOURNEY, Iowa, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Iowa is still flat and friendly, and people here still treasure their pork tenderloin sandwiches. But a lot of other things have changed since Senator Bob Dole of Kansas defeated George Bush, then the Vice President, in the 1988 Iowa caucuses -- the last time this often-influential state witnessed a keenly contested Presidential race among Republicans.
Madison County and the town of Winterset have become tourist attractions because of the book and film they inspired. The state's economy has gone from bust to boom, the religious right has seized control of the Iowa Republican Party, and the moderates who used to dominate it have lost most of their influence. 
 "The right has taken over Des Moines, they've taken over the party apparatus," said Michael Gartner, editor of The Ames Tribune and former president of NBC News. "They're not cheating or doing anything wrong. They're not anti-Semitic or racist. They just feel strongly about the issues. They're like Big Labor in the 1940's: they get out and work at it, while most other people stay home."
In 1988, Pat Robertson finished second with a quarter of the vote, well ahead of Mr. Bush, thanks to evangelical Christians and their allies. He ran especially well here in southeastern Iowa. Since then, Iowa has moved more rapidly to the right than the nation as a whole. Yet it is not clear what kind of effect the changes will have on the campaign for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination, which opens with Iowa's idiosyncratic caucuses on Feb. 12.
Although neither of them is a true soulmate of the religious right, Mr. Dole by all accounts retains a sizable lead, and his potential rival, Colin L. Powell, the retired general, has better prospects than one might expect.
This time, no candidate has been able to monopolize the religious right's support the way Mr. Robertson did. If the conservative vote splits, that could give General Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, an opening. In addition, some evangelicals rather surprisingly say that they want so desperately to beat President Clinton that they might end up supporting the general.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas has gained ground since finishing in a virtual dead heat with Mr. Dole in a straw poll on Aug. 19 and adding appeals on abortion and school prayer to his original message of economic conservatism. Patrick J. Buchanan, the commentator, who finished a solid third in the straw poll, also has evangelical support, but his message is too "hot" for many other voters.
The other candidates seem not to have made much headway, though Lamar Alexander and Malcolm S. Forbes Jr. are already running television advertisements.
Because Iowa is viewed by many analysts as Mr. Dole's backyard, he would probably be deeply wounded by losing or winning unimpressively here. A strong second- or third-place showing by Mr. Gramm or another candidate, on the other hand, could propel that candidate into the thick of the battle.
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts finished third here in 1988, close behind Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, both from neighboring states, and went on to win the Democratic nomination; Senator George S. McGovern of South Dakota did the same in 1972 after running second to Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine.
Once considered a shoo-in, Mr. Dole has been slipping lately, dropping to 40 percent support in late September in the Iowa Poll from 57 percent last May. Mr. Gramm rose in that period to 18 percent from 11 percent.
Local experts think Mr. Dole could fall short of the 38 percent he attracted eight years ago, running against an incumbent Vice President who had held office for almost eight years, or perhaps even lose. Worries about the religious right in Iowa are one big reason the Senator, a pragmatist in the past, has been trying hard to grow ideological stripes.
"Dole's been around a long time," said Marlene Elwell, who organized the forces that defeated the proposed Equal Rights Amendment in Iowa, and who played a crucial role in Mr. Buchanan's campaign until quitting a few weeks ago in a strategy dispute.
"He's a compromiser," she said. "If he can avoid taking a stand on abortion and the other social issues we care about, he'll do it, and the conservatives know it."
But Mr. Dole has the backing of most of the Republican establishment, including Gov. Terry E. Branstad, who has not made a Presidential endorsement in his 13 years in office, and Senator Charles E. Grassley. He has recruited Steve Scheffler, a former executive director of the Christian Coalition, as a full-time organizer, helping to offset a coup by Mr. Gramm in hiring Marlys Popma, another highly regarded operative with close ties to the anti-abortion movement here.
"People in this state have known Bob Dole for a long time," Governor Branstad said in an interview in which he predicted a clear-cut Dole victory. "He's a small-town Midwesterner who has been our champion on agriculture, ethanol and other issues. He knows Washington, knows how to get things done, but he hasn't forgotten where he comes from."
After the straw poll, Mr. Dole dismissed his campaign manager and promised to change his schedule to spend much more time here. The race seems his to lose. But the Iowa Poll shows his backing to be perilously soft; three-quarters of his supporters said they could be persuaded to vote for another candidate.
For General Powell, who has emerged in recent weeks as a potentially powerful nominee, the state would seem at first glance to be an inauspicious place to begin his quest if he decides next month to seek the Republican Presidential nomination. Unlike primaries, the Iowa caucuses are mostly about organization, and it is already late in the day.
"Pete Wilson tried to put something together starting last May," said Brian Kennedy, the state Republican chairman, "and he couldn't do it. You need to line up the regional leaders and precinct organizers. No one's left."
Then there is the religious right, whose recent successes are hard to overstate. The evangelicals managed this year to drive a longtime member off the Des Moines school board after he acknowledged that he was a homosexual. Once outsiders, they have moved into many important party positions. For example, Sharon Rexroth of Burlington in southeastern Iowa, who eight years ago was just learning the rudiments of political organizing as a supporter of Mr. Robertson, is now a Republican county chairwoman and a member of the state party committee.
Some of the religious conservatives agree with Ms. Elwell, who said that General Powell "stands for almost nothing that we have stood for."
In Paris two weeks ago, the general said he shared many of the values of the religious right, like in the importance of the family, but he added, "I won't go so far as to advocate, as they do, amending the Constitution to allow prayer in the schools or ban abortion."
Hardly red meat for the religious right. But Ione Dilley, president of the Christian Coalition, said her view of General Powell was changing. On abortion, she said, "he's not as pro-choice as he sounded at first, and on other things dear to our hearts, like no homosexuals in the military, he's O.K., so I think we'll have to wait and see what happens."
"He needs to come out here and talk issues," she said.
Ms. Rexroth says her mind remains completely open.
"I like Colin Powell," she said. "I don't think any American can fail to admire what he's done for our country. I disagree with him on abortion, of course, but that's not the only issue. We know he's a leader. Above everything else, I want to beat Bill Clinton, and he may be the man who can do it."
If General Powell decides to run as a Republican and to campaign here, said Mr. Kennedy, the state chairman, he "doesn't want to be drawn into a detailed discussion about Medicare or the social issues, because he's not where the heart of the party is." But Mr. Kennedy added: "We need to go after Clinton on leadership and character in the fall. That's what Powell has to offer, and that's what he should talk about in Iowa."
The hope would be that General Powell's undoubted charisma would draw people to the caucuses who usually do not attend. About half of the 130,000 people identified by pollsters as likely participants in the Republican precinct meetings describe themselves as deeply conservative, and about a third, or 40,000, call themselves "born-again" Christians. But there is also a pool of at least 50,000 Republicans who, so far, say they see no compelling reason to take part.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Slide, Then Rebound

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Weighted down by concern over signs of a still-robust economy, but buoyed by expectations that a Federal budget agreement would eventually be reached, bond prices swung widely and ended mixed yesterday in heavy trading.
A morning selloff was prompted by the Commerce Department's report that gross domestic product was up at a 4.2 percent annual pace in the third quarter, far higher than the 2.6 percent that economists had expected. 
 "The number was a surprise," said Gary R. Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, "and therefore brought on a strong reaction from the market," which feared that the news might keep the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates again.
But while the numbers showed widespread strength in the economy, there was nothing to suggest an immediate acceleration in inflation, Mr. Thayer said, so the market began to turn around as traders and investors refocused on budget matters in Washington.
In addition, a mini-rally occurred as traders who had misjudged and sold Treasury securities short -- that is, sold borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices and thereby pocket the difference -- began to cover their short positions by buying back the securities to limit their losses.
Traders said the short-cover rally caused a turnaround for the 30-year bond, which had been trading as much as three-quarters of a point lower. The bond registered a gain of just over half a point on the day. The 30-year bond rose 18/32 , to a price of 107, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.35 percent, from 6.39 percent on Thursday.
In futures trading, which affects the cash market, the December bond contract settled at 11628/32 . The high for the session was 11630/32 and the low was 1159/32 .
The economy's growth will remain moderate but still good, Mr. Thayer predicted, though growth will be slower this year than last. He said the risk of a recession was still low and that the Fed would probably hold to its current policy on interest rates. "If they cut rates on a budget accord, it is likely to be a token move," he said. "Going into the election next year, it is not clear whether the accord will hurt the economy in 1996; therefore, it's probably premature for the Fed to aggressively cut rates."
Other economic reports yesterday included the University of Michigan's final consumer confidence reading for October. The figure was revised slightly downward, to 90.2 from a preliminary figure of 90.4.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said of the report on gross domestic product, "While the Fed cannot acknowledge anything publicly, I am sure that their feel about the numbers this morning is the same as mine -- that is, you don't take these numbers with a grain of salt; you take them with a ton of salt.
"The fact remains that the next time we see a G.D.P. release it will be on the new chain-weighted basis," he said, referring to a new method of measuring growth. Under that system, he said, G.D.P. growth was seven-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter and 3 percent in the third quarter, or an average of 1.9 percent.
"My feeling is that the economy is very likely growing at, or near that pace in the fourth quarter as well," he said. "As a result, I continue to think that the Fed will ease at its December meeting, because not only does the nonthreatening inflation picture give them latitude, but the less-than-booming economy could prompt them as well."
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said, "At first glance, the 4.2 percent rise in G.D.P. should have been enough to send the market sailing off a cliff, and most people tried to play it that way."
He said traders found it difficult to rationalize selling further, however, because the market fell so sharply out of the chute. "The late-day rally portrays the appearance of some larger investors making the play that bonds remain in a trading range," he added. "Clearly, the potential for further gains is limited by fears that the budget process could fail."

Showalter's Chair Barely Cold as Torre Emerges

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Bob Watson, only a few days into his new role as the Yankees' general manager, said today that he had a list of candidates for the club's newest vacancy, the manager's job, but the search may start and end with Joe Torre.
Watson, charged by George Steinbrenner with finding a successor to Buck Showalter, said he would look for a man with major league managing experience, "maybe someone who possibly has won a divisional title." 
 "There's some of them out there," Watson said, speaking by telephone from his home in Houston.
Sparky Anderson is one, and Gene Lamont is another. But in the Yankees' context, Torre fits that description best.
"I have not mentioned his name, but it's a good name," Watson said. "He's a friend. He's a manager who is unemployed. I don't know if he wants to work again. I haven't talked to him."
Torre, who was fired as the St. Louis Cardinals' manager in June, said he had not heard from Watson or anyone else with the Yankees, but he was prepared to listen when they called.
"I'd be interested in managing," Torre said from Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., where his scheduled round of golf was rained out. "After St. Louis, I said I wouldn't go around interviewing for managing jobs. But I would listen if someone wanted to talk to me. You can't say I wouldn't like to manage because you've done it your whole life. It's competitive."
Watson's search comes in the wake of conflicting versions of Showalter's departure. In a release issued by the Yankees on Thursday night, Steinbrenner said Showalter had rejected an offer for a new two-year, $1.05 million contract and had said he would not return next season.
Showalter, after hearing the owner's view, said he never resigned but only rejected the offer in the context of negotiations. Showalter reiterated his position today.
Asked if he thought that by rejecting the offer he was merely negotiating and not resigning, he said, "That's the way things are usually done, aren't they?"
Did he resign, or ever say the word? "Heavens, no," he said by telephone from his home in Pensacola, Fla. "I was hopeful to the end that something would work out."
Finally, the now former manager was asked, if this was a misunderstanding, did he think it was a door that could be reopened?
"Yes," he said, "but it's got to be by him. He made an offer, and I turned it down because of the way it was constructed. If he is willing to change it, I'm willing to listen."
But Steinbrenner, who has been busy with his son's wedding Saturday, has not appeared to be inclined to rekindle talks with the man who managed continuously for him longer than any of his 19 other managers.
Arthur Richman, a senior adviser to Steinbrenner, signaled that stand today by saying: "I put out that release. Why would I write it if I didn't hear it? He said he didn't want to negotiate with him, didn't want to meet with him, didn't want to return."
Watson appeared to be surprised upon hearing Showalter's version of his telephone conversation with Steinbrenner. But Watson said he would not attempt to contact Showalter.
"I'm honoring Mr. Steinbrenner's request to let him handle that, and that's what we're going to do," the new $350,000-a-year general manager said. "It wouldn't be fair to me or Buck or Mr. Steinbrenner to get in on the tail end of something. I was never involved in it."
But he will be involved in the selection of a new manager, Watson said. He said he could begin interviewing candidates as soon as this weekend.
"It is paramount to look for someone with experience," Watson said. "Just given the setting of the New York Yankees, if we were not in the mode of trying to win, if we were going to do a rebuilding job, I'd look for a different type manager. But the statement of 1996 is we want to win."
The Atlanta Braves won the National League West championship in 1982 under Torre. He also managed the Braves in 1983 and '84. Previously, he managed the Mets from 1977 through 1981 and subsequently managed the Cardinals from 1990 until last June 16.
Interestingly, Torre was approached about the Yankees' general manager's vacancy before Watson. He met with Gene Michael about the job last week in Tampa, Fla., but said, "It didn't seem to work."
"I interviewed a number of years ago in St. Louis when Dal Maxvill got the job," Torre said. "It never entered my mind then to be a general manager. Basically I'm not willing to do the job. If I manage, I always want to have a say about things. As general manager, you get paid to say things."
Torre and Watson are old friends. Watson played for Torre in Atlanta.
"We talked quite a bit," Torre said. "He was my unofficial hitting coach. Our views are similar. Then we talked a lot when I went into Houston."
Torre, who was a television commentator on baseball games between his last two managerial jobs, returned to that role after the Cardinals fired him. He said his agent has been exploring television possibilities for next season.
Torre cited an interview he once did with Hank Stram to explain his feelings about managing and broadcasting. Stram, a football coach turned announcer, said, "When you leave the broadcasting booth, you're not sure if you've won or lost."
Watson declined to discuss a wide range of possible candidates, but when asked specifically, he offered views on two:
*Sparky Anderson. "That's something we would talk about. We would consider Mr. Anderson."
*Chris Chambliss. "Chris would have an in because he was a Yankee. Chris has a lot of big moments in Yankee history. He's a guy who has stated he would like to manage. I'd have to sit down and interview him. I haven't talked to him about managing for a long time."
Anderson resigned from his job with the Detroit Tigers the day after the season ended and has been mentioned for the vacancy in Cincinnati. Chambliss has managed in the minor leagues and was a coach under Torre in St. Louis.
Showalter won't technically be unemployed until his contract expires Tuesday. The prevailing view in baseball is that he will wind up managing the Tigers.
Asked if he had heard from the Tigers or any other club, Showalter said: "No, that's illegal and unethical. I'm still under contract with the Yankees."

Good Night, David

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
To me, a fledgling news junkie growing up in Washington in the 50's and 60's, they were unmistakably giants. David Brinkley, who happened to live around the corner, turned TV news into a compulsory nightly ritual by bringing wit and skepticism to a trade in which most of the competitors sounded like ham actors auditioning for the role of Moses. Ben Bradlee, rising from the ashes of Camelot, refurbished a newspaper worth reading mainly for its comics with peppery new urban voices who finally woke up Washington's sleepy provincial culture. And Watergate was still to come.
Hard to believe that both these vital men have now reached the valedictory stage that requires full-dress memoirs. Their charming new books -- the eponymous "David Brinkley" and Mr. Bradlee's "A Good Life" -- are as idiosyncratic as their authors, especially when professional autobiography gives way to personal preoccupations (wives for Mr. Bradlee, taxes for Mr. Brinkley). The occasional overlaps are revealing, too, whether it's their mutual detestation of Joseph McCarthy, affection for Barry Goldwater or surprise at the posthumous revelations of President Kennedy's sex life. 
 But the most important congruity of the two books is their recipe for journalistic integrity and excellence. "There is no other way," Mr. Brinkley writes, than to rely on "the editor's personal judgment." Or, as Mr. Bradlee puts it, "Editors choose." The Washington Post would never have exposed a criminal White House if he had not made his then-lonely judgment that a "third-rate burglary" was a story worth pursuing, and if he had not received what he calls "state-of-the-art support" from his publisher, Katharine Graham, in the face of extraordinary official pressure to shut the investigation down.
What Mr. Bradlee and Mr. Brinkley don't talk about, however, is whether the independent journalistic spirit they celebrate and embody will continue to flourish. "It is no accident that the best newspapers in America are those controlled by families to whom newspapering is a sacred trust," Mr. Bradlee writes -- leaving mercifully unstated the fact that so many of the major papers fitting that description have folded (or been folded into chains) that the survivors can be counted on the fingers of one hand. For his part, Mr. Brinkley had the good fortune to complete his book before ABC News, his supportive journalistic home for the final chapter of his career, was betrothed to Disney.
The erosion in their old journalistic landscape doesn't end there. The proposed merger of Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting will further reduce the nation's store of truly independent news organizations. So will the telecommunications bill now emerging from Congress; in the House version of this deregulatory windfall, a single media company could end up controlling the TV, radio and print news outlets in the same market.
Even assuming that these new mega-media monsters are run by people of the caliber of, say, Katharine Graham -- a highly optimistic assumption -- they still may spell the end of journalism as Mr. Bradlee and Mr. Brinkley knew it. Media corporations this vast tend to speak in a bland, cautious voice that sounds more like "Headline News" than David Brinkley. And because these companies have so many more economic interests whose fate depends on the kindness of politicians -- whether in Washington or those ever-proliferating foreign markets -- they may be less likely to let their relatively puny (and low-profit) news divisions rock the boat. Indeed, such self-interest may explain why the mega-media's coverage of the telecommunications bill itself has been so spotty that few Americans understand its momentous implications.
Other journalistic conflicts of interest, meanwhile, pile up in exponential relation to media mergers. Will Rupert Murdoch's Fox News cover Newt Gingrich aggressively? Will Time Warner publications or CNN flush out Michael Milken's role in their proposed union? Will ABC take the investigative lead the next time its new parent company cozies up to state legislators to promote a scheme like Disney's America?
Don't hold your breath, especially after the current generation of executives at these corporations is gone, taking with it any institutional memory of journalistic independence. The end of the Bradlee-Brinkley era may be only the beginning of a spell of bad news.

Failure Under The Gun

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
O.K., this was going to be a brilliant disquisition -- no, I'm not sure what disquisition really means -- and who cares? I'm too upset to care. Anyhow, disquisition feels right here.
Disquisition, inquisition, quisition -- whatever -- that's what this was to be. It was half written on Number One Computer. It's still in there somewhere. In Number One Computer, the big Number One, with beautiful colors, ringing bells, all that Windows junk. Useless. Useless, useless, useless. 
 "What's it all about, Alfie?"
It's about what it was going to be about. It was going to be about the new hard-nosed labor policy being promised by the new leader of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
It was going to be wonderfully thoughtful, stuffed with trenchant economics thoughts, with highly doubtable generalizations, with poignant thoughts about the human heart.
There were going to be many delightfully constructed long sentences, demonstrating that just because you're a journalist it doesn't mean you can't write just as flowery as Henry James --
" 'Flowery' won't do, Alfie. Not if you're going up against Henry James. 'Flowery' is an adjective, and you need an adverb. The Master would never have misused an adjective as an adverb."
All right, all right already. Make it flowerly. Just because you're a journalist doesn't mean you can't write as flowerly as Henry James. So what happens? I'll tell you what happens. What happens is this idiotic, selfish, useless Number One Computer --
"Before lapsing into incoherent rage, perhaps you would tell us what your half-written column about the new labor militancy was going to say."
What are you, dense or something? What do you think it was going to say? It was going to say what a good column ought to say. Namely, that while new labor toughness might be a blessing for America, it might also be a disaster, but only time would tell.
"Surely you're joking. That's all it was going to say? That only time would tell?"
Look, it was only half finished. How do I know what it might have said at the end? It might have said something brilliant. How do I know what it was going to say when I couldn't even finish writing it? Just look at that computer. I can't even see the half that's already written.
"It certainly looks like a computer determined not to reveal any of its contents. Those 20 vertical white stripes, each with 25 pink little symbols that might be the letter 'L,' look less like a disquisition on labor than like a rather nasty piece of wallpaper."
I hate that computer.
"Please, please! Not another sneer at the computer. You know it generates all that hate mail from persons who adore their computers and point out that, fortunately, computer haters like you will soon all be dead."
I spit in the milk of the computers of such people.
"A joke rooted in Hemingway's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' will not be grasped by many Americans today and will merely be taken by those who do grasp it as proof that you are too dull to make up a joke of your own."
O.K., I love my computers. But only when they work. If this disgracefully old Computer Number Two -- bright orange letters on a dull orange background -- were not working flawlessly right now, a deadline would be missed, and another vital communication would be lost to civilization.
I love Computer Number Two for working right now, for not letting me down like Computer Number One with its glorious colors and its amazing devices for putting me in touch with the whole darn universe if only it were working and somebody would write a manual explaining clearly how to use it to make contact with said universe. I also want to love Computer Number One, but cannot.
If I were a gun person I would shoot it right in its blank, staring, useless eye. Fortunately, I am not a gun person. This has saved many a car of mine from being shot when it broke down at some critical moment and sat idly on the highway snickering at my helplessness. This computer will live. In some remote future, archeologists may revive it and discover an astonishing disquisition on union labor back in the 20th century.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
SENATE SOFTENS SOME EDGES IN PASSING, 52-47, ITS VERSION OF VAST BUDGET CUTBACKS

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Saturday, Oct. 28

 BODY:
After giving ground on welfare, Medicaid and several other issues important to moderate Republicans and the White House, the Senate early today followed the lead of the House and approved a bill designed to balance the Federal budget by 2002.
Included in the bill are provisions that would cut taxes by $245 billion and turn over to the states much more responsibility to care for the country's poor. 
 But along the way to the 52 to 47 vote on the tax and spending legislation, the more moderate Senate veered to the left of the House of Representatives on several measures. It voted to dropp a provision that would allow corporations to withdraw billions of dollars in surplus assets from their pension funds, retain the Federal guarantee of Medicaid coverage for a variety of poor people and keep Federal regulations on nursing homes.
Deploying a Senate rule that prohibits amendments to the budget if they have no effect on the deficit, Democrats forced the Republicans to strip from the bill 46 provisions, including several relating to welfare. Those proposals would have allowed states to deny cash assistance to children born to unmarried women under the age of 18 or to welfare mothers of any age who have additional children.
"It is a vote for real, meaningful and fundamental change," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican majority leader. "And, above all, it is a vote for America's future."
Nonetheless, Mr. Dole said he expected President Clinton to veto the final bill that will be negotiated by the Senate and the House. "President Clinton says he wants change," he said. "But his actions speak much louder than his words."
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said that the fight over the reconciliation bill had united Democrats and predicted that it would give them a political club to beat the Republicans.
"This budget is mean and extreme," Mr. Daschle said. "It rewards the rich and ravages the rest. It punishes families who need our help most to pay for tax breaks for those who need handouts the least."
"This budget is 'D.B.A.' -- dead before arrival -- and is certain to get the veto it so richly deserves," he said.
The final vote, which came after three days of debate, followed party lines with one exception: Senator William S. Cohen, a moderate Republican from Maine, voted with Democrats against the bill.
Despite an agreement that limited debate on most amendments to 30 seconds for each side, the Senate's effort to complete work on the budget legislation bogged down under the weight of dozens of proposals and a glut of procedural matters.
Between 9:15 A.M. Friday when the debate resumed and 12:09 A.M. today, when the last vote was cast, there were 39 roll call votes -- breaking the Senate's single-day voting record.
The previous record of 34 roll call votes was set on June 16, 1964, during the debate on the Civil Rights Act. But that mark fell shortly after 9 P.M. when the Senate, on a 53 to 46 roll call vote, the 35th of the day, tabled an amendment by Senate Robert C. Byrd, a Democrat from West Virginia, to remove all tax cuts from the bill.
For the better part of Friday, Mr. Dole tried to prod Democrats into dropping some of their amendments and to coax some of his own members back into the fold. Still, the proceedings dragged on well into the night.
The 1,900 pages of legislation -- known as the reconciliation bill because it reconciles Congress's broadly painted budget resolution, adopted months ago, with a detailed spending plan -- would bring the Federal budget into balance over seven years, cut taxes by $245 billion during that period and turn over to the states much more of the responsibility of caring for the nation's poor.
Over all, it is very similar to the version passed on Thursday in the House. Central to both versions are huge changes to Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, and Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor.
But the more moderate Senate pulled back from several provisions adopted by the House.
By 77 to 22, for instance, the Senate voted to protect the Federal guarantee of Medicaid coverage for pregnant women, children under 12 and the disabled.
And by a vote of 51 to 48, it agreed to preserve tough Federal standards for nursing homes. The House, by contrast, would eliminate most of the Federal regulations and allow states to set their own rules.
The White House was quick to praise those votes, but just as quick to make clear that the Administration thought the bill was still too extreme in many particulars.
"I want to balance the budget," President Clinton said. "I'm determined to secure the Medicare trust fund. I want a reasonable tax cut targeted to the middle class, child-rearing and education. But I have these other principles on health care, on education, on the environment, on technology."
"And one other thing," Mr. Clinton added, faulting the legislation for its provision scaling back the earned-income tax credit, "I cannot in good conscience support a budget that actually raises taxes on people with incomes under $30,000 a year."
The budget bill has became an especially contentious issue this year because Republicans have used it as the vehicle for most of the fiscal and social changes that they promised in adopting their campaign themes a year ago.
But Friday's debate in the Senate never rose to the pitched battle that those proposed changes have usually sparked in recent months.
The reason was that the real budget fight will not come for several weeks, not until Mr. Clinton vetoes whatever version of the bill emerges from a House-Senate conference and then engages in negotiations on a compromise with the Republican-controlled Congress.
Nevertheless, for every significant provision on which the Senate bill varies greatly from its House counterpart, there is a corresponding increase in the chances of a lively preliminary bout pitting Republican against Republican in the conference committee.
The differences that the negotiators from the two houses will have to reconcile involve not only money but also wide philosophical divides.
"There are a number of places in the two bills where we are going to be different, but we knew that going in," Speaker Newt Gingrich said. "Some are things the Senate can't accept but we have; some are things that probably we can't accept that the Senate has. But we will get it done."
Neither Mr. Gingrich nor Mr. Dole would dwell on any specific differences. "I don't see any real big thing," Mr. Dole said.
But there are plenty of points of friction, and one of the more significant is the issue of pensions.
Under current law, a company may dip into the surplus assets of employee pension funds only to finance other employee benefits. But under a provision of the House-passed budget bill, such a company would be permitted to do so for any reason -- including even financing the takeover of another company -- as long as the assets remaining in the fund totaled at least 125 percent of the company's current pension liability.
Democrats have maintained that despite the 25 percent cushion, the provision would leave employee pensions vulnerable in the event of a sharp downturn in the financial markets where the funds are invested.
Until Friday, though, Senate Republicans, like their counterparts in the House, had overwhelmingly supported the provision, in part, they said, because the money withdrawn would be immediately subject to taxation. Indeed, the Republicans had estimated that the taxes paid on this money by companies would bring $5 billion to the Treasury over the next seven years.
 
CONGRESS vs. CLINTON

Reduction of $245 billion over seven years; most families would get a $500 tax credit per child, but fewer low-income workers would be eligible for earned-income tax credit.

"I believe we ought to help working families raise their children and educate themselves and their children and give tax reductions for those purposes. But I do not favor funding them by raising the price of Medicare on the poorest elderly people." Sept. 15
 
Medicare and Medicaid
 
PASSED BY CONGRESS
Spending on each program over the next seven years would by $270 billion and $182 billion less, respecitvely, than it would be under current law. States would get more control over how remaining Medicaid funds would be spent.
 
CLINTON'S VIEW
"You can have reductions in cost inflation in Medicare and Medicaid, without these Draconian consequences....If these health care cuts come to my desk, of this size, I would have no choice but to veto it." Sept. 15
 
Welfare
 
PASSED BY CONGRESS
Federal subsistence guarantee to poor children would end. Instead, states would get a smaller amount of money to spend on support for poor families, but more contol over how to spend it.
 
CLINTON'S VIEW
"It really would end welfare as we know it....If we can make it a little better in conference I'll be happy to sign it. If they make it a lot worse, they could kill it." Sept. 21
 
Environment
 
PASSED BY CONGRESS
The Arctic National Wildlife Refugee in Alaska would be opened to oil exploration; mining would be expanded on Federal Lands.
 
CLINTON'S VIEW
"The President will veto any reconciliation bill that opens the Artic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling."
Alice M. Rivlin, Director, Office of Management and Budget, Oct. 18 letter to the House

HEADLINE: Crack and Punishment: Is Race the Issue?

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
The drug-sentencing bill attracted little notice in Washington, compared with the attention focused on the pitched debate over the future of health care and welfare. But prisoner rights groups say word of its passage flashed through Federal prisons, and soon after there were rumblings of possible disturbances.
Prison officials will not say if they believe the uprisings that followed at five sites were related to the vote in Congress. But the disturbances have suddenly drawn attention to the debate over mandatory Federal sentencing laws for crack cocaine offenses. These laws, which Congress voted to maintain in the bill, are harsher than those for crimes involving powdered cocaine, and many lawyers and legislators say they have a disproportionate impact on poor black men. 
 "It is both unfair, impractical, and unwarranted," said Laura Murphy, director of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, who called race issues in the criminal justice system "the new frontier" of civil rights. "How can you go to an inner-city family and tell them their son is given 20 years, while someone in the suburbs who's using powdered cocaine in greater quantities can get off with 90 days' probation? When people understand the truth about the way these laws are imposed, the fact they've had no deterrent, and the race-based nature of these prosecutions, then I think a sleeping giant is going to roar."
But others say the violence and addiction that lie in the crack epidemic's wake explain why such offenses are more harshly punished.
"What about the gangs, the rivalries, the shootings, the killings?" said Jim Shedd, an agent and spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration in Miami. "Everybody's forgotten about the amount of violence that goes with crack cocaine. It's not a racist thing, but unfortunately that's what it's turned into."
Last week, during the march on Washington by hundreds of thousands of black men, and later in an emotional debate on the floor of the House of Representatives, speakers decried Federal laws that say it takes 100 times more powdered cocaine to draw the same mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison that awaits a person convicted of possessing five grams of crack.
The United States Sentencing Commission, created by Congress to draft, monitor and amend sentencing guidelines for the Federal courts, recommended that legislators scrap the 100-to-1 ratio, and make equal the amounts of crack and cocaine powder that draw the same base sentences. It suggested a number of enhancements that would more severely punish offenders who had also used a weapon, or committed other crimes. But instead lawmakers passed legislation that rejected those recommendations, and urged the body to re-examine its findings.
This week, the Congressional Black Caucus sent a letter to President Bill Clinton urging him to veto Congress's bill. Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, who attacked the sentencing laws during the House debate, has written to prison wardens asking them to relay to Attorney General Janet Reno their concerns about the impact of the uneven penalties.
Challenges to the penalties have never been upheld in Federal courts. But in 1991, the Minnesota Supreme Court struck down a state mandatory sentencing law that mirrored the disparities in the Federal statutes. And in Miami, some Federal prosecutors say they have chosen not to charge some crack suspects because they believe the punishment they will face is unduly harsh.
With a set of mandatory minimum sentencing laws passed in 1986, Congress for the first time distinguished between crack and powder cocaine. Crack, which emerged in the mid-1980's, had been deemed a new drug plague, blamed for escalating gang violence and for a surge in the number of neglected children flooding the child welfare system.
Crack is the only drug that carries a mandatory prison term for possession, whether or not the intent is to distribute, said Paul Martin, deputy staff director for the sentencing commission. Possession of heroin or powdered cocaine, without intent to sell, is a misdemeanor carrying a maximum of one year in jail. The commission had also sought to make punishment for simple crack possession equal to that of other drugs.
Although Federal statistics find that half of crack users are white, the sale and use of the substance, a cheaper form of cocaine, is often concentrated in poor, urban, minority communities, experts say. Last year, 90 percent of those convicted of Federal crack offenses were black, and 3.5 percent were white, sentencing commission officials say. By contrast, 25.9 percent of those convicted on Federal powdered cocaine charges were white, 29.7 percent were black and 42.8 percent were Hispanic.
"When we saw those statistics," said Judge Richard P. Conaboy, the sentencing commission's chairman, "our theory was a law, no matter how well-intentioned it was, if it's causing such discrepant results, then the law has to be changed and a new method has to be installed."
The commission's recommendations grew out of a study requested by Congress, said the judge, who added he was not surprised by last week's prison unrest.
Commissioners often spoke with prison officials, he said, and "in the course of our dialogue with them, we learned that a lot of their prison inmates are serving time under drug sentences, and that many of the families of these young black men in particular are concerned and hopeful that there will be some change made in that particular statute. And if the change was not made it might lead to problems."
But others say crack deserves its harsher penalties. While most experts agree that cocaine, be it a crystallized pellet or powder, does not cause its user to become violent, many law-enforcement officials say crack's bustling street trade is particularly vicious.
"The closer we get to the crack dealers on the street," said Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Curtis Hazell, who heads the major narcotics unit, "the more likely they are to have a past history of violence."
Of those convicted in 1993 of Federal offenses involving powdered cocaine, 15.1 percent were given additional time for using a weapon, as compared with 28 percent of crack offenders, commission officials said.
"Crack clearly causes more trouble than powdered cocaine," said Dr. Robert Byck, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the Yale University School of Medicine. "When rock was introduced, the number of hospitalizations for cocaine impairment went way up, and the number of people addicted went way up."
But some sociologists argue that many of the ills associated with crack have as much to do with poverty, unemployment and homelessness as the drug itself, and that society should focus on creating more jobs and treatment programs.
Others say there are negligible pharmacological differences between crack and powdered cocaine. Though smoking crack makes the drug's high quicker and stronger, some doctors note that powdered cocaine can also be smoked, when it is concentrated using the technique known as free-basing. Powdered cocaine can also be injected, they point out, which is more likely to lead to addiction.
"The potency, dangerousness and risk depends on multiple factors," said Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, president of the Phoenix House Foundation, a national drug treatment organization. "A person who is selling cocaine in the powdered form or crack form will both bring about a great deal of harm in the user. So does it make sense for a sentencing disparity? Probably not."
The primary difference between crack and powdered cocaine, some say, is the public perception of the user and seller -- the white suburbanite usually linked with powdered cocaine, and the young, urban black man connected to crack.
"If these were young white men going to jail, this would not exist," said William Moffitt, a lawyer and treasurer of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, which has challenged the mandatory sentences in court. "So the war on drugs is essentially being borne by the black community."
The Sentencing Project, a national nonprofit organization that deals with criminal justice issues, recently released a report finding that one in three black men between the ages of 20 and 29 are in the grasp of the criminal justice system.
Marc Mauer, the project's assistant director, said the nation's drug policies were one of the primary reasons for this.
"Every middle-class parent knows that if their son or daughter started using drugs, the first response would be to find the best treatment program they could afford," Mr. Mauer said. "It would never occur to them to write out a check for $20,000 and reserve a space in the prison system for their kid's problem. We have the same problem, yet the responses are different -- one a public health response, the other a criminal justice response -- largely due to the individual who's affected by it."
Mr. Mauer and others said no one had proved that the stringent crack penalties have reduced other crimes or slowed addiction. And he and several others contended that the mandatory laws are too broad, punishing a small-time dealer caught with a few grams of crack as harshly as a drug kingpin.
But some law-enforcement officials argue that more blacks are being jailed for crack offenses because they are the ones committing the crimes.
"It's not disproportionate considering who's dealing," said Mr. Hazell, the prosecutor in Los Angeles. "It's like complaining that not enough Chinese are being prosecuted. But that's because it's not the Chinese that are doing that crime."

HEADLINE: Economy Surged 4.2% in Quarter And Inflation Rate Slipped Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Surpassing nearly all expectations, the economy rebounded vigorously over the summer to grow at a 4.2 percent pace while inflation, already low, subsided further, the Commerce Department reported today.
The Clinton Administration sought to turn the combination of swelling output, steady prices and the likelihood of brighter prospects for job growth to its advantage as the White House enters the final stages of budget negotiations with the Republican-controlled Congress. 
 "We're on the right track," President Clinton declared, citing the sunny report on the nation's gross domestic product -- the Government's broadest measure of the economy -- as evidence that his domestic policies were working. He also noted that the budget deficit dropped substantially for a third consecutive year in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. "We do not need to reverse our economic course. That's the message I have for the Congress."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader and leading candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, was not as enthusiastic as Mr. Clinton about the latest economic news. "One quarter of growth -- however welcome -- will not solve our problem," he said. "You can't erase 25 straight years of deficit spending with one quarter of growth in the economy."
Securities markets initially sputtered when the Government disclosed the strength of the economy in the last quarter, which actually represented the latest uptick in four and a half years of uninterrupted economic expansion. Traders sent bond prices down because of worries that robust growth might keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates when it holds its next policy meeting on Nov. 15.
Upon reflection, however, the markets recovered. Most analysts have decided that the Fed will not embark on another round of interest-rate cuts based on the latest economic data, opting instead to wait until Congress and the White House agree on a deficit-reduction package.
Bonds made up much of their lost ground and stocks jumped sharply, recovering a good share of the market's big loss on Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 4,741.75, up 37.93 points. [Page 37.]
A deeper look at the economic data apparently cheered investors. Analysts, noting that prices remained in check, predicted that the growth spurt was not likely to sustain a fast enough pace in the near future to rekindle inflationary embers.
Not only did the economy expand more than three times as fast as its lackluster 1.3 percent pace in the spring, but the growth was considerably better balanced. And the buildup of inventories, which most analysts had expected to slacken and thus cut into the growth of G.D.P., actually continued.
"There's plenty of evidence of a nice recovery from some temporary weakness earlier in the year," said David J. Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
An interest rate cut by the Fed in November has "close to zero probability," he said.
The housing sector, which is especially sensitive to changes in interest rates, was especially robust in the latest quarter, expanding at a 10.9 percent annual pace after a 13.9 percent decline in the spring. Exports of goods and services climbed at a 10.6 percent pace, and the trade sector, which had been a drag on growth earlier in the year, contributed to growth because exports outpaced imports. Purchases by the Federal Government, benefiting from military items bought at the end of the fiscal year, advanced at a 4.9 percent pace after declining for three straight quarters.
Spending by consumers, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, moderated to a 2.9 percent annual rate of growth, from 3.4 percent in the spring quarter, the report also showed. An upturn for motor vehicles and parts lifted durable goods to a big gain after a flat first half. This was partly offset, however, by a flat quarter for production of nondurable goods like food and clothing and a cooling in demand for services.
Business investment in equipment, which has long soared at double-digit rates, slackened in the quarter to 8.3 percent. But that rise has been exaggerated, many economists contend, by a distortion in the way the figures price computers. The Government plans to start measuring the economy in a different way next year in an effort to more accurately reflect its output.
Looking at it in that light, "investment actually fell as a share of nominal G.D.P. for the first time in the recovery," said Dean Baker, an analyst at the liberal Economic Policy Institute.
As for inflation, what American residents pay for goods and services -- known as the fixed-weighted price index for gross domestic purchases -- rose at a 2.1 percent pace in the third quarter, compared with 2.8 percent in the previous period, which ended in June. A second gauge that takes account of changes in purchasing patterns, known as the deflator, rose only six-tenths of 1 percent, leading Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown to boast of "sustained low levels" of inflation not seen since the Kennedy Administration.
Still, some economists even found a cloud amid the clear skies of such price stability, contending that corporate profit margins were suffering because of an inability to raise prices.
David Orr, senior vice president of the investment banking subsidiary of the First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., said that companies "are becoming less aggressive in their hiring and capital spending plans, which will then result in less new demand for goods and services."
In current dollars, the economy expanded at a 4.8 percent pace in the third quarter, and was running at a rate to produce more than $7 trillion in goods and services this year. Adjusted for inflation, the pace of growth was 4.2 percent. "Nearly every dollar of nominal spending contributed a dollar to real growth," Merrill Lynch analysts observed.
The savings rate -- personal savings as a percentage of personal disposable income -- edged up two-tenths of a point, to 4.2 percent, the report showed. At a briefing, Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, disputed those who earlier this week found cause for concern in data showing rising consumer debt.
He contended that the burden of servicing higher debt was manageable because of lower interest rates. He also noted that delinquencies remained low and that the rising stock market had generated large amounts of fresh wealth.
But he did express concern that political turmoil over the budget could raise interest rates, possibly affecting the millions of households with adjustable-rate mortgages.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the third quarter of 1995 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cooling Ties to Croatia After Winking at Its Buildup

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Oct. 26

 BODY:
On March 24, 1994, Gojko Susak, the Croatian Defense Minister, wrote to the Pentagon appealing for assistance. "Our goal," he wrote, was the peaceful transition of the Croatian military "to one which follows the model of the United States."
The Croatian Army sorely needed help. Hammered by the Serbs in 1991, battered by the Muslim-led Bosnian Army in 1993, its brief history was one of failure. But the United Nations arms embargo imposed in 1991 on Yugoslavia and its former republics made direct military assistance illegal. 
 Mr. Susak's request was referred to a company called Military Professional Resources Inc., based in Alexandria, Va., and run by a group of retired American officers. "This," said Ed Soyster, a retired lieutenant-general and one the company's vice presidents, "is the greatest corporate assemblage of military expertise in the world."
Just what has been done with that American expertise, and whether any infringement of the arms embargo may be involved, is not entirely clear. The American generals say they have done no more than teach leadership skills and advise the Croats on the role of an army in a democracy.
Nonetheless, the Croatian Army, which has also made large clandestine purchases of heavy weapons, mainly in eastern Europe, was quickly transformed into the most effective proven fighting force in the region. And the role of the retired American generals in that transformation has become one element in the increasingly troubled web of relations between the United States and Croatia.
"Croatia became our de facto strategic ally," said a State Department official with intimate knowledge of the workings of the Zagreb embassy. "Arms flowed into Croatia despite the embargo, and this was not an issue. It was never raised. Not once. Now, we're starting to wonder: What have we unleashed in Croatia, and where it is going?"
Several factors have contributed to this new uneasiness about a country that has served until now as the Clinton Administration's pivotal Balkan ally in the search for a balance of power that could open the way to a peace settlement.
To this end, senior officials said, vast Croatian arms imports, in flagrant defiance of the embargo, have been systematically ignored while some top retired American generals have been allowed to advise the Croatian Army on modernizing.
Now, however, Croatian human-rights abuses during and since the recapture of the Serbian-held Krajina region in August are troubling the Administration. Apprehension has been growing over Croatian territorial ambitions in Bosnia and over persistent Croatian threats to retake Serbian-held eastern Slavonia.
More generally, an uneasy sense has taken hold among senior officials that Washington may have allowed itself to get too cozy with a Government whose rhetoric is often laced with thinly veiled racism toward Bosnia's Muslims.
"There are many marriages of convenience in the Balkans, and our relationship with Croatia has been one of them," said a senior Pentagon official. "Let's face it, you can't get to Bosnia without going through Croatia. You need their ports, you need their lines of communication. But right now we're not happy. We see the whole set-up there as overly militaristic."
These concerns have been forcefully conveyed to the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, over the last 10 days by the chief American envoy to the Balkans, Richard C. Holbrooke, and by President Clinton himself. Senior officials said the President had raised the threat of economic sanctions against Croatia in the event of an attack on oil-rich eastern Slavonia.
"Let's just say our relationship has entered a cooling-off period," said one senior American diplomat.
But troubling questions remain as the United States tries to recast its relationship with Croatia, especially as the possibility increases that more than 20,000 American peacekeepers will be sent to the region.
They center on whether American advice or intelligence was provided for the campaign in Krajina, which resulted in atrocities and the uprooting of more than 170,000 Serbs; how far a tacit alliance with Croatia has gone, and whether an American-led NATO mission to police any settlement is compatible with such close ties to Croatia.
Allowing Croatia to arm itself -- it spent an estimated $1 billion on arms in the last year -- has been one pillar of America's Balkan policy. The arms, including tanks and M1-24 armored assault helicopters, were acquired mainly in eastern Europe, Croatian officials said.
Croatia became the chief conduit for weapons to the Muslim-led Bosnian Army, but only after taking its cut, about 30 percent of all shipments, Western officials said.
The buildup has been complemented by the efforts of Military Professional Resources, , which has been active in Croatia this year.
The company occupies one floor of a small modern building in Alexandria. Conference rooms have names like the Infantry Room, where Mr. Soyster greets guests, the Cavalry room and the Artillery Room. A plaque on one wall says: "War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse."
In order to get a license from the State Department, the company had to undertake not to provide direct military planning or advice on strategy to the Croatian Army: This would violate the arms embargo.
Activities were to be limited to courses on leadership, the training of non-commissioned officers, the place of an army in an emergent democracy and other subjects unrelated to the obsession of the Croatian Army: the fact that, when the mission began, about 30 percent of Croatia was occupied by Serbs.
"It was kind of frustrating," Mr. Soyster said. "No military plans. No strategy. Those were our constraints."
For this mission, the company deployed some extremely high-powered people, including Gen. Carl E. Vuono, who was the Army chief of staff from 1987 to 1992, and Gen. Crosbie E. Saint, who was the commander of the United States Army in Europe from 1988 until 1992.
Some idea of the importance accorded the mission by the Croats can be seen in their attendance at a "leadership skills" course. Every Government minister turned up, and Mr. Soyster said President Tudjman also appeared.
The force behind the American presence was clearly the Defense Minister, Mr. Susak, a brisk and ruthless man with a successful career in the pizza business in Canada behind him and an obsession with remaking the Croatian Army to fight the Serbs. He became so confident about the arms buildup that he would joke about it with American officials, a State Department official said. The minister did not respond to a request for an interview.
Gen. Anton Tus, chief military adviser to Mr. Tudjman, said: "We are very satisfied by what the American generals have done for our top-level commanders and some lower levels. General Vuono has been helping us get closer to the standards of NATO. However, it is wrong to believe that he or other American officers have given any specific, operative military instructions."
But the nature of the attack on the Krajina, dubbed Uluja, or Storm, has led many Western military analysts to believe that American planning and advice played a role.
The lightning five-pronged offensive, integrating air power, artillery and rapid infantry movements, and relying on intense maneuvers to unhinge Serbian command and control networks, bore many hallmarks of United States Army doctrine.
An American officer working for United Nations forces called the attack a textbook campaign. He said: "It was carried out on an unsophisticated level, but for me the evidence of American instruction was unmistakable. You don't just stumble on what the Croats have achieved."
Mr. Soyster, who declined to disclose the value of the multi-year contract with the Croatian Government, denied that there had been infringement of the arms embargo. "The guys who run this company ran the American Army, and we are not going to do anything that is against United States policy" he said.
However, a Croatian liaison officer who handled contacts between the two generals and the Croatian army told Roman Majetic, a widely respected journalist in Croatia, that in the five days before the offensive, at least 10 meetings were held between General Vuono and senior officers involved in the Krajina campaign. This account could not be independently confirmed.
"According to this officer, there were a series of computer simulations," Mr. Majetic said. "These were not instructions but scenarios. It was pitched at the theoretical level, but it turned out to be true. What General Vuono and General Saint hypothesized was more or less what happened in reality during the Krajina offensive."
General Tus said: "It may be people came to that conclusion because of speed and strategy. I am not saying that these meetings did not take place. I'm just saying that I'm not aware of it. It is true that General Vuono was in the country at that time."
Mr. Soyster confirmed that General Vuono and General Saint were in Zagreb in the days leading up to the Krajina offensive, and they met with Mr. Susak and with the chief of the general staff of the Croatian Army. "But there was absolutely no wargaming," he added. "We were not even aware the attack was about to happen."
But it is clear that the officer class of the Croatian Army, particularly at the noncommissioned level, has gone through a radical transformation guided by retired American officers and that this has helped create the most potent military force in the area. Only 4 percent of Croatia is now in Serbian hands, and the Croatian Army has taken more than 20 percent of Bosnia.
Having helped in various ways to create this force, the United States is now concerned that it must be contained, especially after the Croats burned 70 percent of the Serbian homes in the southern Krajina, executed dozens of aged Serbs and evicted thousands more.
"You'd have to say we gave the green light for the Krajina offensive because our admonitions were at best half-hearted," said Charles Thomas, who retired recently from the State Department, where he worked on the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia. "But now we're worried by the Croatian military ascendancy. The balance between Muslims and Croats is too weighted to the Croats. It's skewed."
Mr. Soyster said the atrocities during the Krajina offensive were "a major area of concern." But he added that the courses were continuing.
The next target would clearly be eastern Slavonia. Mr. Susak has said repeatedly that by Christmas he will be drinking coffee in Vukovar, the town the Serbs leveled in 1991 when they took the area, slaughtering and evicting Croats. Last week Mr. Tudjman said the army would invade if the region were not returned by the end of November.
The Clinton Administration, switching signals, has told the Croats that it is determined to stop any attack. But the American officer working for the United Nations said: "With the money they have spent, and the training they have received, the Croatian Army is one that's going places. It is definitely not an army on the verge of demobilization."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: RAISING REVENUE;
Airwaves Plan Is Called Give-away to Broadcasters

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Buried in the huge budget bill emerging from Congress is a plan to pull $14 billion from the air -- literally -- by selling off a chunk of the nation's airwaves over the next seven years.
But in a move that has drawn criticism from liberals and conservatives alike, the same provision would give television broadcasters a package of licenses for "advanced television service," such as high-definition or interactive television, that Government economists say could be worth as much as $70 billion. 
 Though it has gone largely unnoticed, the tussle over selling off the nation's airwaves entails a huge and poorly understood scramble for money that significantly affects the budget deficit and the evolution of new communication services.
Everyone agrees that the nation's radio spectrum is worth tens of billions of dollars and offers one of the few seemingly painless ways in which the Government can reduce the deficit. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission sold licenses for new wireless telephone services in an auction that raised $7.7 billion.
The real argument, largely behind the scenes, has been about which portion of the nation's airwaves should be put up for sale. Television broadcasters have waged a relentless lobbying campaign, arguing that every existing station must be given a second channel to carry out a transition to a new generation of digital broadcasting and high-definition television.
"Digital advanced television would never happen if there were auctions," said Lynn McReynolds, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Broadcasters.
But many experts and consumer advocates argue that the broadcasters are being handed a gift at taxpayers' expense. "It's a give-away if the broadcasters don't have to provide any public services in exchange," said Gigi Sohn, the deputy director of the Media Access Project, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group in Washington.
A number of conservative critics also maintain that the bill squanders a valuable public resource by limiting access to one of the best segments of radio spectrum available. "This is not going to help consumers get enhanced services and greater innovation, because that entails opening up the spectrum," said Thomas Hazlette, a telecommunications analyst at the American Enterprise Institute and a strong proponent of auctions.
The industry's arguments have been largely successful. After arduous bargaining over the summer -- mostly behind closed doors -- the House and Senate Commerce Committee came up with similar formulas: the Government must raise $14 billion from selling off a portion of the airwaves, but it would be prohibited from selling off channels that have been earmarked for advanced television services.
The numbers are huge. In a letter to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, the F.C.C. estimated that the television channels that are being reserved would have a market value of $10 billion to $70 billion. Using a separate approach, extrapolating from the recent sale of a New York City station, WNYC, for $208 million, commission officials said the nationwide value of the channels reserved for broadcasters would be $37 billion.
A handful of opponents in the Senate tried today to change the provision, but they are not expected to prevail. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, offered an amendment on Thursday night that would have required the Government to auction off all new licenses of any type and estimated that the measure would bring in at least $35 billion. The amendment was defeated, 25 to 64.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 2, 1995, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about efforts by Congress to raise $14 billion by selling licenses for the nation's airwaves referred incorrectly to a Senate proposal on awarding channels for services like high-definition television. The bill would require the Federal Communications Commission to submit a plan for awarding the channels and then get Congressional approval; it is not like the House version, which would automatically give television broadcasters channels for those services.

A MATHEMATICIAN READS THE NEWSPAPER
By John Allen Paulos.
Illustrated. 212 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $18. 
 MATH -- or rather, Americans' fear and loathing thereof -- seems more the stuff of somber foundation reports than of best sellers. But six years ago John Allen Paulos, a professor of mathematics at Temple University, pulled off the impossible, writing a book so disarmingly charming that many who probably bought it out of guilt ended up reading it with pleasure.
Now the author of "Innumeracy" is back with what, on first glance, appears to be a gentle critique of the ways newspapers make hash of concepts that must be interpreted through the lens of mathematical reasoning. Mr. Paulos certainly does chide reporters for everything from the crime of failing to put new threats to health in context to the misdemeanor of offering impossibly precise breakdowns of calories, sodium and fat content for recipes that call for a pinch of this and a pinch of that. But his little book, "A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper," is mostly an excuse to do what Mr. Paulos does best -- namely, to explain the beauty (and relevance) of math to people who never got past the high school algebra problem that begins "two trains are speeding toward. . . ."
The book comprises some 52 bite-size essays. Among the highlights: an introduction to chaos theory in the context of changing fashions in clothing; the use of least-squares regression analysis to decide the outcome of a contested election in Pennsylvania; the utterly nonintuitive mathematics of affirmative action; Jeffrey Masson's defamation suit against Janet Malcolm as a segue to the theory of complexity; package labeling and the Central Limit theorem of statistics.
One essay guaranteed to startle is a lovely explanation of the elusive mathematics of coin flipping and its application to stock market forecasting. Picture a game in which I win on heads and you win on tails. On average, of course, each of us will win half the time. But Mr. Paulos notes that during a game consisting of 1,000 flips, it is far more likely that one or the other of us will have been ahead in cumulative scoring 90 percent of the time than, say, 55 percent of the time. The moral: Beware stock pickers whose claim to fame is to have been ahead of the Dow for most of the last decade. It's not as hard as it looks.
My own favorite illuminates the limits of voting as a means of expressing group preferences. He imagines a Senate debate over three health care plans in which 33 senators prefer plan A to plan B to plan C, 33 prefer B to C to A and 33 prefer C to A to B. (The 100th Senator, Bob Dole, "likes none of them.")
This implies that 66 senators prefer A to B, and 66 prefer B to C. Obviously, then, A is far better liked than C. Well, it isn't so obvious: go back to the blackboard, and you'll see that 66 senators prefer C to A. Maybe that's why Hillary Rodham Clinton is arranging flowers rather than writing legislation these days.
"A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper" won't help you balance your checkbook. It would even be stretching to claim that the book will improve your understanding of the ways reporters mangle body counts or explain inherently inexplicable changes in stock prices. At the very least, though, it will give the mathematically traumatized a glimpse of what they are missing.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY VIEW;
Testing the Limits In a Culture of Excess

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
ONLY FRAGMENTS OF people are visible through a very dirty window, but what uncommon fragments they are: a naked back and one long, giraffe-print glove; hips and a star-spangled G-string with dollars tucked into it; the profile of a woman having sex with a man; a woman's arm outstretched in front of a pair of male hands. With a kind of ragged classicism, the window dividers gracefully section off clues to sex and drug transactions. Merry Alpern, a 40-year-old photojournalist, took these photographs unobserved from another window across an air shaft. She was looking into the bathroom of a sex club near Wall Street in Manhattan. So are we.
This project was selected to receive a grant by the peer-review panel of the National Endowment for the Arts in 1994, then vetoed by the National Council on the Arts, which reviews all recommendations. Collectors and museums (including the Museums of Modern Art in New York and San Francisco) nonetheless rushed to buy Alpern's compelling if unnerving pictures, which can currently be seen in a show called "Dirty Windows" at the Bonni Benrubi Gallery (52 East 76th Street, through Nov. 25) and in a book by the same name from Scalo. 
 Sexual imagery so permeates contemporary life that these photographs would hardly be surprising if they were studio performances rather than real-life documents recorded on the sly. Few people have seen what goes on in the bathroom of a sex club, but every week millions witness fictional sex and drug encounters -- some explicit, some merely suggestive -- in feature films, soap operas and advertisements.
Sex was kept pretty much under covers in popular culture until the 1960's (except, of course, in the sex trade -- pornography and burlesque). Titillation was a major staple of commerce but shock was not; it was assumed that an offended public would snap its purse shut. Only artists, who were outside the commercial loop, were entirely willing, and sometimes eager, to offend in sexual and other matters. Picasso and Dali were much more sexually explicit (if less naturalistic) than Warner Brothers or Vogue magazine.
It was and remains a prerogative of art to probe regions deemed off-limits, and art has long performed the function of finding new ways to look at familiar objects and new things to pay attention to. Such exploration was often transgressive and sometimes shocking. Manet's decidedly naked rather than nude "Olympia" shocked the French in 1865, and Duchamp's "Bottle Rack," a mass-produced object presented as a work of art, shocked them again in 1914. Dada artists tried not merely to loosen the tight laces of propriety but to undo the very order of things.
Commerce, however, was dependent on propriety and order. While advertising and entertainment teased, tantalized and were openly seductive -- think of cigar ads that purred, "Hey, Big Spender, spend a little time with me" -- they did not seriously try to breach the borders of the acceptable. That was the domain of art.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST stories in popular culture during the last third of this century (the work of the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe notwithstanding) is that the commercial sector has taken the lead away from art in the matter of breaking rules, abolishing taboos, pushing the envelope. Art, of course, challenges society's rules and norms at every level. Popular culture is mainly intent on widening the range of permissions for the display of sex and violence.
Everyone always knew sex and violence sold. What is new is the discovery that a mainstream audience would not only tolerate the casting off of a century's worth of restrictions and discretion but embrace enormous and rapid leaps from one broken taboo to the next.
What was once offensive is now a key to cash in the till. A mass audience today routinely spends money for the newest twist in sex and violence but gets generous daily helpings of the same free on billboards, newsstands and television: a passable description of decadence. This audience does sit up and complain sometimes, and very loudly too. Then it plunks down its money for more of the same.
The sensationalistic images that flood the visual environment appear far more frequently and get immeasurably greater distribution in the popular culture than they ever do in art. Yet art bears the brunt of public attacks.
In 1990, the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center was sued over its Mapplethorpe show despite displaying the most explicit pictures separately, as if rating them NC-17. In 1991, a female professor at Pennsylvania State University said that hanging Goya's "Naked Maja" in her classroom constituted sexual harassment because the picture prompted fantasies among her male students that made her workplace a hostile environment. In 1993, in response to another woman's sexual harassment charges, city officials in Menlo Park, Calif., removed two pleasant and rather innocent woodcuts of nude and seminude women from the walls of City Hall.
Yet no one stopped riding the buses in New York this summer when bus stops sported an ad for Versace jeans that showed a woman standing over and photographing a recumbent man whose foot was on her crotch, where her jeans were partly unbuttoned. Nor have women boycotted the parts of town where huge pictures of an apparently nude woman advertise pantyhose. It was a rare occasion this fall when complaints caused Calvin Klein to withdraw ads using very young models in scenes that looked like child pornography (and that maneuver simply did wonders for Klein's publicity).
Commercial images of all kinds are much less subject to public protest than art. Art, though central to culture, is considered elite, and many people resent it. But the business of America is business, and commercial images are protected by money -- lots of money -- and the mystique of private enterprise.
Life itself is so outrageous, what with tell-all talk shows, the O. J. Simpson and Menendez brothers murder trials and even the nightly news, that it is a wonder anyone can find anything to be shocked about, in art or anyplace else. Artists straggle on, sometimes straining after new transgressions, sometimes reduced to poking at the confines of art itself. Occasionally an artist stumbles onto something really forbidden, like the bathroom of a sex club.
WHEN THE INCREASINGLY blatant use of sexual imagery in the popular culture began some 30-odd years ago, it was partly a response to long-term repressions. From 1934 until the movie ratings system was introduced in 1968, the Hollywood Production Code kept the lid on, forbidding the display of kisses longer than 30 seconds, "intimate items of underwear," women's breasts (Howard Hughes had a huge row with the Hays Office, which administered the code, over Jane Russell's bosom in "The Outlaw") or illicit affairs ("For Whom the Bell Tolls" was another thorny problem).
Today, a Rip Van Winkle who had slept for 30 years might suppose that someone had inserted mandatory nakedness quotas into the commercial equation to make up for the old cover-up rules. (The more modest movie stars demand breast stand-ins, who might be called the cinema league's designated bodies.) Renoir, say, could paint only 60 nudes in a lifetime, but popular culture has the means to churn out nudes by the millions. It seems that once repressive and hypocritical barriers were knocked down, the result was less liberation than binge. We have achieved a stunning triumph of excess.
The media have probably broken more visual taboos in the last two decades than were overturned in the previous half century, not only raising the transgression ante but accelerating the pace of change. First underwear went public, then bodies, then simulated sex, frontal nudity, male nudity -- shifts so frequent and rapid that nakedness inexorably became cliched. Popular culture tends to repeat whatever looks financially successful; like films themselves, sexual images keep having sequels.
Every film of a certain ilk has a long panning shot of its sexpot star, starting at the foot and ascending slowly, the most recent being of Demi Moore standing for an unreasonably long and doubtless chilly time in a tub in "The Scarlet Letter." (John Donne once wrote a poem about the advantages of approaching his lover from the foot rather than the head; the only men who seem to have consistently followed his advice are cinematographers.)
Film makers use any old excuse to drag in frontal nudity or, having discovered from focus groups that women, too, have desires, male backsides (and a few discreet fronts). Kevin Costner appeared nude with his back to us in "Dances With Wolves." Gary Oldman skinny-dips in "The Scarlet Letter" so an admiring Demi Moore can spy on him, a neat, if obvious, reversal of the usual bathing scene.
Advertisers rack their brains to be equally original. In an ad for Valentino jeans, a woman wearing white jeans and nothing else is soberly embraced by four naked men. (Now you know what to wear the next time a similar occasion looms.) In an ad for Groves Brothers Fabrics in Elle Decor magazine, an artfully posed nude man holds up a long swath of damask that tactfully drapes his loins.
Sexual intercourse is simulated so often and so publicly that it seems repetitive, stereotyped, sometimes just plain fake and even -- you might have thought it impossible -- dull. Finding something more sensational to whet the appetite is not an easy task, but considerable creative talent has been devoted to it.
The plot of "Jade," a new sex-and-murder thriller directed by William Friedkin, depends on some grainy videos of a high-priced call girl in bed -- lite porn, you might call it. The sex is a bit more acrobatic than usual; she falls out of bed onto all fours and the man follows her. But, after all, we have already seen a woman pleasuring a man from behind with the aid of a stick of butter ("Last Tango in Paris"), a gang rape ("The Accused"), a woman ravishing and then killing a man she has tied up ("Basic Instinct") and a woman strangled during intercourse ("Rising Sun"), so what's new?
The problem is that shock goes stale faster than bread. It requires surprise or outrage, but once some level of the forbidden has been breached, it loses a good deal of its initial power. If repeated exposure to violence eventually renders viewers immune or indifferent, repeated exposure to sex does something similar. In a nudist colony, who pays attention to a flasher?
Thus, the sexual liberation of images has a built-in imperative to escalate. No doubt it has done us some good along the way. All the bedroom maneuvers on contemporary television soaps and in film may have helped a lot of people improve their sex lives. All those bodies in their undies or without them may have made others more comfortable with their own bodies, although the number of people dieting in this country suggests otherwise.
The constant focus on representations of sex and death looks less like hedonism than like the symptoms of a pervasive, free-floating anxiety and depression. Anxiety about economic problems, tensions between the sexes, broken families and fear of AIDS fuel a frantic search for pleasure, excitement, reassurance and connection, no matter how tenuous.
In a sense, we want popular imagery to substitute for lives we cannot achieve ourselves, as well as to soothe the lives we have. The down side is that however much good the entertainment media's sexual liberation has done or may do, it also burdens the audience with additional anxiety by holding up images, over and over, of beauty, nonstop pleasure and excitement that most lives cannot match.
Ads and movies and television have always purveyed fantasies. They used to emphasize the fantasy of the happy nuclear family eating cereal, merrily vacuuming the carpets or rooting for the Little Leaguer, but few people dare dream that one any more. The dominant fantasies are sexual or violent or both: pivotal matters embedded in the mind. Now the culture is calling on all good citizens to entertain them as often as possible and connect them to their wallets.
Major protests have been mounted against violent images and even hypersexuality, and not just from the religious right. "Showgirls," the movie that tried to bring the NC-17 rating into the mainstream; "Jade" and "The Scarlet Letter" did not fare as well as their producers hoped. Yet moviegoers who stayed away were protesting not the glut of sex but the poverty of invention. These movies were just plain boring, and the public, with plenty to choose from, prefers some kind of quality, even in titillation.
The protests over the resemblance of Calvin Klein's ads to pornography were especially loud because, right now, Americans are alarmed about child abuse, child pornography and the effects of media violence on children. We know how to shut down some levels of visual transgression. Although we are not always so eager to feed, school or tend to the health of all our children, at least we can rest assured that they will be safe from Calvin.

VIRTUAL EQUALITY
The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation.
By Urvashi Vaid.
440 pp. New York:
Anchor Books/
Doubleday. $24.95. 
 BEFORE Patrick J. Buchanan's anti-gay philippic at the 1992 Republican National Convention and the religious right's 1993 sabotaging of President Clinton's pledge to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military -- which propelled countless infuriated gay Americans out of the closet, many into activism -- the gay rights movement was essentially a creature of the political left. Between 1986 and 1992, Urvashi Vaid's successive roles as public information director and executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force put her, a young Vassar graduate and civil rights lawyer, at the center of the action. Noted for her belief that the movement should not only focus on equal rights for gay people but also seek "liberation" for women, people of color and the working class, Ms. Vaid responded to the influx of moderates into the gay rights movement with alarm, denouncing the "mainstreaming" of homosexuality as inimical to revolutionary change and calling for "a full-scale frontal assault" against "the coming of a racist, sexist gay and lesbian right." (There is, incidentally, no such right in sight.)
"Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation" is the work of a woman in an unusual position. While remaining an ideological extremist (who, for example, still defends the stipulation that half of each state's steering committee members at the 1993 march on Washington had to be people of color), Ms. Vaid manifestly wishes to win over a general audience and re-establish her authority in a movement whose center has moved rapidly toward the nation's political center -- and away from her. To this end, she has moderated her formerly strident tone, cut down on the barn-burning rhetoric about the evils of religion, capitalism and the patriarchy, and embraced goals (like the acceptance of gay people by traditional religious institutions and the military) to which she was once at best indifferent. Instead of demanding "full-scale frontal assault" on dissident homosexuals, she speaks of working together.
At times, indeed, Ms. Vaid sounds strikingly like the Johnny-come-lately liberal, moderate and libertarian activists and writers (this reviewer included) whom she labels "gay conservatives." In stating that gay men and lesbians must "be willing . . . to expose the wildness of our subculture and be prepared to debate it honestly and question it thoroughly," that the gay ghetto can simply be "a more spacious closet" and that the movement should seek to educate straight people instead of ignoring or demonizing them, Ms. Vaid echoes core "gay conservative" concepts.
Yet "Virtual Equality" is, essentially, vintage Urvashi Vaid, proffering a vision of a "common, progressive movement" for social, economic and political revolution led by gay people, who, in her view (though not, it seems to me, in the view of most gay people themselves), embody a radical differentness that makes them the natural vanguard for revolution. And we need such revolution, she maintains, in order to transcend what she calls "virtual equality," the situation -- "at once marginal and mainstream, at once assimilated and irreconcilably queer," and at once accepted and vilified -- in which gay Americans now find themselves.
"Gay conservatives" consider the present state of affairs a transitional stage on the way to full social acceptance, which will be achieved only if the gay movement grows beyond extremism and confrontation and if gay people continue to come out of the closet and to give their straight friends and relatives courses, as it were, in Gay 101 (helping them to understand, among much else, that being gay does not necessarily mean being a revolutionary). According to Ms. Vaid, however, virtual equality has resulted from an excessive focus on "mainstreaming," and can only be overcome through "radical social change." Virtual equality, she says, will give way to real equality only if gay people "develop a movement courageous enough to articulate gay liberation's approaches" to issues like "the deficit, crime, public schools, housing, the role of government, national defense, welfare reform and the shrinkage of the work force." In other words, there are correct gay positions on every issue from Nafta to health care, and gay people need only to listen obediently when their leaders explain what those positions are.
Ms. Vaid, then, who at the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force could not even work out a coherent challenge to propaganda from the religious right (and who, in one of many errors in her book, confuses the Bill of Rights with the later amendments to the Constitution, which she dates at 1776), proposes to formulate both the goals and the strategy of a movement for comprehensive and well-nigh utopian "cultural transformation." She never gets very specific, however, about the nature of that transformation and the means by which she hopes to achieve it; she appears to think that in churning out vacuous sentences full of words like "organization," "mobilization" and "empowerment" she is actually saying something. Yet she is clear about who stands in her way: in straight America, her enemy is the white heterosexual overclass oppressor (she ignores the fact that it is in overclass communities that gay people are safest and most accepted); in gay America, her enemy is middle-class white males who, by insisting on "single-issue politics" -- that is, on a gay rights movement focused on gay rights -- fail to understand that for oppressed gay women, blacks and workers, sex, race and class are also gay issues. Issues, yes -- but gay issues?
 TO be sure, Ms. Vaid is aware enough of the recent sea change in gay politics to recognize that most readers will not cotton to her radical approach. Hence she proposes a compromise -- a coordinated two-tiered movement that would enable single-issue types to focus on gay rights while others pursue a "common movement" agenda. All this activity, she suggests, might be subsumed under an "umbrella organization" like Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. This is, of course, basically what the gay movement had in the Age of Vaid: many grass-roots people who did important and effective work toward understanding and acceptance, and a few national leaders who sent out a message of opposition to capitalism, religion and bourgeois values. Ms. Vaid is right to assert that "the gay movement needs a fundamental shift." But while more and more gay people realize that the required shift is one toward integration, education and conciliation, Ms. Vaid longs to return to the days of class struggle and liberation fronts. That her rhetoric has come to seem so old so fast is a measure of how gay political discourse -- outside the academy, anyway -- has been profoundly altered in a relatively brief time.
 
 
Green Mansion
 The last candle made of his bending face the ancient mask of a tyrant or a priest before it, too, winked out. Leon paused then as he always did, looking back on a world which only he ever saw. It spread away to every horizon, a tessellated land whose each plant was distinct yet thickly nested among its neighbors. Small water noises tinkled where voices had been muffled. Newt and terrapin nosed their way about invisible tanks while drops condensing inside an acre of cold glass pattered down on soil and leaves. Sometimes he could hear the tightly wound shoots of bamboos and lilies squeak as they thrust upwards. As his eyes adjusted, dabs and dots of green light marked patches of luminous fungi whose spores had arrived with the plants in their Wardian cases (along with mites and pests and noxious insects) and had thrived in the congenial warmth. And, as he waited still longer, a directionless radiance seeped into his eyes. It was so faint as to be without color, yet had an intensity of its own powerful enough to permeate the universe. This was starlight filtering through the thin layer of snow on the roof. From "Griefwork."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Lights! Camera! Auction!

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
FEW things in life can make your palms sweat, your heart beat faster and your otherwise keen ability to calmly assess the potential impact of an action temporarily vanish. One of those few things is a good old-fashioned auction.
And when the item on the auction block happens to be a piece of the American dream, and the dream looks as though it just could come true, even the most even-tempered bidder may notice that restraint and resolve are "going, going, gone!" 
 "I've seen people get some great deals at real estate auctions," said Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives. "I've also seen people get burned. Auctions are not for the faint hearted. The guiding rule is to be thoroughly prepared."
Indeed, Mr. Weinstein said, anyone hoping to buy property at an auction should know the type of auction he or she is attending and the terms of the sale.
Some auction sales, he said, are inherently risky and should be avoided by amateurs. Auctions resulting from foreclosure, for example, come with few guarantees.
"The party auctioning the property typically makes very few representations concerning the status of the property," he said. "The terms and conditions could be deadly. They often do not even contain a guarantee of occupancy. You could buy an apartment occupied by a tenant and it could take years to get the tenant out."
In fact, if the property being auctioned is rent regulated, it may be impossible to remove the tenant at all. "Even the pros occasionally get stuck," Mr. Weinstein said.
For many people, real estate auctions also conjure up conflicting emotions. Since auctions are often perceived as the final public insult leveled at property owners already at the end of their economic rope, the idea of trafficking in someone else's misfortune may to some people be somewhat distasteful, not to mention risky.
Not all auctions, though, are distress sales. Rob Doyle, principal auctioneer for Absolute Auction & Realty in Beacon, N.Y., said that homeowners frustrated by the time it can take to find a buyer sometimes turn to auctions in the hope of making a faster sale.
Auctions used as an alternative to conventional marketing are usually less risky and can result in true bargains for buyers who are willing to do their homework.
Howard L. Michaels, chairman of the Carlton Group, said that when his company conducts an auction, potential bidders can usually inspect the properties beforehand.
"We have open houses on three consecutive Sundays prior to the sale," Mr. Michaels said. In addition, he said, the company provides fact sheets containing pertinent details on each property being auctioned.
"Still, we encourage everyone to do their own independent investigation," he said.
Mr. Doyle, said the job of an auctioneer is to set the ground rules for the sale, answer questions and eliminate as many contingencies as possible before the actual auction. "You want to get all the bidders on a level playing field before the sale," he said.
Accordingly, he said, all potential bidders should be satisfied that they know exactly what they are bidding on and exactly what their responsibilities will be if they are successful. Generally, Mr. Doyle said, properties sold at a public auction are almost always sold "as is," with no mortgage contingency. Properties sold with owner-financing, he said, while less typical, often results in higher bids.
Auction property, he said, is sold "absolute" or "with reserve." Some auctioneers also have absolute auctions with minimum starting bids. "Absolute is a very powerful word," he said, explaining that in such a sale, the property will go to the highest bidder no matter how low that bid may be. A sale "with reserve," on the other hand, means that the seller retains the right to reject the highest bid if he or she chooses. If that happens, there is no sale.
Successful bidders at a real estate auction, Mr. Doyle said, must leave a deposit of 10 percent of the sale price on the day of the sale -- certified check is usually the required method of payment -- and must pay the balance within 30 days.
On Nov. 16 and 19, the Carlton Group Ltd., a real estate auction company based in Manhattan, will be auctioning 190 commercial and residential properties scattered throughout New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Included in the two-day extravaganza are 138 co-op apartments, 10 condominiums, an 11-unit hotel/motel, 12.5 acres of vacant land and an 85-slip marina. Opening bids start as low as $5,000. Previous sales held by the company have drawn as many as 1,000 bidders.
And on Wednesday, Sheldon Good & Company Auctions, a firm based in Chicago, will be holding a decidedly more intimate gathering. On the auction block that day will be a condominium apartment on the 46th floor of the Bristol Plaza at 200 East 65th Street -- a 2,700-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment with 10-foot ceilings and a 270-degree view. Bidding will start at $1.6 million.
James Samson, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in real estate, said that potential bidders for co-ops should be aware that the co-op board has a right to approve or reject a sale, even a sale made at auction. That presents less of a problem, he said, when it is the co-op itself that is selling the unit. "Unless there's something really wrong with the buyer, they're probably going to let the sale go through," he said.
In fact, Mr. Samson said, potential buyers who are willing to do their homework might find that co-ops being sold at auction can often be bought at bargain prices.
"If the reason an apartment is being auctioned is because people are scared of the building it could be that the building's problems are behind it," he said.
William Mannion, an auctioneer with the JP&R advertising agency in Manhattan, said that in many cases, potential bidders can find out much of what they need to know about a co-op apartment being auctioned by going to the building and asking questions. They should also obtain financial details, such as when the mortgage expires and whether the income from monthly maintenance is sufficient to keep the building in the black.
"The answers you get could make a deal that looked like a good one look bad," Mr. Mannion said. "But they can also make what looked like a bad deal look good."
In fact, most experts agree that the essential ingredients for making a smart buy at an auction are perseverance, knowledge and restraint.
"We went to auctions every weekend for a couple of years before we were successful," said Dean Bertolino, who, with his wife, Laura, recently purchased at auction a four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath colonial house in New City, N.Y.
Mr. Bertolino said that the house cost "a small fraction" of the about $300,000 that properties in the area are selling for.
"Anyone can do what we did," he said. "It means sacrificing a lot of weekends, going to see property after property, making notes, narrowing down the field and then being ready to walk away disappointed."

HEADLINE: After a Retreat, Gentrification Is Marching To the Fringes

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
FLORENCE NEAL fears her neighborhood is about to become an acronym.
"Please don't call us RedHo," she said, wincing at the thought of Red Hook becoming like SoHo (South of Houston Street) or TriBeCa (the Triangle Below Canal Street). 
 Ms. Neal, a sculptor, painter and graphic designer, was one of the first of a wave of artists who have moved in recent years to this bleak waterfront community of old warehouses, public housing projects and dilapidated town houses on the rump of southwestern Brooklyn.
She bought her four-story house at 353 Van Brunt Street in 1987 for $2,500 thanks to a city program that encourages artists to move into and, hopefully, improve low-income areas. She also estimates that she spent about $170,000 on labor and materials for the building, not to mention countless hours of sweat equity.
Today, Ms. Neal, 40, lives on the third and fourth floors of the building; she also has, from her roof, a million-dollar view of Lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty. She rents her second floor to other artists, charging about $800 a month for 1,100 square feet. She uses the first floor as a gallery, the Kentler International Drawing Space, and a studio.
"I can see the little espresso bars and cafes here someday," she said.
The process is gentrification. Young college-educated adults, often artists with the necessary construction skills, are priced out of the neighborhoods that had accommodated them in the past. So they buy or rent, and then renovate, cheap run-down housing, usually brownstones or lofts in unused industrial buildings.
Then come the bourgeoisie. Then the patisseries.
The gentrification phenomenon died, for the most part, in the late 80's in New York, largely because what few buyers there were for residential real estate narrowed their purchases to prime neighborhoods. For a while, what appeared to be a sort of degentrification even occurred in some areas, such as Manhattan Valley, above the Upper West Side on Central Park.
With the stabilization of the local economy in the last year or two, though, the buds of gentrification -- sometimes fertilized by less restrictive city zoning -- are again sprouting, to the chagrin of some, to be sure, on the city's rough-edged real estate frontiers, like the Bowery and Hell's Kitchen.
"There are islands in the city that had not gentrified that are now and others that are about to gentrify again," said Peter Marcuse, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University.
Red Hook, to be sure, is not about to become the next TriBeCa or even the next Williamsburg, a Brooklyn community where many artists, priced out of downtown Manhattan, settled in old warehouses in the 1980's
After all, the commercial activity along the Red Hook waterfront, from glass-blowing to breweries to apple-processing, is thriving and these warehouses are mostly one-story, low-density structures, as opposed to the multiareas like TriBeCa and Williamsburg.
"We get calls all the time for space," said Greg O'Connell, a developer and commercial landlord in Red Hook. "But the artists that are here are in one-family and two-family housing. And you don't even have that much of that. A lot of the housing here is in the low-income housing projects."
EVEN so, about 40 artists have taken root in recent years in Red Hook, where starting last summer there are now evening concerts on a barge at Pier 45.
"There is a bus that goes through Park Slope and Carroll Gardens and Brooklyn Heights and brings them down here," said Mr. O'Connell, who was a detective in SoHo during the 60's and saw the seeds of that neighborhood.
"It will be hard for many more artists to move here because there just isn't the kind of space they are looking for, and what is here isn't that cheap anymore," he said. "But you never know."
Red Hook -- a neighborhood so tough that local lore has it, apocryphally, perhaps, that it was the place where Al Capone got his scar -- isn't the sole frontier of gentrification these days. There is also Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass), an area roughly bordered by York Street, the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Cadman Plaza East, where several hundred artists live in long-abandoned factories.
More established but still embryonic areas of gentrification in Brooklyn include Williamsburg -- still -- and, to a lesser degree, perhaps, Greenpoint, where some artists have moved in the last decade. Across the Hudson River, there is Jersey City.
"Artists have been in Williamsburg for a while, but now they actually have a restaurant over there and everything," said Ms. Neal, who lived in Dumbo before moving to Red Hook.
In Manhattan, there is the Bowery, a street long synonymous with skid row. For decades, artists have lived there as well. In the last year or two, though, the street has become almost chic. Witness the Bowery Bar, a trendy cabaret that opened in a former gas station a few blocks north of Houston Street last year, in the neighborhood sometimes referred to as NoHo.
Further south on the Bowery, a few storefronts in on Prince Street, in a tiny geographical interregnum between Little Italy, the Lower East Side and Chinatown -- an area sardonically referred to by some as Esso (East of SoHo) -- lies the Connecticut Muffin Shop, which also has branch in New Canaan, Conn.
"At least once or twice a day, we get people stopping by here asking if there are any living spaces for rent," said Gary Crissey, the owner of the bakery, which opened seven years ago. "It started up about a year or two ago, and we keep getting more and more people who are curious about living here."
"The Bowery is amazing when you find out about the people who live above the stores, the artists, the dancers," he said. "The Bowery has always had some of these people living down here, but its been really growing lately."
Another Manhattan neighborhood making the transition from derelict to desirable is Hell's Kitchen, sometimes referred to as Clinton. Gentrification has been occurring in the neighborhood for years, but the pace seems to be picking up in recent years, local residents and real estate brokers say.
Alexandr Neratoff, an architect, recently bought a loft for his mother, Rimma, an artist, in the Armory, at 529 West 42d Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues, in Hell's Kitchen. The 1,200-square-foot space, which has a view of the Hudson River, cost $70,000 with a monthly maintenance of $1,400, about two-thirds of which is tax-deductible.
"I moved to SoHo in 1976 and sort of identified it back then as a place where things would happen," Mr. Neratoff said. "A few years ago, I thought the West Side was going to happen, so buying there seems to make sense."
He noted that a lot of the residential development activity in the Hell's Kitchen area began in the 80's -- projects like Riverbank West, at 555 West 42d Street, and the Strand, at 500 West 43d Street. "Things kind of stalled out for a while, but now it seems to be coming around again," he said.
"For a century, New York has been turning away from the waterfront," Mr. Neratoff added. "And now, New York, and a lot of cities, are returning."
NOT all the gentrification in New York is inspired by migrating artists. One of the most significant neighborhood resurrections in recent years has taken place in the Chelsea section of Manhattan and was largely spurred by the northward emigration of gays and lesbians from the crowded and expensive West Village. Indeed, Chelsea and the neighboring Flatiron District may have been the only areas of the city that substantially gentrified during the economic downturn from 1989 to 1993.
"As the real estate market tightens up, people are increasingly looking at neighborhoods that have been previously overlooked," said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the New York City Planning Commission.
He added that the city is also loosening its zoning restrictions in various commercial neighborhoods to help spark future gentrification. For example, the city recently changed the zoning on the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan north of 23d Street to allow more residential devlopment.
"What you are seeing is a willingness of the real estate market to look at places that in the past have looked unappealing," Mr. Rose said.
Similar changes were recently made in TriBeCa. "The zoning was designed to eliminate high-rise construction and have development complement the existing physical scale and historic fabric in the area," said John Young, a senior city planner.
In the East Village, which has now expanded into Avenues A and B, in what was once the Lower East Side or Alphabet City, young Japanese immigrants, as well as the seemingly inexorable spread of the Village eastward, have been the catalysts for a lesser degree of gentrification.
"I had never been to Avenue A until a year ago, and now you have tour buses, and people think it is fun to look at the skinheads and kids with tattoos and body piercing," said Mary Hiatt, president of the Business of the East Village Association. "In '89, they didn't come near Avenue A. Now, they come and take pictures."
Proximity to a popular neighboring community is often a key factor in gentrification. Manhattan Valley, for example, became a spill-over for those priced out of the Upper West Side. And though the strip of apartments along Central Park above 100th Street to 110th Street and the blocks west to Broadway seemed to revert back to their crime and drug-infested past during the early 90's, regentrification now seems possible.
"Eventually, practically all of Manhattan, south of the northern edge of Central Park, will be gentrified, all the way down to the Battery, and that includes the Lower East Side," said Peter D. Salins, a professor of planning at Hunter College and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.
"Of course eventually might mean the year 2025," he added.
Mr. Salins, who is known as the father of modern Hoboken, N.J., for his work with officials there to help gentrify that city in the late 1970's and early 1980's, said that gentrification usually never stops once it starts.
"It still isn't done in Park Slope, in Cobble Hill, in Carroll Gardens," he said of three Brooklyn neighborhoods that underwent widespread gentrification in the 1980's.
As for the mixed results in Hoboken, Mr. Salins said that town has remained a second-tier site of gentrification. "It didn't attract as many of the classic yuppie, two-income couples as we thought it would," he said. "Instead, there are more singles and people who earn less money, and that's one of the reasons why you have so many bars and pubs over here."
Moreover, he said that most gentrified areas tend to have been born from spillovers from other gentrified neighborhoods, and Hoboken, on the other side of the Hudson River, is isolated in that respect.
Mr. Salins also said that the major change between gentrification in most areas today and 20 years ago is that it tends to occur more in industrial areas and often involves non-artists. "It doesn't have to be a brownstone," he said. "Location is more important than building type."
As for the city's plan to restrict adult-oriented businesses to areas like the Hell's Kitchen and Brooklyn waterfronts, neighborhoods that are just beginning to gentrify, Mr. Rose said that these parts of New York are actually more protected from such businesses under the new ordinance than they have been.
"Even in areas where these businesses will be allowed, there will be serious restrictions," he said.
Not everyone, of course, is pleased with gentrification.
Renters in neighborhoods that are improved often suddenly find themselves priced out of communities where they have been raised. Even those who can afford to stay may feel culturally estranged from the newcomers, who are usually better educated and enjoy different types of leisure activities.
IN some neighborhoods, there is even organized resistance to gentrification. In the East Village, for instance, there is a local organization called RAGE-ON! -- Revolt Against Gentrification Erasing Our Neighborhood.
And Mr. Marcuse noted that the process of deterioration is continuing in many other neighborhoods in New York even as gentrification spreads in others.
"It adds to the polarization of the city," he said.
For the most part, though, the changes are welcome evidence of a recovery, albeit modest, in the city's residential real estate market.
"Gentrification absolutely lives," said Barbara Krongel, a broker with Harborview Realty in Brooklyn. "It slowed down after the stock market crash, but it is accelerating again now. We're even getting people taking fixer-uppers again. And if you saw Carroll Gardens now compared to 10 years ago, you wouldn't recognize it."
She noted that rents in many of these gentrified areas in Brooklyn have come back to their 1987 highs.
A two-bedroom floor-through apartment in Cobble Hill that rented for $1,400 to $1,600 a month in 1986 and fell to $900 or $1,000 a month in 1991 now rents for $1,400 to $1,600 again, Ms. Krongel said.
Sale prices have also rebounded. A two- to four-family four-story house in Cobble Hill that would probably have sold for $550,000 in 1987, but only $350,000 in 1991, might now be back up to $550,000, Ms. Krongel said.
"Sometimes, these things happen very slowly," she added. "You almost don't notice these changes until they are done."

Savage Inequalities

 BODY:
Marilyn J. Morheuser, the lawyer at the center of a 13-year court struggle to make New Jersey's school-financing system more equitable for its poorest districts, died last Sunday at the age of 71 after a long bout with cancer. A tough-spoken former nun, she became a single-minded crusader for schoolchildren in what the State Supreme Court, in its first Abbott v. Burke decision in 1990, called the "special-needs districts."
What follows is an excerpt from her testimony before the Legislature in June 1992 on a proposed amendment to the State Constitution that would have wiped out the court's decision by nullifying the requirement that New Jersey provide a "thorough and efficient" education to every child. The lawmakers never put the amendment on the ballot. 
 In recent months, a message that exploded on all of us from Los Angeles has taken hold. National polls show a heightened public recognition that we can no longer afford to neglect the poor -- especially poor youth -- whom we have abandoned in the nation's cities.
New Jersey is now in a unique position to serve as a beacon for the nation. With the Supreme Court decision in Abbott II, this state stands on the brink of showing the nation how to bring hope back to the cities, how to provide little children with a way out of the cycle of poverty, how to provide trained employees who will help fuel the state's economy.
Rather than embarking on an enterprise aimed at nullifying it, we should be working together to devise a means to implement that decision and, at the same time, to assure excellent education to all New Jersey children.
As a prelude to the 21st century, nullification of the Abbott decree is not only counterintuitive, it is a rejection of the politics of inclusion, and it is contrary to basic self-interest. In New Jersey by the year 2000, 40.2 percent of all children and youth under age 18 will be what we now call minorities. That population is predominantly African-American and Hispanic. Two-thirds of those children comprise the resident enrollment of the special needs districts.
Today I ask you to consider the impact of the proposed amendment on 21 of the 30 special-needs districts, including the state's largest urban school districts. For nine districts, funding would increase by less than 5 percent, with 2 1/2 percent for New Brunswick and a little over 3 percent for Jersey City. But in 12 districts, including Newark, Paterson, Trenton, Long Branch, Asbury Park and Neptune, funding would decrease. Paterson, a state-operated district, would have $5.7 million less in state and local funding than it will have next year. Newark would lose $31.6 million; Trenton, nearly $5 million.
This kind of reduced spending level will decimate long-needed program improvements which are just getting started. Teachers by the hundreds, who have waited so long to see those improvements, will lose their jobs. Those teachers who aren't let go will have increases in the size of their classes, which are already overlarge. And what of the children?
What you should know about the Abbott decision is that it was not based on liberal, bleeding-heart appeals to morality. It was based on the record bullt during a nine-month trial, the largest record ever compiled in a school finance challenge. The proofs established who the poor children of New Jersey are, the educational needs they bring to school with them and the total incapacity of districts to meet those needs. Educators from both urban and suburban districts showed through testimony and documents what schools must offer to prepare children to compete in the marketplace and to fully function as citizens and what poor districts cannot offer. It was this record which convinced the court.
All of this, finally, is not to say that your only concern in financing public school education must be in meeting the Abbott mandates for poor districts. When I analyze the impact of proposed legislation or constitutional amendments, that must be my concern, for the children in the special needs districts are Education Law Center's clients. However, I too recognize that the Quality Education Act has visited hardships on other than the special-needs districts.
The amendment before you, however, is hardly the way to correct a bad statute. Indeed, amending the Constitution may visit on you more costly litigation. I will leave it to others to spell out for you the legal challenge you may be inviting. After all, I'm only a simple country lawyer. So I will leave you with some simple country wisdom: Look before you leap into that cow pasture.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
State Securities Chiefs Are Under the Gun

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
THESE are tough times for state securities regulators. Many are facing tight budgets from legislatures. And in Washington, some lawmakers are supporting a bill proposed by Jack Fields, Republican of Texas, that would strip state regulators of some powers.
These facts should concern business executives and investors, according to Dee Harris, Arizona's chief securities regulator and the newly elected president of the regulators' umbrella group, the North American Securities Administrators Association. In an interview, Mr. Harris spoke about the importance of states in securities regulation and warned that cutbacks would leave many defrauded investors with few avenues of redress. KURT EICHENWALD
 
Q. What is it that the states do that's different from Federal regulators?
 
A. Let's take enforcement. In general, the Securities and Exchange Commission, because of its limited staff, tends to focus on large cases. They want at least $1 million in losses, usually. The states don't have any choice but to look at almost everything that comes in. We get complaints all the time by people just walking in and saying, "I think I've been ripped off."
If an elderly woman walks in and says, "I've just been cleaned out of my life's savings," we can't say, "Sorry, it was less than $1 million, we're not interested." The S.E.C. does have the luxury of saying that because they're not the only game in town. They can say, go to your friendly state regulator, and they know that's good advice because they know we will, by and large, take an interest.
Moreover, a higher proportion of our cases probably are criminal cases. The S.E.C. generally is an agency which, in accordance with the statutes, conducts civil cases and administrative cases. Occasionally, they will refer a matter to the United States Attorney, but, by and large, it is a civil enforcement agency.
The states also do administrative cases and civil cases, but we're much more likely to find that the things were so egregious that they merit criminal prosecution. So I would guess that a greater proportion are criminal cases, and in the aggregate, we bring about 10 times as many enforcement actions every year as the S.E.C.
Now that's also because we have more resources and because we are in a lot of places the S.E.C. seldom gets to. Most states do not have an office of the S.E.C. or an office of the National Association of Securities Dealers. So the complaints tend to come to us first.
 
Q. What about the state laws for registering securities? What significance do they have?
 
A. I think the state securities laws play a very important role. They are part of the fabric of securities regulation in the United States.
Our statutes tend to be somewhat stronger in the area of registration of securities offerings. Most large offerings, most national offerings, are exempt in almost every state. So we're tending to look at smaller offerings right on down to very tiny offerings of a few hundred thousand dollars. Many of those offerings are for emerging companies, which tend not to have much of a financial history, may not have yet achieved profitability and they require close scrutiny.
And our statutes tend to be stronger with respect to the discretion of the securities administrator than, for instance, the Securities Act of 1933 on the Federal level. We can say this appears to be a very severe conflict of interest involving an offer or that could harm investors.
 
 Q. So it's not just the disclosure standard they have on the Federal level. You ask issuers to justify what they do.
 
 A. Yes. Many states simply have a disclosure standard, but a good number of states also have a standard that allows them to ask issuers to justify their decisions. And we don't approach that process with hostility toward these companies unless, of course, they're being put together by people that we know are convicted securities swindlers.
 
 Q. What about the rules on licensing brokers and investment advisers? How do they differ from the Federal standards?
 
 A. In a given jurisdiction, there will be people who are not permitted to become licensed as registered representatives, or investment advisers who are in fact registered Federally or are members of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
It's not a criticism of those agencies, it's just that we have statutes which permit us to say that we believe that someone has a bad disciplinary history and should not be permitted to become licensed in our state. Day in and day out we make the decision that people who are active in the industry someplace should not be active in our states.
Most state statutes require investment advisers to meet some standards, require the passage of an examination. We have a state exam, called the Series 65, which is about ethical and legal requirements for investment advisers. So we require those examinations, we require financial statements to see if this person is solvent.
 
Q. There's a lot of talk in Washington about changing the way that this works. The bill from Congressman Fields has been particularly prominent. What is your organization's position on the Fields bill?
 
A. We believe that change, reasonable change, rational change is healthy. We're certainly willing and desirous of exploring the whole issue of what should be the proper role of the Federal Government in regulating securities activities and what should be the proper role of the states. We have appointed a task force to do just this kind of analysis.
 
 Q. Staying on the Fields bill again, what is it that the bill would do from the viewpoint of the states?
 
 A. It eliminates much of the state fee revenue. We get fees for registering investment advisers and we get fees for registering investment companies. All that revenue would be gone, and while that's more of an issue for governors and state legislatures, I think we can see that the appropriations to the states securities divisions are not likely to remain at their present levels if the legislatures figure out that they're no longer getting the fee revenue they were getting.
That means that the other things we do, the enforcement work, the inspections that we perform on investment advisers and broker dealers, the analysis of prospectuses and disclosure documents, all of that work would have a less likely funding source. So that's the first thing it does is to threaten the financial underpinnings of state securities regulation.
Secondly, it would prohibit state legislatures from setting standards for people in the industry. Remember I said before that we may decide that someone who is registered as a broker-dealer or a registered representative or investment adviser someplace in the country, should not be licensed in our jurisdiction because they may simply have such a long disciplinary history. Well, it would prohibit us from making those decisions. It would say basically that if you can manage to become licensed with the N.A.S.D. or the S.E.C., then the states have to take you.
Another troubling area is that it would require states, instead of enforcing state securities laws now in administrative forums, to go into Federal court to enforce Federal law. One of the problems is that we believe state legislatures are not likely for very long to keep in place state securities enforcement units for the purpose of enforcing Federal law. I think they're going to see that as an unfunded Federal mandate.
If you rip away that state enforcement capability, you really must think about replacing it with a much larger S.E.C., and I don't think that's about to happen. In fact, the S.E.C.'s budget looks like it will be cut. So we believe that the Fields bill needs considerable refinement to be workable.
 
 Q. If it does become law, what will that mean for the states and S.E.C., and second, for the investors?
 
 A. Let me take the investors first. I think what it means for investors is that they will have substantially less protection than they currently have, and I think that's bad for the country.
The United States enjoys the strongest capital markets in the world, and I think those markets are part of the reason we have such a strong economy. Those markets are based on investors knowing that there is a cop on the beat. Well, we constitute some of the cops and, in fact, we constitute a big proportion of the total number of cops. If we're gone, I think investors will find it's a lot harder to get someone to listen to their complaints unless they have very, very large losses.
I think there will be a lot less proactive work done, that is, there will be less effort to stop problems before they happen because there will be less resources. I think investors will find that they have to write to Washington or to some city in another state, to the S.E.C., and it may be a long time, if ever, before they get an answer. Even if they get an answer, it won't necessarily lead to any action. So I think both investors and the markets have a great deal at stake here.
In terms of the states, I guess what it means is that we'll do our best. If this legislation is passed and it says that we all have to learn all the nuances of Federal law and become familiar with the Federal court system, we'll do our best to do that. I hope the legislatures will continue to fund our activities. I seriously doubt it, so I think it means that maybe over a period of three to five years, state securities regulation will simply wither away. And virtually the only people who benefit from that are those who wish to commit securities fraud.

Quebec Vote Creates Market Uncertainty

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
AMERICAN investors probably do not need any more reasons to stay out of Canada. The country's economy is shaky, unemployment remains stubbornly high and both consumers and the Government are carrying too much debt.
"Canada is undergoing the usual social tensions that occur when you try to cut the deficit while a recession is going on," said Don Cassidy, senior research analyst at Lipper Analytical Services, Summit, N.J. 
 Now, add the latest uncertainty: whether residents of Quebec, the largest province, want to remain part of Canada. In a referendum about sovereignty that remains too close to call, five million voters of the predominantly French province will go to the polls tomorrow. The outcome could affect the economy and financial markets of the entire country, if not the continent.
To what degree the impact of a separatist victory would spread beyond the provincial economy is unclear, said George D. Vasic, a strategist and economist at Bunting Warburg, a Toronto investment bank. Foreign investors hold about one-quarter of Canada's $550 billion debt, and Quebec contributes a like amount of Canada's gross domestic product. At issue is whether foreign investors will hold on to Canadian paper, and whether Quebec would assume its share of the nation's overall borrowings. Either variable could greatly influence the country's ability to continue to grow.
A final outcome will not be known even after Monday's votes are counted. The referendum simply calls for provincial politicians to negotiate a "new economic and political partnership" with Canada. If a satisfactory partnership is not achieved -- which might require another vote -- the province could move to separate from Canada, perhaps requiring yet another election.
Adding to the confusion, last week two groups that have native land claims in northern Quebec voted overwhelmingly to remain part of Canada. What makes the sentiment voiced by the Cree Indian and Inuit nations unique is that while they account for a mere 1 percent of the population, they lay claim to roughly half of the province's land area -- some 300,000 square miles of territory. Their claims are certain to be contested if Quebec tries to secede.
Investors dislike uncertainty, and voiced their feelings last week by punishing Canadian stocks. The Toronto Stock Exchange index of 300 companies, the most watched stock index in Canada, fell 103.03 points, or 2.3 percent, to 4335.30.
That leaves the benchmark 7.9 percent below its peak for the year, in July. After tracking the performance of the United States stock market for much of the year, Canada's equity markets took a downturn in midsummer, while American stocks surged to new highs through September and October.
"That might have been due to building concern about the Quebec situation," said Michael Smedley, chief executive of Maxwell Meighen & Associates, and co-manager of three Canadian closed-end funds, the largest of which is the $200 million Canadian General Investments fund. "But we've had a tremendous run in the natural resource sector."
The last couple of months, he said, represent "primarily a period of pause and correction" rather than a wholesale turn in the fortune of a market that has performed admirably this year and over the last three years. Two years ago, the Canadian market began far outperforming its neighbor to the south, and only this year did the American equity market catch up.
Much of last week's selling, Mr. Smedley said, came from international accounts rather than Canadian individual or institutional investors, suggesting simply "a short-term condition." Allowing that a "yes" vote in Monday's election would have negative consequences, particularly for international debt markets, he said that "it would also open up a tremendous investment opportunity."
In the end, though, Quebec will probably not separate from Canada, Mr. Smedley said. "The French Canadian who might have a separatist sentiment will have to ask himself if he really wants lower market values, lower job prospects, or if he's not concerned with the question of what passport and currency he will will use," he said. The block of 5 percent to 13 percent "undecided" voters in recent polls, which show the electorate rather evenly divided otherwise, is largely made up of "the fringe 'yes' man who will actually vote 'no,' " he said.
And Mr. Smedley still finds plenty of Canadian stocks that he says will prosper even if Quebec eventually separates. Among them is Bombardier Inc., a Montreal company that makes heavy equipment, including jet aircraft, motor bikes, snowmobiles and some of the subway cars used by New York City.
Canadian General Investments, which trades on the Toronto and London exchanges, but not in the United States, produced a total return in the first nine months of 1995 of 8.6 percent in American dollars, according to Lipper Analytical.
The largest open-end fund sold to Americans who want to invest in Canada, Fidelity Investments' Canada fund, with assets of $357.4 million at the end of September, underperformed the Canadian market in 1993 and 1994. But the fund has closely tracked the Toronto index this year, producing a total return, in American dollars, of 14.8 percent in the first nine months. Investors' gain have been trimmed this month, however, for a year-to-date gain of 5.6 percent.
A smaller option is the Ivy Canada fund, distributed through Mackenzie Funds of Boca Raton, Fla. With just $20 million in assets, Ivy Canada is too small to be included in this newspaper's mutual fund listings. The fund, which carries a 5.75 percent load and annual expenses of more than 2 percent, is down 7.4 percent so far in 1995.
In short, American investors who want to invest in Canada through mutual funds have limited options. Given the recent performance of the market there, and the uncertainty that lies ahead, that may not be all bad.

THE BUDGET
Balancing Act at Center Stage
Ultimately, the Federal budget will be written in negotiations between the White House and Republican leaders in Congress. But leading to that denouement is a dramatic script. Act I: the House and Senate pass bills to balance the budget in seven years, largely by cutting taxes, sharply limiting spending on Medicare and turning much of welfare over to the states. Act II: President Clinton vetoes whatever the House-Senate conference comes up with, pronouncing it too extreme. Act III: Congress lacks the votes to overturn the veto, and talks begin.
The rhetoric flowed freely during the debates. The Republicans said the bill would "save the country and save the next generation." The Democrats said the plan was "a travesty on the American people" that was morally wrong and economically wrong. Stay tuned.
 
REGULATION
The Secret Sharers
Punctuating the S.E.C.'s desire to clean up municipal finance, Merrill Lynch and Lazard Freres agreed to pay more than $20 million to settle charges that they had agreed to split secret fees that the former paid for business provided by the latter. Mark S. Ferber, a former Lazard partner, was indicted on 63 charges, including wire fraud and attempted extortion, and Lazard said it was saddened by his "apparent violation of the firm's ethical standards."
 
NEWSLETTERS
Gazarelli Is Recruited
 Building its stable of newsletters, Phillips Publishing has recruited Elaine Gazarelli, the former Lehman Brothers strategist, to write a newsletter. Famous for calling the 1987 market crash, Ms. Gazarelli left Lehman a year ago and started her own firm in Boca Raton, Fla. Phillips recently bought The Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors and The T. Rowe Price Adviser, and publishes nine other investment newsletters, including Ken and Daria Dolan's Straight Talk on Your Money.

LABOR
No More Road Kill
After telling union members that labor had become a patsy repeatedly victimized by management, John J. Sweeney won election as president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and promised to use aggressive tactics to make sure workers would no longer be treated like "so much road kill."
 
ON LEAVE
'I Have Nothing to Hide'
Dan Dorfman took a leave of absence from Money magazine after Business Week reported that Federal prosecutors were looking into his relationship with a stock promoter. Frank Lalli, Money's managing editor, said he believed Mr. Dorfman had not violated any laws; he also said he had asked the general counsel of Time Warner, which owns Money, to investigate. Mr. Dorfman, who has been writing a column for Money since January, said on his daily commentary on the CNBC cable network: "I have nothing to hide. I have done nothing wrong and I have nothing to be ashamed of."
 
CONGLOMERATES
Shamu Yes, LaRussa No
Yet another company has concluded that diversification, which seemed so right in the 80's, is wrong. Anheuser-Busch said it would sell the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team, which plays in Busch Stadium, as well as Eagle snack foods, in order to concentrate on brewing and its Sea World and Busch Gardens theme parks.
 
TAXES
Whew!
The I.R.S.'s plan to begin a round of extensive audits, including the returns of more than 92,000 individual taxpayers, appears to be dead in the face of public resentment and Republican opposition. The agency said the audits were needed to develop statistical profiles of likely cheaters but could not be done because its tax enforcement budget had been reduced.
 
INNKEEPING
Understaying Your Welcome
The Hyatt and Westin hotels said they would start charging a $50 fee at most of their hotels for guests who check out a day or more early. Hilton, Radisson and ITT Sheraton said guests would continue to pay only for the days and nights they stay.

HEADLINE: How to Succeed? Go to Wellesley

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
DETROIT and cars, Hollywood and films, Silicon Valley and chips. It's hard to think of one without the other. Here's a new link in the business landscape. Henceforth, when you hear Wellesley, Mass., the home of Wellesley College, think of top-level executive women.
More than any other college -- large or small -- Wellesley has groomed women who shatter the glass ceiling. Wellesley women take up far more seats in executive suites and corporate boardrooms than their numbers suggest they should have. They are overrepresented, too, at places like the Harvard business school, a fountainhead for occupants of the nation's corner offices. 
 To cite just a few of Wellesley's major achievers, there's Lois D. Juliber, '71, president of Colgate North America; Ellen R. Marram, '68, president of the Seagram Beverage Group; Shirley Young, '55, a vice president of General Motors, and Marion O. Sandler, '52, co-chief executive of Golden West Financial, a large savings and loan association.
Influencing business policy, there is Alicia Munnell, '64, a top Treasury Department official recently nominated to the Council of Economic Advisers. And of course there's Hillary Rodham Clinton, '69, the once and future corporate lawyer and director.
Just how does Wellesley, a school of only 2,200 students, do it?
This good fortune certainly wasn't planned, college officials said. Wellesley's outstanding record stems from -- in addition to bright students -- a strong, popular economics department; a dynamic professor, Carolyn Shaw Bell, who taught at the college from 1950 to 1989; and programs that encourage networking among alumnae and between alumnae and students, people said. Wellesley, in fact, could be an inspiration to other colleges that want to help their graduates go where few women have gone before, into the business world's upper echelons.
Evidence for the Wellesley edge abounds, starting with the number of companies that look to Wellesley for executive women. In 1994, 75 companies recruited at its leafy campus west of Boston, far exceeding the number at similar-sized elite colleges like Smith and Amherst.
Some executive recruiters say they sense that Wellesley women know how to really succeed in business. "I have always felt this was true, and I've always said I want my two daughters to go to Wellesley," said Julie Daum of Spencer Stuart, a big search firm.
Several studies lend credence to a "Wellesley factor." When Business Week magazine named the "50 Top Women in Business" in 1992, four went to the school. Only one other college claimed more than one spot on the roster -- the University of Wisconsin, which matched Wellesley's four but which also has six and a half times as many women students.
Of the 390 women who serve as directors of the Fortune 500 companies, at least 17 went to Wellesley -- more than any other college -- according to Catalyst, a women's advocacy group (headed, it happens, by a Wellesley graduate, Sheila Wellington).
And Carol A. Scott found evidence in her 1992 survey of America's senior executive women. Asked by The New York Times to look at the colleges attended by those women, she found 8 Wellesley graduates among the 439 respondents. That is 64 times Wellesley's share of the female college population and more than any other college except the University of California at Berkeley (with 9, but also five times as many women students).
"I thought you were out of your mind when you called, but I see that there's something to it," said Ms. Scott, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles's Graduate School of Management.
And don't forget Wellesley's position as a dominant supplier of women to the Harvard business school. In 1975, for example, Wellesley sent more women to the Harvard business school than any other college. Twenty years later, Wellesley graduates still made up the biggest contingent from any women's college, though by then Harvard and Dartmouth were sending a few more proportionately.
Success, of course, breeds success. "There's a self-reinforcing mechanism at work in terms of student selection and faculty recruitment," explained Victor Fuchs, an economist at Stanford University who wrote "Women's Quest for Economic Equality."
Indeed, many Wellesley women are now feeding into the pipeline that leads up to the executive office. All told, about a third of Wellesley's graduates go into the business world, more than any other career.
As an all-female school, Wellesley starts with an edge. Numerous studies show that graduates of women's colleges, compared with women graduates of coeducational institutions, develop higher levels of self-esteem and do better in their careers.
But when it comes to business, Wellesley still outdoes its rivals -- a thought that raises hackles among some of them. "When you look around at the Seven Sisters, I think you'll find similar results," said Barbara Reinhold, director of the career development office at Smith.
True, of those elite traditionally women's colleges, Vassar can claim Geraldine Laybourne, president of the Nickelodeon network, while Smith can boast of Rochelle B. Lazarus, president of Ogilvy & Mather North America, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, director of the White House's National Economic Council. Columbia's Barnard College has Phyllis Grann, chief executive of the Putnam Publishing Group. And Radcliffe College at Harvard has Joan T. Bok, chairman of the New England Electric System, and Lisa Henson, president of Columbia Pictures.
YET none of these colleges -- nor any other college or university -- has produced proportionately as many corporate women in high positions as Wellesley. Neither Smith nor Barnard nor Radcliffe produced a list that matched Wellesley's.
Vassar conceded the point. "Recruiters do say that Wellesley students are very business-oriented," said Clare D. Graham, director of career development. "Our alums have tended to have a focus in communications and the arts."
Wellesley's president, Diana Walsh, cannot explain precisely how Wellesley came to produce graduates who ascend to jobs like senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Margaret Yeo, '64) and executive vice president of Bloomingdale's (Christine Miller, '66).
Ms. Walsh cited the school's past as the key ingredient. "Wellesley has a history of women's rights, a culture of women struggling to succeed in a man's world," she said.
Many graduates agreed that Wellesley's culture influenced them mightily. Many also credited the grounding they got at Wellesley's economics department, which was recently ranked No. 2 (according to the traditional standard, published citations of its members' academic work), behind Williams, among the liberal arts colleges in a study by Michael Robinson of Mount Holyoke College. Ms. Bell has retired, but the department still has widely respected teachers like Marshall Goldman.
Uncommonly for a women's school, economics is usually Wellesley's most popular major, or at least second. And that is a longstanding phenomenon, not a product of the go-go 1980's, which lured many bright students into business.
More important, "Wellesley has Carolyn Bell, who within the school set a model," said Margaret Hennig, dean of the Simmons Graduate School of Business. "She made it legitimate even during the antibusiness period, the hippie period, for Wellesley women to get involved with economics and business. She obviously influenced enormous numbers of women."
And they agree. Ms. Marram, of Seagram, remembered the first meeting, in 1989, of Wellesley's Business Leadership Council, a group of 93 high-powered alumnae. "A bunch of us sat around after dinner, and soon we were all talking about Carolyn Bell," she said. "She was a fierce promoter of Wellesley economics graduates. She used to tell us that we should brag, that we should let people know what we can do."
To that, Ms. Bell, a graduate of Mount Holyoke who at 75 still writes a monthly column for The Boston Globe, pleads guilty. But she says she "never pushed any particular field for people."
"It was a personal value that any woman should be able to support herself and her children, whether or not she has to," Ms. Bell said. "Wellesley produced women who were responsible for themselves, and that may have helped."
Whatever it was, it worked. Marsha Williams, for example, was majoring in archeology until she ran into Ms. Bell. "She made economics come alive," said Ms. Williams, now treasurer of the Amoco Corporation. "It made me not be afraid of being unable to hold my own in a business setting."
Wellesley also tries to expose students to the business world. Ten years ago, it started a program called "Wall Street Warm-Up." It takes 20 to 30 students a year to Manhattan, stationing each with a Wellesley graduate in a brokerage or investment bank.
Whether it is for their first job or years later, Wellesley graduates use these contacts. Some networking is formal, through the Business Leadership Council, which began as a forum for busy graduates to help the school, but quickly became a place where members compared notes about work.
BUT much more of this power-networking is informal, a matter of keeping in touch by women like Adele Morrissette, '77, a director at Cowen & Company, a Manhattan investment bank. She is not a member of the leadership council. Nor did she go to Wellesley with a business career in mind. By the time she was a junior or senior, however, "I knew there were a lot of Wellesley women in business and that they were breaking barriers," she said.
When it came time to look for a job, Ms. Morrissette met Donna Ecton, '69, now chief executive of Business Mail Express Inc., who was recruiting for the Chemical Bank. "She really championed me," said Ms. Morrissette, who took the job, then got an M.B.A. "I would not be a Wall Street investment banker, were it not for her."
Ms. Morrissette keeps up with several Wellesley women, calling on a former client, Robin Smith, '61, the president of Publishers Clearing House, as a mentor; trading information with an alumna employed by a venture capital firm, and steering Cowen to a search firm run by Patricia Morrill, a Wellesley graduate.
This kind of mutual support happens all the time. Ms. Juliber, for example, joined the board of the State Street Boston Corporation after Nannerl O. Keohane, a former Wellesley president who is now president of Duke University and a member of both the leadership council and State Street's board, recommended her.
No wonder, then, that Wellesley graduates keep turning up in corporate circles. And because few colleges have picked up on Wellesley's bottom-line success -- only a couple, like Simmons College, have started groups for alumnae in business -- Wellesley may well remain a mother lode of executive women for a while to come.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
A Derivatives Caution, in Time For Halloween

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THOUGH the derivatives debacle in Orange County, Calif., is receding from investors' minds, the crisis is not likely to be the last of its type, says a report by Ernst & Young, the accounting firm.
Derivatives have a sullied name, not only because they forced Orange County into bankruptcy, but also because they caused losses in bond funds and money market funds last year. Broadly speaking, derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from the value of an underlying financial asset or index. They can be simple or very complex and are used to hedge risks, to reduce borrowing costs or to speculate on the direction of markets. 
 To see if more problems lurk in the derivatives arena, Ernst distributed questionnaires to 400 investment management complexes in Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Ireland and the United States. It received 143 responses.
Ernst's findings could give securities regulators a good scare before Halloween. The study, titled "Derivatives Usage by Investment Funds," found that nearly a third of the funds used some derivatives and that more than 60 percent lacked a supervisory board or risk management committee to set limits on derivatives usage. Moreover, few of the companies' boards were familiar with complex financial instruments or risk management.
"The growing reliance on derivative products, coupled with the lack of sophisticated monitoring techniques, should be a concern of many fund complexes," Ernst concluded.
 
Doing Good
The Devcap Shared Return Fund is a new fund that lets shareholders both invest in a portfolio of "socially responsible" companies and make a tax-deductible donation each year to charity.
Investors designate a portion of their returns for charities that provide money to the working poor who have fledgling enterprises in developing nations. An investor can specify that 50 percent to 100 percent of the return be donated.
Development Capital Fund, the sponsor, is a consortium of international development agencies formed in 1992. It includes Save the Children, Catholic Relief Services and the Seed Capital Development Fund.
The fund will build a portfolio that tracks the Domini Social Index, which mimics the sector weighting of the general stock market but screens out companies with a poor record on environmental issues, with labor practice problems or with business in the weapons industry. The index contains about 400 companies in the United States.
 
A Departure at Govett
Garrett R. Van Wagoner is leaving the top-performing Govett Smaller Companies fund at the end of the year. The star manager led the fund through a period of rapid growth to $550 million in assets, and his departure casts doubt on whether Govett & Company will follow through on its plan to sell Govett Asset Management, its United States subsidiary. Govett officials said that Mr. Van Wagoner would open his own money management firm and that they had yet to decide who would replace him.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Nintendo? Bogus. But Investing? Bonus!

BYLINE: By ANNA D. WILDE 

 BODY:
JARED DECOTEAU takes his investing seriously. He has called the Charles Schwab toll-free number so often for stock prices that some of the operators greet him by name. He reads Barron's, Forbes, Worth and Money and has spent hours daily hunched over computer screens glowing with company data.
But he had to cut back, hobbled by a demanding new day job: ninth grade. "High school started this year," the 14-year-old says, "so I've been doing a lot with high school." 
 Jared, whose diverse portfolio is worth about "two and a half years" at an Ivy League school, which now costs roughly $60,000, is one of a growing group of precocious investors who are playing the market at an age when most of their peers are more interested in playing Nintendo.
According to a survey by Teenage Research Unlimited, about 17 percent of youths aged 12 through 19 say they own stocks or bonds. That percentage hasn't changed much since the survey started in 1992, but experts in children's finance say they are seeing more youngsters who want to invest.
In a survey by James U. McNeal, a professor of marketing at Texas A & M University, the number of children aged 11 and 12 who said they were saving or investing jumped from almost none in 1990 to about 10 percent last year.
There are many resources and services for small-fry speculators, although experts caution that children shouldn't overdo it. They remind parents that, after all, their kids are still kids. There are books about money, summer investing camps, and special mutual funds for kids. A Stein Roe fund for young people, started in April 1994, has about 9,300 investors. Young Americans Bank, a subsidiary of the Young Americans Educational Foundation, is a Denver-based bank for children only, accepting no customers older than 21. It offers checking and savings accounts and has even lent money for cheerleader uniforms and bicycles. Last November, it started offering mutual fund seminars to its 18,000 customers and their parents.
"Kids are more and more conscious of the concept that you really have to think about what you're going to do with your money," says Gail Yumkas, who plans to expand her Baltimore-based money-management summer camp to sites around the country.
Among other factors, educators attribute the rise in investing by children to an increased classroom focus on market issues and to baby-boomers' worries that their children will live in a financially insecure world. A survey on children and money posted on the Prodigy on-line service last November got 34,000 responses from parents, more than 90 percent in favor of financial education for their children, says the children's finance author Neale S. Godfrey, who prepared the survey for Prodigy.
Today, parents feel "it's very different from the Donna Reed world we grew up in," Ms. Godfrey says. "The boomers are saying, 'We have to raise our kids to be financially responsible.' "
Some educators are responding to that need. About 30 states were requiring economic or financial education in 1993, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group for mutual funds. A growing number of schools are also offering higher-level classes in economics: 22,500 high school students took the College Board's advanced placement economics tests last year, up from 5,800 when they were introduced in 1989.
The Security Industry Association's 18-year-old Stock Market Game has grown to include about 650,000 students in 48 states, up from 550,000 just a year ago. The Chicago Board of Trade's eight-year-old Commodity Challenge, an investment game for high schoolers, now includes 13,600 students. Children are learning about mutual funds as early as the third grade in a new nine-city pilot program sponsored by the Investment Company Institute.
Already, the next generation has a few Masters of the Universe who are hitting the lecture circuit and authoring books to proffer their money-making tips. Arthur Berg Bochner, 13, started with a $1,700 stake in Blockbuster at the age of 9 and now has a $72,000 portfolio. He has written two personal finance books with his mother, and this year he toured the country lecturing to summer-camp audiences. After an appearance on "The Tonight Show" last year, he was given $1,000 to invest by Jay Leno. It has grown to about $4,500 with stakes in Home Depot and China Power and Light.
And 17-year-old Matt Seto, the subject of a front-page profile in The Wall Street Journal last year, has controlled his own $45,000 limited partnership, the Matt Seto Fund, since he was 14. That was no easy feat in high school, where he lost his bathroom privileges after the newspaper revealed that he used the breaks to call his broker.
Matt, who started with $700 accumulated from years of gifts, has a book, "The Whiz Kid of Wall Street's Investment Guide," due out in January, with a 10-city tour planned for his winter break. "I like the excitement and the research that goes before it," he says about why he started the fund, which he manages for his family and friends. "It's tough to put into words."
Most underage money managers work on a smaller scale. Blake Engel, a high school junior in Naperville, Ill., turned $500 into $6,000 over six years of investing, mostly through a purchase of stock in the Hewlett-Packard Company. Then he cashed out to splurge on a red Chrysler LeBaron convertible for his 16th birthday. "It was insane, it was great," he says of his gambles, but he acknowledges that he has no grand plans for his economic future.
Blake's relaxed attitude is the right one for a teen-age investor, psychologists say. Youngsters can become dangerously depressed or tense if they risk too much in a stock gamble, says Kenneth O. Doyle, a financial psychologist at the University of Minnesota.
"I'm seeing a tendency to turn kids into miniature accountants at a very young age," Mr. Doyle says. "If it becomes a source of anxiety, I don't advocate it."
The danger can be acute for small children, says Lawrence Kutner, who teaches child psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. "Very young kids have no idea what money is about," he says. "Kids should be out learning and playing and finding out how the world works."
Mr. Doyle and Mr. Kutner recommend close parental supervision for children investing in the stock market and a focus on the educational aspect, not the need for high returns. Minors cannot open their own brokerage accounts, though they can control them if their parents allow it.
A second-grader, Noah Miller, for instance, owns an account that is controlled by his parents. The boy watches for favorites Spiderman and the Human Torch in the annual report from one of his investments, the Marvel Entertainment Group. "I don't want to push it on him," says his father, Joel Miller, a psychologist in Burlington, Vt. "He just will ask, how are we doing?' "
After their interests are piqued, children may want to pick their own portfolios, often beginning with cash accumulated from gifts or allowances. A Northwestern University sophomore, Ben Koff, started investing at 13, with the booty from his bar mitzvah party, and still holds his stock as a nest egg. "It's all something I'll have when I get out of college," he says.
And Eric Lofgren of Denver, 11, cashed in thousands of pennies and $400 hoarded from his $5-a-week allowance to buy shares in a mutual fund. That augmented the 10 shares of the Walt Disney Company that his parents bought him when he was 9 years old. He tracks his stocks with hand-made dot graphs.
"It's kind of mystical to know I own some of a big business" Eric says. "I joke that I own all the nuts and bolts on one of the rides at Disneyland."
 
 
 
Finding Advice for Young Investors
 Here are some tools to help young people learn about investing:
* The Stock Market Game is offered by the Security Industry Association through local economics education clubs. The game requires students to team up and invest $100,000 in virtual "dollars." They read annual reports and follow the stock tables and see who has the richest portfolio after 10 weeks. Some students who play invest real money later, as did Blake Engel of Naperville, Ill. "It definitely gave me a perspective," he says of the game. Write to: Securities Industry Foundation for Economic Education, 120 Broadway, 35th floor, New York 10271-0080
* The Chicago Board of Trade sponsors the Commodity Challenge for high school students. Call (800) 843-2268, extension 97. Teen-agers pick a commodity, write a report and analyze the commodity's behavior over five weeks. The writers of the best reports go to Chicago to spend time in the pit. "It was absolutely fabulous," says Sujata Gosalia, a senior from Lexington, Ky., who turned in 150 pages on "The Deutsche Mark: Currency Mania!"
* The Investment Company Institute offers "Mutual Fundamentals," a four-hour course. The program includes nine cities. Write to: Investment Company Institute Education Foundation, 1401 H Street N.W., Washington 20005.
* Some mutual funds offer educational materials and funds geared to the young. The Stein Roe Mutual Funds Young Investor Fund invests in companies children know like Microsoft and Coca-Cola. Call (800) 403-5437.
* Investing books for the young include Adriane Berg's and Arthur Berg Bochner's "Totally Awesome Money Book for Kids and Their Parents" (Newmarket Press). Neale S. Godfrey's "Money Doesn't Grow on Trees," aimed at parents, includes a chapter on setting up a child's portfolio. And the National Center for Financial Education offers a $1 catalogue of books, board games and other aids. Call (619) 239-1401.

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
The Marxist Professor

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

 BODY:
THERE he was, one of New York City's last old-time Marxists, propped in a lunchtime den of wealthy Wall Street types, shaking a forkful of Irish sausage as he delivered prophecies of doom.
"Capitalism is not a rational system," exclaimed Stanley Aronowitz, a sociology professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center. "The only way it turns around is through mass struggle." 
 But no one at the Beekman Pub was listening. Not the soberly suited young men leaning against the bar. Nor the smart-looking couple in a nearby booth.
"Is everything O.K.?" asked the cheery waitress asked, interrupting Mr. Aronowitz's rambling manifesto.
No! Everything isn't O.K.
That's exactly the point Mr. Aronowitz has been trying to make through four decades of union organizing, proselytizing and Marx-influenced writing and teaching. Whether we know it or not, he says, we're stuck in a class structure that doesn't let us (or enough of us) breathe.
But these are difficult times for Marxists like him. It's been decades since the studying of Marx was regarded as the radical chic of the academic world. The camp of professors that taught Marx in the 60's and 70's has retreated from the social activism that was once so closely associated with it.
What they're doing these days seems far more ivory-towerish. Dispersing into departments that range from economics to women's studies to cultural studies, they are content to explore the power games underlying sex, money and, in a truly abstract exercise, knowledge itself. And that can leave unrepentant radicals pretty lonely, even Mr. Aronowitz, who has tried to keep up with the academic times.
"They say I'm the last one," said the 62-year-old Mr. Aronowitz. "They say I'm the last of the working-class intellectuals. That's terrible."
But Mr. Aronowitz is not likely to fade away anytime soon. In fact, he made quite a splash with his latest contribution to the class struggle: "The Jobless Future: Sci-Tech and the Dogma of Work," a nearly 400-page book written with another sociologist, William DiFazio.
The authors argue that technological advances, like automated teller machines, are permanently dislodging legions of workers from their jobs each and every day in a reorganization of labor.
It's a dreary state of affairs, as Mr. Aronowitz is wont to point out any chance he gets.
"Look what's happening on Wall Street," Mr. Aronowitz said, sipping a very dry Bombay Gibson on ice. "They've laid off 80,000 people out of 400,000 since 1987. It's not a blip, either. It's a permanent displacement. If we don't begin to look at our social arrangements, New York is going to be like Bombay."
Or even, he said later, Detroit.
Ever since the "The Jobless Future" was published last fall, Mr. Aronowitz has been getting calls from unionists, politicians, quotation-hunting journalists and talk-show hosts. (He has been on National Public Radio more than once.) And traditionally liberal periodicals, like The Nation, published lengthy reviews, while major newspapers, like The Washington Post, quoted him in feature articles on joblessness.
It's all got Mr. Aronowitz gloating, if only a bit.
"Marx is starting to look pretty smart at a time when Marxism should have been buried with the Soviet Union," he said. "There was a lot of smugness before the stock market crash in '87, but things are changing. There are a lot more people who aren't so sure about their futures."
Still, he and Mr. DiFazio see a way out, albeit a utopian one. They envision a brave new world in which workers are given shorter workweeks, have guaranteed wages and can spend their leisure in the pursuit of happiness, whether in a museum, on a college campus or with their families at home.
Which is all in keeping with Marx.
The book only reinforces Mr. Aronowitz's reputation at CUNY. He has long been regarded as one of CUNY's most prominent crusaders, who attracts and nurtures some of the most radical students with his insights on the state of mass culture, from TV and movies to rock and roll.
A few years ago, he was right there, bullhorn in hand, calling for solidarity when student demonstrators occupied the CUNY Graduate Center, on 42d Street, to protest state cuts.
Mr. Aronowitz's class-conscious sensibilities run deep. He grew up in blue-collar East Tremont, the Bronx, where boys dreamed of landing jobs in steel mills and truck yards, just as their fathers had.
Mr. Aronowitz's father dropped out of New York University in his freshman year to take a job as a reporter for The New York World. His mother, who held a variety of jobs in department stores and an office, was an ardent unionist who eventually became a shop steward.
It was the early 50's when he joined the blue-collar work force himself as a teen-ager. He took a job loading a fur truck and then worked at steel plants in New Jersey. He also began to take labor-relations courses and became a union organizer.
By 1967, he was enrolled at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, where he earned a degree in sociology. This set him on a lifelong academic course; he has published a dozen books and hundreds of articles for newspapers and academic journals.
Still, his passion has always been working in the trenches of the labor struggle. "I was always bored in classrooms," Mr. Aronowitz said. "Bored out of my skull."
But things aren't looking so good in the trenches these days, particularly not in New York City, which just a generation ago was a relatively nice place for a Marxist like Mr. Aronowitz to live. Now, he says, unions cave in routinely, as City Hall bows to the demands of corporate barons like George Steinbrenner and Donald J. Trump, who seek sweet deals.
"We're terrified that business will split," he said. "So we give them tax breaks and end up cutting education, culture, environmental protection and so on. It's an endless cycle of concessions. It's policy based on the bottom line."
His warnings come down to this: corporate mergers, downsizing and the like are leaving society -- including government -- beholden to the whim of the capitalist.
But don't think for one minute that his interest is purely theoretical.
"They can't afford to pick up the garbage on Wednesday now?" complained Mr. Aronowitz, sounding more like a frustrated New Yorker than a Marxist.
He's worried about the public schools, too, in no small part because he and his partner, Ellen Willis, the writer, send their daughter to an intermediate school in District 2 in lower Manhattan.
So what's the average proletarian to do?
"I think people have to decide if they want to continue to be held hostage," said the professor, who argues that a strong working-class movement is the only way to insure social progress. "No one has been willing to say, 'Enough already.' "
 
WORDS ON WORDS
 
Negotiating the Maze of Meaning
 
"The question What is to be done? has become tainted because it points to calumnies committed in the name of traditional ideologies of emancipation. Indeed, to speak of liberation, of the emancipation of labor, appears utopian, in the bad sense; in a period of the transformation of global politics by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the intellectual discrediting of Marxism, even by some of its erstwhile practitioners, and, on a larger canvas the steep decline of socialism, recalling these words conjures images of betrayal."
 
-- from "The Jobless Future: Sci-Tech and the Dogma of Work" (University of Minnesota Press, 1994) by Stanley Aronowitz and William DiFazio.

HEADLINE: Why Fisheries Drew Bipartisan Applause

 BODY:
To the Editor
"Moderates Soften G.O.P. Agenda on Environment" (front page, Oct. 24) was right to mention the recent 388-to-37 vote in the House to reauthorize and strengthen the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act as an example of Republicans' new approach to environmental measures. 
 The primary reasons for the large bipartisan majority for stronger fisheries conservation, however, concern economic necessity.
Foremost is the obvious need to protect fish populations so that commercial and recreational fisheries remain viable. Although the stronger act may mean smaller short-term profits for some fishing operations, it will help insure that there will always be ample fish, employment, recreation and profits from catching fish for generations to come.
Moreover, our overexploited, declining fisheries are producing far below their potential, at a cost of more than $3 billion a year. Government estimates show that managing our fisheries in an environmentally sustainable manner could generate 300,000 new jobs and cut our annual trade deficit by $2 billion.
If you add to this the social and cultural importance of conserving our fisheries and the traditional way of life of fishing communities, and the imperative of protecting our fragile marine ecosystems, strengthening the Magnuson Act is just common sense. Wise Republicans and Democrats alike agree.
The act also passed because scores of fishing and conservation organizations representing millions of Americans worked hard to raise public awareness and Congressional commitment to save our fisheries. The Senate should exhibit the same wise judgment by supporting the same strengthening amendments and reauthorizing the Magnuson Act this fall.

Powell Takes a Hit

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN Bosnia's three warring factions sit down to talk peace this week, it's only fitting that they will meet at a United States Air Force base.
NATO air power, dominated by United States fighter jets, bombed the Bosnian Serbs to the bargaining table. A two-week bombardment this summer demolished their ammunition dumps, air defenses and command bunkers. It wrecked their will to wage wide-scale war and broke the siege of Sarajevo. But it stopped short of breaking their army. 
 And in doing so, NATO's strikes also challenged the doctrine set forth by Gen. Colin L. Powell: If you use military force, use it overwhelmingly and use it to win.
 
The Wrong Time
 This comes at an inopportune time for General Powell. The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff conferred last week with top Republican strategists on his potential Presidential bid. As he approaches a decision, it seems that his most famous idea might have just been proved wrong.
In his autobiography, General Powell says he told President Bush and President Clinton that limited air strikes or heavy bombing of Serb positions would probably fail. "I emphasized that none of these actions was guaranteed to change Serb behavior," General Powell wrote. "Only troops on the ground could do that."
The General's critics say this thinking has encouraged an all-or-nothing approach that is ill-suited to conflicts like Bosnia.
"We did not set out to win a war," Kenneth Bacon, a Pentagon spokesman, said last month after the two-week bombing campaign. "We did not set out to inflict damage on the population of the Serbian sections of Bosnia, nor did we set out to destroy the Serbian army."
The specific goals were to force the Bosnian Serbs to stop shelling Sarajevo, withdraw many of their heavy weapons from around the Bosnian capital and push the parties into talks. And NATO did just that.
Air power has its limits. Bombing alone did not bring Nazi Germany to its knees. Waves of B-52's did not crush North Vietnam. And it was ground troops that finished off the Iraqi army in the Persian Gulf war.
Allied air power had a lot of help in bringing the Balkan peace talks to this point. The fall of Srebrenica and Zepa, two Muslim enclaves under United Nations protection, shamed the West into action. A ground offensive by Croatian and Bosnian Government troops rolled back the Bosnian Serb army. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia decided that ending the economic embargo against his country outweighed the temptation of continued combat.
Would the same bombing have achieved the same results two or three years ago, sparing many of the 200,000 people killed since fighting broke out in 1991? Many diplomats and military experts familiar with the Balkans answer, resoundingly, yes.
"Swift and disproportionate force is the only way to deal with bullies," said Charles H. Thomas 2d, who retired last month as the top American envoy in Bosnia. "The Serbs would have seen our use of air power as a symbol of our willingness to dish it to them. Diplomacy without force is like baseball without a bat."
While the warplanes cut off the Serbs' communications and supply lines and hampered their ability to wage wider war, they avoided most of the tanks and artillery guns that Bosnian Serb troops needed to defend themselves.
"We could have done the same thing two or three years ago," a senior NATO commander said ruefully. "We just didn't have the stomach for it then."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Iraqis Are Angry but Not Just at You-Know-Who

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq

 BODY:
A LAH MUKHTAR, a ranking member of the ruling Baath Party, glanced at television sets tuned in to CNN, BBC and (of all countries) Israel in his office on a recent evening, watching for commentary about the imminent referendum on whether to retain Saddam Hussein as President. Not far away, in a teahouse near Al Kazem mosque, Malek, an unemployed 25-year-old Iraqi Shiite, watched the Qatar-Iraq soccer game -- for him, a far more interesting diversion from the hardships of life under economic sanctions.
By nightfall, Iraq had won the match 3 to 2, but nobody was in a mood to celebrate. In the gathering dark, Abu Waleed, who drives clients between Baghdad and Jordan on the 18-hour road voyage made necessary by the embargo on air links, hooked a live electric wire to his GMC desert van to dissuade car thieves. And nightclubs in the suburb of Massbah were filling with visitors from Jordan, Yemen and Libya -- looking for the crop of girls from good Iraqi families now said to be selling their virtue for a few dollars. 
 This is what has become of the dreams of a comfortable modern life in Iraq, dreams on which Saddam Hussein built his ties to the middle class that he virtually created in the optimistic years before 1990.
Back then, the clients at the nightclubs were big-spending Iraqis seeking the company of foreign women. Malek was employed in a thriving business selling car parts. And Abu Waleed went to sleep without bothering to lock up his car at all.
Then came Iraq's calamitous invasion of Kuwait -- and, in its aftermath, the crushing United Nations sanctions intended to force Iraqi compliance with peace terms and, perhaps, to bring down Mr. Hussein.
The sanctions have, indeed, crushed hope that life will improve under Mr. Hussein. Today, the mood of Baghdad's inhabitants seems to alternate between apathy, hopelessness and anger.
But there is also an important way in which the sanctions have begun to work against their own purposes. For the anger these days is one of resignation and despair, not action -- focused on no one as it lashes out at everybody.
Two or three years ago, when the sanctions were relatively new and Mr. Hussein's staying power remained untested, many Iraqis here were expressing confidence that their problems would be over once the United States, working with Iraqi opposition groups, succeeded in overthrowing their leader.
But now that Mr. Hussein has proved he can survive, this clarity of view is gone.
 
Even Romania Looks Good
 "It is a case of total anger even against God himself," says Ghassan Attia, an opposition activist in exile in London. "People are at the end of their rope. We feel it in the opposition. You can measure the despair by the vast immigration movement. Two million Iraqis have left the country to places like Iran, England, Canada, New Zealand and Romania.
"Imagine," he said. "Romania. Just to get out."
To many Iraqis who speak candidly, Saddam Hussein remains a villain. But since nobody has succeeded in overthrowing him, he is far from the only villain. He is joined by the United States, because of its insistence on continuing sanctions; by Arab nations, because they have remained silent about the clear suffering of the populace, and by the many factions of the divided Iraqi opposition, who are widely seen here as interest groups doing someone else's dirty work.
This diffusion of blame has been used skillfully by the ruling clique in the past year to nail down two messages. One is this: As bad as things are, they could be a great deal worse, if the opposition gets control and Iraq is sundered into ethnic entities with Kurds in the north, Shiites in the south and Sunnis in the center.
 
A Past to Reckon With
 The other is a reminder that the regime that brought war and calamity to Iraq was also the one that raised Iraq's hope of modernity in the first place -- by greatly expanding the middle class, by pushing Iraq to become the fastest growing Arab economy (based on its oil, education and skills), by instituting a generous welfare and health system and a mighty army. Those things once made Iraq a country to reckon with, and the lesson of the sanctions is that its enemies are now simply out to destroy the country, the message goes.
"All Iraqis can see we have done everything that is required of us, yet there is no end to the suffering because of this fierce determination of the United States to wipe out this country as we used to know it," said Mr. Mukhtar, editor of the mass circulation newspaper Al Jumhuriya, in an interview in his office as he watched the television screens. "That is why we are not anymore under pressure from public opinion in Iraq." A true believer in Mr. Hussein, Mr. Mukhtar continues to think the Baath Party can bring Iraq out of this crisis by reaching out to angry Iraqis with the message that the embargo is a Western consipiracy to split up Iraq.
And he has reason for hope. While Iraq remains a society replete with ethnic groups, religious groups, subgroups, tribes and clans, many Iraqis say a strong sense of nationhood has emerged in the two decades of Saddam Hussein's rule -- and that many are wedded to it because if the nation fragments or descends into a power struggle, blood and anarchy would follow.
"I don't think of myself as a Shiite, but as an Iraqi," said a poet who opposes the regime and, like most of those interviewed, sought anonymity. "People forget there is something called an Iraqi identity that precedes Saddam. Right here in Baghdad there are hundreds of thousands of Shiites and Kurds. We are not in the south only and the Kurds are not in the north only."
It is safe to say that few Iraqis believe that President Hussein or his party is capable of shifting "from revolutionary legitimacy to democracy," as the Government promised last week. But that is, in a way, beside the point. The true believers can count on deep skepticism among the populace about the alternatives, and this has only increased in the years since sanctions were introduced. There are a half-dozen opposition groups, but the Kurds in the north fight each other and the hard-core Shiite opposition in the south is clearly under the control of Iran, the Persian enemy.
So more and more, Iraqis seem to believe that instead of pushing them to revolt against a ruthless regime, sanctions are simply undermining their society, altering its morality and social cohesion.
"If your arrows cannot reach the head, why do you keep aiming at the body?" asked Hamid, a once-successful Shiite businessman who claims to be one of the few Iraqis who had the nerve to vote no in the Oct. 15 referendum.
"Isn't it clear by now that Saddam is staying because he has no other place to go and no one strong enough to push him out? He is only leaving on a stretcher or not at all."

Soldiering On, Without an Enemy

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN preparing to send 20,000 American troops to Bosnia, one of President Clinton's biggest problems is how to market the mission.
The polls explain why. 
 Only 37 percent of Americans favor sending in American ground troops to participate in a NATO-led force in Bosnia, while 57 percent are opposed, even though the troops would be going there to keep peace, not wage war, according to a New York Times-CBS Poll released last week.
Some of the reasons are familiar. Historically, Americans have always questioned the need for sending their soldiers to some new faraway place, even when the stakes were high and the risks low.
In this Administration, the television footage of Somalians dragging a dead American soldier through the streets of Mogadishu in 1993 had a chilling effect on future use of American troops in "peacekeeping" operations, particularly when there is no peace to keep. It's what Richard Holbrooke, the chief American negotiator, calls the "Vietmalia syndrome": the placing of constraints on policies by the memories of the worst cases rather than the successes.
But there is another problem as well. In arguing for the proposed Bosnia peace mission, the Administration finds itself describing something that sounds suspiciously like a war. It isn't supposed to be a war, of course -- American soldiers would be asked not to fight anyone, only to stand between adversaries who have already agreed to stop shooting at each other. But they still could be killed by mines or ambushed by trouble-makers, even if war doesn't resume.
So because of the scale of the overall NATO commitment (60,000 troops), the blood-soaked history of the Balkans and the risk to American soldiers, supporters of the mission find themselves facing the language of the battlefield.
The starkest -- but clearest -- moment in the debate so far came in a recent hearing on Capitol Hill, when Senator James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican, asked Administration witnesses point-blank whether the Bosnia mission justified "hundreds of young Americans dying over there."
Secretary of Defense William Perry: "Yes.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher: "Yes."
So the first question to Mr. Christopher on "Larry King Live" the other night from a caller in Henderson, Nevada, should have surprised no one. "Secretary of State, what is the difference of sending troops to Bosnia or to Vietnam?" she asked.
 
NATO Yes, Body Bags No
 To be sure, the decision of whether to commit troops is not going to be made by referendum, but by the President and Congress. And although lawmakers of both parties have raised objections to the mission, ultimately Congress is likely to be won over by the argument that the preservation of NATO is at stake. Still, there is great concern in Congress about the reaction from voters if body bags arrive home in the middle of re-election campaigns.
Indeed, American support for peacemaking in Bosnia falls dramatically when the hypothetical casualties rise. Americans favor the mission by more than a two-to-one margin if no Americans are killed, and oppose the mission by nearly the same margin if 25 Americans are killed, according to a USA Today/ CNN/Gallup poll released last week.
But the selling of wars, unlike peacekeeping missions, usually requires enemies. And usually these are not so much evil principles as the evil, larger-than-life actors who personify them -- a Hitler or a Saddam Hussein. Even little wars have people to hate: President Antonio Manuel Noriega in Panama in 1989, the specter of Fidel Castro looming over Grenada in 1983.
In his memoirs, former Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d acknowledged the folly of saying that what was at stake with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was American jobs. ("I overreacted to the growing complaints that the only reason we were in the Gulf was because of oil," Mr. Baker wrote. "I still believe I was right, but it didn't work.")
It took the vilification of Mr. Hussein as a dictator "worse than Hitler" whose country was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power before President Bush had a message with resonance.
Bosnia has plenty of bad guys, but none of them make much of an enemy. It is simply too difficult for the average American to understand why the political leader and the military commander of the Bosnian Serbs have been indicted (but not arrested) by an international war crimes tribunal, but why the President of Serbia who speaks for them will be sitting at the peace table in Dayton, Ohio, this week.
"It is a hard argument to make," admits Michael McCurry, the White House spokesman. "Most Americans throw up their hands when they try to wrestle with the dazzling complexity that is Bosnia. Americans by nature would say, 'What does Bosnia have to do with me?' "
And by deciding not to declare Serbia an aggressive and genocidal enemy, the Administration has had to fall back on abstract and difficult-to-prove predictions to justify peacemaking: that the war will spread to the rest of Europe and the NATO alliance will collapse if American troops do not serve in the force.
But even Mr. Christopher resorted to war-like words in arguing for peacekeeping recently, when he suggested to a recent Congressional hearing that the stakes were nothing less than avoiding World War III. Asked what he would tell a mother whose son died for Sarajevo, he said: "I would recall that twice before this century the United States has had to send not a limited number of troops, but an almost unlimited number of troops to take part in a war that started from Central Europe -- once again from the very city that we're talking about here now. We have an opportunity to avoid being put in that situation again."
One problem with that argument is that it seems to overstate the risks of staying out, while shrinking from a more plausible, if less dramatic, explanation: If the United States wants a stable Europe with which to trade and share a democratic future, it's going to have to help police the danger zones. And if that requires troops, some will have to be Americans.
Another big problem with Mr. Christopher's argument is that this is the first time it's been used. For four years after the Yugoslav wars began, neither President Bush nor President Clinton told the American people that the United States, together with NATO, had to stop these wars because they could spread and because the future of NATO was at stake. On the contrary, with few exceptions, both Administrations argued that saving Bosnia was not in America's vital national interest.
But now that peace looks more likely, suddenly the argument is being put forward that it is a vital national interest for American troops to help keep a peace settlement because to fail to do so would risk a European-wide war and destroy NATO.
"All of a sudden, Clinton is trying to make the case that he is best friends with the heads of Europe and that he is doing this to solidify the Atlantic alliance," says Barbara Bardes, professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati and an expert on public opinion and foreign policy. "That's a big stretch. It's going to be a slippery sell."
Indeed, when asked on NBC's "Meet the Press" last week, "What's so sacred about NATO?" Mr. Perry found himself in the peculiar position of using the arguments of war -- the cold war, to be exact..
"There are still 20,000 nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union," Mr. Perry said. "And the political and the economic recovery going on in those countries is extremely fragile. Extremely fragile. So we have a very strong interest in the security and stability of Europe. NATO, in my judgment, is the linchpin of maintaining that stability."

The Japan Bank Alarm

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
A DELICIOUS meal had been polished off, the Geisha girls had set down their musical instruments, the wine bottles had been emptied and the songs sung. Yoshio Nakajima, a top official at the Ministry of Finance, reportedly eyed his favorite hostess, who then accompanied him to his hotel.
The bill for that extravagance last year was paid, according to Japanese press reports, by Harunori Takahashi, who at the time was head of a credit union. The lavish entertainment was a factor in the credit union's bankruptcy and in Mr. Nakajima's resignation from the Finance Ministry in July. It was an extreme case, but such revelations are prompting people here to wonder whether those in banking officialdom are really the dour, restrained, middle-aged functionaries they are widely perceived to be. 
 Most likely many aren't, for regulatory oversight in Japanese banking is definitely not a dour affair -- as American officials are learning after Daiwa Bank and Japanese officials kept American regulators in the dark over the bank's huge losses in New York. Here banking oversight is a nod-and-wink business, and quite often a drunken affair in the bars -- and that may be one reason Japan's banking system is a mess today.
That mess is raising eyebrows and fears in America as well as Japan because international finance is like a huge swimming pool: if one corner springs a leak, the water level drops everywhere. If a major bank crisis forced the Japanese to sell their holdings of Treasury bonds to bring cash home, the price of bonds would slide. That would force interest rates to rise in America, and higher mortgage rates would make homes less affordable in Peoria.
This is partly why American financial officials are worried about the state of Japanese banking, and the uncertain role in the Daiwa scandal of the Finance Ministry, which has denied any wrongdoing. A certain trust in mutual cooperation has been breached, and with revelations that the Central Intelligence Agency spied on the Japanese during trade talks this year, the Americans are no less to blame. As Japanese and American officials meet for talks during President Clinton's visit to Japan next month, both sides will be asking: how much can we trust each other?
 
Chumminess
 In the case of these two huge trading partners, the need for financial integration and cooperation is being challenged by their extraordinarily different ways of doing business. While American bankers and their financial authorities have a distant, sometimes chilly relationship, their Japanese counterparts in contrast are hard-and-fast chums.
In every Japanese bank there is an elite group of promising young bankers whose full-time job is to dawdle in the offices of the Ministry of Finance. The real work, however, often begins in the evenings, when they and their fellow bank executives wine and dine ministry officials to gather the latest bits of news on regulatory moves, approvals of new products or anything that might help the bank's business.
They are the "MOF-tans," -- the handlers -- the bank's special liaison agents for the Ministry of Finance. Japanese bankers must consult the ministry for almost every conceivable matter related to their business, and so the job of the MOF-tan is to stop by the ministry, usually once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Sometimes, to deepen personal relationships, they send gifts to the officials' wives on their birthdays and wedding anniversaries.
"The MOF-tan people might just drop in the office, and that is why MOF people are quite busy -- we can do our work only after 5 P.M.," said Yukio Noguchi, an economics professor and a former ministry official. "They say, 'I happened to visit the MOF and just dropped in to see if you are in the office or not.' It's gradually changing, but the basics are there."
As these MOF-tans then scatter throughout the bank in their next assignments, the contacts they have built with financial officials help bind the banks to the Finance Ministry in a complex web of relations, a glue that helps the two sides stick together in a crisis.
"If you have a dinner with a business counterpart, with lots of drinks and so on -- it is a Japanese tradition -- you can know each other better so as to have a sense of trust to expand the business relationship," said a ministry official.
The Daiwa scandal, in which a rogue trader lost $1.1 billion over 11 years, illustrates how the cozy relationship between banker and bureaucrat can lead to misunderstandings with other countries. Daiwa executives informally told the Finance Ministry of the loss, saying they wanted to wait a while before publicly disclosing it together with satisfactory earnings, and the Ministry willingly obliged and kept silent.
When American regulators discovered that the ministry had known about the loss for six weeks, they were surprised and angry. But Japanese bankers were less astonished, for while in America bankers and regulators stand on opposite sides, in Japan they are sometimes partners.
 
Tip-Offs

Today Japan's sagging economy is trimming expense accounts, and public criticism has made ministry officials much more reluctant to be entertained by corporate executives. While extravagant entertaining has been toned down, meetings now occur over lunch or a leisurely drink, so that trust can still develop.
A conversation might go like this:
MOF-tan: "We believe there will be a surprise inspection at one of our branches. We wonder which one that could be?"
Ministry of Finance bureaucrat: "Somewhere in the west, I believe."
In 1991, for instance, the ministry conducted an inspection at Fuji Bank in the aftermath of an incident over falsified bank account certificates, according to the Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese daily. After the inspection, an executive at Fuji Bank reportedly said: "The timing and the target of the inspection were as we expected."
In fact, inspections in Japan are significantly scaled-down versions of the kind conducted by any of the numerous regulatory agencies in the United States. Japan has only 700 inspectors for all of its banks, far fewer (even in proportional terms) than the estimated 8,000 to 10,000 financial inspectors in the United States.
"Japanese believe that people are essentially good," said a senior Finance Ministry official. "But Americans believe that people are basically evil. For us, trust is very important."
Sometimes, the cultural divide between the world's two largest financial communities can even affect international financial stability. For several months earlier this year, the value of the yen hovered at 80 yen to the dollar, the yen's strongest level.
While it helped American exports, it was an embarrassment for Americans that the reserve currency of the world was falling through the floor. Americans blamed the Japanese, the Japanese blamed the Americans, and an impasse seemed unbridgeable until two old friends, Eisuke Sakakibara, a top Ministry official, and Lawrence Summers, a senior Treasury official, started talking.
They had met at Harvard University and had a common language -- Mr. Sakakibara speaks flawless English -- and with their coordination the dollar began to strengthen.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Bartering Inmate Futures

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
THE first 200 inmates from Colorado arrived at the Bowie County Correctional Center in Texarkana on the last, scorching week of July. Some were put to work making road signs, others picnic benches or toys for poor children. Still others agreed to duty in the sewing shop, where they learned a trade but worked on a more immediate goal: stitching shorts for themselves and other Coloradans unaccustomed to the deadly heat of Texas.
In the last 18 months, 500 inmates have been sent from Colorado's overcrowded prison system to the county prison in Texas, another 500 to a privately run prison in Minnesota. They are among a growing and hotly debated trade in prisoners across state borders, a movable byproduct of the drive to crack down on crime through tougher sentencing laws and an inability -- often because of voters' reluctance -- to build expensive new prisons quickly. 
 And while the numbers are small, probably fewer than 10,000 prisoners nationwide from less than a dozen states, few support the practice as anything more than a bad, short-term answer to overcrowding.
 
Prisoners in Oversupply
 "It's a last resort," said Liz McDonough, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections. "It's not something anybody wants to do. It's hard on the families. It's hard on the departments. It's not easy to manage. You have to, in essence, manage a facility long distance."
It has, however, turned prisoners into a commodity, as empty county jails and private prisons compete for excess inmates and the money they bring. There are prisoner placement consultants and rules for what kind of prisoner can travel (the healthy and tractable are preferred). One prison in Texas, where the county system houses by far the greatest number of out-of-staters in the country, advertises, its aim being to keep corrections employees employed and its local economy alive.
"I would never apply the word commodity to human beings," said James R. Roberts, vice president of Dominion, an Oklahoma company that locates private prisons and brokers transfers of prisoners for a fee. "I would say that they are becoming some kind of economic unit that represents a cost and, to the receiving facility or region, represents an economic benefit."
The practice has spurred lawsuits from prisoners' families and advocates. But in these days of limited sympathy for convicts, the economic argument against the practice appears the most compelling. Last summer officials in Tennessee decided against sending prisoners out of state largely out of concern that they would be filling another state's pot. Mr. Roberts said costs run from just under $40 to $70 a day per inmate.
States have sent prisoners to neighboring states for years, sometimes to relieve overcrowding and other times to fill a special need, like protective custody. But now, prison officials say, the difference is that the state prison systems are at or above capacity and the overflow is moved in greater numbers to county jails and private prisons.
Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Missouri, Virginia and Alaska have all transferred inmates out of state, and several other states, including Massachusetts, Idaho, Oklahoma and Hawaii, are considering it.
A tale of two states, Oregon and Texas, illustrates how and why this is happening.
In 1994 Oregon voters passed a ballot initiative that established a mandatory minimum sentence for 16 serious felonies at 5 2/3 years, with no chance of early release. Gary D. Weeber, a program manager at the Oregon Department of Corrections, said the measure, combined with tougher rules for parole, filled prisons to the point where the state's 7,600-bed system may soon grow by 4,000 prisoners.
In Texas a huge expansion of the state prison system emptied more than 200 county prisons of an overflow of state inmates, after many counties had expanded to accommodate the surplus. The counties scrambled to find prisoners from anywhere.
"Why let these facilities rust?" asked Bob Dearing, deputy director of the Texas Jail Commission, which regulates county jails.
So, starting Sept. 1, Oregon began sending what will be as many as 250 inmates toDenton County, north of Dallas. The cost is $36.50 a day per inmate, compared to about $52 a day in-state. Oregon saves money and Texas makes some. "We really have to choose between the lesser of two evils," Mr. Weeber said. "Right now we have more coming through the door than we can handle. And that being the case, our first priority has to be safety and security."
Advocates for inmates complain -- and prison officials agree -- that the practice defies sound theory: Inmates with ties to family and community tend to be better behaved and less likely to return to prison. They also complain that it is inhumane and unfair to separate prisoners from their families by hundreds of miles.
Jeffrey Bridges, a 39-year-old from Newport News, was among the first 150 inmates transferred from Virginia to Newton County, Tex., in February. He said he and other inmates had no idea where they were going until they sat, shackled, on a chartered plane. Many of the inmates incarcerated in Texas, he said, "were real angry. A lot of them acted up because they definitely didn't want to be there."
Mr. Bridges, convicted of stealing electronic diaries from a Wal-Mart, was visited once by his family, in a trip organized by families of prisoners sent to Texas. He was released in September.
"It was hard on me, but I think it was a lot harder on my family," Mr. Bridges said. "I had done a crime, but there was no need for them to suffer along with me."

HEADLINE: Perot Commands Enthusiasm For New Jersey Conservatives

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Oct. 28

 BODY:
Ross Perot brought his twang and his pungent criticism of the major parties to New Jersey today, telling his United We Stand supporters to back New Jersey's infant Conservative Party in the General Assembly elections next week as a prelude to sweeping Congress and the Presidency with a new national political party next year.
The Texas industrialist uncorked a speech that was vintage Perot: the Democratic and Republican Parties, he said, are "bought and sold" by special interests; Federal bureaucrats are too stupid to manage Federal programs properly, and the United States' economy has fallen in thrall to the low wages and high technology of foreigners. 
 "Here is why we have to win the Presidency in '96," said Mr. Perot, whose political organization, renamed the National Reform Party, has won spots on the California, Ohio and Maine presidential ballots for next year. "Right now, this country is a patient on the table bleeding arterially, and we've got four broken fingers, and guess what? The doctor is the Republicans and the nurse is the Democrats, and they're fighting, and all they can agree to do is put a splint on those fingers."
The 500 people who attended the annual state conference of the New Jersey chapter of United We Stand America was a far smaller crowd than the nearly 3,000 people who jammed Mr. Perot's visit in 1993, a year after his presidential bid won 522,000 votes in the state, 14 percent of the total.
But if the crowd was smaller, the agenda at today's meeting was more complex than at Mr. Perot's other appearances in the state. In a bid to leapfrog the multiyear process of party-building in New Jersey, United We Stand has joined with the three-year-old New Jersey Conservative Party to field General Assembly candidates in 37 of the state's 40 legislative districts for next week's elections.
If they can win 10 percent of the General Assembly vote statewide, which party officials admit would be a stretch, the Conservatives would become the first official third party in New Jersey since World War II. That would create an automatic ballot spot for the new party, and for Mr. Perot's movement, in next year's presidential elections.
Some of the Conservative Party members were disappointed that Mr. Perot did not offer any money for a last-minute, get-out-the-vote effort on Nov. 7. But they were delighted to hear him bless the union of the two movements in his speech.
"I want every member of New Jersey United We Stand America to take a hard look at the Conservative Party effort here," he said. "They are fine, fine, first-class people, their principles are fine, first-class principles and our efforts are marching in lock step.
"But how are you going to get it done? You've got to get out on the streets, you've got to get on the phone, you've got to wake up all the people lying on the couch listening to Oprah and get them out to vote."
The leadership of the Conservative Party has agreed to consider changing its name to Mr. Perot's nascent Reform Party, which he has at different times called the American Independence Party, in time for next year's national voting.
Those attending today's event at the Hyatt Regency Hotel here reflected the coalition-building that has followed Mr. Perot into the state since last year. Besides the marriage to the state Conservative Party, United We Stand's pledge to change campaign spending and limit political fund raising has attracted support from two usually liberal groups, the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group and New Jersey Common Cause. But the campaign- reform effort, which is called the Citizens Agenda, is also embraced by the hard-right, antitax group Hands Across New Jersey, which helped defeat Jim Florio, the state's last Democratic governor, in 1993.
In addition to changes in campaign financing, the Conservative Party/United We Stand movement supports term limits for legislators, the adoption of new laws by referendum and the revocation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, which the group blames for the loss of American jobs.

HEADLINE: Secessionist's Vision for Quebec Pleases the Crowd

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: MONTREAL, Oct. 28

 BODY:
He talks about the passport of a future independent Quebec as "a beautiful thing -- a symbol of what we are, the symbol of our people, the symbol of our state, the symbol of our identity -- and we'll be well received everywhere with a Quebec passport."
The cheers resound to the rafters. Hundreds of people, some of the younger ones with blue fleurs-de-lis painted on their faces, stomp their feet and mount a chorus of "Lucien, Lucien, Lucien." 
 Twelve hours a day, Lucien Bouchard, a truck driver's son from a remote Quebec village and the driving force of the campaign to pull the province out of Canada, plays to Quebec's pride and its sense of betrayal by English Canada.
Mr. Bouchard's appeals to Quebec's 4.8 million eligible voters -- of whom 82 percent are primarily French-speakers -- to back independence in a referendum on Monday could force Canada to confront the unthinkable: its own breakup. Quebec is Canada's largest province and its second most populous.
In the event of a separatist victory, Mr. Bouchard says, it could be up to a year before independence is proclaimed. He says he wants an economic union with the rest of Canada as part of an orderly transition, but threatens an immediate declaration of independence if Ottawa refuses to negotiate.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien has refused to be drawn out on how he would respond, but his options include a legal challenge and a second referendum to put the question of separation to all Canadians, not just Quebecers.
The separatist surge in the three weeks since Mr. Bouchard, the leader of the parliamentary Bloc Quebecois, took the reins has put victory within reach, alarming federalists and many of Canada's allies, and rattling Canadian financial markets.
The latest poll by Groupe Leger & Leger placed the contest in a dead heat. The poll, however, was conducted from last Monday to Thursday, just before an enormous rally on Friday brought tens of thousands of federalists from all over the country into the streets of Montreal.
While declaring a reluctance to interfere in the referendum, President Clinton has expressed puzzlement as to why such "a great model for the world" would want to break up.
Canadian federal officials have hailed the Americans' comments but the deputy premier of the pro-separatist Quebec Government, Bernard Landry, said bluntly that in the event of a victory for independence, the voters "will remember that the sovereignty of Quebec was achieved despite or even against the American will."
On Monday, prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange experienced their largest one-day drop in more than six years. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates, which could slow growth and increase mortgage rates for all Canadians.
"If you're going to lock in your mortgage, do it now," Mr. Chretien advised his countrymen last Monday.
Signs of capital flight were also manifest in the rush of inquiries to banks about transferring money out of Quebec or converting Quebec investments into cash.
The market reaction underscores one of the overriding issues of the battle. While Mr. Bouchard and his fellow separatists promote nationhood to preserve a distinct French cultural identity in a sea of English-speakers, federalists point to unacceptable costs, including higher taxes, increased unemployment and economic isolation should a split actually occur.
Separatists "ignore the costs of the new political structures," said Laurent Baudouin, chief executive of Bombardier Inc., a producer of planes, trains and skimobiles and one of Quebec's leading companies, "as well as the consequences of a devalued Quebec currency and the unavoidable rise in interest rates."
Fearful that market reactions could influence voters, the Quebec government ordered its financial institutions to buy hundreds of millions of Canadian dollars this week in an attempt to check the slide of the currency and reassure Quebecers.
Against the drumbeat of attacks on the economic front, Mr. Bouchard and his separatist followers promise that independence would shrivel deficits, restore pride, protect French culture and redress all wrongs.
Mr. Bouchard, who less than a year ago had his left leg amputated to check the advance of flesh-eating bacteria, took over the day-to-day management of the flagging campaign from the Quebec Premier, Jacques Parizeau, a former Quebec finance minister who lacks Mr. Bouchard's charisma.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Bouchard walks slowly with a cane, usually accompanied by his American-born wife, Audrey. Aides are steps away to shield him from over-enthusiastic crowds. When he speaks, he lays his cane aside and leans forward on the podium toward his audience, rarely consulting notes.
Although Mr. Bouchard advocates nationhood for Quebec, his notion of a newly negotiated political and economic partnership with Canada is at the heart of what has apparently proven to be a successful strategy. Many Quebecers -- including, pollsters say, about a third of those who would vote "yes" to sovereignty -- do not want a complete break with Canada but rather greater leverage for Quebec within the federation.
Working with Mr. Parizeau and Mario Dumont, leader of the fledgling Action Democratique du Quebec, an offshoot of the Quebec Liberal Party, Mr. Bouchard has outlined a plan for partnership that has little chance of being accepted by the rest of Canada but that seems to satisfy many Quebecers' desire for continued links.
He envisages, for example, negotiations with Ottawa to insure the free movement of people, goods, services, capital, money and labor and to establish such institutions as a partnership council, assembly and tribunal.
Federalist leaders denounce the plan, saying it is intended to confuse voters. They also warn there is no way Quebec would inherit membership of the North American Free Trade Agreement between United States, Canada and Mexico, as Mr. Bouchard and other separatists assert.
Since Confederation in 1867, one fifth of Canada's prime ministers have been Quebecers; a Quebecer has been Prime Minister in all but 3 of the past 27 years. And over the past quarter-century, the province has made great economic strides and solidified French as its working language. Yet this is the second time in 15 years that Quebec has voted on independence. Why?
Quebecers say that what they want most is a public acknowledgment of their distinctness within Canada to insure protection of their language and culture.
In a 1980 referendum, Quebec voted 60-40 to remain in Canada, but two years later, in constitutional changes, saw its provincial powers reduced and lost its coveted right to veto constitutional amendments.
Quebec sought redress through the "distinct society" clause of the 1987 Meech Lake agreement, which would have restored some of these powers. However, the agreement was not ratifed by all provinces by the 1990 deadline. So great was the sense of betrayal when the agreement fell through that polls taken in the immediate aftermath showed as many as 70 percent of Quebecers favoring independence.
Mr. Bouchard has deftly played into these resentments. "We will not be duped," he told a national television audience on Wednesday. "The broken promises from '80 and the odious blow in 1982 are too fresh in our memories."
Should Quebecers vote for independence on Monday a long period of uncertainty would be inevitable as Canadian leaders frantically try to buy time and calm and negotiate their way through uncharted waters.
"In many ways this is like our Civil War," said Robert W. Thacker, director of Canadian Studies at St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y. "There are provisions for admitting provinces into the federation, but none for the breaking up of the country."

HEADLINE: Redrawn Map Has Surprises For Nassau

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Oct. 27

 BODY:
With two beepers clipped to his belt, Lance D. Clark hunts for voters with a pocketful of plastic campaign pens, gently rattling picket gates to alert dogs and other household pets that a Republican is present.
He is striding through Democratic turf, a newly fashioned minority voting district, where -- in theory -- the party of Newt Gingrich is about as popular as speeding motorists and stray cats. But in fact, young black Republicans are running so well in Nassau County that the powerful Republican organization could utterly dominate the county's first legislature, which was fashioned to make government more open. 
 The political paradox is not lost on Democrats; it was black and Hispanic residents dissatisfied with the dominance of Republican and white candidates on the Board of Supervisors who brought a Federal lawsuit compelling Nassau County to scrap the board and create a legislature.
Campaigning for the Nov. 7 elections in the Second Legislative District, which includes Hempstead, Rockville Centre and Westbury, Mr. Clark, a lawyer, devotes little time to Republican ideology. He prefers to discuss more pressing issues: the proper height of a sidewalk curb, the replacement of diseased street trees.
In the neighboring First District, which covers largely black neighborhoods in Freeport, Roosevelt and Uniondale, the Republican candidate, Darlene Harris, campaigns on issues of job training and community revitalization.
When pressed about her Republican affiliation, she has a brief speech. "Frederick Douglass was a Republican," said Ms. Harris, 30, a lawyer whose father is a prominent black minister. "Booker T. Washington was a Republican and Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. The power structure in Nassau County happens to be Republican and I can work with them."
Nassau County has long been the base of one of the most powerful Republican Party organizations in the nation, producing New York's junior senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato, and a string of Republican county executives and other local officeholders, including the current County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta.
The Board of Supervisors is made up of elected leaders of Nassau's three towns and two cities, who cast votes weighted to reflect their populations. But last year, after a court ruled that the board's voting system violated the constitutional principle of one person, one vote, Republicans and Democrats agreed to divide Nassau into 19 voting districts. The map makers envisioned a 12-to-7 split in seats, approximating the 3-to-2 advantage in Republican registration in the county. Two districts were fashioned so that minorities made up a majority.
But Democrats, who vigorously supported the new legislature, have already started to lower their expectations, with some saying the party will be grateful to win five seats on Nov. 7. And if they did win only five, Republicans would have a veto-proof majority.
"The notion that somehow a minority district is automatically going to go to the Democrats allowed a lot of people to be asleep at the switch," said Richard M. Kessel, former executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, who began his career in Nassau Democratic politics in the 1970's as a gadfly and critic of the Board of Supervisors. "I certainly think the Republican Party is going to get the greater benefits from this."
Nowhere is this political boon more unexpected than the First Legislative District, where feuding Democrats could split the vote and permit Ms. Harris, the Republican, to win. So fractious is the campaign that the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. has requested help from the Justice Department to monitor the voting on Election Day.
Most Democrats had assumed that the district would support the Democratic organization's choice of Frederick Brewington, a young black civil rights lawyer who was considered a rising star in the Democratic Party. But in a three-candidate race, he lost the primary by a 54-vote margin to Seretta McKnight, an upstart who is president of the Roosevelt School Board.
Initially, Mr. Brewington tried to overturn the results, charging that more than 200 votes were tainted. He said he suspected Republicans of unfairly influencing the outcome of the election, particularly at the polling stations located on Roosevelt school property. There, for reasons still unclear, some Republicans were allowed to vote in the Democratic primary.
"The N.A.A.C.P. received telephone calls with regard to some irregularities, and we were the ones who brought this to the attention of the Brewington camp," said Robert Sumerville, president of the chapter and a former Roosevelt School Board member.
Mr. Brewington asked an appeals court judge to schedule a new primary, but when that tactic did not work, he started running under the banner of the Liberal Party.
From his vantage point as a newly minted independent candidate, Mr. Brewington watches with envy the support that Republicans offer to Ms. Harris. He complains that the Democrats never gave him any help in the primary, although he says they have promised him a judgeship if he ends his independent campaign.
"Just look at the plywood billboards she has, the posters in the windows," Mr. Brewington said. "The numbers are there in terms of money, but also the Republican structure and control."
His persistence has naturally irked Democratic Party leaders, who fear that the tarnished Democratic star has become the Republicans' secret weapon.
"Fred Brewington is being put up by the Republicans to act as a spoiler," said the Nassau County Democratic Chairman, Steve Sabbeth. "All of a sudden he's got finances now. These are people who will be excluded from the Democratic Party from now on. They are disloyal Democrats who are apparently acting in concert with the Republicans."
Not even Republicans are that nasty to the Democrats in the Second Legislative District, where the race between Lance Clark, the Republican, and Roger Corbin, the Democrat, is often characterized as a dogfight.
The odds should be against Mr. Clark. The district's registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by 13,500 to 9,000, and Mr. Clark is a longtime Republican who started as a party foot soldier and committeeman in the early 1980's.
But the Republicans have picked a candidate with mainstream appeal. A volunteer firefighter, Mr. Clark won a race for Deputy Mayor of the village of Hempstead under the Unity Party label. In that position, he cultivated a base of support by working regularly with local residents and community groups.
So when Mr. Clark started knocking on doors with his campaign pens and palm cards, residents associated his name with the bread and butter of government -- mundane calls about storm drains and new pavement, street-side trees and sidewalk curbs.
"I think he's going to run away with it," said Richard Burks, 39, after Mr. Clark had made a campaign stop on his porch in the Duncan Estates section of Hempstead. "He's extremely popular. If you have a complaint for the town, you get a call back from him the next day. If he can help you personally, he will."
While Mr. Clark makes his party affiliation seem as pleasant and unthreatening as a Hallmark greeting card, Mr. Corbin is not so saccharine when it comes to the G.O.P.
"Lance has approached this much like he was running for a nonpartisan village election," Mr. Corbin said. "He thought that once he got this nomination that this was going to be a breeze, but Lance Clark's party is the reason why we have the new county legislature. Their party has not represented our constituency in a rightful manner. Now he has to defend the party that houses Newt Gingrich, Governor Pataki and the all the rest of those knuckleheads destroying our country."
With just days until the election, the Republicans have already started to warm up their machine in the First and Second Districts. Lawn signs and bumper stickers have been distributed. The county Republicans will help with a districtwide mailing. Local committee members accompany the candidates, providing them with lists of residents likely to vote.
"We're spending some extra money," said Joseph Mondello, the Republican Party chairman, who declined to elaborate. "I think we're in very good shape in both races. I think we have a real opportunity. We're in a good position and we're poised and the organization is ready to work hard."

Hours after the Senate approved a sweeping budget bill, President Clinton today made his strongest warning yet to the Republican Congress, saying not only that he would veto the bill but also that "there is nothing for us to talk about" until money is restored for health, education and the environment.
By a vote of 52 to 47 shortly after midnight, the Senate approved the huge revenue and spending measure, which would cut taxes by $245 billion over seven years, sharply curb the growth of outlays for Medicare and Medicaid and turn over to the states broad new responsibility for caring for the poor. 
 Negotiators must now reconcile it, probably late next month, with a similar bill approved in the House by a vote of 227 to 203.
During a session of almost 15 hours beginning on Friday morning, the Senate adopted a number of proposals, demanded by moderate Republicans, that veered away from the more conservative House version.
But the President insisted today that he had no intention of negotiating a compromise until the Republicans moved his way, even if they tried to force his hand by refusing to extend the Government's borrowing authority so it could keep paying its bills during a stalemate -- a threat Mr. Clinton called "blackmail tactics."
"Hear this: Before or after a veto, I am not prepared to discuss the destruction of Medicare and Medicaid, the gutting of our commitment to education, the ravaging of our environment, or raising taxes on working people," Mr. Clinton said in his weekly radio address. "So I say to the Republican leaders: Back off your cuts in these vital areas. Until you do, there is nothing for us to talk about."
In the Republican response, Speaker Newt Gingrich warned Mr. Clinton to "think twice about vetoing the balanced budget and jeopardizing long-overdue revolutionary change" and said the President "promises to be a roadblock." The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, added, "America cannot afford to continue on this destructive course."
This morning's vote sets the stage for a new round of wrangling between Capitol Hill and the Administration that White House aides acknowledge could well result in a series of vetoes, not only of the budget package passed this week but also of some of the individual appropriations bills that accompany it, and a virtual stalemate through the end of the year. They say that is a risk Mr. Clinton is prepared to take to preserve what he can of his priorities and build a record for his re-election campaign next year.
Congressional Democrats have worried that Mr. Clinton, whose propensity for compromise is celebrated, will be too quick to bargain. His tough language today seemed intended to help allay those fears and to portray himself to the public as the true defender of middle-class interests and what he today called "national values."
"You say your principles are a balanced budget, a tax cut, extending the life of the Medicare trust fund," Mr. Clinton said, addressing the Republicans. "I want all those things. They are my principles too. But there are other important principles, the one that I have outlined. They are morally right for America, and they are good for our economy."
Repeating his refusal to let the Republicans pressure him into an agreement by holding up an extension of the Federal debt limit, which expires next month, Mr. Clinton warned, "I am not about to give in to that kind of blackmail."
"If they send me a budget bill that says simply, 'Take our cuts, or we'll let the country go into default,' I will still veto it," he added.
In the coming weeks, Republican negotiators from the House and Senate will not only have to iron out the differences between their bills but in the face of Mr. Clinton's veto threat might make accommodations to win White House support.
The Democrats' remaining strength in Congress virtually insures that Mr. Clinton's vetoes on budget bills will not be overridden. But what would happen after such a veto is far less clear. The consensus view in the White House is that a compromise will eventually be reached, but no one believes any longer that a compromise will happen soon.
"Don't assume that when Newt says this is all Kabuki theater that we're all just playing along to a compromise after a ritual veto," one White House aide said today. "We're sticking with these principles all the way through."
Both the President and the Republicans stand to lose in the end if the public perceives them as contributing to the Government gridlock that each, from different perspectives, has pledged to end.
Mr. Gingrich sought to make that argument in his response to the President's address: "Without a doubt, this week was a true crossroads for America's future. Down one road was the status quo, big government, rising deficits, high taxes, a bankrupt Medicare program and a destructive welfare system. Down the other road was historic change and a better future.
"This is the road Republicans chose for America," he added. "Unfortunately, President Clinton promises to be a roadblock."
Senator Dole sought to recast some of the issues on which Mr. Clinton criticized the bills, saying Republicans had "kept our promise to cut taxes so that you could keep more of your hard-earned money."
"And we kept our promise to preserve, protect and strengthen Medicare," he said.
On Friday morning, the Senate made a number of changes in the bill, voting to drop a provision that would allow corporations to withdraw billions of dollars in surplus assets from their pension funds, retain the Federal guarantee of Medicaid coverage for pregnant women, children under 12 and the disabled, and keep Federal regulations on nursing homes.
Making use of a Senate rule that prohibits amendments to the budget if they have no effect on the deficit, Democrats also forced the Republicans to strip from the bill 46 provisions, including several relating to welfare. Those proposals would have allowed states to deny cash assistance to children born to unmarried women under the age of 18 or to welfare mothers of any age who have additional children.
The White House was quick to praise those votes but just as quick to make clear that the Administration thought the bill was still too extreme in many particulars.
For months, the President has strived to walk a line between accommodating the reality of the new Republican majority in Congress and defending his own priorities. In an effort to keep the Republicans from seizing the moral high ground on balancing the budget by a fixed date, he dropped his previous reluctance to that idea early this summer and said he favored doing so in 10 years, instead of 7, as the Republicans wanted.
He has since suggested that improved economic forecasts now make that goal possible in 9 years or less, though he has resisted offering too many details of what spending cuts he would propose, lest the Republicans simply seize on his cuts and ignore the programs he wants to protect.
But wide differences remain, with little clear indication of just how either side might move. The Republicans propose cuts in taxes and in the growth in Medicare spending that are more than twice as deep as those Mr. Clinton wants and sharp restrictions in the Federal income tax credit for the working poor, which Mr. Clinton successfully expanded in 1993.
In recent weeks, the President has focused his attack on the Republican plans for curbing the growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending and proposals for overhauling welfare as cruel to children, even though an early analysis by his Administration showed that the Senate bill he supports could push more than a million additional children into poverty.
Because Mr. Clinton is so determined, on the advice of his new chief political strategist, Dick Morris, to portray himself as the one able to get things done, some of his own top aides have said they are worried that he will compromise too soon.
But today, several of them suggested that the President was now sharply aware that one of the greatest of Presidential powers is the power to say no and that the Republicans are equally aware that they cannot pass the sweeping agenda embodied in their Contract with America without Mr. Clinton's support.
The President himself embraced that notion in a telephone conference call with Democratic Congressional leaders on Friday.
"You know, this is one of those moments in our history when I'm grateful for the wisdom of our founding fathers," Mr. Clinton said then. "I mean, the Congress gets to propose, but the President has to sign or veto, and that Constitution gave me that authority and one of the reasons for the veto is to prevent excess."
He added: "They knew what they were doing, and we're going to use the Constitution they gave us to stand up for what's right."
"Just be of good cheer," Mr. Clinton told the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, in the conference call. "Just go out there and debate these things and tell them what we believe in, and it will all work out."


GRAPHIC: The main differences on the budget between President Clinton and Congress on the budget (dollar amounts are for a seven year period):
 
BALANCED BUDGET
 
Congress: Balanced budget after seven years using conservative economic forecasts.
 
Clinton: Balanced budget after nine years based on more favorable economic forecasts.
 
TAXES
 
Congress: Cut taxes by $245 billion with a $500 credit for most families with children, a lower capital gains rate and increased eligibility for I.R.A.'s.
 
Clinton: Cut taxes by $111 billion with fewer families eligible for a smaller per-child tax credit, no capital gains cut and similar provisions on I.R.A.'s. A deduction of up to $10,000 a year would be allowed for college tuition payments.
 
MEDICARE
 
Congress: Spend $240 billion less than under current law. Limit payments to doctors and hospitals, raise monthly premiums and offer inducements to beneficiaries who move into private insurance plans.
 
Clinton: Spend $124 billion less than current law. No specifics offered on how this money would be saved. Eliminate co-payments for mammograms.
 
MEDICAID
 
Congress: Turn program over to the states and spend about $170 billion less. House would eliminate most Federal standards for nursing homes.
 
Clinton: Retain Federal control, giving states more flexibility. Spend $55 billion less. Retain nursing homes standards.
 
WELFARE
 
Congress: End Federal guarantee of cash assistance to the poor. Allow each state to decide who is entitled to what benefits. Reduce Federal spending by about $100 billion. Require most recipients to work. Make most families ineligible for assistance after five years. Reduce spending for food stamps. House would deny welfare to unwed teen-age mothers and children born to mothers already on welfare. Senate would allow states to impose those restrictions.
 
Clinton: Support the general direction taken by Congress but insist that states be required to maintain a fixed level of spending on welfare, that more money be provided for child care and that mechanisms be strengthened to protect the poor in times of serious recession. Oppose cuts by Congress in foster care and child protective services, in benefits to legal immigrants and in assistance to disabled children.
 
EARNED-INCOME TAX CREDIT
 
Congress: Tighten eligibility to save between $23 billion (House) and $43 billion (Senate).
 
Clinton: Maintain existing program but crack down on fraud.
 
EDUCATION
 
Congress: House would save $10 billion in student loan costs by reducing assistance to students and parents, a proposal rejected by the Senate.
 
Clinton: Expand Federal aid to college students and increase spending for other education and job-training programs.
 
ENVIRONMENT
 
Congress: Open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration and take a variety of other steps opposed by environmentalists involving national parks, the Endangered Species Act, cattle grazing on Federal land and other matters.
 
Clinton: Maintain most existing laws and regulations on the environment. Mr. Clinton has said he would veto the entire legislation if it included the Congressional provision on the Arctic refuge.

HEADLINE: Easing Toward an Election in Philadelphia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Mayor Edward G. Rendell has a zillion stories he likes to tell that reflect the changes in Philadelphia during his first term in office. One of his favorites:
Last year, Conde Nast Traveler magazine set out to find the friendliest of 10 major American cities. Among 12 test questions, residents in the cities were asked to change $1, police officers were asked to take a picture, shopkeepers were asked for a Yellow Pages directory and bartenders were asked for a glass of water. 
 "With one test to go, Philadelphia and San Francisco were tied," Mr. Rendell said, recounting the story for public school food-service workers at a state convention here this week. "The last task was to go up to a cabdriver and say: 'My car is broken down and I need some jumper cables. Can you help me?' "
All the cabdrivers in San Francisco refused to help, and so did all but one in Philadelphia. "The last one said yes," the Mayor said, beaming, and that's how Philadelphia won the title.
Given the time, Mr. Rendell could spend another four-year term spinning out ways to show Philadelphia as a city that feels good about itself, and judging from the changes since he won election in 1991 and the popularity he has achieved as a result, he will probably get it.
While Philadelphia is just one of 40 big cities with a mayoral election on Nov. 7, few candidates or incumbents anywhere are expected to win with the ease predicted for Mr. Rendell.
"It's not so much if he'll win, but by what margin," said Randall Miller, a political science professor at St. Joseph's University here. "This is a two-term guy. The only question is, Where does he go after this?"
A Democrat and former district attorney, Mr. Rendell, 51, is opposed by Joseph Rocks, a Republican former State Senator, and by two minor-party candidates. The son of a firefighter, Mr. Rocks, 48, has been endorsed by police and firefighter unions, but has not appeared to excite enough voters to bring about an upset even with the promise of a big wage-tax cut, the major thrust of his campaign. Democrats have held City Hall for 44 consecutive years.
Independent polls show Mr. Rendell far ahead, and much of the reason is the enormous energy and enthusiasm he brings to the job -- even when he is not campaigning. A natural schmoozer, he thrives on dashing about the city, visiting neighborhood groups, giving awards and making speeches. After an hourlong candidates' debate on Thursday night, he made three more stops before calling it a night, close to 11 o'clock. On weekends, his schedule includes as many as 20 events a day.
Not even Mr. Rocks has been immune to Rendell fever, acknowledging that last year, before he was a candidate, he asked Mr. Rendell for a job as a lobbyist.
But unlike big-city mayors who shake hands and kiss babies for show, Mr. Rendell has much to be proud of. During his administration, the city has raised its bond rating from junk status to investment grade, the last years have produced budget surpluses with no layoffs or tax increases, downtown is flush with new projects, libraries are open six days a week for the first time in memory, and voters say they have noticed a new spirit all about.
"There was always so much negative about Philadelphia," said Kathy Middleton, 39, a food-service worker who has lived in Philadelphia all her life. "You always saw things going down. There was no new life. But now, it's wonderful. He has brought the city back to life."
Philadelphia is not without its problems. Federal budget cuts could cost the city as much as $100 million by 1997, Mr. Rendell said, if the final legislation resembles the bill passed by the House this week. Also, police officials are investigating corruption in the department; the city's population, now 1.6 million, continues to shrink, and municipal workers, particularly police, are grousing because their salaries have remained stagnant for years.
In addition, Mr. Rocks has attacked Mr. Rendell with the criticism that he has focused too much money and energy on downtown commercial and institutional projects at the expense of neighborhood needs, an accusation Mr. Rendell dismisses. And some voters in low-income neighborhoods say Mr. Rendell ignores them.
"We have a new Marriott hotel," he said. "Who do you think works there? People from the neighborhoods, that's who.
"But you can't do everything," he said. "Look, it's what you expect in a campaign. If I found a cure for cancer, they'd criticize me for not finding a cure for AIDS."
The campaign has produced few fireworks. But even if Mr. Rendell wins with the large margin expected, he still faces some political risk if, as many voters believe, he has designs on running for governor or the United States Senate after his second-term as Mayor. Mr. Miller, the political science professor, said Mr. Rendell would need a big turnout and a big victory to help maintain his viability.
But both Mr. Rendell and his chief of staff, David Cohen, deny that the Mayor has made any plans beyond the next four years. Mr. Cohen was not even certain his boss would be suited for higher office.
"He only cares about one thing," Mr. Cohen said. "So for him, he's already found the perfect job."

HEADLINE: It's Not the Most Conventional Run, But Specter Asserts He's in It to Win

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Senator Arlen Specter had just finished meeting with the editorial board of The Des Moines Register when, in the newspaper's lobby, he spied a young man who looked as if he might be an authentic Iowa voter. Naturally the Senator introduced himself. The young man responded by rolling his eyes.
"If it isn't Mr. Single-Bullet Theory himself," he said.
The young man ambled off, still smirking, and the Senator turned to a reporter. 
 "How would you like to not have a single day go by," he said, "without being asked about the single-bullet theory or Anita Hill?"
Mr. Specter, 65, has spent the better part of his life as a public figure, first as Philadelphia District Attorney, then as Senator from Pennsylvania and now as a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination. But out of that long career, just two events seem to stand out in the public consciousness: first, as a young lawyer for the Warren Commission, his championing of the theory that a single bullet, fired by a gunman acting alone, killed President John F. Kennedy, and second, his fierce questioning of Professor Hill, who had accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, during Senate hearings on Judge Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court.
In the aftermath of the Thomas hearings, Mr. Specter, one of the Republican Party's most committed defenders of abortion rights and a longtime ally of women's organizations, seemed fated to go down in history as a monster of male insensitivity. Indeed, some political analysts have gone so far as to suggest that his campaign for President is less about getting elected than about altering the image he leaves to posterity.
Certainly Mr. Specter is a long shot for the Republican nomination, as he freely acknowledges. But while other candidates might be discouraged by the kind of showing he has made so far, he himself seems to derive a perverse satisfaction from demonstrating just how unpopular he is willing to be in clinging to his own principles.
For instance, while most of his rivals either call themselves opponents of abortion or have tried to shade their positions to appeal to crucial anti-abortion voters in the Republican primary elections, Mr. Specter has made his support for abortion rights the centerpiece of his campaign. And while the other candidates seem to have embraced the conventional wisdom that no Republican candidate can win the nomination without the help of the Christian right, Mr. Specter spends much of his time denouncing the movement as a destructive "fringe."
"If they control the party, they're going to lead us to certain disaster," he said in an interview during a flight on a chartered jet from Philadelphia to Des Moines. "Not possible disaster, not likely disaster, but certain disaster."
Still, Mr. Specter insists that he is in the race to win. Strategically, his campaign is built on the premise that there are enough abortion-rights Republicans that in a 10-person field, they could give one candidate -- him -- enough votes to be competitive.
In theory, at least, that is a plausible enough premise; after all, everyone's favorite noncandidate, Gen. Colin L. Powell, also favors a right to abortion. But Gov. Pete Wilson of California, another pro-choice candidate, recently dropped out of the race for lack lof support. And Senator Specter, short of cash and near the bottom of most polls, acknowledges that he too has yet to mobilize the constituency he maintains is out there.
The first Jew to seek the Republican nomination, Mr. Specter says he believes that the country is ready for a Jewish President. And if it is not, he quickly adds, "it should be." At the same time, though, he says he believes that his religion hurts.
"I think that there continues to be a lot of anti-Semitism in America -- not as much as there is racism, but still a fair amount," he said. "And I think being Jewish costs votes. Whether it's 5 percent or 8 percent or 11 percent, I don't know."
Mr. Specter is frequently classified as a member of an endangered species, "moderate Republican." But he dislikes the term, saying it has acquired too many negative connotations.
Instead, he prefers to call himself a "fiscal, economic conservative and a social libertarian." In contrast to most of his fellow Republican candidates, who invoke as their inspiration Ronald Reagan, Mr. Specter frequently compares himself to Barry Goldwater -- a curious choice, given the dismal outcome of Mr. Goldwater's own Presidential campaign after he won the Republican nomination in 1964.
"I think my views are really the conservative views of Barry Goldwater: get the government off our backs, out of our pocketbooks and out of our bedrooms," he said.
"The government is most intrusive when it gets into people's personal lives," he continued. "The true conservative is not Pat Buchanan, who wants to bring the government into everything. The true conservative is my view: the least government is the best government."
Although he has a reputation for abrasiveness, Mr. Specter endures the humiliations of the campaign trail with relatively good humor. He shrugs off sarcastic comments about the single-bullet theory, which he still actively defends, and even managed a wan smile when a student at a West Des Moines high school offered to sell him a tape of heavy-metal rock for $15. (He declined.)
In his campaign appearances, Mr. Specter stresses not only his stance on abortion but also his support for a flat tax to replace the graduated income tax. Wherever he goes, he carries around the postcard-sized form that he says is all a taxpayer would need to fill out if a flat tax were adopted. Under his plan, all of an individual's investment earnings would be exempt from taxation. All remaining income would be taxed at the constant rate of 20 percent, with deductions allowed only for interest on mortgages (up to $100,000) and for charitable contributions (up to $2,500).
On the trail, Mr. Specter is often asked about Professor Hill, and every time he gives the same obviously rehearsed but still heartfelt-sounding answer.
"The Hill-Thomas hearings were a learning experience for me, and I think really a learning experience for the country," Mr. Specter said in response to one recent day's first question on the topic. "I personally had no idea how much sexual harassment there was until after those hearings were over and practically every woman I met told me about the time she was sexually harassed and told me how painful those hearings were, almost as if they saw themselves in Anita Hill's position."
As for Justice Thomas, Mr. Specter said he was disappointed with the performance so far, judging the Justice little more than "a clone" of Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court's most conservative member. But, he added, "I still think there's hope."
Unlike most Presidential candidates, who rely on finance chairmen with fat Rolodexes, Mr. Specter is financing his campaign largely through direct mail solicitations, singling out groups like Jewish and abortion-rights voters. His campaign chairman, Roger Stone, a veteran Republican strategist, maintains that the Senator will have "enough money to compete" in the early caucuses and primaries. But the campaign shows a net debt of almost $500,000 at present and should receive only $1 million or so in Federal matching funds early next year. In contrast, Senator Bob Dole's campaign has $6 million in the bank and expects at least $7 million in matching funds.
Because of his lack of money and of organizational support, Mr. Specter has adopted some unorthodox tactics for the early contests. Here in Iowa, for example, which will hold its caucuses on Feb. 12, he has been trying to enlist the support of labor unions, not an obvious constituency for a Republican candidate.
Mr. Specter estimates that one-quarter to one-third of the state's union members are Republicans and says that of all the Republican candidates, he has the record on labor issues that should be the most attractive to them. "I'm the only one who could walk into a union hall," he said, "and walk out alive."
Mr. Specter concedes that any Republican candidate relying on the support of labor unions will have to get pretty lucky to win the nomination. But, he maintains, "a lot of unexpected things have happened in this campaign."
"I can tell you this," he went on. "If I weren't in the race now, I'd really be kicking myself because of all the events that have occurred which leave me as the only candidate not off the board to the right. Everybody else is off the board to the right."

HEADLINE: Murder a Growth Industry In Poor, Reeling Camden

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Oct. 27

 BODY:
Clarence Jones, who had a record as a small-time drug dealer, was shot to death on Sunday. The police said the drive-by shooting was probably an act of revenge or a territorial grab by other drug dealers. His killing would be unremarkable by urban standards except that it was the 48th homicide here this year.
Early next month, at the current murder rate, the highest in New Jersey, the city will surpass its record of 51 slayings, set in 1992. Camden's homicide rate so far this year is nearly twice that of Newark. 
 It is another blow for a poor city of 87,000 across the Delaware River from Philadelphia that has known many defeats.
The latest rebuff came this week when the city's call for state troopers to help contain its soaring murder rate was turned down by state officials who wanted to know why the local 341-member police force could not handle the problem.
A task force of state troopers patrolled with city police for several months in 1993 after the previous record-setting outbreak of murders.
The State Attorney General, Deborah T. Poritz, after conferring Thursday with Bob Pugh, Camden's Police Chief, said that, before any troopers were dispatched to Camden this time, it needed to be understood why the city force was not more effective.
Getting that answer will take many weeks of study by outside experts. On Camden's dreary streets, where men lounge on street corners and young mothers push baby carriages past burned-out row houses, there were quicker judgments about the nature of the problem.
"Long as there's no jobs, people going to deal drugs," said Lonnie Watkins, 33, carrying a bag of groceries on Broadway in South Camden. "And if that's how you make your living, then you protect your business any way you can, know what I mean?" Mr. Watkins freed one hand from his grocery bag, cocked his thumb and took aim with a forefinger. "Ker-POW!" he said, and blew imaginary smoke from the end of his finger.
People used to measure prosperity here by the number of tomatoes that spilled from the trucks carrying produce to the Campbell Soup factory by the riverfront. But the factory closed several years ago, and while Campbell still maintains a white-collar force at its Camden headquarters, it no longer employs local workers in food production, and plans for a new 20-story corporate building have been shelved.
What jobs there were for Camden residents in the Philadelphia Navy Yard were lost with the recent closing of that base. Other fallout from the end of the Cold War and cutbacks in the space program eliminated aerospace and electronics plants that once employed thousands locally, leaving Camden the fifth-poorest city in the nation.
Unemployment hovers around 20 percent; two-thirds of the population receives public assistance, and more than half of the community is less than 25 years old. Middle-class white families long ago moved to suburbs like Cherry Hill, and black, Hispanic and Asian people now make up the great majority of the population. The flat-roofed brick row houses the whites left behind now house people mired in unemployment and the social ills that accompany economic decline.
"The difficulty with Camden is, people who can make it get away, and those who can't come here," said Monsignor Michael Doyle, an Irish-born priest at Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church who has worked with the poor of South Camden for three decades.
New civic ornaments on the riverfront like the Thomas H. Kean state aquarium and a Blockbuster-Sony music entertainment center are attractive but offer a limited number of unskilled jobs "parking cars and picking up litter," he said.
Across town, Rosa Ramirez takes on the daunting task of driving the drug dealers and prostitutes from street corners across from St. Joseph's parish school, where she works as a secretary and lunch program director, and from locations a few blocks down Federal Street where Woodrow Wilson High School stands.
Ms. Ramirez, 53, is president of Camden Churches Organized for People, the city's largest grass-roots organization. On Sundays after Mass, hundreds of members drawn from more than 3,000 Spanish-speaking, black and Vietnamese families hold prayer vigils at what she describes as "hot corners," attempting to galvanize others in the neighborhoods to present a counterforce to the criminal elements.
"Two years ago, the people would not speak out about what was going on in their street," she said. "Now, they are more willing to talk to the police because they know sooner or later they or their children are going to get killed right in front of their homes." A drug ring called the Sons of Malcolm X was broken up last year and the streets became safer, she said, but the gang was soon replaced by others who fought murderously for the territory.
The police say they are doing the best they can with the resources and manpower available to them. In the 1970's, when the crime rate and murder rate were lower, the police department received Federal funds to add 30 percent more officers than are available today, said Inspector Albert Handy, a 28-year veteran of the Camden police force.
What makes selling drugs so profitable, and worth the danger to some, are steady streams of visitors from the suburbs who drive to Camden to buy marijuana, crack cocaine and, increasingly, heroin, said Lieut. Thomas Olson, head of the Police Department's criminal investigative division.
On Thursday evening, the two officers met in the fortress-like police headquarters with other city and community leaders to prepare for "Mischief Night," the Halloween observance that every year brings a rash of arsons and shootings. After hearing of the preparations, Ms. Ramirez said, "In Camden, every night is Mischief Night."

HEADLINE: Haitian-Americans Work to Rebuild Their Newly Democratic Homeland

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Max Delices's voice floats over the airwaves of a Haitian-American radio station in Brooklyn, painting enticing pictures of a Haiti that he urges listeners to go and see for themselves.
Roger Etienne, an accountant in East Flatbush, said he plans to help open trade centers in Haiti's jagged foothills to train high school dropouts to be paramedics, paralegals and word processors so they can work in "the Haiti of tomorrow." 
 And Dr. Jean Claude Compas ships donations of needles, bandages and intravenous bags from his Brooklyn office to Haiti's poorly equipped hospitals.
The three Brooklyn men are among scores of middle-class or affluent Haitian-Americans in New York City who are helping to rebuild their country after the restoration of democracy last year.
While few of the immigrants are moving back permanently, many are making frequent or long visits -- either to take advantage of new business opportunities or to offer humanitarian aid. Others simply wish to once again set foot on the soil they were forced to leave many years ago. They say that years of living abroad have only sharpened their passion for Haiti.
The way for return was cleared when President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored to power a year ago under the watch of United States military forces.
The country can already feel the effects of support from abroad; the money Haitian-Americans send to their families has increased by 10 percent to about $40 million a year, said Smarck Michel, who resigned earlier this month as Haiti's Prime Minister.
Many of the exiles equate the task of rebuilding in Haiti with development by blacks in South Africa. They say they hope to mirror what Jews from abroad have done to help Israel.
"In New York, the Jewish people helped rebuild Israel," said Mr. Delices, 36, a self-employed financial consultant in East Flatbush and a host on Radio Soleil. The station's signals are piggybacked on other radio stations' frequencies; radios must have special receivers or computer chips to receive the programs.
"One of the things they did was to set up a fund," Mr. Delices said. "It's brilliant. We should be doing that for Haiti to help build bridges, roads and hospitals." The current building boom in Haiti has caused a shortage of masons and electricians, Mr. Michel said.
Mr. Aristide's return ended the era of tyranny that began when the Duvalier family dictatorship took power in the 1950's. Haitians were taxed and robbed by successive governments that provided little in the way of roads, hospitals, schools and even potable water.
The Haitians who fled have settled largely in New York, Miami and Boston. Some 500,000 people in the New York metropolitan area are of Haitian descent, with enclaves in East Flatbush and Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
Mr. Delices arrived in East Flatbush 14 years ago after his oldest brother helped pack his suitcases and ushered him to a plane. The Port-au-Prince native was an outspoken radio broadcaster who blasted the Duvalier regime; his family feared his days were numbered. He stayed away until May 1995, when he returned to witness democracy in action, he said.
"If I hadn't left, I would be history by now," he said. "Now, it's time to go to do something for my country. It's free and open. You can say what you want and no one will punish you."
As a consultant for Haitian-owned travel agencies in Brooklyn, he prods owners to sell Haiti to customers. On his radio talk show, he discusses ways to revitalize the country and applauds Mr. Aristide's hotly contested move toward privatizing governmental services.
"We should go back and spend money to revive our home," he said. "I tell them: 'Hey, Haiti is open. You can dream about it, or make your dream come true.' "
Mr. Etienne, 56, also supports privatization, but his concerns revolve around education rather than business. At least two-thirds of the population is illiterate and less than 5 percent of the country's youths are enrolled in high schools.
He is a member of the Haitian Affairs Committee, a nonprofit group of professionals based in East Flatbush, which had worked vigorously to reinstate Mr. Aristide, but is now focused on education.
The group is busy trying to help find funding for trade schools that would provide classroom and on-the-job training for young adults in the countryside.
Born in the northern city of Cap-Haitien, Mr. Etienne left Haiti in 1968. "A lot of young people left because the situation was unbearable," he said. "There was no freedom. If you opened your mouth, you could have been shot on sight. The Duvalier law said: 'Any Communist thought in public or private was punishable by death.' Of course comments like getting food to the people was thought to be Communist."
The next time he went back was in 1986 after the last Duvalier was overthrown. He returned in 1990 when Mr. Aristide was elected.
"I was there," he said. "I saw the lines forming at 4 A.M. as people waited for the ballots to come. It was so important to the people that peasant women went to have their hair done so they could look nice. And if they had one good dress, it was ready after being laid out overnight."
Dr. Compas, a family practitioner in Crown Heights, speaks of his homeland with the same pride. Shortly after Mr. Aristide's return last year, Dr. Compas opened a medical office in Port-au-Prince, the capital, near the National Palace. He and other Haitian-American doctors, frequently sponsor medical and supply drives. He flies to Haiti once a month.
"There is a lot of technology that we don't have," Dr. Compas said. In Haiti, there are only 3 doctors per 100,000 people. But the doctors are concentrated in the capital, and even there, equipment and medicine are limited.
"At my clinic, I want to try to provide services that we don't have," Dr. Compas said, "but I don't want to be in competition with other Haitian doctors."
Dr. Compas left Haiti in his 20's to attend medical school in Lille, France, because his country lacked opportunities.
"My country is very important to me," he said. "I want to do what I can to make it grow."
With the presidential election scheduled for December, many Haitian-Americans are eager to spend Christmas in Haiti to relish the last days of Mr. Aristide, who is barred by the Constitution from succeeding himself.
American Airlines has added flights to Haiti from New York since Mr. Aristide's return. Flights in late December have been booked solid for months, the airline said.
Mr. Etienne remembers the "loving and festive" Christmases of his childhood. "If you heard caroling outside someone's house -- even if they didn't know you -- they would invite you in and offer you a soda.
"The very first Christmas I spent away from home I was sad, and every year I always say I'm dreaming of a green Christmas."

HEADLINE: Ailing Czar, Fragile State

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The official secrecy and vagueness surrounding the condition of President Boris N. Yeltsin, hospitalized since Thursday with a second attack of heart disease, are beginning to have the usual counterproductive effects here.
For all of Russia's semi-democratic trappings, Mr. Yeltsin has followed Russian history in keeping the presidency a regal office, and everyone knows the czar is very ill. No one suggests he is about to die, but his chances of running for, let alone winning, a second term in June are growing slimmer. 
 As his loyal acolytes and retainers are seeing their hero and meal ticket falter, nerves are jangling, and assurances that all is well sound increasingly hollow. Big decisions cannot be made, whether about Bosnia or political strategy before December's parliamentary elections.
In sharp contrast to the American reaction to presidential illness -- charts and graphs and medical briefings -- Russia preserves a monarchic secrecy. There has been no photograph of Mr. Yeltsin, no television, no statements from his doctors except through official spokesmen.
For the third day, Mr. Yeltsin was allowed no non-family visitors. But clumsy efforts at reassurance continue, with claims that Government work is unaffected. The official Rossiskaya Gazeta said today that "the President will recover soon." The President's official paper, Rossikiye Vesti, asserted that "Boris Yeltsin's condition does not cause anxiety."
But a politician can survive only one heart attack, says Sergei Markov of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "Who will vote for a sick man?" he asked. "Once, maybe, it could be explained away, but not twice."
Mr. Yeltsin's period of rule seems to be drawing to an end, with all its drama and accomplishment, but with the transition toward a new, democratic, market-oriented Russia inevitably incomplete. The system is still fragile, and moods about domestic and foreign policies are increasingly somber, defensive and isolationist. Even as the economy is finally stabilizing, Communists and ultranationalists who promise to undue some of Mr. Yeltsin's reforms are expected to do well in the elections scheduled for Dec. 17.
Mr. Yeltsin vowed to protect the essence of Russia's reforms against any resurgence of Communists and ultranationalists. Under the current Constitution, with nearly undefeatable veto powers, he could. But a different President -- Aleksandr Lebed, say, or Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin -- would make different compromises with those unhappy about the pace and course of stop-and-go reforms.
Current opinion polls show that the Communists and the ultranationalist parties should do better in December. But they are still not likely to win a working majority in a new lower house, let alone command the two-thirds majority needed to override vetoes. And there is little expectation, judging from the last Parliament and other regional assemblies, that the Communists and ultranationalists can find common ground.
But the sense of Mr. Yeltsin as a bulwark against revisionism has been shaken. Questions are again being raised about whether he will allow himself the revolutionary act of voluntary retirement, or whether he will pursue the czarist and Communist model of trying to die in office, as the safest place to hide.
Some, like Mikhail Leontyev of the newspaper Sevodnya, think elections could be canceled and a state of emergency declared. Those around Mr. Yeltsin will seek to preserve him, and thus themselves, in power for as long as he draws breath, Mr. Leontyev suggests, saying: "Those in the executive branch are afraid of ending up in a jail cell."
As important, they are afraid of losing their offices, dachas, cars and business opportunities. That is why Mr. Yeltsin's aides had moved against Mr. Chernomyrdin, who appeared the natural, even anointed, successor after Mr. Yeltsin's first hospitalization in July.
But Mr. Yeltsin's new frailty casts the dice again. Russians afraid of instability may withhold their votes from Communists and ultranationalists in December and may look more favorably on the steady Mr. Chernomyrdin in June, rather than risk an untested figure as President.
Yeltsin aides, however, may move to Yuri Skokov, a quiet bureaucrat with good military and intelligence connections who nearly became Prime Minister in December 1992 instead of Mr. Chernomyrdin.
Now allied to Mr. Lebed, Mr. Skokov has promised Mr. Yeltsin and his aides security under a new presidency. Some Yeltsin aides suggested before his illness that Mr. Yeltsin might dump Mr. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister for Mr. Skokov after December, in an effort to weaken the presidential bid of Mr. Lebed.
All these calculations are not idle. Whenever the czar weakens, everyone looks first to themselves.

HEADLINE: Syria Raises an Increasingly Lonely Voice Against Israeli Power

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria

 BODY:
The Syrian Government is voicing new frustration at what it calls signs that Israel is being allowed to forge an increasingly strong role in the Middle East.
As other Arab delegations prepare to join Israeli officials at an American-sponsored economic conference in Amman, Jordan, the Damascus Government has decided to stay away, and it is pointing to the gathering to sound new alarms at what it regards as others' capitulation. 
 "There is no way to compel Syria to abandon her rights and dignity because if she did that, she would be like the one who places a bomb that permanently threatens the security of the region," Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam warned in a recent address in Colombia.
After 47 years formally in a state of war, Syria remains firm in insisting that peace requires a complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory in the Golan Heights. But now that the Palestine Liberation Organization and Jordan have concluded accords with Israel, Damascus is portraying Israel as a dangerous beneficiary of a peace that is deeply flawed.
In announcing Syria's boycott of the economic-development conference, which is to open on Oct. 29, officials here have portrayed it as bound to serve Israeli interests.
And with Jordan, the P.L.O. and others plainly eager for the international aid from the Middle East Development Bank that the United States hopes the conference will establish, a Government newspaper used a recent front-page editorial to scorn the projects under review as likely only to "establish the so-called new Middle East under Israeli leadership."
Another fresh point of Syrian discontent lies in southern Lebanon, where requests from Washington and Jerusalem that Syria rein in the Party of God guerrillas responsible for the recent deaths of nine Israeli soldiers have been met with resentment.
As Syria sees it, those guerrillas are fighting a legitimate war of national resistance against Israeli occupiers. That vision, once a commonplace in the Arab world, is among the many that Syria, a powerful but increasingly lonely voice, warns are being trampled in the rush to ratify Middle East peace.
"I think it's fair to say that the Syrians are in a particularly sour mood," a Western diplomat said.
The sense of Syrian frustration has increased since June, when the abrupt collapse of the latest round of peace talks with Israel left Damascus to confront the first in a series of unwanted turns.
Syrian officials have said their side has been unduly blamed for the breakdown of the discussions, which were adjourned after two days by Syrian negotiators. They have said an Israeli proposal then to maintain ground monitoring stations in the Golan Heights so contradicted Syria's longtime insistence on total Israeli withdrawal that the two sides had nothing left to talk about.
Since then, Syria has had to watch as Washington embraced the two Arab leaders it regards as most misguided: King Hussein of Jordan and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
In its response to the American and Israeli criticism over the Party of God attacks against Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Syria has been more muted. But its official newspapers have suggested that those who have called on Syria to restrain the guerrilla strikes have swung too far toward an Israeli point of view.
"Operations against occupation are a kind of self-defense, no matter what the U.S. State Department thinks or says," The Syrian Times said in an editorial.

HEADLINE: WORLD SERIES '95: NOTEBOOK;
Players and Owners Take Lesson In Geography of Labor Problems

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Fort Lauderdale and Homestead don't quite live up to Munich and Potsdam in the context of historical significance, where agreements affecting the world's powers took on the names of geographical locations.
But Fort Lauderdale and Homestead, cities in southeast Florida, are locations that have given their names to developments in major league baseball's long-running labor dispute. 
 Fort Lauderdale was the site of a meeting in January 1994, where the owners adopted a revenue sharing plan for the first time. Throughout the eight-month strike, when labor representatives of the owners and players talked about revenue sharing, they referred to "Fort Lauderdale" instead of a revenue sharing plan, as when the players said they would accept Fort Lauderdale.
Drive south from Fort Lauderdale, past Miami, and Homestead comes into view. No agreement was reached there, but when people in baseball say "Homestead," they mean the spring training camp operated there last spring by the players association for unemployed players.
"Homestead" is being used more and more these days as the free-agent period draws near. Players eligible for free agency, in fact, can begin filing tomorrow. But Homestead, as uttered by club officials, has a nasty connotation for players who plan to become free agents willingly or who will be set free by their clubs.
Homestead, in the view of one player agent, is a buzzword meant to intimidate players and agents, as in threatening them with unemployment. But, as one agent said: "They don't need any extra intimidation. Reality is enough."
There will be no Homestead next spring, at least not literally. Perhaps there will be figuratively, in the sense that many players could still be looking for jobs when spring training begins in February. But the union has no plans or reasons to duplicate the fine camp it ran last April.
The union created Homestead because most free agents had not found jobs by the time signed players were heading for spring training after the end of the strike. But the main reason so many players remained unsigned was the double signing freeze that existed through the winter.
First, the Players Association told players not to sign contracts because the clubs had changed the contracts and working rules unilaterally. Then the owners' labor relations committee placed a freeze on signings by delegating individual signing authority to itself.
With no work stoppage or signing freeze hampering operations this signing season, signings should proceed at a quicker pace. That is not to say all free agents will find jobs by the end of the year, or even by the start of spring training.
With the usual stars excepted, the coming signing season will be a buyer's market. Clubs needing a backup second baseman will have 8 or 10 or 12 players to choose from. If one doesn't want a $250,000 salary, four or five others will grab it.
That is the reality the agent referred to, and it will be the overriding economic factor at work in this free-agent market. Stars pursued by a collection of clubs will fare all right financially, but a growing number of players in the middle class will find it difficult to get jobs or salaries commensurate with what they believe their talents are.
The clubs have wanted a payroll cap or tax to curb their spending because they have never learned how to do it themselves. The heavy economic losses they have suffered, the half-billion dollars in lost revenue they have incurred this year, give the clubs a ready-made reason not to spend the usual amounts of money on players' salaries.
The clubs should be able to reduce their payrolls easily on that basis that the new economics should obviate the need for a cap or tax.
The market and the state of the baseball economy, though, will produce another development. So many players will be available that clubs could find enough players to transform themselves from a losing team to a winning team.
 
Free-Agent Potential
 These players would make up a pretty good All-Star team:
Fred McGriff at first base, Roberto Alomar or Craig Biggio at second, Shawon Dunston at shortstop, Ken Caminiti at third, Mike Stanley catching, Jose Canseco the designated hitter and Dante Bichette and Ron Gant flanking Devon White in the outfield.
Add starting pitchers Jack McDowell, Kenny Rogers, Ramon Martinez, Chuck Finley, Jim Abbott, Ken Hill and Andy Benes and a relief corps headed by Jeff Montgomery and Tom Henke.
Those are the more attractive players who are eligible to file for free agency beginning tomorrow. Other equally talented players could join them if their clubs don't exercise options in their contracts for 1996 or offer salary arbitration in the next five days.
The Seattle Mariners must let Edgar Martinez, the American League batting champion, know by Tuesday whether they will pick up an option for $3.5 million. Boston has to decide this week whether to pay Rick Aguilera, their No. 1 reliever, $4 million next season.
Players who face restrictions as repeat free agents will learn this week whether their options have been exercised. Those include Darryl Strawberry of the Yankees ($1.8 million), Dennis Eckersley of Oakland ($2.25 million), Paul Molitor of Toronto ($4 million) and Otis Nixon of Texas ($2.6 million). Eckersley missed by two games having his option take effect automatically.
In the group of players who can be free agents if they don't receive salary arbitration offers in the next five days are David Cone and Wade Boggs of the Yankees, Kevin Brown of Baltimore, Gary Gaetti of Kansas City, Todd Stottlemyre of Oakland, Mickey Tettleton and Bob Tewksbury of Texas, Randy Myers of the Chicago Cubs and Ozzie Smith of St. Louis.
 
Omar Vizquel Fan Club
 Jimy Williams, the Atlanta Braves' third-base coach, has added his name to the list of Omar Vizquel fans, but he has more than a fan's appreciation of the ability of the Cleveland Indians' shortstop.
"Vizquel is real active out there," said Williams, once a shortstop himself. "I read him because I played short. I respect him for the way he plays. He's sneaky in a good way. I think he watches me a lot to see if I'm watching him."
The activity Williams referred to is Vizquel's style of play when a runner is at second base. He often fakes a move to second for a pickoff throw and sometimes actually darts to the bag for a throw from the pitcher or at least to give the pitcher an opportunity to throw. The third-base coach is responsible for alerting the runner to the shortstop's whereabouts.
"He's trying to get an out; he's trying to do something," Williams said, flashing a smile of appreciation for Vizquel's efforts. "He does it from a distance, but his quickness makes him so good. I respect that. He's looking for a lean or a step. He has good instincts."
The only part of his game Vizquel hasn't exhibited in the World Series is the barehand grab of a bouncer to short. He did it a couple of times against Seattle in the American League playoff.
"This isn't turf," Williams pointed out. Vizquel makes the barehanded play only on artificial turf, always using his glove on less predictable grass.
 
Indians Look Ahead
 Even as they were trying to win the World Series, the Cleveland Indians were shopping some members of their starting lineup in trade talks with other clubs. Catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. and first baseman Paul Sorrento are the starters the Indians have offered.
The Indians, according to one executive, would like to find another catcher to replace the injury-prone Alomar. In seeking to trade Sorrento, the Indians are planning to platoon Herbert Perry and Eddie Murray, whom they want back as a free agent, at first base. They would add a left-handed hitter to be the designated hitter when Murray plays first.

Inequalities in Income Are Reported Widening

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
The income gap between rich and poor keeps growing wider in the United States, according to a study issued last week. Some conservatives' definition of the middle class seems to be stretching along with the gap.
The study, commissioned by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, concluded that the difference between the best-paid 10 percent of Americans and the worst-paid 10 percent is wider than in any other large, industrialized nation.The study did not try to analyze the reasons for the high levels of inequality in the United States. It did say that inequality here had risen between 1980 and 1991. 
 Earlier in the week, the Raleigh News and Observer in North Carolina reported that one of the state's Republican Congressmen, Representative Frederick K. Heineman, had said that he considered himself lower-middle class even though he earns $183,500 a year from his Congressional pay and police pension.
"When I see someone who is making anywhere from $300,000 to $750,000 a year, that's middle class," said Mr. Heineman, a former New York City police officer and Raleigh police chief. "When I see anyone above that, that's upper middle class."
By comparison, the Census Bureau released figures this month showing that only one-fifth of all American households earn more than $62,841 a year, and only 5 percent earn more than $109,821. KEITH BRADSHER

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
A Stock for Each Season

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
SECTOR analysis sounds like something you might flunk in high school. But with the stock market stagnant, technology stocks flying on vapor, and the economy in its 55th month of increasingly uncertain expansion, sector analysis may well pinpoint stocks to buy and stocks to avoid.
Sector strategies can be very dangerous, particularly when people chase today's "hot" sector. Often, these investors are Johnny-come-lately's who get in just as the industry cools down. Another tack, though also risky, takes a "top down" approach, looking for those sectors likely to do well at a given stage of the economy. 
 What does this economy-based theory say to today's investor? Here's one analyst's recommendation: "Buy Eat-'Em-Smoke-'Em-Drink-'Em-Then-Pay-for-It-by-Going-to-the-Doctor stocks." These are the consumer staples like Campbell's Soup, Philip Morris and Coca-Cola, along with health-care stocks like Merck. Stocks to avoid: those high-flying tech issues.
Such is the thinking of Sam Stovall, editor of Standard & Poor's Industry Reports, and his colleagues. Looking at economic and market data from 1969 through 1991, they concluded that the economy is in late expansion. That means, they believe, that the market will soon look kindly on health and consumer-staples companies -- the Eat-'Em-Smoke-'Em stocks -- because those enterprises tend to do better than others during economic downturns.
Other consumer-staple companies that may shine are Iowa Beef Processors and American Brands, the S.& P. analysts figure, and good health-care bets include Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and Pfizer.
Sector investing gets its power from the fact that up to 60 cents of every dollar's move in a stock's price comes from trends in the overall market, and from whether a sector is in or out of favor.
Interested investors can turn to the 300 or so sector funds available. Fidelity Investments, the behemoth of the mutual fund business, offers 35 sector funds with some $5.5 billion in assets.
For Mr. Stovall and his colleagues, the economic cycle is the main guide for these investments. In their just-published "1995 Standard & Poor's Guide to Sector Investing," they posit that as economic expansion picks up, transportation stocks will thrive as more and more goods are delivered. As demand continues to rise,companies seek to improve productivity through technology, so computer and other high-tech stocks also prosper.
As the economy reaches the middle phase of expansion, service stocks, like providers of temporary workers, rise as companies struggle to meet increased demand but remain reluctant to add to permanent overhead costs.
Finally, when the expansion is in full throttle, companies hire a few more workers but spend more money on capital goods. That makes stocks in machine tools, energy, and basic materials like steel the way to go. Then -- now, Mr. Stovall would say -- the contraction begins.
Sector investing is not for everyone, warned Neal Litvack, Fidelity's executive vice president. A sector investor must stay alert to economic developments, be able to tolerate above-average volatility, and allocate no more than 10 percent of assets to such investing because of that volatility, he said. And watch out if you are chasing today's hot sector. On five of the seven occasions since 1985 when a sector was hot, many more investor dollars poured into funds after the sector delivered its best returns than before, according to a study by Morningstar, the mutual-fund research company.
Moreover, remember that all investing models cannot fit all of the facts. Mr. Stovall's model, for example, does not explain the remarkable 1995 performance of high-tech stocks. And it assumes that future economic performance will reflect past economic performance. But a few economists say that the economy is changing so quickly that the future ain't what it used to be.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Don't Spend Tax Breaks Before They've Hatched

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THOUGH the final terms of the 1995 tax bill won't be known for another month or two, Congress has already taught some investors a costly lesson: a little knowledge is particularly dangerous when it comes to taxes.
After repeated statements from Republican leaders that taxes on capital gains would be cut retroactively to Jan. 1, 1995, legislators now appear inclined to make lower rates apply only to transactions made much later: probably after Oct. 13, but possibly not until early next year. 
 "They told everybody to go out and sell" with some assurance of getting the new, lower rate, said Bob Shapiro, national director of tax policy at Price Waterhouse and a former Capitol Hill tax aide. "I didn't think they'd do this," deny lower rates to most people who sold in 1995.
To be sure, accountants and other financial advisers routinely caution clients to be wary of Congressional whim and never to let tax considerations dictate investment decisions. But that is easier said than done.
Now, with the passage of its version of the budget bill, the Senate has put the main components of the pending tax legislation into useful focus. It's not necessarily time yet to take action. Still, it probably makes sense to refrain from a few actions, like putting money into an individual retirement account or buying an annuity, for the time being, since all the rules on savings and taxes are up for grabs. New types of accounts and new rules on existing ones could change your way of thinking by early next year.
In the category of things not worth delaying might be the sale of some financial assets to realize long-term gains, particularly if you're skittish about the financial markets and their increasing volatility. There are savvy ways to do such sales to make sure any future cut in capital gains tax will come your way.
On saving accounts, capital gains and other central tax issues, the final legislation will no doubt emerge only after a Senate-House conference, an anticipated veto by President Clinton and subsequent negotiations by all.
There is near unanimity on a few fronts. C. Clinton Stretch, of the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, and other tax professionals consider a tax credit for each child a near certainty. The credit, probably $500 for each child under age 18, will probably apply to people under certain income limits and take effect in January 1996.
Next most likely, many tax advisers say, are a reduction in capital gains taxes and the creation of what the Republicans call American Dream savings accounts, which would provide a tax-advantaged way to save for something other than retirement, say a house or college tuition.
You will probably be able to exclude from taxation 50 percent of any gains on assets held more than a year. The top rate would drop from 28 percent now to an effective rate of 19.8 percent under both the House and Senate proposals. The provision is likely to kick in Oct. 14, though it might be later this year or Jan. 1, 1996. Indexing assets for future inflation, a provision in the House bill, will probably be dropped, while profits on baseball cards, coins and other collectibles are expected to remain subject to a 28 percent rate.
David M. Bradt Jr. of Arthur Andersen & Company predicted that the cut would take effect no later than mid-October, but suggested that investors who want to play it safe sell now in such a way that defers recognition of the profits until next year.
For stocks, which have generated hefty gains for many people this year, the tactic is called shorting against the box, a common way of locking in gains by borrowing and selling the same number of shares you already hold. Sometime next year after the legislation's effective date, you would deliver your stock to the party from whom you borrowed. Not only would your profit be taxed at the new, lower rate, but the tax would not be due until 1997. Why pay now when you can pay later?
Anyone who sold assets before mid-October of this year, on the other hand, may need to earmark some of the profit for taxes due next spring.
And anyone with losses on stocks or other investments will want to think about selling them before year's end. This is because both bills call for doubling the amount of losses needed to offset each dollar of ordinary income, up to the $3,000 maximum, effective Jan. 1.
For real estate, consider tailoring a transaction as an installment sale, with some or all of the proceeds to be paid next year. The risk is that the buyer might become unable to pay or, because of some real or imagined flaw in the property, unwilling to pay.
Before making such shifts wholesale, remember that under the Senate bill half of all capital gains would be added back to taxable income for purposes of calculating the alternative minimum tax, which trips up many taxpayers. "Watch out that you don't realize a lot of capital gains only to find out you don't capture it all because you're bumping up against the A.M.T.," counsels John A. McGraw, a vice president in the Washington office of Loomis, Sayles & Company, a large investment adviser.
In theory, a steep cut in the capital gains levy would make some other tax-advantaged products, like individual retirement accounts, less attractive in relative terms. But specialists dismiss the suggestion that taxpayers focus on capital gains instead of I.R.A.'s as wrongheaded. "Tax-free is always better than taxed at half rate," said Mr. Stretch of Deloitte & Touche.
I.R.A.'s will probably gain wider appeal in new legislation. Both the House and the Senate suggest that nonearning spouses be allowed the full $2,000 deduction for contributions, a perk now confined to the employed. If one spouse works and one does not, the maximum contribution is now $2,250 for the couple. More people are expected to qualify for the I.R.A. deduction because of higher income ceilings. Households could also gain financial flexibility, namely the ability to make penalty-free withdrawals for certain purposes, including medical and college expenses.
The American Dream savings account, probably taking effect in January, would have no initial tax advantage, but the contributions, unlimited in both House and Senate bills, would compound tax free and could be withdrawn tax free after five years. Earlier withdrawals would be permitted without penalty for designated expenses.
These accounts are considered so appealing, in fact, that advisers expect a surge of popularity that would come at the expense of the annuity business, which has boomed in recent years as Americans wake up to their long-term retirement needs.
Annuities, which merely defer taxes on growth until withdrawal and provide no tax benefit for contributions, would become less attractive, Mr. McGraw said, but he added, "I don't think it would be crippling."
Various other provisions of the House and Senate bills have a most uncertain fate. Some would not merit much financial attention even if the outcome of the legislative marathon were known, because taxpayers can do so little to prepare for them.
Among these items are a marriage credit of up to $145, credits for adoption and interest paid on student loans, repeal of the 1993 increase in taxation of Social Security benefits, creation of medical saving accounts and an increased exclusion from estate tax.
So the wisest course seems to be to keep an eye on the general direction of tax policy but avoid being paralyzed by uncertainty.
"If there's a valid business or investment reason to do a transaction now," said Mr. Bradt of Arthur Andersen, "I'd be very reluctant to defer doing it for tax reasons."

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
The Marxist Professor

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
THERE he was, one of New York City's last old-time Marxists, propped in a lunchtime den of wealthy Wall Street types, shaking a forkful of Irish sausage as he delivered prophecies of doom.
"Capitalism is not a rational system," exclaimed Stanley Aronowitz, a sociology professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center. "The only way it turns around is through mass struggle." 
 But no one at the Beekman Pub was listening. Not the soberly suited young men leaning against the bar. Nor the smart-looking couple in a nearby booth.
"Is everything O.K.?" asked the cheery waitress asked, interrupting Mr. Aronowitz's rambling manifesto.
No! Everything isn't O.K.
That's exactly the point Mr. Aronowitz has been trying to make through four decades of union organizing, proselytizing and Marx-influenced writing and teaching. Whether we know it or not, he says, we're stuck in a class structure that doesn't let us (or enough of us) breathe.
But these are difficult times for Marxists like him. It's been decades since the studying of Marx was regarded as the radical chic of the academic world. The camp of professors that taught Marx in the 60's and 70's has retreated from the social activism that was once so closely associated with it.
What they're doing these days seems far more ivory-towerish. Dispersing into departments that range from economics to women's studies to cultural studies, they are content to explore the power games underlying sex, money and, in a truly abstract exercise, knowledge itself. And that can leave unrepentant radicals pretty lonely, even Mr. Aronowitz, who has tried to keep up with the academic times.
"They say I'm the last one," said the 62-year-old Mr. Aronowitz. "They say I'm the last of the working-class intellectuals. That's terrible."
But Mr. Aronowitz is not likely to fade away anytime soon. In fact, he made quite a splash with his latest contribution to the class struggle: "The Jobless Future: Sci-Tech and the Dogma of Work," a nearly 400-page book written with another sociologist, William DiFazio.
The authors argue that technological advances, like automated teller machines, are permanently dislodging legions of workers from their jobs each and every day in a reorganization of labor.
It's a dreary state of affairs, as Mr. Aronowitz is wont to point out any chance he gets.
"Look what's happening on Wall Street," Mr. Aronowitz said, sipping a very dry Bombay Gibson on ice. "They've laid off 80,000 people out of 400,000 since 1987. It's not a blip, either. It's a permanent displacement. If we don't begin to look at our social arrangements, New York is going to be like Bombay."
Or even, he said later, Detroit.
Ever since the "The Jobless Future" was published last fall, Mr. Aronowitz has been getting calls from unionists, politicians, quotation-hunting journalists and talk-show hosts. (He has been on National Public Radio more than once.) And traditionally liberal periodicals, like The Nation, published lengthy reviews, while major newspapers, like The Washington Post, quoted him in feature articles on joblessness.
It's all got Mr. Aronowitz gloating, if only a bit.
"Marx is starting to look pretty smart at a time when Marxism should have been buried with the Soviet Union," he said. "There was a lot of smugness before the stock market crash in '87, but things are changing. There are a lot more people who aren't so sure about their futures."
Still, he and Mr. DiFazio see a way out, albeit a utopian one. They envision a brave new world in which workers are given shorter workweeks, have guaranteed wages and can spend their leisure in the pursuit of happiness, whether in a museum, on a college campus or with their families at home.
Which is all in keeping with Marx.
The book only reinforces Mr. Aronowitz's reputation at CUNY. He has long been regarded as one of CUNY's most prominent crusaders, who attracts and nurtures some of the most radical students with his insights on the state of mass culture, from TV and movies to rock and roll.
A few years ago, he was right there, bullhorn in hand, calling for solidarity when student demonstrators occupied the CUNY Graduate Center, on 42d Street, to protest state cuts.
Mr. Aronowitz's class-conscious sensibilities run deep. He grew up in blue-collar East Tremont, the Bronx, where boys dreamed of landing jobs in steel mills and truck yards, just as their fathers had.
Mr. Aronowitz's father dropped out of New York University in his freshman year to take a job as a reporter for The New York World. His mother, who held a variety of jobs in department stores and an office, was an ardent unionist who eventually became a shop steward.
It was the early 50's when he joined the blue-collar work force himself as a teen-ager. He took a job loading a fur truck and then worked at steel plants in New Jersey. He also began to take labor-relations courses and became a union organizer.
By 1967, he was enrolled at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, where he earned a degree in sociology. This set him on a lifelong academic course; he has published a dozen books and hundreds of articles for newspapers and academic journals.
Still, his passion has always been working in the trenches of the labor struggle. "I was always bored in classrooms," Mr. Aronowitz said. "Bored out of my skull."
But things aren't looking so good in the trenches these days, particularly not in New York City, which just a generation ago was a relatively nice place for a Marxist like Mr. Aronowitz to live. Now, he says, unions cave in routinely, as City Hall bows to the demands of corporate barons like George Steinbrenner and Donald J. Trump, who seek sweet deals.
"We're terrified that business will split," he said. "So we give them tax breaks and end up cutting education, culture, environmental protection and so on. It's an endless cycle of concessions. It's policy based on the bottom line."
His warnings come down to this: corporate mergers, downsizing and the like are leaving society -- including government -- beholden to the whim of the capitalist.
But don't think for one minute that his interest is purely theoretical.
"They can't afford to pick up the garbage on Wednesday now?" complained Mr. Aronowitz, sounding more like a frustrated New Yorker than a Marxist.
He's worried about the public schools, too, in no small part because he and his partner, Ellen Willis, the writer, send their daughter to an intermediate school in District 2 in lower Manhattan.
So what's the average proletarian to do?
"I think people have to decide if they want to continue to be held hostage," said the professor, who argues that a strong working-class movement is the only way to insure social progress. "No one has been willing to say, 'Enough already.' "
 
WORDS ON WORDS
 
Negotiating the Maze of Meaning
 
"The question What is to be done? has become tainted because it points to calumnies committed in the name of traditional ideologies of emancipation. Indeed, to speak of liberation, of the emancipation of labor, appears utopian, in the bad sense; in a period of the transformation of global politics by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the intellectual discrediting of Marxism, even by some of its erstwhile practitioners, and, on a larger canvas the steep decline of socialism, recalling these words conjures images of betrayal."
 
-- from "The Jobless Future: Sci-Tech and the Dogma of Work" (University of Minnesota Press, 1994) by Stanley Aronowitz and William DiFazio.

Keepers of the Tenure Track

BYLINE: By JUDITH SHULEVITZ; Judith Shulevitz, an editor at large at Lingua Franca, is a contributing editor at New York magazine.

 BODY:
IF you were a graduate student in the 80's and subject to the general delusion that held literary criticism to be the ne plus ultra of intellectual thrill, then you too probably owned one of these: an oversize paperback with an austere cover and small-type title that, grouped with three or more of its kind on your bookshelf, confirmed your status as an avatar of predoctoral chic. The object in question was a volume in the University of Minnesota series called "Theory and History of Literature" -- any volume, since they all looked alike and were each equally tantalizing, coming as they did in a wide variety of colors. There were Hans Robert Jauss's "Toward an Aesthetics of Reception" (pink), Paul de Man's "Blindness and Insight" (powder blue) and Jean-Francois Lyotard's "Postmodern Condition" (lurid aquamarine). There were Mikhail Bakhtin's "Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics" (sunflower yellow) and Michel de Certeau's "Heterologies" (electric blue). No other books in all academia were quite so insistently chromatic, or had half as much cachet.
The tenets of scholarly fashion, like those of every other kind of fashion, derive in part from the rules of material culture; the fetish objects just happen to be books. Whatever the merits of the subject matter -- and in the case of Minnesota, they were not to be sneered at -- it is the rare academic trend that takes off without the aid of a magisterial series or a fashion-forward university press. Stanley Fish, a professor of English at Duke University, says that in the 80's Minnesota's "Theory and History of Literature" list -- more commonly known as the lipstick series -- "was the only series for which I put a standing order, so that I would just receive whatever book came out next." In the 90's, Routledge and Verso have edged out Minnesota; you can't even think the words "cultural studies" without the image of their bright, matte, pop-icon-laden book covers cropping up in your head. (There is even a bookstore called Verso in Manhattan, which, though technically unaffiliated with that left-wing British press, features a cultural studies section devoted almost exclusively to Verso and Routledge books.) Among the strictly academic publishers -- Routledge and Verso are not linked to universities -- Duke University Press's shrink-wrapped books probably enclose more fetish value per pound than those of any of their competitors, since their pages are hallowed by the imprimatur of no less a personage than Stanley Fish, the press's celebrity director, and such series editors as the queer-theory superstar Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and the nonfiction prose stylist Jane Kramer. 
 Editors, of course, are eager to foster the impression that their presses reside at the cutting edge, since this is the perception that best moves books. But what about the ideals of what was once quaintly called "scholarly communication"? Ever since university presses began publishing in America in the late 19th century -- in fact, ever since the first academic presses were founded in Cambridge and Oxford in 1584 and 1585, respectively -- they have had as their lofty mission the unimpeded exchange of scholarly views and findings. Scholarship was never the only thing these presses published; in the 17th century, both Cambridge and Oxford stole away from several furious London printers the much-coveted royal charter to publish the Bible, thereby insuring themselves a subsidy for all time. But such revenue-generating tricks aside -- and the American university press has its equivalent of the Bible in the form of the glossy coffeetable book on state birds and other regional reference works -- academic publishing has always considered itself the handmaiden of intellectual labor. Indeed, by the turn of the century, American academic publishers generally saw their service in the most self-effacing terms possible -- printing dissertations and Festschriften, anthologies of essays celebrating the work of some beloved but usually unknown mentor. By 1919, one pundit had already observed that "the university press was an organization whose function was to publish works which no one would read."
In 1995, however, a better observation would be that the university press is an organization whose function is to publish works plenty of people want to read -- just not enough people to warrant an entry on the global megaconglomerates' bloated balance sheets. "We're moving into a market niche that has been less and less easy for major houses to occupy," Mr. Fish says. "Now we think in terms of books that sell between 5,000 and 40,000 copies. We no longer think in terms of the nine hundred to fifteen hundred print run that was for a long time the standard among university presses." This is not the sole prerogative of the more prestigious university presses, either; the smaller ones are following the bigger ones into the wider market, whether they want to or not. "We end up publishing in fields where we think sales will be good enough," says Sanford Thatcher, director of the Pennsylvania State University Press. "One of the ironies of all this is that a field like women's studies, which is still marginalized in the academy, which is not fully accepted there, is a gold mine for publishers."
 THERE'S another irony. It's that even as academic presses tend toward the broad and fashionable subjects for which tens of thousands of readers might be willing to put down credit cards, academics themselves are beginning to view scholarly publishing in the narrowest possible terms: It gets them jobs. Forget about advancing the intellect; for the academic, what scholarly communication is for is to advance the intellectual. With university presidents doing everything they can to balance their budgets by downsizing their faculties, all the stirring rhetoric about how teaching counts more than publishing has come to mean nothing. Last spring, The Cleveland Plain Dealer published a study of the records of tenuring committees at Ohio State University after a state court ruled that these documents, which are usually tightly sealed, were public information. The unsurprising finding: that tenure is awarded on the basis of a candidate's publication record, just as it always has been. Assistant professors don't need formal studies to know this; junior scholars coming up before a tenure committee are well aware that their potential employers will demand publication credentials with the implacability of the Victorian matron requesting references from a nanny. "There's a long and important tradition of a relationship between university presses and scholarship that results in tenure," says David Bartlett, director of Temple University Press. "But now we have the kind of absolutist tradition that dictates that you have to have one book or two books before you can get tenure, and that seems to me arbitrary and silly."
Editors sign up books they hope will sell; professors write books they hope will get them tenure. The unhappy result of these conflicting desires is an excess of unpublishable manuscripts and many desperate academics. "My sense is that there's a much higher level of anxiety among scholars because they recognize that it's harder to get that first monograph published," says Lisa Freeman, director of the University of Minnesota Press. "I hear that all the time: 'What do you mean you don't want to look at my book because it's too narrow! That's what you're supposed to do!' " The gap is increasingly filled by young professors trying to write crossover books. And while that might in many ways be for the good, it can also result in an intellectual conformity all the more distressing for being nonideological, the product neither of tenured radicalism nor of political correctness but of simple economics. For if books are the sine qua non of employability, then the judgments upon which academic hiring committees must ultimately rely are not those of experts, or of peers, or even of university press editors themselves. The people who determine what subjects up-and-coming academics get to write about -- and who in effect award tenure and the right to shape the next generation of scholars -- are Barnes & Noble customers. And what they want from university presses, as any editor will tell you, are women's studies, African-American studies, gay and lesbian studies, Asian-American studies, studies of popular culture and literary biographies, to say nothing of that inevitable publishing troika, Nazis, dogs and the Civil War.
 BUT doesn't such structured trendiness defeat the whole purpose of university presses? Aren't they subsidized by their host institutions specifically so that they can withstand the pressures of the marketplace? As it turns out, they aren't all that well subsidized. According to the American Association of University Presses, the average university underwrites about 10 percent of its press's cost. That figure hasn't changed much in the past 20 years, but other things have. Paper and printing costs are up. So is the practice of assembling photocopied course packs, which cuts severely into book sales. Foundation support, both for scholarship and for publication, is down; just last month, Congress's 37 percent cut in the National Endowment for the Humanities eliminated one of the most significant scholarly publications support programs in the country. And academic librarians -- perhaps the steadiest consumers of university press books -- are cutting their book budgets sharply. Not only have their general budgets shrunk, but the cost of commercially published scientific journals has soared by 115 percent in the past nine years; to keep up, research libraries are allotting more and more of their budgets to journal subscriptions. On the average, according to the Association of Research Libraries, its 119 member libraries buy almost a quarter fewer scholarly monographs than they did in 1986. "We're in a quandary," says Duane Webster, executive director of the research library group. "The practice of individual institutions has been to eliminate or cancel low-use, high-cost items, whether these are monographs or serials. The consequence is that, collectively, the corpus of available knowledge has shrunk."
Douglas Bennett, a vice president of the American Council of Learned Societies, an umbrella organization for a lot of very obscure specializations in the humanities, shares Mr. Webster's fears. "We think that scholarly research is something that to be healthy requires some active support from a variety of sources that are independent of what the marketplace will support," he says. Penn State's Sanford Thatcher tells the story of how he tried to publish some of the as yet untranslated works of Johann Gottfried Herder, an 18th-century German thinker best known for providing the first philosophical justification for modern nationalism. Despite good reviews, Mr. Thatcher had to abandon the project after the first volume for lack of funds. Colin Day, who is an economist as well as the director of the University of Michigan Press, illustrates the problem by way of example. "Say you want to publish a book on some very serious facet of Japanese studies," he begins. "What would your library sales be?" Since many academic libraries have begun limiting themselves to one particular branch of knowledge or another, Mr. Day says, "there have been discussions about having no more than, say, a dozen libraries in America collect books in Japanese studies." That would account for 12 copies, plus a few hundred more to those scholars of Japanese life interested in this topic. Given the cost of printing a book (Mr. Day says that when the print run drops from 1,000 to 900 the average cost of printing a volume rises by 10 percent, while the drop from 600 to 500 brings the cost up by 25 percent), no university press would take on the book. "Those trendy books on the Japanese threat to American industry will go on selling," Mr. Day says. "But not the serious books."
Not everybody thinks the market's bias against hyperseriousness is such a bad thing. "Me, I'm looking for people not to write books," says Lindsay Waters, the founder of the Minnesota series, who is now the executive editor for the humanities of Harvard University Press. "There are too many people writing books and sending them in who ought to be writing articles. People say to me, why don't you do nice books on Keats's image patterns? I won't buy 'em. What's so good about them? It's not like anybody is going to require their students to read them." At their best, university press editors can bring a generalist's rigor to their scrutiny of manuscripts, holding them up to standards of coherence and clarity. "The world of the humanities and social sciences could use more talk across disciplinary lines," Mr. Bennett says. "To the degree that the publication process results in works that, without any decline of sophistication or richness, are prepared in such a way that they're understandable by people in other disciplines, that seems like a positive effect."
One scholar of 18th-century English literature, David Ritchie, a professor at Queens College, recently explained in an article in Scholarly Publishing that the theory boom of the past decade may have been accelerated by the economics of publishing -- by presses looking for works that cut across subspecializations -- but that such pressures had had certain social benefits. "Why is it that I buy the latest books by Stephen Greenblatt, Stanley Fish, or Henry Louis Gates, since I don't specialize in Renaissance, 17th-century, or African-American literature?" he writes. "The answer is that theory has become common ground for most of us who take the profession seriously, and if I buy theory I will be able to discuss Greenblatt, Fish and Gates with a wide spectrum of my colleagues."
IN any case, for the most unmarketable pieces of scholarly research, there's always electronic publishing. In the sciences, any number of superspecialized subdisciplines now bypass the journal stage and transmit papers directly to subscribers on list servers that take advantage of the Internet. Why shouldn't the humanities follow suit? Eventually, they probably will, though at the moment nobody knows how to insure quality control, without which subscribers are likely to find themselves swamped with unedited articles of dubious value.
In the meantime, though, university press editors find themselves wielding ever more influence over the fate of academics and their departments, a degree of power that makes many of them uncomfortable. They'd like to see universities change the way they grant tenure -- athough they would not do away with it altogether, as some college presidents and administrators propose. What the publishing community wants to eliminate is the mindless reliance on books as material evidence of intellectual excellence.
"Tenure evaluation is based on the quantity rather than the quality of the publication," Lisa Freeman says. "We've got a system in which more is better." David Bartlett believes tenure committees should be required to read candidates' writing themselves, rather than tally up the number of publications and rank the presses at which they were published. Otherwise universities will someday find themselves staffed by academic equivalents of John Grisham -- by scholars who can sell.
"I think you're going to see a sea change in academic publishing in 1996 or 1997," Ms. Freeman says. "I think that in two years, there will be hardly any monographs on the market."
And lest that plaint sound wearisomely academic, consider that Harold Bloom's "Anxiety of Influence" and John Rawls's "Theory of Justice" both began life as relatively obscure monographs. It would be a bleak world indeed that could find no place for thinkers such as these.

 BODY:

BARRY GOLDWATER
By Robert Alan Goldberg.
Illustrated. 463 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $27.50. 
 I GREW up in the shadow of Barry Goldwater's hilltop house in Phoenix, often thinking scornfully of the fossil inside. When my parents moved to Arizona in the 1950's, the Goldwaters had already been doing business in the state for a century; by the time I was old enough to notice, Barry Goldwater had been around forever and seemed little but an anachronism.
The joke was on me, and on the millions of other people who once saw Goldwaterism as the reactionary impulse of a dying ideology. There is not a candidate in the current Republican Presidential race who does not mouth themes that Mr. Goldwater pioneered in his own campaign of 1964. That campaign was the first to tell the country that government was the problem; the first to woo what Mr. Goldwater called the "forgotten American" (the precursor of Richard Nixon's "silent majority" and today's "angry white male"); the first to see an emerging Republican base in the South. Mr. Goldwater favored a 25 percent tax cut, space satellites to shield against nuclear attack, and school prayer; he opposed "inverse discrimination" and denounced "meaningless" sex and violence on television. Above all, he energized the conservative generation that is now in power.
Robert Alan Goldberg's admirable and refreshingly brisk biography of Mr. Goldwater could hardly be better timed. Those who want to understand the cycles of success and failure of the conservative movement need to know Goldwaterism. Mr. Goldberg, a historian at the University of Utah (who had Mr. Goldwater's cooperation), gives a splendidly clear-eyed view of it.
The author's verdict on Mr. Goldwater is split. On one side, Mr. Goldwater was a founding father of a familiar conservative hypocrisy. For decades, Republicans have been complaining about the evils of big government without really intending to do anything much about it. Mr. Goldwater detested the New Deal and its plethora of programs, but when the time came, in 1952, to make his first Senate race, he declared, "No responsible Republican has any intention or desire to abolish any one of them." He is heard to insist, time and again, that he came up the old-fashioned way, by hardscrabble individualist grit. "I suggest to you that government never did a thing for us," he says. In fact, as Mr. Goldberg shows, the economic boom in Arizona came on the back of untold billions of dollars in Federal subsidies -- defense subsidies, water subsidies, New Deal subsidies -- and they were subsidies that Mr. Goldwater fought to keep.
Too often, Mr. Goldwater was loyal to scoundrels. He protected his friends Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon long after others had abandoned them. In his private life, he unwaveringly opposed discrimination and racism; but in his political life, he was blinded to the moral call of civil rights by his reliance on white (and Southern) votes and his mistrust of liberal activism.
Yet one puts down this book feeling, as its avowedly liberal author appears to, that Mr. Goldwater is that rarity in public life: a man who swayed politics far more than it swayed him. Unlike Nixon and Lyndon Johnson, the author notes, Mr. Goldwater lacks a dark side. Unlike President Reagan (of whom Mr. Goldwater remarks, "I don't think he ever thought anything through"), he did much of his own thinking.
Moreover, he grew. Late in life, as the country moved to the right, he rose again to remonstrate against his own faction's intolerant streak. Get government out of the economy, yes, but out of private lives, too. Thus he attacked "political preachers" ("I will fight them every step of the way if they try and dictate their moral convictions to all Americans in the name of conservatism"), championed abortion rights and, in 1993, called for an end to the ban on homosexuals in the military ("I can't see any way in the world that being gay can cause damage to somebody else" expressed his philosophy). To this day, he is a gravelly iconoclast.
And there remains about him a certain gruff humility that seems genuine. "I just like to be remembered as an honest person who tried," he said in 1993. Mr. Goldberg is adept, if sometimes a touch dry, in tracing the trajectory of Mr. Goldwater's political career. But it is the man, much more than the politician, who finally earns Mr. Goldberg's admiration, and who lingers in the mind when the book is put away. To re-encounter Mr. Goldwater in the age of Newtbaugh is to hope that conservatives, above all, do not forget him.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Spiffier Stage for 'Anything Goes'

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
THE before (May) and after (September) pictures of the Downtown Cabaret Theater in Bridgeport tell the tale. The theater that closed its doors from June through August of this year, for "major physical, technical and cosmetic renovations," in the words of the 20th-anniversary program, reopened early this month, full of spiffy improvements, about $1.2 million worth.
In addition to a $900,000 grant from the state'e Department of Economic Development, $300,000 was raised from corporations, foundations and individuals -- and the goal is $1 million more. Or more than that, "to keep on going," said a theater spokesman. 
 The new lobby, a larger women's bathroom, an extended horseshoe-shaped balcony and backstage technology (fly space, lighting and sound) represent the beginning of a campaign to "keep this place alive and kicking," in the words of a speech given before a benefit performance of "Anything Goes" on Oct. 13.
The Cole Porter musical, a fitting choice for the reopening show, may well signal a more assured accent on big-time musicals for Bridgeport. At this point, any revival of "Anything Goes" is likely to be a mishmash of the original 1934 version, a 1960's revision and the musical's most successful adaptation yet, the rewritten 1988 Lincoln Center production.
In other words, there can be no musical comedy purists as such musicals go. Few contain so many inimitable -- and irrelevant -- songs, and few composers wrote so many sparkling ones for obscure shows. So it's easy to lift such sparklers as "It's DeLovely" (from "Red, Hot and Blue," 1936) -- so easy to lift when the setting is the deck of a ship in the moonlight.
And then there's "Friendship" (from "Du Barry Was a Lady," 1939), "Let's Misbehave" (from "Les Ambassadeurs in Paris" 1927) and "Take Me Back to Manhattan" (from "The New Yorkers," 1930). These are among the songs originally meant for "Anything Goes" -- songs like "You're the Top," "Blow, Gabriel, Blow" and "All Through the Night," not that there are other songs like those songs.
"Anything Goes" is now more a scintillating hit parade than it could ever have been in the first place, when Ethel Merman and Victor Moore headed the cast. And since the book, originally written by P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton, had to be revised, even in 1934 by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, because of news events of the day.
The sinking of the S. S. Morro Castle, for example, with 135 people going under, made a story about a jolly shipwreck cry out for rewrites. Then there was the Lindbergh kidnapping, which caused Porter to delete two lines, suddenly in questionable taste, from one song and substitute "flying too high with some guy in the sky/is my idea of nothing to do."
What remains of a daffy book still includes the ever effervescent Reno Sweeney, "her high-stepping holiness," who says: "It's not easy being New York's most notorious evangelist" and the debutante Hope Harcourt "who came out in a Zeppelin." Add the stowaways, Snake Eyes Johnson (public enemy No. 1) and Moonface Martin (public enemy No. 13), gangsters dressed as ministers. One of them is a "broken down stockbroker" while the other likes to quote Dillinger, as in: "It's always darkest just before they turn the lights on."
"Let's Misbehave" is an unbeatable seduction song for anyone with class, "All Through the Night," in a nice up tempo, is one of the most intoxicating songs, well, ever. If you don't get the line, "You're the pants on a Roxy usher," don't worry; you'll get another one.
In the Bridgeport production, Janet Aldrich effervesces as Reno Sweeney. The title song brings on an all-out tap number, choreographed by the show's director, Scott Thompson. It could easily fit into the company's next scheduled show: "42d Street."
 "Anything Goes," Downtown Cabaret Theater, 263 Golden Hill Street, Bridgeport, 576-1636. Performances through Nov. 25.

Adding a Line to a Distinguished Resume

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
WHERE do you find the strength to trust your vision and instinct?"
Now, that is the question for the artist to muse upon, but first, Athol Fugard acknowledged it, humbled himself before it. 
 "What a huge, beautiful question," he replied to Sarah Angelini, a Princeton senior from Northboro, Mass. He grasped for an answer. "It's all I've got. I'm not schooled. I'm not trained." He paused. "But I'm not answering your question. It relates to my passion for the craft."
This South African Renaissance man of the theater is currently carrying out the missions of playwright, director and actor in "Valley Song," at the McCarter Theater here through Nov. 12. On Monday afternoon, he was playing yet another role, that of teacher, in the theater and dance department of Princeton University.
Mr. Fugard might argue with being called a teacher. "I get enormous pleasure from sharing my craft," he said after class. "I don't think of it as teaching." The 16 students in Theater 330, "Fugard on Theater," might disagree.
"There are no hard and fast rules; there are as many ways to write a play as there are people who want to write one," Mr. Fugard said. "This is a sharing experience. The selfish aspect is that I get an enormous energy feed, an adrenaline rush. I'm 63. The theater has given me my life, my identity. I try helplessly to repay it. I find the students very challenging. Young people replenish my work."
Yes. But are those not the words of a master teacher? If Mr. Fugard's commitment to six seminars, three hours each, is not an exaltation of teaching, what is it?
"They are venturing in there, gaining confidence," Mr. Fugard said of his students, who are majoring, variously, in politics, in anthropology, in religion, in English. "I spent the first three hours talking nonstop. Now we have a genuine dialogue in that room. I love that word, dialogue."
It is Mr. Fugard's first such experience, "having a sit-down dialogue with students," he said. It's also a first for Princeton, having a playwright of power and glory take over a class -- not for just an hour, but a whole course.
"I've stood up and delivered orthodox talks and lectures and addresses," he said, most recently at the Governor's Conference on the Arts in Trenton last month. "But here I insisted on a venue that doesn't feel like a classroom, that invites openness."
In a semicircle, Mr. Fugard sits next to Prof. Michael Cadden, the director of the university's theater and dance program, who initiated the course. The six sessions span 12 weeks and include an overview of Mr. Fugard's career, as well as the customary reading assignments, journals and conferences.
In addition to his own works -- "Blood Knot," "Hello and Goodbye," "My Children! My Africa!" -- Mr. Fugard included Brecht and Grotowski, who "used the theater to do something about the world in which they lived."
In this session, the fourth of six in which Mr. Fugard is participating, he wore a black sweatshirt and gray sweatpants and held a mug of tea or sipped bottled water. He began with a question: "Any un answered questions?" And the students' hands flew.
For three whirling hours, he shared a life in the theater. He recalled an improvisational theater piece in Johannesburg last year: "My Life," taken from the words of young women. "We sat around and developed a beautiful piece of theater," he said. He would later say that, yes, he would welcome a similar opportunity in Princeton.
He commented on the ages of most theatergoers, 40 plus. (How does one get younger people into the theater? he wondered.) He reflected on the problems of the previous night's performance "in the naked reality of the rehearsal room." He referred to the theater of Shakespeare, of Machiavelli, of Tennessee Williams. He recalled the time he assisted black South African actors who came to him for help in forming a theater troupe "to break the conspiracy of silence that had gagged their mouths."
He thanked a student for asking about lighting and admired the lighting designer's palette of colors. He answered a question about his most memorable theater experience. It was a performance of "Sizwe Bansi Is Dead" in the black ghetto of New Brighton near Johannesburg after the play's award-winning American premiere, and audience members were emboldened to interrupt, take sides and otherwise throw themselves into the action. He relived the groundbreaking premiere of "Blood Knot" -- "when I knew I had already found my voice." Throughout, his eyes searched for more questions, his hands dancing, gesticulating, building sets and images in the air.
"You sit here as young Americans," he told the group, "and you take for granted that you can speak, that you have freedom of movement, that you can enjoy the essential freedoms -- of the press, of the university, of an artistic environment -- that are the hallmark, the guarantee of a civilization.
"It is harder for Americans being a member of a minority group. There is more anger, more bitterness, more frustration, and rightly so, here -- because in South Africa, the oppressed are in their own majority group. They are not part of the white world, so the world is theirs, though not economically. In this country, the Constitution promises one thing and society practices another."
He wanted to temper an image of Fugard as polemicist. "Fun is such an important word in theater," he said. "I haven't the slightest problem with using the word entertain. It's an important, useful, beautiful word, and a good start."
Even though the racial separatism and political persecution that informed his seminal plays have ended, his notion of theater, as expressed in a 1986 interview in The New York Times, remains un altered. "I think it is almost impossible to have a piece of meaningful literature that does not involve some form of social criticism," he said then. Now, he added: "It's amusing and it's scary. People say now that it's all changed, well, that's the end of him."
The student who asked, "What is the most precarious role you play in the theater?" invited a speculation: "If I was never to act again, that would be no big deal. If I was never to direct again, that would be a more significant loss; it teaches me a lot about my craft as a writer. But my life wouldn't end. If I was never to write again, I wouldn't know what to do with my life. That is the fact of my life. The only truly safe place in my life is in the middle of a story, as its teller. Then I know who I am and why I am."
AFTER the McCarter's acclaimed production of Mr. Fugard's early play "Hello and Goodbye" last year, it is unavoidable to wonder if he intends to forge an association with the McCarter comparable to the one he had with the Yale Repertory Theater in the 1980's.
"Because of its size, the McCarter is a hard venue," he responded. "But I'm so comfortable, so at home with Emily Mann's vision of theater and the amicable warm environment here, that there's an enormous agreement between us. And yes, I'm prepared to come back a third time. But three Yale Rep theaters can fit into the McCarter, and what they need here is a second smaller theater."
By the time Monday's class ended, Mr. Fugard had not let go of the question about vision and instinct. "I can psychically feel the truth of a story, feel its generative power, its pulse, its throb," he said. "I plant words, and they grow."

HEADLINE: ATLANTIC CITY;
The Slot With Something Extra

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
MAC SEELIG has seen the future of casino gambling, and he says it will be "more comfortable and a lot more fun."
The big, barrel-chested Mr. Seelig, 52, is president of the A.C. Coin and Slot Service Company, New Jersey's largest slot machine distributor. Having just returned from the World Gaming Conference, an annual gambling industry trade show held in Las Vegas last weekend, Mr. Seelig could barely contain his enthusiasm for new products that could transform his privately held Pleasantville company, which started as a vending machine service, into an international concern. In 18 years, Mr. Seelig estimates, he has sold nearly 100,000 slot machines to casinos in Atlantic City, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, and to cruise ships. 
 At the three-day trade show, Mr. Seelig said, he signed 50 contracts with casino operators for the Bonus Road Rally "interactive slot environment," a $300,000 row of 10 slot machines with a Corvette race car theme. Mr. Seelig's company developed the game in partnership with International Gaming Technology, a slot machine manufacturer, and the Trump Taj Mahal Casino.
Bonus Road Rally is a marriage of slot machines and slot cars, vaguely reminiscent of a Boardwalk arcade skill game in which contestants use water pistols to move cars across a track. Above the slot machines, a mural trimmed in neon light is divided into 10 horizontal tracks. Scale models of Corvettes, representing the gamblers playing individual slot machines, move across the tracks. The faster gamblers feed the machines, the faster the cars move. The machines can be customized to provide rewards like extra payouts or noncash prizes as the cars near the finish line.
"This is a business in which you make money by listening to your customers and giving them exactly what they want," Mr. Seelig said. "My customers are casino operators. For years, they've been telling me they haven't seen anything new. Variations, sure, but nothing really exciting. At all the trade shows, they would say to me, 'Mac, give us something new.' This year, I did just that, and when they sat down to play Bonus Road Rally, they went berserk."
"What really blew everybody away is that an idea for something like this could come out of Atlantic City," he added. "Up until now, all the creative gaming innovations come out of Nevada and work their way from west to east. This time, we sort of reversed it."
The Bonus Road Rally is undergoing regulatory testing by the State Division of Gaming Enforcement, and the first game is expected to be operating at the Trump Taj Mahal by January, with others in casinos around the country and in Europe possibly by the end of 1996.
Although Atlantic City has shown the gambling world a few new tricks, like Tropworld's indoor theme park, the state's long, tedious and often adversarial regulatory process made introducing such tricks an expensive, risky proposition. It took more than a decade for Las Vegas standards like poker, keno and racetrack simulcasting to appear here.
In the past, the smallest items used in an Atlantic City casino, from cocktail stirrers to hotel soap, were subject to intense and costly regulatory examination. But the economic climate of the last five years, and increased competition from other gambling meccas, have made state officials move a little faster.
Obtaining approval for even minor variations in slot machine technology "used to be a nightmare," said Thomas McCormick, a lawyer for Mr. Seelig's company. "Now it can be a five- or three-day turnaround."
Mr. Seelig said the current regulatory attitude had encouraged entrepreneurs to dream up innovations that are changing the gambling industry "from a grind type of operation to something that's exciting and fun." He cited a smaller, sit-down version of a craps game recently developed by three Harrah's employees, and a $1,500 casino chair invented by a New York furniture manufacturer. In addition to vibrating when the customer flips a switch, the chair can be adjusted up, down, backward and forward for more comfortable seating.
"When you look at what the chair does for the customer," Mr. Seelig said, "the issue is not the price of it."

OPENING AMERICA'S MARKET
U.S. Foreign Trade Policy Since 1776.
By Alfred E. Eckes Jr.
Illustrated. 402 pp. Chapel Hill:
The University of North Carolina Press. $34.95. 
 THE cold war consensus in favor of free trade is now under attack in the United States from economic nationalists on both the right and the left. In debates like those over the Nafta and GATT treaties, both sides have claimed that history supports their position. Alfred E. Eckes Jr. has provided a dispassionate, informed and accessible account of the history of United States trade policy that can help Americans evaluate the arguments of both free-traders and protectionists. Mr. Eckes, a former chairman and commissioner of the United States International Trade Commission during the Reagan and Bush Administrations who now teaches contemporary history at Ohio University, unites scholarly rigor with a policy maker's sensitivity to the political factors influencing trade.
The commitment of the United States to free trade, Mr. Eckes shows, is a relatively recent phenomenon. George Washington not only supported the protection of infant American industries, but set an example by "buying American." "I use no porter [ale] or cheese in my family, but such as is made in America," he said. Alexander Hamilton's arguments in favor of a national industrial policy not only inspired early American economic nationalists like Daniel Raymond but influenced the German-American economic thinker Friedrich List, whose vision of a united Germany with a protected market was realized later in the 19th century.
In the period before the Civil War, the Democrats, representing the agricultural exporters of the South, tended to favor lower tariffs; Northern manufacturers sought protection from British and European imports. Northern industrial interests prevailed during the period of Republican dominance from the Civil War to the Great Depression. Theodore Roosevelt summed up the prevailing Republican view when he declared, "Thank God I am not a free-trader. In this country pernicious indulgence in the doctrine of free trade seems inevitably to produce fatty degeneration of the moral fibre." Republicans, accused of exploiting American consumers on behalf of industry, claimed that high tariffs protected American workers from low-wage competition abroad; Herbert Hoover, for example, sounded like many of the opponents of Nafta when he argued that free trade would "place our farmers and workers in competition with peasant and sweated labor products." Mr. Eckes, while cautious about drawing conclusions, notes the trouble caused for doctrinaire free-trade theory by the fact that the economy grew more rapidly during the high-tariff era than during the post-World War II period of tariff reduction.
During Franklin D. Roosevelt's Administration, the traditional Southern Democratic goal of free trade was promoted by Secretary of State Cordell Hull (himself a Southerner, a former Senator from Tennessee). After World War II, Hull's vision was realized as the United States, formerly the world's leading protectionist nation, led successive rounds of trade liberalization negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In doing so the United States, as the superpower leader of a global anti-Soviet alliance, had geopolitical as well as economic goals. "With the executive, not Congress, managing trade policy," Mr. Eckes writes, "tariff policy became another instrument of cold war foreign relations." He notes that "time after time during the cold war years, when policy makers confronted a conflict between foreign policy and domestic interests, the diplomatic imperative prevailed."
With the end of the cold war, the national security rationale for tolerating deviations from free trade by allies like Japan has diminished. At the same time, many Americans whose wages are threatened by low-wage producers abroad are giving their votes to economic nationalists like Ross Perot and Patrick Buchanan. "In an open world economy with no common standards governing working and environmental conditions," Mr. Eckes writes, "many believed that the transfer of high-paying factory jobs to developing countries would bring about the downward harmonization of wages and incomes that 19th-century Republicans had foreseen."
The most controversial section of "Opening America's Market" may be Mr. Eckes's revisionist account of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which is often blamed today for causing everything from the Great Depression to World War II. The author shows that while Smoot-Hawley raised duties on some items, it lowered or eliminated them on many others. "Except under the Underwood schedules during World War I, no tariff before or after Smoot-Hawley permitted such a large percentage of U.S. imports, by value, to enter duty-free." By a careful examination of American diplomatic correspondence, Mr. Eckes destroys the often-repeated myth that Smoot-Hawley provoked a wave of discrimination against American exports. "Why have textbook authors, editorial writers and public officials beat up on the bogy of Smoot-Hawley for three generations?" he asks, and concludes: "Committed to this goal" of free trade, "Wall Street, Washington, corporate America, academic economists and the media elite found it expedient to thrash Smoot-Hawley at each opportunity."
At the moment, Mr. Eckes observes, the post-World War II free-trade orthodoxy still reigns supreme within the American political and academic establishment. "With international contacts proliferating and transnational corporations allocating resources on a world scale, the 'global village' had become an operational reality," he writes. "As the 20th century moved to a close," it was not clear whether the free trade millennium "had finally arrived or was another mirage. Historians of the future would have the perspective to decide." One hopes that future historians will provide their readers with a perspective on the past as helpful as the one Mr. Eckes has given us in "Opening America's Market."

HEADLINE: A State Tries to Rein In a Prison Awash in Drugs

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: GRATERFORD, Pa., Oct. 26

 BODY:
In February, the Pennsylvania authorities paroled Robert Simon, despite his being a convicted killer and known prison drug user who had killed another inmate in self-defense.
Three months later, back on the street, Mr. Simon was accused of another killing, this time the shooting of a New Jersey police officer who had stopped him and a fellow motorcycle gang member in Gloucester County for a traffic violation. 
 When the authorities in Pennsylvania began looking into why Mr. Simon was set free, the trail led back to the state prison here, where officials say the case is another sign of the widespread drug trade, mismanagement and possible corruption at the crowded maximum-security prison outside of Philadelphia.
In the view of state corrections officials, it was as if the prison had fallen into enemy hands. Last Monday, 650 state troopers and corrections officers from other prisons deployed in a nighttime surprise assault on Graterford. During the next 72 hours, they searched all 3,500 inmates, the prison's staff and its 1,700-acre grounds, looking for drugs and weapons. As a result, nine ranking officers at the prison retired or were transferred, and 21 inmates suspected of drug trafficking were moved to other prisons.
The shakedown, in which about 200 homemade weapons and more than 60 caches of drugs were seized, was unusual in scope. But the extreme action was an indication of the frustration many corrections officials and politicians feel at the constant battle to keep drugs out of prisons, especially as tougher laws are sending drug-addicted criminals away for longer sentences.
The question that prompted the raid -- "Who runs the prison?" in the words of Martin F. Horn, Pennsylvania's Corrections Commissioner -- is a common one for prison administrators. Corrections officials across the country say controlling prisons is becoming more difficult because of increasing inmate populations, harder-core prisoners and tighter budgets. Earlier this month, inmates were ordered confined to their cells at Federal prisons after uprisings at five sites.
The drug economy in prisons not only threatens peace among inmates but also dangles temptation before guards. In the last year at the Federal prison in Atlanta, for example, several employees have been arrested on drug charges and there has been a spate of violence including the first killing of a corrections officer at the prison since 1987.
[On Friday, Federal prosecutors announced the indictments of four corrections officers, four inmates and two others on charges of trying to smuggle marijuana, cocaine and heroin into the Atlanta prison.]
"In large systems, it's almost a truism that you're going to have some drug trafficking," said a former Texas prison official and a consultant on prison conditions, Steve Martin. "But when it seeps into your security staff you have serious problems."
Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who approved the search at Graterford, said, "The first thing we need to do is control the prisons, and we weren't in control of that one."
Officials said that in Mr. Simon's case, a complete record of his prison misdeeds was not in his file when the parole decision was made. Inmates told a recent State Senate hearing that it was common practice among prisoners at Graterford to avoid punishment for infractions and to cover up evidence of drug use by paying officers to alter records.
At the hearing, an inmate who was a clerk at Graterford from 1992 to this January, Jonathan Brown, told the State Senate Judiciary Committee about officers' selling furloughs and other privileges, and about drug trafficking involving officers. He said Mr. Simon paid officers to cover up his disciplinary infractions, though the allegations have not been proved and are under investigation.
"The fact that he was allegedly selling and using dope was not in his file," said the committee chairman, Senator Stewart J. Greenleaf.
Mr. Simon's case was just more evidence of trouble at Graterford, one of the largest state prisons in the country. Since 1989, 13 staff members have been arrested on charges of trying to smuggle drugs, 11 inmates have died of drug overdoses and about 20 percent of the urine tests done on prisoners each month show signs of drug use.
In March, three inmates were found in a cell, all with hypodermic needles and all unconscious from drug overdoses, Mr. Horn said. They recovered, and one took another nonfatal overdose the next night.
Calling the drug trade in prison "enormously frustrating," Mr. Horn said it "gives the lie to everything we're trying to do in terms of rehabilitation."
The search had been planned since April by Mr. Horn and his staff without the knowledge of Graterford officials. In the raid, officers with drug-sniffing dogs removed inmates from their cells one at a time, searching the cells, strip-searching the inmates and then moving to the next cell.
Officials say they might have found more drugs but many inmates flushed them down toilets after hearing about the search.
"I suspect all of the bass and trout in the streams connected to that sewage system are jumping far out of the water," Mr. Ridge said.
Mr. Horn was realistic about the search's effect. "The minute we walk away from here the inmates are going to start trying to figure out how to get drugs," he said.
Although few deny that Graterford has a drug problem, some prisoner advocates say the search, with all of its drama, had political motivations. The Simon case, which led to an overhaul of the state parole board, came less than a year after the release of a Pennsylvania inmate, Reginald McFadden, who went on to kill and rape on Long Island and in Rockland County, N.Y.
In last year's election, Mr. Ridge criticized his opponent, Lieut. Gov. Mark S. Singel, for voting in favor of the McFadden parole as a member of the parole board.
Drug use at Graterford is both long running and well known.
"There was a period of time at Graterford that I smoked a joint when I woke up, at lunch, at dinner and when I went to bed," said Kenneth Tervalon, 49, who was released in 1993 and says he has stopped using drugs.
Although just 10 percent of Pennsylvania's state prisoners are at Graterford, the prison accounts for 25 percent of inmate attacks on staff members and a third of inmate drug infractions, said Mr. Horn, who headed the parole system in New York State before becoming Commissioner in March.
Donald T. Vaughn, the superintendent at Graterford, said the drug problem was caused largely by its proximity to Philadelphia, which is 30 miles to the southeast. The drug market behind Graterford's 30-foot wall mirrors the city's.
Mr. Vaughn acknowledged that his staff might not have provided the "intense supervision" required for the prison. He said he had asked the corrections department for help in the past but not yet received it.
Mr. Horn said he would leave Mr. Vaughn in charge.
With 85 percent of the inmates from Philadelphia or neighboring counties, there are frequent crowds in the visiting room, a key entry point of drugs in most prisons. Drugs packed in small balloons are passed mouth-to-mouth when inmates kiss female visitors and inmates swallow them and pass them later. Although visitors are searched before coming in, they have been known to hide drugs in babies' diapers or in their own body cavities.
Inmates and others say Graterford has a more casual atmosphere than other prisons, which may contribute to the drug problem.
Prisoners are allowed to walk down the halls freely, not in straight lines under close supervision as is required in other prisons. And the number of volunteer workers -- almost 400 -- gives inmates many chances to make contact with people from the outside.
"If you don't want to go to work, you just go out to the yard," said Steven Blackburn, an inmate for 12 years there until 1991. "Compared to a lot of other institutions around the state, Graterford is still considered loose."
Whatever that buys in inmate peace, it has its downside. On Aug. 4, an inmate serving a life sentence for murder hid on a bread truck leaving the prison. He was recaptured 18 days later, but his escape was made possible because no one reported that he failed to show up for his job that day or that he was in the delivery area without authorization, Mr. Horn said.
Some inmates have been allowed to acquire enormous power. Ameen Jabbar, a gang leader in Philadelphia, has led Graterford's Muslim movement, officials said, controlling part of the prison's drug trade.
A prison guard, Lieut. Cynthia Link, said that when the lights in the prison's mosque suddenly went out one night two years ago the 100 inmates ignored her order to leave. Finally, one of them said, "Ms. Link, these people aren't going to move until Ameen tells them to."
"I said, 'Well, go get Ameen, tell him I need him,' " Lieutenant Link recounted. He came, told the prisoners to leave and they did.
Last week, Mr. Jabbar was one of the inmates transferred out of Graterford.

HEADLINE: Detroit Wages All-Out Fight To Stop Devil's Night Arson

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Once more, with new depth of feeling, Detroit's leaders are pleading with its residents not to try to burn their city down on the night before Halloween.
After being surprised and embarrassed by a surge in arson last year, the city is hoping to snuff the bizarre, heartbreaking ritual known as Devil's Night and substitute Angel's Night, using curfews, dances for teen-agers, bans on containers of gasoline and neighborhood patrols. 
 Prompted, they say, by reawakening pride in a reawakening city and by the lessons of the Million Man March, some 25,000 volunteers have responded to the city's call for help, and the list is expected to grow. Officials say the outpouring -- from churches, businesses and at least one motorcycle gang -- has been so strong that this year they are not even praying for rain.
"I'm looking for good weather," said the executive assistant to Mayor Dennis W. Archer who is director of public safety, Emmett R. Baylor Jr. "If we get 20 degrees and rain, we won't know if we can conquer this thing."
Detroit has been watching the urban revival across Lake Erie in Cleveland with a blend of envy and hope, as it plots its own economic renaissance. Residents fret that a fiery Devil's Night would set back the city's fragile recovery.
On Friday, an important piece of Mayor Archer's turnaround plan fell in place as the city announced that it had secured public and private financing for a $235 million baseball stadium downtown. Mr. Archer is betting that the open-air, natural turf park, for the Tigers, will do for the city what similar stadiums have done for Cleveland and Baltimore.
The stadium is the largest but only the latest in a series of new developments planned for the city. Just 10 days ago, Standard Federal Bank said it wanted to build 400 houses for middle-class families along the Detroit River on the west side, the biggest housing development here since World War II.
But residents fear that Devil's Night could scare off businesses and developers by provoking another bruising of the city's image by news organizations.
"It's almost how they get their kicks," Loretta Williams, who has signed up to help patrol her west side neighborhood, said about reporters. Detroit is treated "almost like we're a foreign country," she said.
For years, Detroit appeared to have doused Devil's Night. But the city relaxed its vigilance last year, notwithstanding another official attempt at a nomenclature change, to "Halloween Eve." It was rewarded with the biggest outbreak of fires since 1986, as the number reached 182, almost triple the level in 1993. "The citizens didn't come out," said the executive fire commissioner, Harold D. Watkins Sr. "They felt we had it under control."
Abandoned and occupied homes, parked cars, and piles of garbage and brush were torched. One blaze killed an 18-month-old girl, Destiny Wilson.
The fires were a blow to Mayor Archer, who had swept into office in 1993 pledging to revive moribund city services. This year he is not taking chances. The city has imposed a curfew on children and teen-agers under 17 from 6 P.M. Monday to 6 A.M. Tuesday. Violators will be immediately prosecuted, the city says, facing $100 fines or 40 hours of community service.
Another emergency measure forbids dispensing gasoline into portable containers from Saturday through Halloween. Although Devil's Night peaks on the night before Halloween, the arson tends to spread over three nights, through Oct. 31.
But the backbone of the efforts are the volunteers, who have promised to watch empty homes and to walk the streets.
"We want to put an end to the self-destructive behavior," said the Rev. Lawrence T. Foster of the Calvary Baptist Church, on Detroit's lower east side, adding that the Million Man March -- "like spending a day in heaven," he called it -- had helped encourage 25 members of his congregation to volunteer so far.
"There's no doubt in my mind that we're going to create a new Detroit and we're going to give Halloween Eve a new name," Mr. Foster said. "We're going to change it from a night of mischief to a night of constructive energy and fellowship."

HEADLINE: Mideast Leaders Talk, This Time of Business

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 29

 BODY:
More than 1,000 officials and business leaders from around the world gathered here today to explore ways of moving from Arab-Israeli peace agreements to business deals.
Greeting a packed house of monarchs, sheiks, government ministers and executives in the modern Palace of Culture, King Hussein of Jordan set the theme of the largest such gathering ever held in the Middle East when he declared that people in the region must "realize the importance of peace through tangible and positive change in their standards of living." 
 But for all the glossy proposals and optimistic talk, there were also reminders that this is still the Middle East.
Syria and Lebanon, the two Arab neighbors that have yet to make a peace deal with the Israelis, were conspicuously absent, as were Libya, Iraq and Iran.
An army of soldiers and police ringed the conference center and hotels. Rivalry between Jordan and Egypt, and between Israel and the Palestinians, burst briefly into the open, and one major project, a Middle East development bank, failed to generate much support from European or Persian Gulf countries.
And although neither Israeli nor Arab officials made any public comment, the news of the assassination in Malta last week of Fathi Shiqaqi, the leader of the militant Islamic Jihad -- and the expectation of retaliation against Israel -- was a reminder that the threat of violence still hovers over the region.
But for all that, the mood was distinctly upbeat and pragmatic as representatives of 60 countries mingled in the lobbies or attended seminars on regional development and doing business.
"For too long, this has been a region of warriors and widows," said Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who represented the United States along with Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown. "Let it again become a region of builders and traders."
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, who led a team of 5 government ministers, 60 other officials and 100 Israeli businessmen, echoed the call to do business.
"No one will come here because of our winning smiles," he said. "They all want to make money."
The Israeli Government arrived with a package of regional development proposals, many involving Jordan and the new Palestinian homeland that has begun taking shape in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
These included the construction of new bridges over the Jordan River, the development of tourism around the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean coast, the creation of special commercial regions and a program to link the electrical systems of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian lands.
The greater hope of the conference organizers was on private business. The Amman conference came a year after the first such regional summit, in Casablanca, where the stress was on the very novelty of Arab and Israeli businessmen getting together. The intention this time was to produce actual business contacts.
Accordingly, the emphasis of the conference was on small workshops on specific subjects like "textiles and apparel" or "information superhighway and telecommunications," where participants could meet with executives and officials in their field.
"There's a lot of people here looking for specific deals," said Christopher Keen, the London-based general manager of the United Bank of Kuwait. "The list of organizations and the level of representatives is definitely higher than in Casablanca."
But there was also ample evidence that the rivalries and tensions that have plagued the Middle East were far from overcome.
The absence of Syria and Lebanon was the most conspicuous. Mr. Christopher planned to fly on Monday to Damascus on his way home to meet with President Hafez al-Assad, but he held out little hope of breaking the stalemate in Syrian-Israeli negotiations.
"I don't expect any major developments to come out of that meeting," Mr. Christopher acknowledged. "Really it's just to bring me up to date on their own thinking."
One of the major projects before the conference had been the establishment of a regional development bank, and Mr. Christopher announced that one would be set up with headquarters in Cairo.
But resistance from Western European governments, which see the bank as an extension of American influence at the expense of existing development banks, and from Arab oil states, which thought they were being asked to finance an institution that would primarily benefit Israel, left the proposed bank with little capital and limited backing.
Two exchanges in the opening session also revealed the rivalries that are never far below the surface in the Middle East.
One erupted when Foreign Minister Amre Moussa of Egypt, which has looked with annoyance at the rapid development of Israeli-Jordanian cooperation, cautioned in his speech against "chasing" after peace.
The Arab word he used implied an irresponsible rush, and King Hussein unexpectedly asked for the floor.
There were some who have had peace for 17 years, the King said with an edge in his voice, referring to the Egyptian-Israeli agreement, and it was necessary for others to catch up.
Another exchange ensued when Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, assailed the vote in the United States Congress mandating the move of the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, calling it a "very dangerous precedent" and a "violent violation" of United Nations Security Council resolutions.
Mr. Rabin was the next to speak, and he noted that it took him only 20 minutes to fly from Jerusalem -- "the capital of Israel" -- to Amman.

HEADLINE: CALI DRUG CARTEL USING U.S. BUSINESS TO LAUNDER CASH

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
Frustrated by Government crackdowns on banks that once helped Colombian drug traffickers funnel their profits back home, the leaders of the Cali cartel are processing the billions of dollars they reap in cocaine sales in the United States through a wide variety of American companies.
In recent months, investigators in New York, Los Angeles, Houston and Miami have uncovered a range of intricate schemes in which Colombian drug kingpins are using scores of American companies -- large and small, witting and unwitting -- to help launder their illicit profits. 
 "The cartels have been moving into trade because we have been working to tighten up the financial sector," said Robert S. Gelbard, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. "It's become increasingly important that companies know who they are doing business with."
In a single continuing New York investigation, Federal Customs Service officials said, they have identified 105 American companies that accepted drug money for electronics, auto parts and other goods shipped to Colombia. They will not name the companies, they said, until the investigation is completed.
United States officials estimate that Cali traffickers are using such trade-related schemes to process about half of the $6 billion a year in cocaine revenue that goes from the United States to Colombia, with billions more being sent through third countries like Mexico.
In addition, the Manhattan District Attorney's office is just beginning an investigation into more than a dozen small costume-jewelry exporters operating along Broadway below midtown and in the Times Square area, as well as several other electronic and furniture companies around the borough that are suspected of knowingly or unknowingly accepting drug cash.
And Scotland Yard, working with Federal and New York prosecutors, has been looking into still more money laundering schemes in which cartel operatives buy and sell paintings at art galleries in London and New York, a senior American law-enforcement official said.
While the schemes can be complex, the concept is simple. Just as drug merchants need to move their product into the United States, they need to move their earnings south and convert them into pesos.
In the early days of the drug trade, profits were small and easily transported in suitcases. But when America's appetite for drugs exploded in the 1970's and the volume of business reached into the hundreds of millions of dollars, the drug exporters needed more efficient means of sending the money home.
In the new schemes, cartel intermediaries typically contact companies in Colombia that import goods from the United States. The intermediaries offer to pay for the imported goods with dollars that go to the American exporters. In return, the importers pay intermediaries an equivalent amount inside Colombia. For participating in the scheme, the importers pay intermediaries slightly less than the true exchange rate.
In other cases, the cartels have turned to old-fashioned methods similar to those used to smuggle drugs into the United States -- concealing dollars inside real products or in false bottoms of containers.
Officials say the increase in the trade-related schemes is so great, they have helped improve the United States' balance of trade with Colombia. Ten years ago, the country had a $5 billion trade deficit; last year it had a $5 billion surplus. Clinton Administration officials estimate that a major portion of the increase in exports is paid for with tainted money.
"What makes them so difficult to detect is that these operations are cloaked within what appear to be legitimate businesses, with legitimate inventories, sales and customers," said Eric Friedberg, the chief of narcotics prosecution in the United States Attorney's Office in Brooklyn. "The drug money can be easily mixed with legal sales of the company."
Last week, the Clinton Administration singled out 33 Colombian companies -- from drug store chains to automobile dealers -- that President Clinton said were fronts for the Cali cartel, and ordered United States companies to stop trading with them.
Explaining the decision in a speech to the United Nations, he said, "I directed our Government to identify the front companies to freeze the assets of the largest drug ring in the world, the Cali cartel, to cut off its economic lifelines and stop our own people from dealing unknowingly with its companies."
The Drug Enforcment Administration compiled the list of Colombian front companies after law-enforcement agents interrogated a former cartel accountant and inspected computer logs that were captured along with six cartel leaders recently arrested by the Colombian police. The agency has refused to divulge the names of the American companies, which have been ordered to change their trading partners.
 
Trafficking
The Cash Flow Of Cocaine
But Greg Passic, a special agent at the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, said that wholesale representatives of many American companies, including General Electric, Microsoft, Apple Computer and General Motors, sold goods to Colombian importers they did not know were Cali fronts. In other instances, officials said, smaller private American firms or franchises knowingly accepted cash generated by drug sales.
Cocaine trafficking is widely regarded as the most lucrative criminal enterprise, and the cascade of cash constantly requires new means of moving money to Colombia.
Through the early 1980's, the task was relatively easy as many banks turned a blind eye toward cash transactions while law enforcement concentrated on interrupting the flow of drugs into the country. The first modest crackdown came in 1985, when dozens of American banks paid fines after admitting they had not filed reports on millions of dollars worth of cash deposits.
Cali cartel leaders like Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela set up vast money laundering networks in Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Corona, Queens, in the late 1970's and 1980's, according to Drug Enforcement Administration intelligence reports.
 
How It Moves
Faxes, Beepers, Brown Paper Bags
A routine traffic stop on the Sprain Brook Parkway last year led to a break in one cartel trade scheme.
Inside a black 1985 Chevrolet Camaro a state police trooper discovered $40,000 in small bills, postal money orders worth $16,000 and records of extensive financial transactions with Colombia. The driver, Hector Fabio Gualteros, told the police the money and records were part of his work as an independent distributor of Herbalife International health-care products.
Agents with the State Organized Crime Task Force and the Federal Customs Service placed Mr. Gualteros under surveillance, eventually monitoring 22 telephone lines, 8 beepers and 13 fax lines. In weeks, their suspicions were confirmed.
As described in court papers and interviews, the ring collected drug money for the Cali cartel and paid it to small New York City companies exporting costume jewelry and watches. Cash was often left in brown paper bags.
Seven companies that received the drug money were identified in court papers as High Top Enterprises, Almar Sales, Axelrod Inc., Proyectos Z Corp., Ruby International, AAA Watch and Royal Watch Company, but none was charged with wrongdoing because officials concluded they were unaware of the scheme. Some of the companies were in nondescript offices on Broadway and Seventh Avenue, while four other companies receiving such tainted cash were in Miami and Los Angeles.
The investigation ended earlier this year with the arrest of six people, including Mr. Gualteros and Libardo Moncado, a Colombian importer, who was arrested on a trip to Miami. All pleaded guilty in Federal Court in Brooklyn. Prosecutors said Herbalife was not implicated.
Records show that payments were directed to the companies by coded fax and beeper messages from Cali bosses in Colombia. The authorities say the operation laundered about $4 million in six months.
It also had a violent side.
On Sept. 1, 1994, midway through the inquiry, state investigators arrested two men and seized what they suspected was $157,000 in drug cash. To keep the investigation alive, the woman who delivered the money, Cleofe Ojeda, was not arrested.
Two weeks later, she was found dead in an apartment in Forest Hills, Queens. Investigators think Ms. Ojeda may well have been executed for losing the money.
 
How It Works
Taking a Trip To a Restaurant
Besides employing innovative trade schemes, authorities say drug traffickers are shipping cash in everything from used cars and dolls to television sets and refrigerated containers of bull semen. When a forklift accidentally punctured a shipping pallet in a warehouse on West 32d Street, workers were shocked to see $100 bills tumble out.
A sharp jump in seizures of drug currency -- to $314.4 million in the last fiscal year from $250.4 million in fiscal 1993 -- suggests that the amount of cash shipments is rising.
"We're seeing an increase in the amount of physical transportation of illicit drug money as Government investigations and regulations close loopholes in money laundering vehicles such as casinos, real estate brokers, attorneys, banks and even stockbrokers," said Robert E. Van Etten, the special agent in charge of the Customs Service in New York.
One of the most elaborate operations uncovered involved small warehouses and sham export businesses in suburban industrial parks in New Jersey, Houston and Miami, Customs officials say.
On the New Jersey end, money from drug sales in New York was collected at safe houses after which a coded call to a beeper set up a meeting at a McDonald's on Route 22 in Union, N.J. In a hallmark of the cartels, the operation was carefully compartmentalized so no single arrest would bring down the operation.
A driver arrived at the restaurant in a Mazda pickup truck, cash concealed in compartments beneath the liner of the bed. Another person met him and drove the truck to an apartment in Westfield, leaving the driver to wait. After the cash was unloaded, the truck was returned to the McDonald's. A third person counted and packaged the cash and yet a fourth person transferred it to a warehouse in neighboring Springfield.
Inside the small warehouse was Reno International, what appeared to be a normal business. Machinery had been installed to wrap thin sheets of fiberglass around large spools, and a handful of workers showed up daily. But Reno was a front. Inside each roll of fiberglass were compartments to conceal $700,000 in small bills; officials said the operation could launder $2 million a day.
The organizer prepared so carefully that he first researched the fiberglass industry down to the finest detail and then made two test shipments to Colombia and the Caribbean island of Aruba to see whether it would attract attention.
"They did their research," said Martin D. Ficke, assistant special agent in charge of the Customs Service office in Newark.
With the help of an informant, the authorities uncovered the operation and arrested nine people last year. Among them was Juan B. Munera, 41, a Colombian living in Miami.
Mr. Ficke said Mr. Munera had set up similar warehouses in Miami and Houston for the Cali and Medellin cartels. He described them as money-laundering franchises which were turned over to the cartels once operational. Mr. Munera, who has pleaded guilty to money laundering, collected $1 million for each franchise.

HEADLINE: Fish Dealers Tell of Slump In Business

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
In the dense darkness before dawn, Herbie Ackerman peered gloomily at the mounds of 100-pound crates of unsold perch and salmon stacked in front of his Fulton Fish Market stall.
'It's not a pretty picture, and it's a difficult time for us," he said. 
 The 68-year-old Mr. Ackerman, owner of the Messing Fish Company, has hawked seafood for 42 years, and other dealers value him as one of the market's best judges of trends in the risky art of selling fish wholesale.
On Friday, he was uneasy about the market's prospects. Dealers like him, he said, are having to cope with a new system of unloading seafood that New York City officials imposed this month in a campaign to end reported mob corruption.
Wholesale prices are sharply higher, he said, and seafood supplies and sales are down. Consumers in the New York area should expect prices to keep climbing, at least in the short run, Mr. Ackerman warned.
He said that his normal sales of 35,000 pounds of seafood on a busy day had dipped 30 percent in the last two weeks. Many of the market's 58 other dealers say their businesses also have nose-dived since a wildcat strike brought chaos briefly to the market on Oct. 16, the first day of the new unloading system.
On Oct. 13, the city abruptly ejected six companies that had unloaded supplies for decades, saying that they had been operating a cartel with an economic choke hold over the flow of 125 million pounds of seafood into the market every year. Some truckers had long complained that the companies demanded payoffs for speedy unloading of their highly perishable products.
The ousted companies were replaced by the Laro Maintenance Company of Bay Shore, L.I., which had no experience in handling seafood. Under Laro's system, trucks are unloaded on a first-come, first-served basis and wholesalers' fees were cut by 20 percent.
Some dealers blame the city's unloading plan and Laro's inexperience for their sluggish business. They say that the new crews misplace and damage shipments, create congestion and deter shippers and buyers from using the market.
But most merchants say it is more than that. They blame a combination of factors that coincided with the introduction of the new unloading system for reducing supplies and raising wholesale costs: catches in the Gulf of Mexico and in the North Atlantic have been substantially cut by bad weather, they said, and many suppliers in Southern states and in New England have bypassed New York in the last two weeks or sent smaller cargoes to avoid possible losses from new labor disruptions.
Dealers say their problems have been compounded by dropping retail sales, apparently caused by consumer fears that the market is gripped by disorders and is selling stale products at inflated prices.
And the dealers claim that their incomes depend mainly on volume, not on sales. Thus, with less seafood available and with demand dropping, all of them are suffering.
The market, mainly on city property next to the South Street Seaport, generates about $1 billion a year in sales, salaries and related businesses. It is the nation's largest wholesale seafood distribution center.
City officials insist that the kinks in the new unloading system have been smoothed out, and that it is more efficient. According to city records, 329 refrigerated tractor-trailers were unloaded last week, compared with 298 in the final week of the old system.
"You can quibble over the amounts being brought in, but the market is operating well and there have been no incidents since the first night," said Randy M. Mastro, chief of staff in the Giuliani administration. "We have cut unloading fees by 20 percent and the carting costs by 40 percent. Eventually, that has to reduce or hold down costs for consumers."
Joseph Niece, the owner of the Sweetwater Sea Food Corporation, a major supplier of shellfish based in in Carlstadt, N.J., said that the high retail prices should level off in a few weeks. "If there are no more unloading debacles," he added, "the shippers will have to come back."
In Miami, Sonny Kravitz, the vice president of Solymar Fisheries International, said he had reduced his weekly shipments of grouper, mahi-mahi and red snapper to 8,000 pounds from 30,000 pounds.
"With catches in the Gulf and Central America improving, prices in New York should drop in a week or two," Mr. Kravitz said.
The Laro company offered jobs to the 40 employees of the ousted companies, but none applied. On Thursday, Gennaro Prisinzano, the former president of a dismissed company, PAS&G Rapid Unloading, was arrested at the market on charges of trying to intimidate Laro employees.
The rejected unloaders, meanwhile, have sued in State Supreme Court to regain their contracts. "Giuliani's people are cooking the books about the level of shipments into the market," said Gerald J. McMahon, a lawyer for the unloaders. "City Hall may appear to be winning but the war is not over, and I fully expect the old unloaders will be returning before Christmas."
To protect Laro's crews, the Police Department has assigned more than 100 officers to the market.
Some dealers said the first-come, first-served unloading system does not allow for a variety of fish and shellfish to be quickly available.
On Friday, with a fishhook dangling from his belt and a Yankees cap on his head, Mr. Ackerman complained that sloppy unloading by Laro crews had forced him to hire two more helpers, on Mondays and Thursdays, the busiest days.
"They're getting the fish unloaded, but not in an orderly manner," he said of the Laro employees. "It's costing me about $800 a week in extra salaries."
Under a law that went into effect last month, the city can license all market businesses and workers. So far, the city has licensed 46 wholesale dealers and is reviewing the backgrounds of 13 companies that are still operating in the market.
The next priority for the administration is a decision on licensing or removing 10 companies, known as loaders, that provide parking spaces and guard services for buyers.
Most dealers say a change in loaders could lead to slowdowns in loading and more problems.
On Oct. 17, at a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan on the unloading dispute, Judge Thomas P. Griesa encouraged city officials to heed the dealers' concerns.
"If you don't," Judge Griesa cautioned, "bingo -- $1 billion in business in this city is gone."

HEADLINE: As Deregulation Is Debated, Cable Prices Outpace Inflation

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Prices for cable television service have begun to creep back up, even as a House-Senate conference committee negotiates final details of telecommunications legislation that would unfetter the cable industry.
Cable prices rose 4.1 percent during the 12-month period that ended in September, according to the most recent statistics released by the Department of Labor, compared with a 2.5 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index during that time. 
 The cable increase came after more than a year of declining cable costs, resulting from the 1992 legislation that sought to tighten control on cable rates.
But while the White House indicated on Friday that it would take an even harder look at the proposed telecommunications reform package, the rate increases have failed to attract the aggressive consumer criticism that was a major motivation behind the 1992 law.
To the contrary, cable is luring new subscribers at impressive rates. The industry's subscriber rosters increased 4.26 percent, to 62.2 million, in the 12-month period that ended in July. The number of subscribers increased 2.6 percent in the 12 months that ended in July 1994.
Larry Haverty, a senior vice president at State Street Research in Boston who follows the cable industry, said that cable companies promise rich returns in the not too distant future.
"We are now expecting double-digit growth in cable cash flow from every major cable operator," he said. "Subscriber rates are creeping up, growth has been vigorous and the companies have done well at controlling costs."
Cable operators have also taken a more sophisticated approach to marketing. As an example, Viacom Inc. is promoting its Nickelodeon children's cable service at its Blockbuster video stores. Viacom has also teamed up with MCA Inc. to open a Nickelodeon studio at MCA's Universal Theme Park in Orlando, Fla.
Federal rules adopted in the wake of the 1992 law held rate increases for basic cable services in line with inflation, starting last January. But cable operators were permitted to raise rates by as much as $1.50 a month for newly added advertiser-supported services, up to a maximum of six channels.
Some critics of the system, like Barry Orton, a professor of telecommunications at the University of Wisconsin, believe that prices are also rising because the Federal Communications Commission has been relaxing the rules in recent months. He cited a provision in the regulations that gives certain small cable systems far more flexibility to raise prices than their larger counterparts.
But supporters of the new trends argue that consumers are relatively docile because they are receiving additional benefits in return for the higher rates.
A spot check of consumers found little if any revolt, though not everyone was pleased with the current combination of prices and service.
Scott Martell, a Detroit writer who pays $22 a month for basic, no-frills service from Comcast Cable, said he paid $1 a month less now than he did a year ago.
But Rene Graham-Buckner of Rochester Hills, a Detriot suburb, said that she now pays TCI Cablevision $48 a month for the same service that cost her $40 a year ago. The bulk of the increase came from a $4.95 monthly charge for two services, Stars and Encore, that were free a year ago.
Asked about the increases, a company spokesman said: "We are not obligated to discuss rates."
Both Mr. Orton and Gene Kimmelman, a co-director of the Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports, said they expect rates to soar again if the main provisions of the pending legislation become law. "There is a treasure at the end of the road for the cable industry if the bill passes. Naturally, they will curb their greed a bit anticipating that event," Mr. Orton said.
Mr. Kimmelman predicted that if the legislation passes, rates will go up $5 a month. "The language of the new bill gives operators the flexibility to do that," he said.
But Mr. Haverty dismissed such consumer pessimism. "The cable industry has had a good sniff of regulation, and they don't like it," he said. "The result is there is likely to be pricing prudence, even if there is deregulation. Rates will go up 3 or 4 percent, but a lot of the increase will mean better product. At the very end of the day, the people who run major businesses are not world-class stupid."

HEADLINE: New Rules on Ownership for German TV

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Almost two years ago, German broadcasters began complaining to regulators that they were in danger of losing control of German television to foreigners with deep pockets.
International media giants like Capital Cities/ABC, the News Corporation and Walt Disney were quietly coming into Germany, the world's largest television market after the United States, and buying pieces of existing channels or starting small, specialized channels. 
 German media groups feared that the competition could eventually wrest away control of big nationwide channels. The broadcasters did not get the urgent measures they sought, but finally, earlier this month, they were pleasantly surprised by government action that in the short run will give them the chance to consolidate their own entrenched positions in Europe's largest and arguably most coveted television market.
But the short-term gains may have a price, as the law would also give their foreign competition greater opportunities to move into the market over the medium and long term.
At a recent meeting, the governments of the country's 16 states, which regulate broadcasting, agreed to change the country's ownership rules, which had sharply limited the ability of individual companies to acquire substantial stakes in German channels.
The states' leaders agreed to allow investors in general interest and all-news channels to own 100 percent of one channel, compared with 49.9 percent before, and as much as 50 percent of subsequent outlets, provided the overall market penetration of an owner's channels does not exceed 30 percent.
"Practically speaking, if you can't control the voting stock in a channel you can't control programming content or editorial content," said Dirk Reiter, head of the media group at Roland Berger & Partners, a management consulting firm in Frankfurt. "It's an issue not only of management control over content, but also of being able to compete with outside investors."
The new law is likely to open the German market to a host of new competitors, but at first the leading German media companies, like the Kirch Group of Bavaria and the giant conglomerate Bertelsmann A.G., will probably move to lock in their control of the country's biggest channels.
Because foreigners will compete under the same ownership rules, however, American companies will be able to build a larger presence and compete for dominance. "Takeovers and new alliances will be the outcome," said Roland Berger, head of the Berger consulting firm, in the weekly magazine Der Spiegel. "The competition will be merciless."
Nonetheless, the law should insure that the $4.4 billion broadcasting business, one of the country's fastest-growing industries, will continue to generate jobs inside Germany, which because of its high wages has seen unemployment rise sharply and manufacturing jobs move abroad.
"We have to be careful that this growth creates jobs in Germany and that jobs are not exported abroad," said Bavaria's Premier, Edmund Stoiber, a key backer of the new law.
The interest of foreign companies is not just in the advertising revenue generated by the nationwide channels. The companies are investing at a time when Germany, which has Europe's wealthiest viewership, is deregulating its entire telecommunications industry, clearing the way for highly lucrative businesses like telemarketing, pay-per-view and on-line services.
The law is scheduled to be made final on Dec. 14.
The old regulations were put in place in the early 1980's, when commercial broadcasting first began in Germany with a handful of private channels and regulators feared the effects of one owner's dominating the business. Now, with 25 nationwide channels, those fears have diminished.
But concern about foreign control of German broadcasting companies has increased. Outsiders own large stakes in almost 40 percent of the German broadcasting properties not owned by the state, according to some media experts. (The state owns two networks, ARD and ZDF, which together control almost 40 percent of the television market.)
For example, the Walt Disney Company, after its acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. is completed, will have a 16.5 percent ownership in RTL2, a general interest channel; a 50 percent stake in Super RTL, an entertainment channel, and stakes in Eurosport, a European sport channel, and in Frauenkanal, a specialized channel aimed at women.
Time Warner Inc.'s planned merger with Turner Broadcasting System Inc. will mean that the combined company will own more than 50 percent of Germany's only all-news channel, N-TV. Time Warner also has holdings in two local channels near Hamburg and Berlin, and two successful popular music channels, Viva 1 and Viva 2. Analysts say the new law probably means that the combined company will be allowed to keep the larger stake in the news channel.
The News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, owns almost 50 percent of VOX, the country's sixth-largest commercial channel.
By far the largest foreign presence in German television is that of a Luxembourg media consortium called CLT, which owns almost half of RTL, Germany's largest commercial channel. CLT also has stakes in RTL2 and Super RTL, giving it a market penetration of about 24 percent.
Ralf Beke-Bramkamp, a spokesman for Bertelsmann, which also owns a stake in RTL, said: "We do not complain about this foreign presence in the German market, because we are also operating in more than 40 other countries. But those countries do not have the same strict regulations that we have in Germany. So we see this change as very important."
Still, German companies dominate the largest private channels, and the new law should help them consolidate their grip on these cash cows.
To begin with, if the two Government-controlled networks are privatized, as many argue they should be, they are sure to be sold into German hands.
In addition, the Kirch family already controls almost 30 percent of the German market. Leo Kirch has major stakes in SAT.1, the second-largest commercial station in the country, and DSF, the most popular sports channel. His son, Thomas, controls Pro 7 and Kabel 1, the third- and fifth-largest commercial channels. It is still unclear whether regulators will treat the two men as separate investors or -- because of their relationship -- as one enterprise.
Bertelsmann will also benefit from the rule change, because it holds large stakes in RTL, RTL2 and Vox. It is already seeking to wrest control of RTL from its non-German partner, CLT.
Since the summer, Bertelsmann has struck a deal with another German shareholder in the channel, the WAZ Group. Pooling their ownership in RTL, they now control as many votes on the RLT board as CLT. The two German groups now have 49.1 percent ownership, and CLT has 49.9 percent.
CLT has filed suit against Bertelsmann, saying the agreement violates German media rules, but experts say that given the planned changes in ownership rules, such a challenge will be in vain.

Discount books in Britain could reshape the industry.

BYLINE: By Sarah Lyall 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
"TWENTY-FIVE percent off!" boasts the sign on the High Street bookshop, above an enormous pile of books. It is a common sight in the United States, which is why it is so startling to learn that before Oct. 1, bookstores in Britain were forbidden to sell books at reduced prices.
For close to 100 years, publishers and booksellers had been bound by a gentleman's pact called the Net Book Agreement, which allowed publishers to establish fixed minimum retail prices for their books. 
 If the system stifled competition based on price, the thinking went, then at least it encouraged literary competition: the company that published the best (rather than the cheapest) books would win. But the system fell apart this fall when most of Britain's largest book publishers, dismayed at recent deplorable sales, said they were pulling out of the Net Book Agreement, freeing up most of the country's biggest-selling titles for American-style deals.
It happened just as the industry was entering its busiest period of the year, leading up to Christmas, and retailers braced themselves for a round of price wars in an industry whose margins are notoriously low. "It's a fairly crazy period being led by frenzied retail competition, which is what you would expect when the rules change overnight," said Simon Master, chairman of the General Books division of Random House U.K.
The biggest bookseller chains -- W. H. Smith, Waterstones and the Asda Group supermarkets -- immediately cut prices up to 50 percent on their most popular current titles, including "The Moor's Last Sigh," by Salman Rushdie, and "Enigma," by Robert Harris. Publishers began printing more copies of their best sellers, knowing that because of their new discount deals with bookstores, they would have to increase sales to turn a profit.
Afterward, book sales for a few discounted titles skyrocketed. The most impressive example was "Delia Smith's Winter Collection," a book of recipes by Britain's top television chef. The book was discounted by more than 15 percent in mid-October by chains and independent stores alike. It sold a reported 500,000 copies in one week -- as many as its publisher, BBC Books, had expected to sell in the entire holiday season.
Britain's 2,000 or so independent bookstores (about 1,000 other stores belong to chains) have reacted with fear and in, some cases, plucky promotions. In the town of Bicester, Coles Book Store instituted a special weeklong deal: every customer who bought a nondiscounted book received a free can of Heinz baked beans.
"When the N.B.A. fell, we decided we would have to compete in the local price wars," said Jamie Cole, a salesperson at the store, which is next door to a W. H. Smith's and near three big supermarkets that have begun discounting the best sellers on their racks. "We decided that since they would be selling discounted books, our customers should be able to get baked beans."
Forcing books to answer to the same market forces that govern other retail products sounds like a boon to consumers, who in Britain used to pay upwards of $25 for a hardcover book. But booksellers who oppose the new discounting policy say it could drive up prices, if publishers and booksellers charge more for their nondiscounted titles to help pay for lower profits on discounted books.
"The economics of discounting are merciless," said Kevin Ramage, who owns the Owl Bookshop in Kentish Town, London. If he was to reduce the price of some hardcover books by 25 percent, he said, he would have to sell four times as many books to make the same profit he would have had without the discount.
So far, chain stores are faring better under the new system because they can place bigger orders and get better deals from publishers, although some publishers are offering special price-promotion deals to independent stores. And while no one knows what will happen in the long run, England's booksellers are braced for an American-style battle between the small and the large retailer, the idiosyncratic store and the large conglomerate.
Mr. Ramage at Owl said he hoped that a book's price would prove less important than its content and the personal service his store offers. "In the long term, customers will become more price conscious," he said. "But so far, customers don't seem particularly motivated by price on an individual title. Buying books is not like buying milk."

HEADLINE: Unlikely Allies Join Forces To Save a Neighborhood

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
The landscape of East New York is still dominated by damage, with decaying buildings pockmarking blocks where murder remains much too frequent. But behind the scars is a vibrant neighborhood, one where children are led by the hand through the streets to school, buildings are rebuilt and gardens are grown where there once was debris.
The mix of devastation and determination makes East New York ripe for urban experimentation. Enter, then, one of the more unusual sets of lab partners: police officers and professors, residents and corporate executives, housing experts and welfare recipients, all banding together to create the latest model for community policing. 
 Starting this week, 20 blocks of East New York will become the laboratory for this effort, benefiting from an intensive deployment of police and other resources. The program will use private money, national and local community development corporations, criminal justice experts from Harvard University and the officers of the 75th Precinct.
Two sites have been chosen so far for the three-year national pilot program: this area of Brooklyn -- the center of what has long been one of the most murderous neighborhoods in the city -- and Seattle's Chinatown.Projects in three other cities, including Boston and San Diego, are expected to be announced soon.
"I don't believe East New York is the Wild West anymore," said Rosa Serna, 42, a mother of two who lives there. "And the working people have always been here waiting for change."
Under what will be known as the Community Security Initiative, to be announced by Police Commissioner William J. Bratton at a news conference today, the 75th Precinct, reorganizing its community policing unit, will assign four officers to the target blocks of East New York. Those officers will be directly supervised by a sergeant, who will have the authority to request any or all of the department's tactical drug and street crime units.
The precinct's liaison to the neighborhood's residents will be the East New York Urban Youth Corps, a community development corporation that has helped rehabilitate scores of buildings in East New York in the last several years. Using their contacts with tenant organizers and residents, the development corporation will introduce the officers to a network of people willing to provide information on drug dealing and desperate for a relationship with beat officers that goes beyond staring at them as they drive by in a car.
There will be monthly meetings; committees of residents from each of the 20 blocks will be set up, and professional surveys and polls will be conducted. And all of the data collected will be studied, with refinements proposed, by professors from the criminal justice and management program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
 "This is a long-term commitment, not just about two cops on a corner for a couple of weeks," said Inspector Edward Mezzadri, commanding officer of the 75th Precinct. "This is community policing turned up to the highest possible volume."
 The history of community policing in the city has not been sterling. Former Mayor David N. Dinkins initiated his version of the concept -- broadly understood to be a way of fostering working relationships between the police and the residents of individual precincts to prevent crime -- only to have his own officials conclude that the effort had been plagued by flawed strategy, a lack of interest among officers, high turnover rates among community policing officers, and outright dishonesty. Officers were found to have lied about how often they actually walked their beats.
In East New York, there has been a gap in trust between the residents and the 75th Precinct. For officers, an assignment to work in the 75th Precinct, which two years ago recorded 129 murders over 12 months, was viewed as punishment. There was also corruption among some officers, and plain fear about having to serve in such a troubled area.
But the 75th Precinct has enjoyed a rebirth of sorts over the last several years. Under the aggressive tactics endorsed by Mr. Bratton, violent crime has fallen by 30 percent across the board in the precinct, with murders down by more than 60 percent over the last two years.
And while no one in the neighborhood is willing to concede that the police have completely accounted for the drop in crime, there is a sense that the moment is right to reclaim East New York's streets permanently. More than 7,000 units of affordable housing are to be built in the coming years, and more modest rehabilitation efforts are going on along whole blocks of the neighborhood.
Program organizers, who have been working with the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, are ambitious enough to be considering having people who plead guilty to buying drugs or soliciting prostitutes work on the block on which they were arrested, during which they would be forced to wear clothing identifying them as having committed a crime in the neighborhood.
To Paul Grogan, the president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which has coordinated the investment of millions of dollars in revitalizing East New York and put together the community policing program, the program makes practical financial sense.
 Millie Wilkerson, though, doesn't look so deep for rationales. Mrs. Wilkerson, who has lived in East New York for 20 years, knows she wants to feel safe again.
 "Who knows why people are doing it or how long it will stick for?"' she said. "But how can it not be worth trying?"

Higher Education Funds

 BODY:
New York is one of only four states putting less state money into higher education this year than two years ago, according to an annual study by the Center for Higher Education at Illinois State University. A sluggish economy and budget cutting by the Pataki administration caused 1995-96 higher education appropriations to drop 4 percent this year compared with 1993-94. This year's expenditures are only 12 percent higher than 10 years ago. For both the 2-year and 10-year period. New York ranks 48th in the nation in growth of state funding for higher education. In both New York and New Jersey, state financing for student aid was down 4 percent from two years ago.

HEADLINE: Baseball Ends With a Flourish

 BODY:
The baseball season, which could not have started more badly, redeemed itself at the end. The playoffs -- a bit too drawn-out for our tastes -- nevertheless produced magnetic moments. Not the least of these was the series between the New York Yankees and the Seattle Mariners, an unforgettable duel that gave Yankee fans a welcome respite from the tiresome grievances of George Steinbrenner and gave Seattle fans hope that their troubled franchise would stay put.
At last came the World Series. Behind some extraordinary pitching, including Tom Glavine's masterpiece in the final game, the Atlanta Braves neutralized Cleveland's powerful hitters to capture a prize they had come so close to winning before. There was justice and symmetry in this. The playoff schedule was so arranged that a mediocre club could have lucked its way into the Series. The two best teams in baseball actually survived, and the better team won the championship. 
 The biggest winner, however, may have been baseball itself. The season started late because of a demoralizing labor dispute that began in 1994 and did not end until April. The fans, furious with both players and owners, stayed home. Yet over the last month there have been enough dramatic nights and enough packed stadiums to suggest that the game of baseball might well survive the business of baseball -- if only the players and owners will get their heads together. There is still no collective bargaining contract, no real bargaining and no commissioner of baseball. There could well be another strike.
It is hard to summon great sympathy for either side in a dispute over riches that most Americans can only dream about. That includes the players, especially those who charge children $7 for an autograph. In the end, though, the responsibility for stabilizing the sport lies mainly with the owners. The players are justified in fighting for the freedom to sell their skills in an open market. The salary inflation that imperils teams in weaker markets -- teams like the Pittsburgh Pirates, an old and honorable franchise -- was propelled by the owners themselves. If some redistribution of wealth is required to keep these franchises competitive, the owners should finance it.
For now, let us savor a fine Series and join with the disappointed Cleveland fans in baseball's most hopeful refrain: Wait till next year. Let us also join with fans everywhere in hoping that there will be a next year.

Message to the Fans: Baseball Isn't Back Yet

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
WHENEVER they weren't bundled in warm-up jackets during the World Series, the Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians could be seen wearing a patch on the left sleeve of their uniforms that read, "Welcome to the Show." And the late-but-unlamented Baseball Network also blared that message across its television openings.
Welcome to another example of baseball not understanding itself. 
 Baseball isn't supposed to be "the show" or even "a show." That's a phrase out of the movie "Bull Durham." A show is a Broadway play or a Hollywood movie, something with a script. Baseball is a game, a competition without a script. But baseball is also big business, an industry. It is not a show.
Baseball's public discovered that a year ago and now it is about to be reminded.
Just because the World Series was compelling, just because the earlier post-season games had their moments, don't think that baseball is back. As good as the games were, as glittering as Tom Glavine, Mark Wohlers and Dave Justice were in the Braves' epic 1-0 one-hit clincher on Saturday night, games alone won't put baseball back on the public pedestal it once enjoyed.
Since the owners and the players union knocked baseball off that pedestal, they're the only ones who can put it back there.
When last year's World Series was canceled, the owners and the union hung a dark cloud of public distrust over baseball. That cloud is not only still up there, but more clouds are on the horizon.
Now that the World Series is over, now that stadiums are empty, labor negotiations are due to resume soon. If a settlement and a multiyear agreement develop, that distrust will disappear.
But if the dispute over a salary cap and revenue sharing lingers, if it threatens or delays the 1996 season, the patch on those World Series uniforms should have read, "Welcome to the Woe."
Talking baseball soon will mean discussing the moves of the acting commissioner Bud Selig and the union chief Donald Fehr instead of the decisions of the on-the-field managers Bobby Cox and Mike Hargrove.
Talking baseball soon will mean arguing Congress' debate over baseball's antitrust exemption and recalling a Federal judge's injunction last April that prevented the owners from imposing a new economic system on the union.
That injunction, remember, saved the recent season. Without it, the union would not have ended its 234-day strike against the owners.
And for all the glitz of the post-season, for all the boasting by some that baseball is back, remember that the excitement involved only 8, then 4, then 2 of the 28 franchises. Many people, if their team wasn't in it, weren't that interested.
Only hours after Atlanta celebrated the first championship professional sports team in its history, many of its citizens seemed more concerned yesterday with Deion Sanders's return to the Georgia Dome as the Dallas Cowboys' designer cornerback.
Unlike other eras, baseball has a short shelf life now. Too much else is happening. Pro football is halfway to the playoffs. Pro basketball starts dribbling this weekend. Hockey has been skating for nearly a month. Mike Tyson will swagger into a ring again Saturday night.
Baseball likes to think that its franchises are stable. Many are. But the future of the Houston Astros and the Pittsburgh Pirates is uncertain. Even the St. Louis Cardinals are up for sale.
After more than four decades, the Busch beer barons decided that the Cardinals, one of baseball's flagship franchises, were no longer cost-efficient. Another brewery, Molson, wants to sell the Blue Jays. That's always the risk under corporate ownership. To the bean counters, the bottom line is always more important than the farm system.
As if baseball didn't have enough problems, Albert Belle and George Steinbrenner tarnished the World Series with their bullying.
Belle, the Indians' sneering slugger, has apologized to Hannah Storm for insulting the NBC broadcaster in the dugout before the third game, but he deserves a stiff fine of at least $100,000. And when will he apologize to all the others he has insulted in recent seasons?
Steinbrenner stepped on the World Series by announcing Buck Showalter's "resignation" as Yankee manager an hour before Thursday night's fifth game was to begin. The principal owner's explanation was that he had to announce it because it had been leaked. But who leaked it?
Steinbrenner was fined $50,000 for his derogatory remarks about the umpires during the first two games of the divisional series with the Seattle Mariners. And he should be fined $100,000 for upstaging the World Series, at least in New York, with his Showalter announcement.
Because these incidents occurred during the World Series, the fines of both Belle and Steinbrenner must come down from what is known as "the commissioner's office."
But there's no commissioner in that office. And none is in sight. Welcome to the Woe.

HEADLINE: A Talent Cradled in London And Nourished by New York

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
In 1993, Patrick Stewart went to London to perform his one-man version of "A Christmas Carol" for the hometown crowd. In New York, his performances of the work over the two previous Christmas holidays had been sold-out sensations, the audiences so thrilled at watching him act out an entire Dickens novel that they laughed even before the punch lines.
But at the Old Vic theater in London, there were no waves of love or laughter radiating from the audience on opening night. The crowd sat stone-faced as Mr. Stewart anxiously went through his paces as Tiny Tim and Bob Cratchit and Scrooge, material that had seemed sure-fire on the other side of the Atlantic. 
 "I played to almost total silence," said Mr. Stewart, who is to star in "The Tempest," which opens on Wednesday at the Broadhurst Theater. "I was in a total state of panic. There was no indulgence, no overt generosity. I felt I was on trial."
And of course, he was. Theater is to London what fine red burgundy is to, well, Burgundy. So when Mr. Stewart returned to the British stage after years in the United States as a performer on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," he was instantly reminded of how much more demanding audiences there could be. The only thing to do, he said, was to raise the level of his performance and win over the crowd.
"In London, they make you work for it," Mr. Stewart said the other day as he sat in his Manhattan apartment high above Third Avenue. "I just think that acting here in New York is more fun. When I think of London, I think of drama. When I think of New York, I think of show biz."
Few actors working today have bridged the worlds of drama and show biz more successfully than the 55-year-old Mr. Stewart, who spent years playing classical roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company in England before finding huge commercial success in the United States as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on "Star Trek." Now, armed with the technique acquired in London and the money and fame earned in Hollywood, Mr. Stewart has the skill and the following to bring the two worlds together. Which is precisely what he is doing this season, as the star of a Shakespeare play on Broadway.
And not one of Shakespeare's traditional crowd-pleasers. Not a zippy "As You Like It" or a bloody "Macbeth" or a raucous "Taming of the Shrew." Mr. Stewart is Prospero in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of "The Tempest," an esoteric work that scholars describe as one of Shakespeare's "problem" plays. It was such a critical and popular success during its run in Central Park last summer, however, that George C. Wolfe, who heads the festival and directed the play, decided to move it to Broadway.
"Watching 1,900 people rise to applaud and cheer 'The Tempest'!" Mr. Stewart marveled as he recalled his summer in the park. "It's not 'Hamlet.' And they were reacting like it was 'Sunset Boulevard.' "
That the festival finds itself on Broadway with Shakespeare for the first time since 1972, when Sam Waterston and Kathleen Widdoes starred in "Much Ado About Nothing," is in no small measure due to Mr. Stewart. The transfer, in fact, was predicated on his participation. It is a strange and gratifying turn of events for an actor who was unknown in this country a few years ago. And odder still that an interlude on television should be a major factor in how a classically trained English actor gets to Broadway in a classical role.
Mr. Stewart is a bit ambivalent about his television success: pleased at the economic freedom it has provided ("That's 'Star Trek,' " he said, showing a picture of a 315-year-old farmhouse in the north of England that he bought with earnings from the show) but worried that the impression he made in seven seasons as the Star Fleet captain will obscure his stage accomplishments. Because Mr. Stewart, despite his television experience and a growing film career -- he managed to steal a scene or two in the recent "Jeffrey" -- still thinks of himself as a stage actor. And it is on the stage, always the stage, where English actors prove themselves.
He has been doing the classics since his boyhood in Mirfield, a village in Yorkshire where theater was as ubiquitous as pick-up rugby matches. "In my small town, there were 9,000 people and 11 fully active drama societies," Mr. Stewart said. By the age of 15 he had played Richard III, Leontes and Prospero. "Every church, every chapel, you had plays," he added. "Those were possibly the most idyllic days of acting, and it was all just for fun."
After training at the Bristol Old Vic, Mr. Stewart joined the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 1968 he came to New York for the first time, appearing with the renowned company in "As You Like It" and "The Taming of the Shrew." Two years later, he returned to the United States in another Shakespeare production that some theatergoers regard as one of the most memorable theater nights in their lives: Peter Brook's legendary 1970 staging of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
Mr. Stewart had a small part in "Dream," that of Snout, the tinker. He would work again with Mr. Brook in the mid-1970's, playing Enobarbus in "Antony and Cleopatra," a production he remembers better for what happened during rehearsals than for the performances.
"The aura of mystique and magic around Brook I found to be unfounded," Mr. Stewart said. "I felt his technique was based on absolute common sense." He recalled a rehearsal period with the five other principal actors, including Alan Howard and Glenda Jackson, in which they were called on to perform all the parts in the play. Mr. Brook had placed a script on a carpet; anyone could pick it up and start to read. "It was one of the most thrilling experiences of a play that I've ever seen," he said. "It was as if I was experiencing the play for the first time."
But little in Mr. Stewart's theatrical training had prepared him for Hollywood. Having come from a society obsessed with status by birthright, he was stunned to discover that he was entering a subculture with almost as rigid a hierarchy. "A New York producer once said to me, 'In Hollywood, people define themselves by what they won't do,' " Mr. Stewart said. "Like, 'I don't do TV daytime.' " As an actor in a syndicated series, Mr. Stewart learned that his rung on the ladder was lower than that of feature film and prime-time network television stars.
But in New York, Mr. Stewart has never felt anything less than a celebrity with a permanent key to the city. Just as New Yorkers seem to have embraced his performances, so has Mr. Stewart embraced New York.
"I feel, as a performer, for the first time in my life I'm understood," he said, gazing out the kitchen window at the rooftops of the Upper East Side. "I think America is good for me."

HEADLINE: Trying to Put the Power Grid On a More or Less Even Keel

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
These days, small wafers of silicon precisely control tens of millions of personal computers. But the electric system that powers those computers -- along with the lights, the telephones and most of the rest of the physical components of the economy -- still lumbers along with technology from the days of manual typewriters and mechanical adding machines.
Now, though, experiments are under way in the power industry to demonstrate that chunks of silicon could help run the nation's electrical power network in a manner similar to the inner workings of a computer -- by rapidly and precisely switching current on and off. 
 Why silicon? Because it is a "semiconductor" of electricity, silicon can be instantly switched from a conductor to an insulator and back again, using the electricity itself to make this change.
Silicon is a particularly effective medium for the on-off switching of the tiny pulses of electricity that represent the ones and zeros of information in a computer's binary code. Engineers hope that the same principle can be applied to an electric utility system, in which silicon could rapidly switch huge jolts of electricity on and off -- to better stabilize the current's flow and to open new possibilities in the productivity and reliability of transporting electricity over the nation's power grid.
The Tennessee Valley Authority will begin testing such technology in mid-November at a substation near Johnson City. And in eastern Kentucky, American Electric Power is working on its second installation of a silicon-control system.
This is the dawn of "the other silicon revolution," said Karl E. Stahlkopf, vice president of the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif.
Dawn may be breaking not a moment too soon. After years of public discussion about the generating side of the electricity business -- whether to build nuclear plants, how to control acid emissions from coal plants, new ways to avoid using oil -- attention is now shifting to the transmission system. About 40 percent of all electricity produced in the country is sold on the wholesale market, transmitted from one utility to another -- a proportion that has quadrupled in the last 15 years, according to the research institute.
 And the percentage could rise sharply again as the industry is de-regulated and customers are allowed to shop among producers, rather than being forced to buy electricity from the local monopoly.
The problem with the existing power transport network is that it is largely uncontrolled, resembling a network of canals, in which the electricity is like water, flowing down the course of least resistance.
The new silicon technology can be thought of as converting the system to something more controllable, like water mains outfitted with adjustable valves. These silicon valves are called thyristors (pronounced thigh-RIS-ters) -- thick disks of silicon slightly larger than hockey pucks, capable of switching millions of watts of electricity on and off in rapid bursts.
 Because the existing power grid was built primarily for reliability, not bulk power transfers, when too much electricity is pushed through it, it is prone to collapse.
The Tennessee Valley Authority installation, scheduled to go into use on Nov. 15, will use 240 thyristors to stabilize voltage at a Johnson City substation with a growing number of industrial customers.
 Electricity at the substation, as in most major electric operations, is moving in three phases. Each phase is 60-cycle alternating current, in which the electrons switch directions 60 times a second. But the three phases are staggered by exactly one third, like three people singing "row, row, row your boat" in a round.
A generator produces equal amounts of energy in all three phases. But miles away, where customers are drawing power, the energy in each phase can vary significantly. By opening and closing electrical gates at precise intervals, the thyristors can shunt energy between the phases to stabilize the system, according to T. W. Cease, the principal project specialist for the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Dr. Stahlkopf sees future applications as well. Today, some industrial or computer sites that need high reliability are wired with feeders to two different power substations, in case one fails. A thyristor switch, he said, could probably accomplish the switch in well under one cycle, or one-sixtieth of a second -- so fast the computers would not even hiccup.


GRAPHIC: The power systems operated by electric companies often suffer irregularities too small to produce even a noticable flicker in the lights, but large enough to hurt sensitive equipment. Engineers are using silicon devices, similar to computer chips but thousands of times larger, to stablize the current that flows over electric-power transmission lines. Current alternates 60 times a second. Even though an outage or voltage sag may last only two or three cycles, that is long enough to cause trouble.
Chart/Diagram: "A Computer Chip Model for Energy"
 As a precaution against interruptions, some commercial buildings are hooked up to feeder cables from two different elecrical substations. Old-style power equipment cannot make a switch fast enough to keep a comptuer running. However, silicon switches called thyristors can sense a failure or a voltage sag and accomplish the switch in well under one cycle.
 Sometimes the 60-cycle system developes unwanted variations. The amount of energy may increase or decrease, like a series of big waves on the ocean followed by a series of small waves. A thyristor can chop off the tops of the big waves to keep the power steady.

HEADLINE: In Flat Market, Co-op Life Has Steep Ups and Downs

SERIES: THE HOUSE RULES: First of three articles.

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD with TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
The actor was so enraged at his co-op board president that one morning he dumped a mountain of dirt outside the man's apartment door. When the board president died of cancer, another exasperated resident of the Upper West Side building held a little party to celebrate.
The board of a Sutton Place co-op despised a tenant who had spent three years noisily renovating his apartment. When he decided to sell the place for $2.7 million, the board, to spite him, rejected an amply qualified buyer. Word circulated among brokers that this was a problem apartment. Not until years later did it sell -- for almost $1 million less. 
 The rambunctious 4-year-old threw tantrums unless she was fed in the elevator of her family's Queens co-op. Thus the girl's nanny dutifully nourished her in the elevator -- messily. Neighbors went off to work with food remnants speckling their shoes. They complained to the parents, who pointed out that they were apartment owners and could do as they pleased. The dispute boiled until the board formally prohibited dining in the elevator.
Co-op life, of course, has always been difficult. But in the last few years, for the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who bought into the co-op market only to see it collapse, this often fractious communal living arrangement has become even more so.
Always powerful and subject to precious little oversight, co-op boards are now increasingly vigilant about their buildings' finances and thus are becoming more controlling -- or, many residents and brokers would say, more intrusive, autocratic and quixotic. Several brokers say boards appear to be turning down more people than ever -- even applicants painstakingly screened by brokers well-versed as to which buildings consider which sorts of people "compatible." Prospective buyers, in general, are being forced to reveal more and more. Often acerbic co-op litigation is escalating as well.
A co-op is very much an insulated private club, and many of them impose a thicket of house rules: "Poorly dressed guests must ride service elevator." "Residents cannot sit in lobby chairs when dressed in flippers." You may be penalized if you flout them.
At 860-870 United Nations Plaza, you are not permitted to cook in a wok (people don't like the smell), and all draperies must be lined in white. At 77 Seventh Avenue, pianos are prohibited. At the Dakota, you need board permission to be interviewed by television crews in your apartment. At 301 East 64th Street, you can be fined $250 for skating inside the building. At 53 East 66th Street, if there are two written complaints about a dog creating a nuisance, "said dog would be removed."
The result of all this is that many co-op residents aren't just routinely fed up with one another these days; they're starting to get fed up with the co-op enterprise itself.
"A lot of people bought into co-ops not knowing what the life would be like," said Vicki Chesler, executive editor of The New York Cooperator, a publication devoted to the field. "We did a seminar and one woman said, 'When are you going to do a book about how to overthrow your board?' We get a lot of calls from people unhappy with their boards. We get, 'My neighbor makes a lot of noise, but he's the board president.' We get a lot of complaints about boards rigging elections to keep new members off. There is no question that some people have become disillusioned about co-op life."
This souring of the cooperative mood has come as co-ops, once identified largely with the affluent, spread throughout New York's geographic and economic interstices in the 1980's to become available to virtually all socio-economic groups. Relatively rare outside New York, co-op apartments are home to more than a million New Yorkers. Four times more co-ops exist today than in 1980, and they sell for $15,000 as well as $15 million.
Many of the people who bought these co-ops did so not out of any abiding belief in the system itself, if they even understood it, but for financial motives. Co-ops made more sense than renting, and as real-estate values rode the frenzied boom, they became investment gold mines.
Now, though, with the gold rush done and prices generally stagnant, the more misunderstood and distracting elements of co-op life are asserting themselves with a grouchy vengeance: the potentially stringent limitations on tenant freedom, capriciousness about who can move in, malicious boards, crooked managing agents, malevolent neighbors and the fact that tenants are not simply homeowners but partners in a multimillion-dollar corporation they have not been trained to run.
"It's a form of living under dictatorship," said Arthur Cantor, a producer who owns a co-op in the Dakota. "Anyone who lives in a co-op has to have mixed emotions. In a sense, you're half-slave and half-free."
 
Realization
Shareholders Live Above the C.E.O.
There are 8,080 co-op buildings in New York City, containing about 416,000 apartments, more than half the co-ops in the nation. In contrast, there are just 1,040 condominium complexes, the less restrictive form of communal ownership that is more popular elsewhere in the country. Half of the city's co-op apartments are in Manhattan, with the largest and most expensive enclave lining the Upper East Side. And while New York remains emphatically a city of renters, roughly 15 percent of the population now lives in co-ops, though about 45 percent of those people rent the apartments from their owners.
It is only after actually buying a co-op that many people truly realize what it is: a synthesis of home, kibbutz and Hewlett-Packard. Living in a co-op means agreeing to share responsibility for everything from a building's finances to its decor.
Tenants do not own the space they live in; they own shares in the corporation that owns the building. The corporation then leases an apartment to each shareholder, who pays a monthly maintenance that covers a proportional share of the expenses of the building.
Co-ops operate like businesses. Rules and governance are the province of an elected board of directors. In no other business, however, do shareholders and board members all live together in the same building.
People who rent apartments share a common enemy in the landlord, who may live in New Jersey. In a co-op, all the tenants are also the landlord, and the boy playing the tuba next door belongs to the board president. But since many people migrate from rental buildings to co-ops, they often take a long time to acclimate themselves.
"There's a real rental mentality among many co-op residents," said Naomi Karp, who is working on a book about the history of co-ops in New York. "They still think the landlord is going to come to fix the broken water pipe."
One of the aspects least appreciated by co-op owners, until something goes awry, is that the business they own may well boast a multimillion-dollar budget. In their spare time, not necessarily with any managerial grooming, they are expected to run it. If something goes dreadfully wrong with the building, they have to pay for it. One day, as happened to residents of 740 Park Avenue, you can receive a bill for a special assessment of $258,000 to repair the facade of your building.
"You have invested in not only a home but a corporation," said Carol J. Ott, editor and publisher of Habitat magazine, which covers co-op issues. "What's in your face every day is your home. But the fact that there's a corporation, too, is becoming more obvious to many people. And that realization has made people unsettled. In no other industry do you have neophytes spending this kind of money."
In the last couple of years, many boards, neophyte or not, seem to be seizing even greater control of their buildings' affairs. To some extent, this is a reaction to revelations last year by the Manhattan District Attorney that scores of managing agents, who as a rule mind the day-to-day details, had extorted millions of dollars in kickbacks from vendors.
And since most co-ops are no longer appreciating in value, boards making such mundane decisions are very anxious about how each one -- from approving buyers to deciding the wattage of the new lighting in the elevators -- will affect the value of the apartments.
"It used to be that people would be elected to the board and complete trust would be put in the managing agent to do everything," Ms. Ott said. "Boards today are in a much tougher spot. Expectations and their sense of responsibility are much greater than members have been trained for. I don't know if it is fair to ask volunteers to do this. An enormous amount of people have moved into this form of ownership, and they've been left out to dry."
There has been a certain amount of agitation to have agents licensed -- though, as some point out, even licensed agents might steal if no one watched them. Some owners have broached the more radical notion of having board members licensed. Others argue that it is difficult enough to persuade owners to serve as board members without requiring training and licensing.
On occasion, this shortage of attention and expertise can lead to rude shocks. For years, residents of a midtown co-op allowed a wily and obstinate board president to run their building as if he personally owned it. In fact, he told business associates that he did own it. A few tenants finally started poking around. They discovered that he had been convicted of embezzlement in the late 1970's and served two years in prison. Several other embezzlement cases were pending against him, and there were suspicions that he had defrauded the co-op. A few weeks ago, he was forced to resign. Both the Attorney General and the Manhattan District Attorney have been alerted.
"What I learned is that people living in co-ops don't know anything about co-ops and they run away from responsibilities," said the leader of the movement to expel the president. "I think everybody who lives in a co-op needs to take courses to learn what their rights are. We sit around and grouse, but we don't do anything."
Confusion has been especially rampant in the hundreds of buildings that tumbled into financial distress in recent years, often because of crushing mortgages that had been attached to the buildings by their former owners (some of whom subsequently defaulted on their obligations.) Numerous troubled co-ops are selling at bargain prices and in many cases shares must be bought in cash, because no bank will make loans against them.
The prices of the preponderance of co-ops continue to lag below their peaks of the late 1980's, though Lawrence Sicular, a co-op appraiser, said that the city's elite apartments -- those selling for between $3 million and $10 million -- have attained peak selling prices.
Many disaffected owners have begun looking with greater favor on condominiums, where buyers own their apartments outright and hold joint title to common spaces. The only control boards have over buyers is the right of first refusal, meaning that if they oppose someone the building has to buy the apartment, something that rarely happens. Condominium boards also tend to impose less control over subletting and over how people live within their apartments.
Except at the highest end of the market, brokers say condos sell for appreciably more than comparable co-ops, largely because the co-op board system deters people.
"Co-op boards have such incredible, sweeping power," said I. Dolly Lenz, a senior broker at Sotheby's International Realty. "They have the sort of power that they wouldn't have at I.B.M. They can say someone with green eyes shouldn't get in their building."
 
Control
Courts Backed Boards' Power
Many people, of course, like being able to control who moves in beside them. To some, an inherent allure of a co-op is the opportunity to mold an environment in which everyone is a mirror reflection of themselves. If a resident strays from the fold, they want to be able to curb his behavior, and even punish him. And, indeed, the courts have empowered boards with broad latitude to make their homes as they see fit. Two cases are especially notable.
The first was the 1959 ruling by the Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, in Sidney Weisner v. 791 Park Avenue Corporation. Mr. Weisner, a lawyer, sued after he was rejected by the co-op board at 791 Park Avenue without being given a reason. The court said that as long as members of a co-op do not violate civil rights law, they have total discretion in who they admit "to share their elevators, their common halls and facilities, their stockholders' meetings, their management problems and responsibilities for their homes." Furthermore, the court said that a co-op need not furnish a reason for rejecting someone.
The second key ruling came in a 1990 Appeals Court case, Levandusky v. One Fifth Avenue Apartment Corporation.
Dr. Ronald Levandusky, a plastic surgeon and board member, had received board approval to renovate his apartment. His plans, however, did not show that a two-inch steam pipe in the kitchen was being moved four feet. The board told him that he could not relocate the steam pipe. He did it anyway. When the co-op board halted the work, Dr. Levandusky sued. He argued that the restriction was unreasonable, precipitated by a personal vendetta by a board member whom he had criticized for hooking up a sink in her rooftop greenhouse.
The court, reversing a lower court decision, held that the co-op board was within its powers. It said that co-op boards should be afforded "the greatest possible degree of deference." Furthermore, it said that boards should be subject only to the "business judgment" rule applied by courts to corporate directors, meaning that a co-op board can do as it pleases if it acts in good faith and has the benefit of the entire co-op as its goal.
The court acknowledged that governing boards "may significantly restrict the bundle of rights a property owner normally enjoys." But it added that people always have the freedom not to buy an apartment.
As it happened, the One Fifth Avenue board, whose composition had by now changed, never did require Dr. Levandusky to restore the pipe to its original position. In exchange for agreeing to pay $181,000 of the building's legal fees, he was allowed to keep the pipe where it was.
Dr. Levandusky still does not speak to the board members who fought him. But three years ago, he ran for the board again and was voted in handily. He served until this past April. "It completed the healing process," he said. "It made me feel again that I was respected and worthy as a tenant."
 
Battlegrounds
Who's Making All That Noise?
Now that so much of the city's choicest housing stock is co-ops, the admissions dance between buyer and board has become one of New York's most traumatic and dreaded rituals. Many people would rather face an I.R.S. auditor, or, as one spurned applicant said, "I'd take a firing squad."
Co-op boards can pose any conceivable question to applicants, and do. Marc Luxemburg, a lawyer and president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, an organization that offers guidance to co-ops, says his three favorite questions are those routinely asked by a co-op on West 85th Street: What is the wattage of your stereo? How many C.D.'s and tapes do you own? When were the last three times you saw a lawyer, and why?
A number of real-estate brokers report that boards have gotten far fussier about whom they bless. The Corcoran Group, a large broker, said that it found a rejection rate of 2.5 percent among the 1,010 apartments it sold this year, compared withto 1.1 percent during the depths of the market in 1991 and 1.7 percent during the height in 1988. While those percentages seem tiny, brokers agree that rejections would be much higher without their own meticulous screening to shepherd buyers away from what brokers call a "tough building."
Barbara Corcoran, the head of the Corcoran Group, ascribed the rise in turndowns largely to board queasiness, since the stock market crash, about purchasers reliant on Wall Street and self-employed people.
Subletting, always severely limited, has become an especially raw issue recently. Since the market is slow and boards may not approve buyers, many owners who are in financial trouble desperately need to rent their apartments. While a lot of buildings have relaxed their rules, others have stood firm. "Some people have declared bankruptcy and abandoned apartments because they weren't allowed to sublet," said Vicki Chesler of the New York Cooperator.
No one has taken a tally of the cases, but several lawyers agreed that in recent years there had been a pronounced surge in lawsuits affecting co-ops.
"Twenty years ago, it would be six to eight months between when you saw a co-op decision," said Mr. Luxemburg, of the Council of New York Cooperatives. "Now there are two a week."
During the summer, a member of the board of 1045 Park Avenue went so far as to sue Charles Millard, a city councilman, to compel him to name the shareholders who had complained to him about building code violations in their co-op. The board member wished to inform all the co-op's tenants of their identities. Two weeks ago, the State Supreme Court rebuffed the co-op, declaring that the suit was an "invidious" attempt to make it difficult for the tenants to live peacefully in the building.
In another recently decided lawsuit, a Greenwich Village co-op was granted an injunction forcing a shareholder to give it access to the roof to make repairs, even though the tenant's roof garden would be destroyed. In yet another, a woman was forbidden to let her grandson live in her co-op while she was away, because the board had not approved him. The board noted that he threw a loud party and had a pit bull.
Most often, tenants battle over noise and renovations. It could be any noise. A resident at a Sutton Place co-op declared the whooshing sound of the toilet flushing in the apartment above his unacceptable to his comfort. Attempts at a peacable solution failed. The man recently went to court and asked a judge to actually enjoin the neighbor from flushing his toilet. So far, the judge has demurred and the case has been postponed while the building tries to find a less astringent way to address the bathroom.

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Monday with an article about the co-op apartment market in New York City misstated the number of co-ops in the city in 1984. There were 247,000, not 211,000.


GRAPHIC: In a co-op, tenants don't own their apartments, but shares in the corporation that owns the building. The corporation then leases an apartment to each shareholder, who pays a monthly maintenance that covers a proportional share of the expenses of the building. The building is governed by an elected board of directors, made up of shareholders.
 
THE EARLY YEARS
Chart: "The Co-op: History of a New York Insitution"
The first co-op in New York is thought to be the Tenth Street Studio at 15 West 10th Street, built in 1857 to contain studios, galleries and living space for artists. In the 1880's, Philip Gingembre Hubert, an architect and inventor, conceived of the Hubert Home Clubs as co-ops for those of moderate income, but not enough working class people had the money, and so the home clubs were snapped up by the affluent. In the early 1900's, members of the Finnish community erected two dozen co-ops in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and various labor unions also got into the co-op market.
 
THE 20's
 During the Roaring 20's, the "white glove" co-ops for the wealthy sprang up along Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue. Promoted by Douglas Elliman, a real estate broker, the buildings became the province of the wealthy WASP community, who were intent on keeping out "undesirables" -- namely blacks, Jews and Catholics. The onset of the Depression, however, toppled many co-ops and brought the movement to a standstill.
 
THE POSTWAR YEARS
 The acute need for housing for veterans returning from World War II rejuvenated the concept in the form of government-subsidized complexes. In time, thousands of units aimed at moderate-income tenants were also created under the state Mitchell-Lama program.
 
THE BOOM YEARS
The pivotal moment was the 1980's, when co-ops went mainstream. The easing of rules for conversions in 1982, when the real-estate market was surging, stimulated an explosion in rental buildings being transformed into co-ops. Driving the conversions was the desire of building owners to evade rent control. Moreover, they discovered that they could attach a mortgage to a building and buyers of apartments paid scant heed to it, paying as much for their apartments whether the mortgage was small or large. After all, co-op apartments were appreciating almost by the hour and buyers were untutored in their economics. Some people bought and sold co-ops in a day, gilding their lives with profits in the tens of thousands of dollars.
 
THE LEAN YEARS
When the stock market crashed in October of 1987, the real-estate market began to come apart, and it has remained stagnant in the current queasy economy. In the last few years, the number of co-ops has remained virtually unchanged. Many troubled co-ops are selling at bargain prices and must be bought in cash because no bank will give loans against them.
 
Where the Co-ops Are
Density of co-op apartments in the five boroughs of New York City. Over all, the number of co-op apartments grew from 211,000 in 1984 to 416,000 this year; the growth was especially dramatic in the boroughs outside Manhattan. (pg. B2)

HEADLINE: Getting Into Co-ops: The Money Bias

SERIES: THE HOUSE RULES -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON with N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
They knew they were going to be rejected the second they walked through the door.
"Our other friends had gone before co-op boards, and they said the meeting was just a formality, just a little tete-a-tete to go over the house rules," said the woman, for whom the board interview was supposed to be the last step to acquiring a $275,000 co-op apartment on East 72d Street -- a process that had already cost her and her husband thousands of dollars in bank and legal fees. 
 "But when they opened the door to us," she recalled, "there was a chill. It was businesslike, polite, but I knew: we'd never get out of there alive. They sat us down and started right in on my husband. They said they had a problem with his income."
Before a New Yorker can experience the ambiguous joys of co-op life, there is the matter of getting in -- an exercise that has always tended to be unpleasant, intrusive and exclusionary. But in these days of co-op angst, as the market struggles warily in the wake of the bankruptcies and defaults of the early 1990's, there is widespread agreement that the admissions process has become more onerous than ever before.
Nervous co-op boards, several big brokers report, are rejecting a growing number of applicants outright, though the numbers remain small. But brokers acknowledge that without newly rigorous methods of "screening" applicants, far more would be turned down. And many, many more people are having to wait longer, and to reveal more, as boards probe deeper and deeper into the recesses of their lives, expecially their financial lives. All of which adds up to a new, and increasingly economic, system of discrimination.
To be sure, the traditional "social" strictures -- the right connections, the right religion or ethnicity, the right, or at least not the wrong, way of making a living -- haven't exactly disappeared, especially in the grand old buildings lining Central Park West and Fifth and Park Avenues. (A number of celebrities -- always a dicey group in the high-end co-op world -- can attest to that, including Sean Lennon, son of John, recently turned down at 88 Central Park West, and Steve Wynn, the casino entrepreneur, rejected at 825 Fifth.)
Nor has the socioeconomic structure of the co-op world changed much. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, of virtually all economic groups, have bought co-op apartments in the last 15 years, but co-op residents remain generally wealthier, better educated and -- even accounting for differences in income -- whiter than the city as a whole, according to an analysis of housing data by The New York Times.
But many brokers and other industry experts agree that the old prejudices have lost some of their sting. More than ever, money -- solid, secure money -- is the ultimate arbiter.
"You used to turn in a financial statement and sign it, period," said Joanne Kennedy, co-president of Hunt-Kennedy Real Estate. "Now, the board members add up all the lines to the last decimal, and if it doesn't add up, they impugn the person as either a liar or reckless. It's ridiculous."
Cooperative buildings like to see more and more money; 20 years ago, one building held its board interviews at tea time -- in French. If the prospective shareholder managed that with elan, entrance was taken for granted.
These days, agents say, some buildings (4 East 66th Street; 2 East 67th Street, 820, 834 and 960 Fifth Avenue; 740 and 778 Park Avenue) prefer a net worth of $100 million. Boards for other buildings (720, 730 and 770 Park; 950, 998, 1020, 1030 and 1040 Fifth) like to see $50 million. The run-of-the-mill posh Fifth or Park Avenue co-op looks for a buyer's net worth to total between three and five times the price of the apartment. Off these streets, known as the Gold Coast, buyers usually must show that their long-term debt does not total more than 25 percent of their gross income.
Some buildings do not mind if the money is crisply new; some want it old, with socially prominent ancestors lined up behind it. But no matter if it is a 12-room palace on Park Avenue or a one-bedroom in Park Slope, Brooklyn, boards now want to see the assets already piled up, not merely flowing in. Often, it is the co-op boards for lower-end buildings, without hefty reserve funds, that worry the most: one defaulting shareholder can tip a building into the red.
According to a statistician at the Corcoran Group, which reported a turndown rate of 2.5 percent among the deals it handled this year, compared with 1.1 percent during the depths of the market in 1991, the majority of board turndowns on apartments that cost more than $1 million are for "social" reasons. The vast majority of the rest are financial; since the stock market crash in 1987, boards have become increasingly queasy about stockbrokers and entrepreneurs.
Scott Warshaw, a managing agent with Midboro Management, agreed that board turndowns were rising, at least partly because boards felt an increasing number of apartments were selling too cheaply and would therefore lower the value of others.
All this talk about money and apartment values particularly annoys brokers in the business long enough to know when and how certain board members came to buy their own apartments.
"It really galls me to see these guys, who bought their own apartments for $35,000 or $40,000 decades ago, who are sitting there clipping food coupons so they can afford to pay the monthly maintenance bills," one broker said, requesting anonymity out of fear of reprisals by co-op boards. "They're passing judgment on lovely families who can afford a $3 million apartment -- and finding them wanting. It's a joke."
 
A Private Club
Screening Process And Possible Bias
 A co-op, essentially, is a private club. And so the courts have ruled that boards may turn down anyone they want, as long as no one can prove they have broken laws barring discrimination on the basis of things like race, sex, sexual orientation, age, religion, disability or lawful occupation. And since boards also do not have to give reasons for their decisions, illegal discrimination is almost impossible to prove.
What this system produces is a world that is considerably more homogeneous than the city at large. The most striking finding of the housing data, based on the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey for 1993, is the racial imbalance. While 48 percent of New Yorkers are white, 77 percent of co-op owners are white. Although blacks make up 23 percent of the city's population, they account for just 6 percent of co-op owners. In Manhattan, the percentage drops to less than 2 percent. On the Upper East Side, a negligible number of blacks live in co-ops.
Even among New Yorkers of similar means, the analysis indicated, whites are more likely to own co-ops than nonwhites, especially at the upper income levels. Among homeowners with annual incomes of between $99,999 and $199,999, 44 percent owned co-ops, compared with 11 percent of blacks, 27 percent of Asian-Americans and 18 percent of Hispanic people.
Given the secrecy allowed co-op boards, the precise anatomy of each board's widely differing admissions process cannot be known. Still, most brokers agree that while an applicant's bottom lines have gained more importance than ever, old-fashioned discrimination still comes into play in some buildings. Often, though, it is camouflaged in more socially acceptable ways.
A young Jewish family may be welcomed in a Park Avenue building one week, and the next month, a remarkably similar family is rejected -- because of an unwritten quota. Blacks seldom apply to the poshest buildings -- and when they do, are almost never rejected. Some buildings have no problem with openly gay couples; another may prefer to see a man and woman married before they approve them.
In most cases, applicants are "screened" by brokers, not only for money but frequently also for religion, ethnicity and sexual preference. (The term "steering," which is illegal, is never used.)
"Absolutely, there are buildings that don't want kids, and there are buildings with clear ethnic preferences and clear racial preferences, and the brokers know where to take people," said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, a group that represents co-op boards.
As part of this screening, applicants are handed a "reverse directory," a list of all occupants of the desired building, and asked if they recognize any friends -- or perhaps more important, any enemies. If there is doubt, board members are sounded out.
"If there are any questions, it's always better to lay your deck on the table," said Roger Erickson, a senior vice president at William B. May Real Estate. "We sometimes ask the seller to 'run it by' a board member -- nothing formal. If I get a question mark, I'll go to the customer and tell him it's not a green light."
Still, there is a consensus that, for whatever reason, things have improved. Though blacks simply do not apply to many buildings, brokers point to co-ops that accepted their first blacks in the last five years -- 834 Fifth, which welcomed Reginald Lewis, who until his death owned Beatrice Foods, and 1158 Fifth, home to Sidney Poitier.
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said that there are still anti-Semitic buildings but Jews avoid them. "The community is comfortable enough that they can say: 'They don't want me. I won't go there.' "
Brokers point to buildings that were once all-white Anglo-Saxon Protestant and are now run by a Jewish board of directors -- and they add that those can be some of the worst anti-Semitic buildings. "It's often surprising to brokers when a predominantly Jewish building turns down a Jewish applicant," said Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group. "There is a sense that the board doesn't wish to be labeled a 'Jewish building' or that they have already reached their quota."
One broker even refers to himself as a Kremlinologist as he tries to keep track of who's in and who's not.
Mike Wallace, the "60 Minutes" host, was rejected at 770 Park. Ron Perelman, the financier, was turned down at 820 Fifth, 834 Fifth and 4 East 66th Street. Madonna and Barbra Streisand were rejected, too. The biggest surprise, according to brokers, was Mr. Lennon, who was rejected from his mother's building.
"Garmentos," brokers' slang for people in the clothing business, including the dress designer Carolyne Roehm (rejected from 131 East 66th Street), are out in certain buildings. "Loud" entertainers are out. Politicians are frowned upon. Those with bodyguards need not apply.
A co-op board's scrutiny can extend to mundane minutiae. Charles Rappaport, president of a co-op in Flushing, Queens, said his building's interview committee wants to see everyone who is going to live there, "including babes in arms." The board uses an outside investigator and insists on a home visit. "We want to know," he said, "is it dirty? Is it sloppy?"
In Manhattan, some boards, including the one at 870 United Nations Plaza, will commission an investigation known as the Bishop's Report, which costs between $1,500 and $2,000, agents say; a Pinkerton's investigation costs $500.
Each board has its own unwritten rules: no big dogs at 336 West End Avenue; no shopping carts in the lobby of the Majestic on Central Park West; applicants must provide a letter detailing community service at 870 United Nations Plaza.
At 431 West 54th Street, tenants had become perturbed by smoke that seeped into their apartments from smokers who were subletting. When a five-pack-a-day smoker applied last year, the board rejected him and decided to go smoke-free.
 
Rights and Death
Gay Residents And Succession
 One day last spring, a 36-year-old gay man with a growing reputation for designing glossy magazines, was forced to listen to a discussion of his life -- and his death -- through the paper-thin walls of a managing agent's office.
"They stupidly put me in a conference room next to where they were meeting," said the man, who asked that his name not be used for fear of alienating his neighbors. "They began what I can only term a very homophobic discussion. The whole thing was based upon what would happen if I were going to die. It's a very sensitive subject -- like all gay people have AIDS, all people with AIDS are going to die.
"It was fascinating, listening to them through those walls, how cavalier they were with my life. It felt incredibly un-American."
The door opened, and the board members shook his hand, "like I was coming to an interview at Harvard or Princeton." If he died, they asked, what would happen to his apartment? Would his companion of 11 years want to live there? Would he be able to afford it?
He said he was bequeathing his apartment -- and his considerable wealth -- to his friend. How, he was asked, was the board to know his relatives would not contest the will? In the end, both men signed a letter, agreeing that if the wealthier man died, the other man would reapply, as if he were a new applicant.
Some rejected candidates threaten to sue, then find out there is almost no chance of winning. A few go to the state's Division of Human Rights or the city's Human Rights Commission. In the last fiscal year, only 13 complaints of co-op board discrimination were filed with the city; most are still under investigation. The state does not break down cases geographically.
 
Rejections
Getting Through Board Interviews
 The couple who were rejected from the East 72d Street co-op said their broker had assured them that they were "perfect for the building." They walked into the interview on a Friday last February -- she in her "beautiful red jacket," he in a sport coat and tie, "like lambs to the slaughter," recalled the woman, who, for fear of being rejected again, asked that she be identified only as Paula B.
"There were only two of them, and it was held in the woman's apartment," she said. "She's there with another, older gentlemen. They started off with the question about David's salary."
Her husband owns a sizable piece of his family's construction business. The year before last, he made only $32,000. She makes more than $100,000 as an advertising executive at a woman's magazine. They had enough cash in the bank to buy the apartment three times over, they said.
"We wouldn't have had a problem if it was the other way around," she said. "If he had made $100,000 and I had been the little housewife, they would have praised me for being so noble for me to work and contribute."
The interrogation lurched onward. "You say you spent $10,000 a year on meals in New York City -- I find that unrealistically low," the woman said she was asked.
"I replied that we don't have kids, and it doesn't cost that much to live if you're not eating at Lutece every night," Mrs. B. said, adding, "At this point, I could tell she really didn't like me."
The board member then asked what synagogue the couple belonged to, they said. "We didn't want to answer the question," Mr. B said. "I thought it was inappropriate. I knew they couldn't legally ask that, but we were in a vulnerable position. I knew if I didn't answer, we wouldn't get the apartment."
He muttered something about going with his mother to the family synagogue in Westchester, and the two interviewers moved to a new subject: the couple's current apartment. "Oh, we have a lovely apartment," the wife answered enthusiastically. At last, she said she thought, she was on safe ground. "We love it."
"Then why do you want to leave it?" the female board member snapped.
The interview lasted an hour. On Monday, the broker called to give them the bad news.
The couple appealed to the State Human Rights Division, which held a preliminary conference based on the question about the synagogue. But when the female board member volunteered that she herself was Jewish -- despite her looks and Irish-sounding name -- "the case just kind of evaporated," the couple said. The state found no probable cause for their complaint.
That was in mid-March. The couple have just started looking for another apartment. They are looking at co-ops. "What else?" Mrs. B. said, shrugging. "All the buildings we want to live in are co-ops."
 
Stalling Tactics
Black Applicants And Qualifications
 Hal Harris is a black real estate broker who sold co-ops from 1987 to 1993, when he became so discouraged he switched to commercial spaces. When he was selling co-ops, he said, he saw a half-dozen fully qualified black applicants rejected or stalled by co-op boards until they gave up.
"They delay until your bank commitment expires," Mr. Harris explained. "They know you have 90 days on your loan commitment. So they say the integral board member is out of town. Next month, they say the recording secretary is out. They stall and stall until it's too late."
Confronted with months of the same delays, Abbey Lincoln, the singer, who is black, gave up, feeling herself a victim of racism.
Ms. Lincoln had kept asking for an interview at the building on Riverside Drive so she could explain her finances. Singers, like models and artists, have complex income tax documents, with many, many deductions, giving them a relatively small taxable income. But the board would not budge.
"I just said, 'That's it -- I'm through,' " she said, tossing her many braids with spirit. "They never did reject me exactly, but they let it be known they weren't going to accept me. They kept coming back and back, asking me for more information."
A year and a half later, by coincidence, the president of the building's board happened to visit Judy Maysles, the real estate agent who had represented Ms. Lincoln.
"We started chatting, and I told him I was mad at him for what he did to Abby," Ms. Maysles said. "He admitted he'd been against her, but he said it wasn't because she was black; it was because of her income. It turned out the apartment was still available, and we were able to write a cover letter stating her total income and reorganize the financials, and she was accepted."
Ms. Lincoln no longer thinks it was racism. Or does she? "Everybody discriminates against someone, don't they?" she said. "At my old building on St. Nicholas and 157th Street, they discriminated against Hispanics.
"Isn't that just life?"

HEADLINE: MERGERS FOR YEAR APPROACH RECORD

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
This year's wave of mergers and acquisitions in the United States is poised to set a record, continuing a feverish pace of global business consolidation that during 1994 and 1995 could see as many companies swallowed up as during the last three years of the 1980's, the decade of the takeover.
According to the Securities Data Corporation, American mergers and acquisitions thus far this year were near $346 billion yesterday, just shy of the record $347.1 billion completed during all of last year. 
 D. Scott Lindsay, the co-head of mergers and acquisitions at CS First Boston, estimated that worldwide mergers and acquisitions could reach $800 billion this year, with a two-year total of $1.3 trillion. The $653.4 billion in global deals done so far this year is already a record.
In many ways, the deals announced so far this week are typical of many transactions this year. Yesterday, Softkey International, a software company, announced it was making an $800 million bid for two makers of education software. On Sunday, Praxair, an industrial gases spinoff from Union Carbide, said it planned a hostile $2.1 billion bid for a rival. And Comcast agreed to buy the cable television operations of E. W. Scripps for $1.58 billion.
While the entertainment, drug, banking and media industries have dominated center stage this year, the range of companies involved in acquisitions has touched all sectors of the economy, even the once somnolent utilities.
What many of the acquirers have in common is a new willingness, even by blue-chip companies, to engage in hostile takeovers, making this year the biggest for such deals since 1988. There is also a desire to capitalize on the strong performance of the stock market by financing deals with shares that are steadily rising in price.
"So long as the stock market stays at record highs, it's a great time for companies to do stock deals," said Samuel C. Butler, the managing partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a law firm that has one of the leading practices in advising on mergers and acquisitions.
Other factors contributing to the deal-making boom include a perception of a looser regulatory environment and a sense that in a period of a slow-growth economy, business expansion can best be achieved by acquiring competitors. Deals also can be a way to satisfy pushy investors who want the reduced costs and better earnings that can be achieved in some mergers.
"Strategic, not financial, issues are behind most deals that have been done over the last two years," said Willard J. Overlock Jr., the head of global mergers and acquisitions at Goldman, Sachs, which brokered $93.7 billion of deals through the first three quarters of this year.
Wall Street is benefiting from the fees for the deals, even if more competition means the business is not quite as lucrative as it was in the 1980's. The broader economic benefit from the consolidation, however, is still being debated.
"There are people who like to read a variety of sinister implications into this sort of activity, but I just don't see it," said Robert Crandall, an economist at the Brookings Institute in Washington. "If in fact combined firms become more efficient by paring labor in the short term so that in the long term they do better, then I would think that's good for everyone in the long run."
This year's burst of activity is changing the corporate landscape. With the $7.5 billion acquisition of CBS, Westinghouse will metamorphose into a media company. The pending $488 million acquisition of the Washington Electric Company by Puget Sound Power and Light weds an electric company and a provider of natural gas.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company's name will disappear when it is absorbed in the $5.3 billion merger with Union Pacific. Chemical Banking will give up its name in its $10 billion merger with Chase Manhattan. And with these and other corporate disappearances, thousands of jobs will also vanish as costs are cut to make the deals pay off.
It is too early to say whether the deals of the 1990's will be more successful than those of the last decade. But in some important respects they are different. The deals of this decade seem to be aimed more at strategic partnerships than at making a fat and fast return on an investment, which was the goal of many done in the late 1980's. And the deals may be resting on a better financial foundation because more of them are being financed with cash or stock than with borrowed money.
Many factors have led to the record-setting pace of deals, but one of the key ones has been the rally in the stock market, which has sent the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks up 27 percent this year.
This jump has given many corporations a powerful currency to spend -- their own high-priced shares. Wells Fargo, for example, was able to offer to pay roughly three times the $3.5 billion book value, or $10 billion, to buy First Interstate at least in part because its stock at the time it made its hostile bid in mid-October had appreciated almost 50 percent since the beginning of the year.
In addition, competition is putting pressure on pricing and costs. Thus, the prospect of cost savings -- often corporate America's euphemism for layoffs -- has spurred a lot of deals. Chemical and Chase Manhattan plan to shed 12,000 employees worldwide, while the chief executive of Kimberly Clark, which paid $7 billion for Scott Paper, has promised Wall Street a "significant staff reduction" in the companies' combined work force of 57,000.
Also, aggressive investors are increasingly focusing managements' attention on enhancing shareholder value. Michael Price, head of Heine Securities and a major owner of Chase's stock, was instrumental in forcing the Chemical-Chase merger by demanding that Chase move quickly to improve the value of its shares, which had been languishing. "When there is inadequate performance, their investors are quick to let their unhappiness be unknown," said Bruce D. Fiedorek, head of the worldwide mergers and acquisitions group at Morgan Stanley, which has been the No. 1 deal maker so far this year.
Plus, investors seem more willing to recognize the potential cost savings and synergies of a deal when it is announced. In the past, the price of an acquiring company's shares fell while the shares of the target company jumped. But in many of the deals this year, both the acquirer's stock and the stock of the target gained after the announcement. The stock of Wells Fargo jumped 7 percent, to $229 a share, when it announced on Oct. 18 its bid to buy First Interstate, whose stock also rose, climbing 32 percent to close at $140.25.
This more favorable reception may be one reason blue-chip companies have adopted the hostile takeover, once the exclusive province of buyout firms and corporate raiders, and its less controversial cousin, the "bear hug," or an offer too good to resist, as an acquisition strategy. I.B.M.'s hostile offer for Lotus Development seems to have legitimized the practice, paving the way for Johnson & Johnson, that gentle corporate giant famous for making baby shampoo, to make an unsolicited bid for Cordis.
According to Securities Data, the percentage of hostile deals, in terms of dollar volume, has risen to 14 percent this year from just under 6 percent in 1993. The dollar total of about $49 billion is second to 1988, when $127 billion, or 38 percent, of the deals were hostile.
And Mr. Fiedorek said American companies were increasingly exporting the hostile takeover to the European market, where International Paper made an unwanted offer for Holvis, a Swiss paper and medical materials manufacturer; ARCO went after Aran Energy of Dublin, and Amoco tried to buy Home Oil of Alberta, Canada.
As corporate America has become more aggressive, corporate raiders have begun to resurface. Kirk Kerkorian is goading Chrysler to sell out to him, while Carl C. Icahn has teamed up with Bennett S. LeBow to prod RJR Nabisco into selling its tobacco holdings.
In the entertainment business, regulatory changes that broke the barriers separating the producers and distributors of programming led to the biggest deal of the year so far, Walt Disney's $19 billion acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC. That spawned a host of similar deals, the last of which was Time Warner's proposed $7.5 billion purchase of Turner Broadcasting.
Slow economic growth has encouraged companies to combine in hopes of increasing revenue growth. Glaxo's $14 billion acquisition of Wellcome was an effort to increase its growth rate by combining two fairly stagnant streams of revenue and eliminating overlapping jobs and functions to bolster the combined company's growth.
While the lawyers and investment bankers who orchestrate mergers and acquisitions have definitely benefited from the elevated level of activity in the market, the business is not as lucrative as it once was. In part this is because the percentage a firm gets on a deal of more than $1 billion is lower than on smaller deals. Plus on larger deals, many companies are hiring more than one investment bank to represent them, which pushes fees down.
And since most deals these days lack the combativeness that marked the takeovers of the 1980's, lawyers are also making less. "The business today is a lot better than 1991 and 1992, but it isn't the bonanza that it was in the 1980's," Mr. Butler, the Cravath, Swaine partner, said.
To be sure, deal brokers are quick to add that the mergers and acquisitions business is difficult to predict. But they contend that the business has reached a new level of magnitude that is here to stay. "Worldwide, the dollar volume of deals done in the early 1980's was between $20 billion and $40 billion," Mr. Lindsay of CS First Boston said. "My sense is that, globally, the market today is somewhere between $400 billion and $800 billion."

HEADLINE: Mexican Markets Applaud Plan for Economy

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Mexico's economic managers got the initial reaction they wanted today as financial markets responded favorably to a new recovery plan to revive the battered economy.
The Mexican stock exchange, which lost ground through most of October, roared back, gaining 4.57 percent, its biggest one-day gain since July. The market's main index shot up 102.27 points, to close at 2,348.64, as investors expressed confidence that the broad package of tax cuts, business incentives and fiscal restraints announced on Sunday would help Mexico break the hold of a recession that has turned out to be far deeper and more durable than expected. 
 The peso also rebounded after dropping last week. In late trading today, it sold at 6.925 to the dollar, or 14.44 cents, a gain of about 2 percent over Friday's rate.
Mexico customarily announces such significant economic policies on Sundays to leave some time for officials to shape reaction before the markets reopen for business. But they cannot control the longer view of investors and analysts.
Thus, while initial reaction was positive, there was a clear sense today that by itself the new package of incentives would not be sufficient to restore the investor confidence Mexico lost after a disastrous devaluation of the peso last December.
"The incentives are not a magic solution," said Mario Dehesa, director of Macro Asesoria Economica, an economic consulting firm here. "The stimuli will have a significant effect not in the short term, but more likely in the midterm."
Mexican business leaders were reluctant last week to sign another of the periodic pacts through which the Government has shaped its economic policies since 1987. Today, they wholeheartedly endorsed its business tax cuts and investment tax write-offs. That enthusiasm also brought a favorable reaction among investors and analysts in the United States, as well. American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico rose 87.5 cents, to $28.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. Prices of Mexican closed-end funds were up, too.
John F. H. Purcell, managing director of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers in New York, said, "The apparent broadness of the agreement is seen as very positive," adding that the tax breaks on corporate investment and the elimination of the sales tax on new cars would help stimulate Mexico's economy.
But he was worried about the lack of a firm exchange-rate policy and said investors would need to see signs of growth by the middle of next year. "They will only wait so long before throwing up their hands and saying that Mexico is simply a no-growth country," Mr. Purcell said.
At a news conference today, Mexican officials said the exchange rate would continue to float freely, but they left unclear what level they expected it to reach next year. Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz refused to say what target rate was used to calculate assumptions for the 20 percent inflation and 3 percent growth in the gross domestic product that the plan projects for 1996.
Mr. Ortiz said such a reference rate would be made public next month when the Government presented its budget to Congress.
He also said futures contracts on pesos now being sold in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were poor indicators of what would happen to the exchange rate. Contracts now being sold for delivery in September 1996 call for an exchange rate of 10 pesos to the dollar.
But Alejandro Valenzuela, the Government's chief spokesman for the recovery programs, acknowledged that estimates of export growth for 1996 were based on what officials hoped would be a strengthening of the peso next year over this year. Exports, excluding services, are expected to grow 12 percent in peso terms, but 18 to 20 percent in dollar terms -- which, if true, would indicate that the peso will be stronger than it is today.

HEADLINE: Republican Bills on Health Bow to Wishes of Doctors

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB 

 BODY:
For years, many doctors practiced their profession in a cut-and-dried way: they hung out shingles and tended to their patients.
But the Medicare and Medicaid measures working their way through Congress could remold the role of many doctors, turning them into medical entrepreneurs and permitting them to engage in business enterprises that are now forbidden. The legislation is an important victory for the American Medical Association after years in which doctors have complained about losses of income and authority in the age of managed care. 
 The House version of the legislation would allow doctors to start physician-run health groups without the financial and regulatory requirements that states impose on similar organizations. Instead, the House bill would authorize development of new Federal regulations to police the doctors.
The bill could also make it easier for doctors to set prices in ways that now violate antitrust rules. It, along with the Senate version, would let doctors charge some Medicare recipients higher fees then they can now. And it would permit local medical groups to define standards in ways that Government officials say would curb competition and raise prices to patients.
President Clinton has threatened to veto the bills, making the future of these provisions uncertain. Before the President gets a bill, the House and Senate also have to compromise on their differences.
The House bill, more than the Senate version, reflects the lobbying efforts of the A.M.A. But both bills would help doctors do battle with managed care organizations and earn money in new ways.
"This is not about dollars; it's about control," Dr. Lonnie R. Bristow, president of the A.M.A., said in an interview, referring to many provisions. "It will give physicians an opportunity to come together and compete with the large insurance companies and corporate managed care entities."
Patient care will improve, he said, because decisions will be made by doctors and patients unencumbered by restrictions from private managed care groups. Those groups pay doctors a fixed fee for the care of a patient and often prohibit or discourage treatments deemed to be ineffective or too expensive.
Republicans argue that in place of fee restrictions and other Government regulations, a hotly competitive market for Medicare and Medicaid dollars will hold down prices and improve benefits.
But consumer groups and top antitrust officials say many changes would be disastrous for patients, potentially leading to higher fees, poorer care and a fraying of trust, with patients questioning whether doctors are making decisions for economic rather than medical reasons.
"One of the fundamental elements of health care is a personal relationship, a human relationship, which can't be quantified," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, the advocacy group. "This represents the corporatization or commodification of medical care, if you will."
The Republican legislation would, over seven years, cut more than $440 billion in anticipated growth from the budgets of Medicare, which serves 37 million elderly people, and Medicaid, which covers almost as many poor and disabled people, and nursing home residents.
Doctors would absorb billions in losses in projected income, according to Congressional estimates.
For the A.M.A., which endorsed the House Republican plan days before its passage, the lobbying effort centered not only on trying to limit the losses, but also on extending the ability of doctors to operate as entrepreneurs and curtailing their liability in cases of malpractice and suspected fraud and abuse.
The group succeeded most strikingly in the House legislation, which relaxes restrictions on doctors' ability to operate laboratories and own companies that they can refer patients to, heightens the Government's burden of proof in fraud and abuse cases and limits punitive malpractice awards.
 
Doctors Push Insurers Back
 Most significant, many experts say, the House legislation gives doctors the opportunity to start their own health plans, physician service networks, without having to put up the capital reserves or meet the detailed mandates often required by states of managed care companies.
These networks would be exempt from state regulations on quality standards, appeals processes for patients and monetary reserves, which are intended to insure that plans have enough money to cover expensive treatment.
The House bill would have these groups regulated by the Federal Government rather than by states, where restrictions by insurance departments have often limited the ability of doctors to compete. The Senate version would require the doctors' groups to apply for licenses from the states, but gives them the right to go to the Federal level if they do not receive approval in 90 days or if they are rejected under regulations deemed to be at variance with the Federal ones.
"I think that's the Normandy Invasion by the providers to try to roll back the insurance industry's growing role in health care," said Lynn Etheredge, head of the health care staff at the Office of Management and Budget in the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan Administrations.
Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, said this provision, as well as others, would allow doctors to reassert themselves after humbling years in which the advent of cost-cutting managed care companies led to a loss of autonomy and often of income, as well.
By operating their own managed care groups and benefiting from the relaxation of many regulations, doctors, he said, "will move to the head of the food chain."
 
Making a Business Out of Healing
 Under the plans, doctors would start a network, typically through a community hospital or county or state medical society, and offer services to Medicare recipients. The networks would receive a fixed rate for each member from the Federal Government. From this, it would administer the patients' care, keeping any money left over, but also running the risk of having to pay expenses that run beyond the Government contributions.
Several doctors health plans along these lines have already been started around the country.
In addition, under both the House and Senate bills, doctors would be free to set their fees for certain patients -- those who receive care outside their networks or who pay for care under the traditional fee-for-service arrangement. Currently, doctors are allowed to charge a maximum of 115 percent of what Medicare deems a fair price in such situations.
This provision was vehemently attacked by consumer groups, but Republicans argued that the increased competition fostered by the legislation would help hold down fees and make price controls unnecessary.
Howard B. Shapiro, director of public policy for the American College of Physicians, the professional organization of internists that strongly opposed the broad legislation, said the network proposal would help encourage preventive medicine. And he added that unlike standard managed care plans, the doctor-run plans would not "take out of the system the marketing and shareholder percentages that are lost to health care."
Insurers and managed care companies oppose the legislation, fearing that it will give doctors an unfair advantage by exempting them from regulations they say should apply to everyone.
Consumer groups warn that if the doctors' networks do not have to adhere to strict standards, like putting up substantial capital reserves, they will invite scandals similar to ones that afflicted California 20 years ago. There, many health maintenance organizations with meager capital reserves went bankrupt and left patients stranded.
The groups also argue that the new networks will make doctors responsible for care and put them on the line for expensive procedures that could damage them financially.
"All the concern about overtreatment when doctors were paid a fee for every service they performed is matched by a concern for undertreatment here," said Cathy L. Hurwit, legislative director of Citizens Action, an advocacy group.
Predictions vary widely about the financial potential of the networks.
"They have an enormous marketing advantage," Professor Reinhardt said of doctors. "They can literally market their plans in the examination room."
But Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health securities analyst with Sanford S. Bernstein & Company, noted that good doctors were often not good businessmen. "They have no chance of making it, but they want to have a chance," he said dryly.
Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the George Bush Administration, said that after years of doctors complaining about H.M.O.'s, "this is an attempt to say, 'All right, guys, put your money where your mouths have been.' "
 
Regulations Are Wiped Away
 Doctors would also be helped by two changes in antitrust laws in the House bill.
One would allow medical societies and other professional groups to write standards "designed to promote the quality of health care services provided to patients." Many doctors maintain such standards are necessary for patient safety.
But in a letter to Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Anne K. Bingaman, who heads the Justice Department's antitrust division, warned that under the guise of protecting quality care, local medical societies have in the past -- and could again in the future -- write standards that in reality are intended to squelch competition.
Such standards, they wrote, have been used to enforce "broad restraints on price competition, policies that inhibited the development of managed care organizations, and concerted refusals to deal with providers or organizations that represented a competitive threat to physicians."
The second provision would exempt doctors in networks who set fees together from a rule that would hold such activity on its face to be illegal price-fixing, unless the doctors have a financial relationship.
Instead, the Government would have to consider each case independently. Dr. Bristow of the A.M.A. said the change would simply require a review of individual situations. "If it is anticompetitive, that's what they should say," he said.
But consumer groups fear that the Government would not have the time or personnel to consider every case. Ms. Bingaman and Mr. Pitofsky described such price setting as a "naked restraint on competition."
Dr. Bristow said that in the end the various provisions would allow the doctor-patient relationship to flourish. Professor Reinhardt, who has worked with the A.M.A. in the past, disagreed. "This thing of physicians becoming corporate entrepreneurs may very well tarnish their image," he said, referring to the many changes that would help doctors.
"When they pass around the cookie plate and you take two cookies, no one will say anything, but it will hurt your image."

HEADLINE: Washington Journal;
For City's Strays, a New Life of Sorts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The District of Columbia is still going to the dogs, and for once in this financially strapped city, that's good news.
Hours after the Washington Humane Society shut down the capital's largest animal shelter today rather than allow the city to run up a tab for animal control services that has reached nearly $400,000, another private concern, Animal Link Inc., agreed to take over the shelter. 
 That not only assured that as many as 80 stray dogs and 30 cats could be housed at one time in the safety, if not comfort, of steel-fence cages, it also meant that workers would continue picking up stray animals deemed to be too dangerous or too aggressive to leave roaming the streets.
Still, the sudden change in management underscores what has happened to many city contractors in Washington because the city cannot pay its bills. After hanging on for months, looking for the city's check in the mail, the Humane Society finally gave up. Its officials spent the last few days relocating the animals to other shelters before closing their doors this morning and turning people away.
John Allem, a spokesman for Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., said the District of Columbia still owed private vendors about $140 million, after paying off part of the $322 million of debt the Barry Administration says it inherited from the previous Mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly.
Mary Healy, executive director of the Humane Society, said problems for the shelter began earlier this year after city officials stopped signing yearlong contracts in favor of short-term deals, some for as brief as five days.
"It became increasingly difficult to hire and maintain a staff," said Ms. Healy, who once had a staff of 30 full-time and part-time workers. "But how can you hire someone if you can't tell them they'll have a job five days from now?"
The change is, at least, an encouraging development for abandoned pets. Ms. Healy said that about 60 percent of the dogs and cats that reached the shelter were returned to their owners, and 20 percent were adopted by others. The remainder are put to death.
 
These Mean Streets
 Among businesses large and small hurt by the city's inability to pay its bills, Ebone Inc. provides a bleak example of trickle-down economics as it works these days in Washington.
Ebone, a minority-owned construction company that has repaired city streets, gutters and sidewalks for 17 years -- and once grossed $9 million in annual revenue -- is nearly out of business. Belle Vee Gentry, the owner, said the unpaid bills had caused her to fall behind in her taxes and to dismiss all but four of the company's 75 employees.
The Internal Revenue Service has notified her that on Wednesday it plans to seize her fleet of trucks and other heavy equipment, worth about $500,000. Some of her former employees, she said, have turned to illegal activities because they cannot find other jobs to support their families.
She blamed the District government for withholding more than $2.4 million for work completed and the Federal Government, particularly President Clinton, for not doing more to protect local businesses from poor management by the city.
"I'm losing everything I worked for, and people's lives have been destroyed," Ms. Gentry said, citing $460,000 owed her for work completed this year and another $2 million for previous projects.
"We have gone from solvency to total insolvency," she continued. "My family has been devastated. It's terrible, and I just can't understand how the Government can let the nation's capital fall."
Ms. Gentry said she would sue the city if she had the money to hire a lawyer.
 
From Darkness to Light
 When the Potomac Electric Power Company sold the city's street-light system to the District government 10 years ago, it signed a maintenance contract promising to keep the city properly lighted.
But with the contract expired and the city this month paying off only $8 million of an $11.8 million debt, the utility stopped replacing burned-out bulbs along Washington's streets and alleys. That caught the attention of Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose interest in helping the city recover stems in part from his concern over public safety.
An aide to Mr. Gingrich called John Derrick, president of the utility, and prevailed on the company to replace the dead bulbs. As a result, the utility dispatched work crews last Friday night, and they worked through the weekend, making dark streets light. Nancy Moses, a spokeswoman for the company, said crews would be sent out another three nights this week to finish the job.
In return, Ms. Moses said, the city has promised to pay off its debt this week and enter into a new maintenance contract.

HEADLINE: Peace in the Balkans Now Depends On the Man Who Fanned Its Wars

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia

 BODY:
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, is often to be found padding through the cavernous presidency building in Belgrade, alone except for a single faithful aide.
"He's the only person you ever see there," said an American official who has conversed a great deal with Mr. Milosevic of late. "It's eerie the way he rattles around the building. Once he wandered into a side room and muttered about never having been in it before. Sometimes you ask yourself: Is there anyone else in this country?" 
 It is a pertinent question. Eight years after he seized power by exhorting Serbs to rise against perceived past injustices and create a "Greater Serbia," and four years after the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction began, Mr. Milosevic stands alone. He seems close to the end of a labyrinthine political journey that has left his ragtag band of former nationalist allies and his former country devastated.
What remains is one man's almost uncontested personal power in Serbia, and his remorseless quest for the renewed international respectability that would vindicate him.
Mr. Milosevic's visit to the United States for the peace talks that are to start on Wednesday in Dayton, Ohio, brings him closer than ever to that goal. For a long time, he has yearned to set foot in America. It is the closest thing to the fulfillment of an obsession: He is given to reminiscences of the "wonderful smells of New York" and the charms of the Drake Hotel, a regular haunt during his stint as president of a major Belgrade bank.
But even as he emerges from isolation, cast in the role of peacemaker, this man of jutting jaw and shifting tactics seems haunted by his past.
Now seen by western powers as a key figure in the quest for peace in the Balkans, Mr. Milosevic is also the man most identified with the descent of Yugoslavia into war.
Like shadows, the wars of Croatia and Bosnia, their bloodshed and their atrocities, keep darkening his path, even as he charms dignitary after dignitary with good humor, good English and apparent good will.
This month the dignitary was Richard C. Holbrooke, Assistant Secretary of State who is chief American envoy to the Balkans; the atrocities were those reportedly carried out in northwest Bosnia by Zeljko Raznatovic, the Serbian paramilitary leader known as Arkan.
Between Oct. 6 and 12, half of an estimated 2,000 Muslim men who had been detained in the area were killed. Mr. Holbrooke's question was simple: Can't you control Arkan?
The response, American officials said, was outraged protestation. Not only could he not control Arkan, Mr. Milosevic insisted, but the paramilitary leader would probably kill him if he had a chance. "Arkan is my sworn enemy," an official quoted Mr. Milosevic as saying.
The reply was consistent. Through 42 months of war in Bosnia he has held fast to his position: Bosnia is another country. To link him with killing or genocide there, Mr. Milosevic told BBC television recently, "is really out of all consideration."
 
America Good; Russian Meat Bad
 The case of Arkan is, however, difficult to reconcile with Mr. Milosevic's claims. An intelligence report carried by Mr. Holbrooke, for example, confirmed that Arkan was already in the employ of the Serbian security services in the late 1980's.
But Mr. Milosevic is a persuasive man. He exudes power; he wants peace now; he likes America. He can also be witty. When an American official recently asked about Russian "humanitarian aid" for Serbia, Mr. Milosevic scoffed: "Humanitarian aid? You mean some meat we had to bury because it was radioactive and some biscuits manufactured in 1969?" His pronunciation of "biscuits" is "bis-kweets."
This bonhomie alternates with a frozen stoniness. When 170,000 Serbs were chased from the Krajina in August, he remained silent and distant. He is apt to set his jaw, narrow his shrewd eyes and wave away the carnage of Bosnia. The basic message is: These Bosnian Serbs are crazy, so what can I do?
Robert Frasure, the American diplomat who died in an accident near Sarajevo last August and dealt extensively with the Serbian President, once said he was reminded of "a Mafia boss who desperately wants to get out of the business."
Mr. Milosevic has been trying since mid-1993 to put the tidal wave of Serbian nationalism he orchestrated and the accompanying destruction of Yugoslavia behind him. His conclusion that diplomacy could achieve his ends -- described by one American official as "Greater Serbia Lite" -- is what now makes him central to American diplomacy.
"Forced to choose between Greater Serbia and Greater Slobo, there is no doubt where Milosevic has come down," said one western diplomat. "He now sees Serbia as a prosperous little eastern gateway to Europe, and he needs peace to secure that."
Over the last several months, moreover, Mr. Milosevic has delivered. He has forced the Bosnian Serbs to line up behind him and begin serious peace negotiations. And American officials say he has promised that, in the event of a peace, elections would oust the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and the Serbs' military leader, Ratko Mladic, would be removed.
The removal of these men, closely identified with the massacre of Muslims, is almost certainly vital if any Bosnian peace is to last and any hope remains of patching Bosnia together again.
Thus Mr. Milosevic has an important role, if he can be taken at his word. But if General Mladic can be removed, why could his savage assault on Srebrenica not be stopped?
Moreover, Mr. Milosevic's recent compliancy, like many other tactical switches in his career, begs the question of what he believes in and to what extent he is believable.
 
A Son of Suicides Adopted by Marxism
 He was born in the provincial town of Pozarevac, about 50 miles from Belgrade, the son of an Orthodox priest who committed suicide when his son was 4. His mother was a schoolteacher who committed suicide several years later.
Mr. Milosevic, earnest and energetic, embraced Communism early and rose through the ranks, hitched to the coat-tails of Ivan Stambolic, the leader of the Serbian Communist party, whom he ultimately humiliated and deposed in 1987.
The vehicle for this humiliation, and for Mr. Milosevic's own apotheosis, was Serbian nationalism. He discovered its force, and potential political rewards, in Kosovo in April 1987.
In a stand-off between the Serbs of the then-autonomous region and the ethnic Albanians who account for 90 percent of Kosovo's population, Mr. Milosevic abruptly shed the dour garb of the apparatchik to side with the Serbs against the mainly Albanian authorities of his own party.
Film of this critical moment shows Mr. Milosevic hesitating before the Serbian crowd, then ditching his past, thundering to the ecstatic crowd of Serbs, "Nobody has the right to beat you!"
Having sensed his opportunity, Mr. Milosevic moved fast. Medieval battles, the relics of Serbian kings, the sacrifices of Serbian soldiers in two world wars, the alleged injustices endured by Serbs in Tito's Yugoslavia, all suddenly became grist for the nationalist mill.
When tens of thousands of Serbs, appalled by the increasingly hate-filled propaganda on state-controlled media, tried to protest in the streets of Belgrade in 1991, Mr. Milosevic crushed them with tanks.
 
'Serbia Does Not Kneel' Is the Party's Motto
 Baying supporters, bused through Serbia, chanted the name of "Slobo" as he eliminated the autonomous status of Kosovo and Vojvodina and brought them under direct Serbian rule. Serbia, the refrain went, would no longer be humiliated. The motto of his Communist-turned-Socialist party was, "Serbia does not kneel."
"The national and historic being of Serbs," Mr. Milosevic declared, "is a liberating one."
But the rest of Yugoslavia did not want to be "liberated;" on the contrary, it took fright. Indeed, perhaps the deepest irony of the Serbs' argument that they have only fought in the last four years because they wanted to remain in Yugoslavia is that Mr. Milosevic almost certainly did more than anyone to destabilize the country and set it on its course to implosion.
Another irony is that the very right the Serbs have claimed -- that of their people in Bosnia and Croatia to govern themselves -- was precisely the one Mr. Milosevic denied to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo.
Moreover, it has become clear that Mr. Milosevic's real interest in preserving Yugoslavia was slight. When Slovenia seceded on June 26, 1991, it was allowed to go with scarcely a fight: there was no Serbian minority there. The real aim, as a senior presidential aide, Borislav Jovic, recently explained, was to use wars in Croatia and Bosnia to take the Serbian-occupied areas and so forge a Greater Serbia.
In extensive interviews with the BBC for a documentary on the destruction of Yugoslavia, Mr. Jovic, now vice president of Mr. Milosevic's Serbian Socialist party, said that in April 1991, more than two months before war broke out in Croatia: "We decided to change tactics. We would deploy troops in Serb areas of Croatia, the Croats would provoke war, and we would then take those territories."
The same tactics were used in Bosnia, where war broke out in April 1992.
"We knew that when Bosnia was recognized, we'd be seen as aggressors because our army was there," Mr. Jovic said. "So Milosevic and I talked it over, and we realized we'd have to pull a fast one. We transferred all the Bosnian Serbs in our Yugoslav Army to their forces and promised to pay all their costs." Thus was an extremely well-armed Bosnian Serb force created.
 
What Goes Around Comes Around
 The results, in the end, have been disappointing. The war in Croatia has effectively been lost and the war in Bosnia is going against the Serbs. Serbia lies in economic ruin and hundreds of thousands of Serbs are refugees. Moreover, because Mr. Milosevic has resorted to irregular forces to disguise his hand in the wars, Arkan and other paramilitary groups have been given a freer hand.
"Any assessment of Milosevic must conclude that he has been immensely destructive, to his own people and to others," said Zarko Korac, an opposition politician. "The world now wants to see him as a pragmatist, but it is destructiveness that, up to now, seems to distinguish him."
The Serbian President is also a survivor. His overwhelming control of the police and press has insured that, as has his ability to convince foreign diplomats that he constitutes the ineluctable road to peace.
"He's so easy to deal with compared to the Bosnian Government," said one American official. "He's charming and decisive. Sometimes we have to remind ourselves that with Milosevic we are dealing with a compliant dictator, whereas in Bosnia we are dealing with a muddled, fledgling democracy."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Canadian Dollar Surges in Asia After Quebec Rejects Secession

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Canadian dollar rallied last night after Quebec voters narrowly rejected a proposal to secede from Canada.
Initial returns after polls closed had showed a sharp separatist lead, leading to a steep selloff of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar in Asian trading. 
 But as later results came in, showing a swing in votes against an independent Quebec, the Canadian dollar recovered and shot up more than 2 United States cents in less than an hour.
"The Canadian dollar was really getting whacked on the early return," John Lilley, a currency analyst with MMS International in Singapore, told Bloomberg Business News. With the late returns giving the opponents of independence a decisive lead, "the currency and bond markets have taken off," he said.
By midday in Tokyo today, the Canadian dollar was quoted at 74.71 United States cents, up from its late New York quote of 73.34 United States cents.
Earlier yesterday, the United States dollar was little changed in thin trading as currency traders moved cautiously while awaiting the results of the vote in Quebec.
"People are sitting on the sidelines watching to see what happens in Canada and how it will affect the dollar," said David Ogg, foreign-exchange manager at Midland Bank.
The possibility of an independent Quebec raised questions about the effect on Canada's heavy debt load and on the North American trade agreement.
In New York trading late yesterday, the United States dollar edged up to 101.95 Japanese yen from 101.93 yen on Friday, but it slipped to 1.4089 German marks from 1.4090. The British pound rose to $1.5779 from $1.5765.
The United States dollar was locked in narrow ranges during the day.
 "There are some good reasons to buy dollars and some good reasons to sell dollars, and I'm not sure the market knows which way to go," said James Kemp, chief dealer at Citibank.
 Mr. Kemp said the perception of instability in Canada and Mexico, coupled with tensions over the Federal budget negotiations in the United States, could weigh on the dollar. But political uncertainty in Russia was bolstering it.
 The Mexican peso strengthened yesterday after investors felt reassured by a weekend economic pact among the Government, labor and business. The accord inspired more confidence in the peso, which tumbled last week on worries over Mexico's economy. The dollar traded at 6.925 pesos yesterday, down from 7.0650 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Europeans Pledge Aid for the Balkans

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LUXEMBOURG, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The European Union will provide $2 billion in reconstruction aid for the countries that made up the former Yugoslavia, a third of the total package, if coming peace talks lead to an overall settlement, officials said today.
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette of France said that European Union foreign ministers would like to see $2 billion contributed by the United States, with the final $2 billion provided by other countries, probably wealthy Gulf states and other Muslim nations. 
 The money would be disbursed jointly by the European Union and the international lending organizations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The European Commission, the European executive body, plans to hold a pledging meeting for donors in early December with the aim of raising the money.
An outline plan by the commission would divide aid into three categories: relief efforts, rehabilitation money and reconstruction.

Mimi Cassin's Christmas list is not the stuff of traditional fantasy. It seems she would be happy with a salad bowl.
"This year, I would like something like kitchenware," said Ms. Cassin, who lives in Kansas City, Mo., where she is an assistant in a retail leasing firm. As for giving, she plans to spend less money on her friends and family this holiday than she did last year, and will not be dropping into clothing stores, preferring art supplies for her 5-year-old. 
 Ms. Cassin is not the only one planning for a modest Christmas this year, bringing scant joy to retailers, who have grown weary of cautious consumers spoiling the industry's most crucial season.
A high level of consumer debt, a low savings rate and a new wave of mergers and acquisitions that has many people edgy about their jobs are all expected to contribute to reined-in spending, economists say. Many analysts expect retail sales for the season, which traditionally begins the day after Thanksgiving, to rise by about 5 percent, compared with 7 percent last year.
"I am expecting a decent, but not spectacular, Christmas," said Stanton J. Bluestone, the chief executive of Carson Pirie Scott & Company, a department store chain in the Midwest. "The consumer is somewhat restricted."
Not everyone is hemmed in, of course. Many investors are quite flush, given the sharp rise in the stock markets this year, though how much of that paper wealth shows up in retailers' registers is uncertain. Still, while much of working America is feeling the pinch, affluent shoppers are not expected to head for the sidelines.
Nor is the outlook the same for all retailers. To hear some analysts and shoppers tell it, Christmas morning may feature cozy scenes like these: consumers turning on the new computer, unwrapping some jewelry, perhaps even trying out the new vacuum cleaner -- all while wearing last year's shabby bathrobes.
Indeed, the predictions for apparel are far worse than for any other category, a continuation of that group's decline. Computer products and household goods are picked as winners, reflecting the current trends for nearly everything high-tech and nest-feathering. And while cheap bracelets and low-end paisley scarves may suffer, upscale merchandise like expensive jewelry and furniture should fare better.
"I see this as being a very selective Christmas," Janet Kloppenburg, an analyst in New York at Robertson, Stephens & Company, said. "It won't be a total doomsday, because certain retailers have positioned themselves very intimately with their customers and they know what an aging baby boomer wants."
To be sure, predicting any Christmas season is dicey. In 1992, for example, analysts forecast clouds and misery, and the season ended nicely. And at least a few experts are bucking the consensus view, saying many people who managed to keep costs in check all year are now ready to splurge.
Still, whatever the sales numbers turn out to be, most agree that profit margins will be slimmer across the board, if only because retailers will be forced to begin the season with big sales to lure shoppers who have been spoiled by the discounting in recent Christmases.
Clearly, many retailers are already reaching for their Tums.
Same-store sales, the clearest indicator of how retail operations are faring, have been poor in the clothing business for months. More broadly, declining profits quarter after quarter have been harbingers of bad things for general discounters, off-price chains and the specialty stores. Some, like the Caldor Corporation, filed for bankruptcy protection even before waiting to see how the latest quarter turns out. Department stores, too, will have to work overtime to turn profits.
Even catalogue retailers, who rely heavily on the holiday season to lift them through the rest of the year, are worried, because they have been hurt badly by big increases in paper costs and, to a lesser degree, postal rates. The Christmas catalogue by Lands' End, for instance, is 20 pages thinner than last year, and is offering incentives like free postage and monogramming for early orders.
In recent years, retailers have been in the difficult position of needing to unload a huge overstock of goods during the holiday season any way they could. As a result, shoppers have come to expect the pre-Christmas sale, a promotion almost unheard of a decade ago.
"Retailers have trained customers to be value-conscious," said Karen Sack, an analyst in New York at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. "Sales were up last year at Christmas, around 7 percent, but it was because stores were very promotional. This year it will be more like 5 percent, but it is going to be very promotional again."
Rosemary Bregande is on to this, and snoops around the Galleria Shopping Center in Houston for bargains. Mrs. Bregande, who is 55, said that she had already bought her grandchild's Christmas present -- a winter wardrobe -- at half the price she was used to paying years ago.
Recent Government figures on rising levels of consumer debt help to explain why many shoppers are expected to be so careful. Personal debts are reaching a level close to the most recent peak of the late 1980's, a point at which most consumers started to pull back on spending.
Other factors are at work as well. "The savings rate is fairly low in historical context," Donald H. Straszheim, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, said. "It is 4 percent now, and has been more like 5 in recent years."
Mr. Straszheim also said that people are increasingly nervous about Washington's plans to cut back on social spending, particularly for Medicare, which further tightens their purse strings.
Despite all the concerns, some retailers expect a fine season. Almost all analysts said that a surge in interest in technology will translate into long lines at the checkout counter for sellers of computers, facsimile machines and other electronic equipment.
Some analysts picked Best Buy and Circuit City Stores as consumer-electronics chains likely to do well, along with the Compaq Computer Corporation and other manufacturers that are introducing new products.
"I was at the Mall of America last week and all the entertainment stores were very busy," said Alan G. Millstein, publisher of the Fashion Network Report, an industry newsletter, referring to the Bloomington, Minn., shopping mall, the country's largest. "You could have rolled a bowling ball through the apparel stores."
Paul Ewert, vice president of merchandising at CompUSA Inc., a national chain of computer stores, is already licking his lips. "We expect to do extremely well this Christmas season," he said, ticking off a series of products that shoppers are enamored of, like multimedia personal computers, the latest generation of high-speed modems and video enhancers. He declined, though, to discuss projections about profits.
"Electronics will have an outstanding Christmas," Mr. Millstein said. "But I think their margins will be hurt simply because of price wars, and because computers don't self-destruct like clothes, so they are not replaced often."
Lisa Davis, a 35-year-old lawyer in Manhattan, said that while she had cut back on her general spending, she intended to allow for frills, like an upgrade for her wedding ring. "I want a diamond band," she said with a firmness that should send her husband walking briskly to Fortunoff. "I don't like utilitarian gifts."
She represents a small but significant group of spenders.
"Luxury items are likely to do quite well for a strange reason that we call the wealth effect," said Kurt Barnard, the president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, a trade publication. "The stock market has soared and a lot of people are feeling extremely wealthy."
Ms. Kloppenburg, the analyst at Robertson, Stephens, also expects a lift from this group, forecasting an 8 percent increase in fine jewelry sales for the coming season.
"Jewelry is perceived as having value and being durable," said Alan M. Zimmer, the chief executive of Reeds Jewelers Inc., which has 100 stores in the East. His company saw a 7 percent increase in same-store sales last year, and he expects to hit that range again.
And for housewares, Bed Bath and Beyond, a chain based in Springfield, N.J., seems to be the analysts' darling this year, with consumers expressing a strong desire for items for the home. A spokeswoman for the chain said it expected to do well in everything from waffle makers to flannel sheets to Christmas-decorated toilet paper.
Within apparel, Mr. Barnard said he expected Sears, Roebuck & Company to be the anomaly, largely because he thinks the company's new marketing push for reasonably priced women's fashions may well bump out rivals that are offering similar products for less value.
Over all, retailers may find the blows softened by earlier experience. Third-quarter earnings were so weak in many areas that the Christmas numbers may not look that bad. Also, retailers have learned from previous bad holiday seasons to keep inventories in check.
And there are those retail bulls who predict that at the last minute, consumers are going to throw their money about.
"I'm thinking that a lot of analysts are just wrong," said Audrey Gusky, a professor of marketing at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. "A lot of people have been postponing their purchases all year and now feel they are due."

HEADLINE: Real Politics: Why Suharto Is In and Castro Is Out

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Fidel Castro never got so much as a smile or a handshake when he stepped into the same reception with President Clinton last week; the Secret Service deftly kept them from coming face to face.
President Jiang Zemin of China did a bit better. The Administration quashed his hopes for a state visit, but insisted that a largely empty two-hour meeting in New York had advanced the cause of "comprehensive engagement" with the Chinese, the kind of engagement Mr. Castro is desperate to win. 
 And then came Suharto, the aging, military-backed leader of Indonesia, and a man who also knows a good deal about how to keep dissenters under control. When he arrived at the White House on Friday for a "private" visit with the President, the Cabinet room was jammed with top officials ready to welcome him. Vice President Gore was there, along with Secretary of State Warren Christopher; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili; Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown; the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor; the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, and many others.
"There wasn't an empty chair in the room," one participant said. "No one used to treat the Indonesians like this, and it said a lot about how our priorities in the world have changed."
For a quick understanding of how the Clinton Administration balances American economic interests abroad, Presidential election politics at home and human rights concerns around the world these days, simply look at how President Clinton dealt with three very different, very authoritarian foreign visitors.
For years Washington has embraced dictatorial leaders, particularly anti-Communist ones, when it served the national interest. But in interviews in recent days, Administration officials said the treatment of Mr. Castro, Mr. Jiang and Mr. Suharto was driven by very different litmus tests, a potent mix of power politics and emerging markets.
Of all the three leaders, Mr. Castro probably evokes the strongest emotional response, especially in the Cuban community in Florida, where anti-Castro sentiment remains at a fever pitch and a crucial state in the coming election. "There are no votes riding on how we deal with Indonesia, and not many on how we deal with China," one of Mr. Clinton's foreign policy advisers said the other day. "Castro is still political dynamite."
And of the three, he has the fewest strategic and economic cards to play. Russia no longer cares about Mr. Castro's fate. And he has few other sources of capital to reach for. The Europeans, the Japanese and the overseas Chinese, who are vying for manufacturing footholds in Indonesia and China, could care less about his little island.
That allows the United States the luxury of continuing a policy of isolating Cuba while proclaiming that "engaging" other hard-line Communist countries, including China, Vietnam and North Korea, is the best way to bring about change in their Governments.
"You use your leverage where you can find it, and we are in a unique position to isolate Castro," a senior Administration official said on Friday when asked what it would have cost Mr. Clinton to shake Mr. Castro's hand. "It is a real power politics approach, but why would we want to give him the status and respectability that would come from a meeting with the President until he has given way? And if he doesn't deal with us, who else can he turn to?"
Fred Bergsten, who heads the Institute for International Economics in Washington, noted recently: "Cuba is the anomaly. Not only are its relations with the U.S. driven by domestic politics here, it has nothing to offer. Vietnam at least has 90 million people in a terrific neighborhood, a place where everyone wants a plant." And those who want to deal with Mr. Castro -- including most of the nations in Latin America -- do not have the billions of dollars in capital available to build highways, plants and factories there, even if they were willing to take the political risk.
Mr. Jiang presented a far more complex case for the White House. Since the beginning of the summer, when China was outraged by the Clinton Administration's decision to allow Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, to make a so-called private visit to Cornell University, the State Department has been consumed with getting back on speaking terms with Beijing. The rebuilding process began with Mr. Christopher, who met his Chinese counterpart in Brunei, and then New York. The Chinese responded by releasing Harry Wu, an American who had been seized and charged with espionage during one of his human rights investigations in China.
But Mr. Clinton is having a harder and harder time making the case that his decision two years ago to "delink" the issue of human rights from the annual extension of preferential trade treatment is paying off. Nor is there much evidence that "commercial engagement," a phrase coined by Mr. Brown, has resulted in significantly better treatment for dissidents.
Moreover, he can hardly boast too loudly about the economic benefits reaped by his new approach. American exports to China have risen slowly -- they now stand at about $9 billion -- but the trade deficit has exploded to Japan-like levels.
Certainly there is huge pressure from American businesses to keep all channels to the Government open, but privately American business executives tell tale after tale of frustration. Of the $6 billion in deals signed with great fanfare by Mr. Brown in Beijing last year, two-thirds have barely made progress.
But unlike Cuba, China is all about huge potential, upside and downside. Failure to get into the market is seen as tantamount to surrender to Japanese, Taiwanese and European business interests. And everyone in Asia expects the United States to continue acting as the counterweight to Chinese military power -- without, of course, feeding China's fear that a containment policy is under way.
"This is a case where you are dealing with a great power, and you have no choice but to make sure that your contacts stay open," one of Mr. Clinton's top foreign policy advisers said last week. "But bring Jiang to a state dinner, with trumpets and everything? That would be a bit much for everyone to take."
That leaves Mr. Suharto, who is sitting on the ultimate emerging market: some 13,000 islands, a population of 193 million and an economy growing at more than 7 percent a year. The country remains wildly corrupt and Mr. Suharto's family controls leading businesses that competitors in Jakarta would be unwise to challenge. But Mr. Suharto, unlike the Chinese, has been savvy in keeping Washington happy. He has deregulated the economy, opened Indonesia to foreign investors and kept the Japanese, Indonesia's largest supplier of foreign aid, from grabbing more than a quarter of the market for goods imported into the country.
So Mr. Clinton made the requisite complaints about Indonesia's repressive tactics in East Timor, where anti-Government protests continue, and moved right on to business, getting Mr. Suharto's support for market-opening progress during the annual Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Osaka in mid-November.
"He's our kind of guy," a senior Administration official who deals often on Asian policy, said the other day. "The message of his visit was clear: this is the kind of relationship we want to have with China."

HEADLINE: Guggenheim Foundation, Long a Donor, Is Now Having to Seek Donations

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
For 70 years, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation has bestowed grants on promising scholars, scientists and artists -- from Aaron Copland, Ansel Adams and James Baldwin to Henry A. Kissinger, Linus Pauling and Paul Samuelson -- 13,500 in all.
But now, cup in hand, the foundation, set up with proceeds from the Guggenheim mining fortune, is asking others for contributions so it can continue to give money to a new generation of artists and researchers. 
 Pleas from the American Cancer Society, the American Red Cross and CARE come by the armful. But a request from the Guggenheim Foundation seems about as likely as the computer magnate William H. Gates asking for a loan.
"People look at us," said Joel O. Conarroe, a literary scholar who is president of the Guggenheim Foundation. "They say: 'You're a foundation. You have the Guggenheim name. Why do you need money?' "
But years of generous spending, coupled with erratic investment earnings resulting from an overly conservative investment strategy, eroded the wealth of the foundation in the 1970's and 1980's. Now the Guggenheim Foundation is on a quest to add some $10 million to $20 million to its $150 million endowment.
While it is not unusual for foundations to have difficulty earning high enough investment returns year after year to replace what they spend and to keep pace with inflation, it is highly unusual for a private foundation like the Guggenheim to resort to raising money.
Although some argue that foundations ought to spend themselves out of existence rather than being self-perpetuating fonts of grant money, the Guggenheim's directors say they do not think that closing down makes sense for them.
"There was discussion of the board about whether we should exist in perpetuity or go out of business, but no real debate," said Robert V. Lindsay, the former president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and the chairman of the foundation; he leads its fund-raising campaign. "Everyone felt we would be more and more needed."
The Guggenheim Foundation was set up by Senator Simon Guggenheim and his wife, Olga, after the death of their 17-year-old son at Phillips Exeter Academy in 1922, shortly before he was to enter Harvard. The Senator's idea, developed after consultations with several Rhodes scholars, was to provide grubstakes for exceptional scholars, scientists and artists, or, in his own words, "to continue the influence of the young life of eager aspiration."
In the years since then, the Guggenheim Foundation has acquired a luster that rubs off on its recipients.
"Guggenheim invented the prestige fellowship," said Stanley N. Katz, president of the American Council of Learned Societies. "It's not just the money. For young academics, it was the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. With its peer review process, it came to have a cachet that was invaluable."
Other foundations grant fellowships, as do Government agencies, like the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a growing number of research centers at universities. But many of these have a narrower vision. The Guggenheim Foundation offers fellowships in 79 fields; computer studies is one of the newest. And the National Endowments, the biggest sources of financing in their fields, face deep cuts from Congress and an uncertain future.
"In terms of what's available, the Guggenheims are critical," said Mr. Katz, whose own organization gives about $1.1 million in fellowships in the humanities and social sciences annually, about half of what the Guggenheim Foundation spends in those areas each year.
The grants are not large. The average fellowship last year was $27,031, and the highest was $31,000; the amount is based on need. But for professors with a half-year's salary for a year's sabbatical leave, or for writers and artists used to living frugally, they often make an important financial difference.
The realization that the foundation needed to tighten its belt if it wanted to stay in business began to take shape in the mid-1980's, about the time that its second president, Gordon Ray, was preparing to retire.
With an endowment hovering between about $100 million and $120 million, the foundation had been awarding, since the 1950's, about 300 fellowships each year, including about 25 to 30 awards each year in Latin America, where Guggenheim mining activities brought in huge profits.
While foundations are required by law to spend an amount equal to at least 5 percent of their assets annually, the Guggenheim had spent more than that in many years to maintain the number of grants and to try to adjust the value of the grants to account for inflation.
But, like numerous other foundations, its investment returns have been erratic, with big gains in some years and losses in others. In some years, its investment earnings did not even cover its grants. Like many foundations and other investors in the 1980's, the Guggenheim had left all its assets in the hands of one bank money manager, rather than trying for more diversification and more aggressive money managers who might have brought in higher returns. The trustees began to realize that those results, combined with inflation, meant that if the foundation continued along the path it was on, it faced a gradual erosion of its spending power in coming decades.
With the help of a planning grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation called in a consulting firm that confirmed the worst fears of the trustees: they could not continue to hand out grants at the rate they had been if they wanted the foundation to be around indefinitely.
Under the new president, Mr. Conarroe, who had been the dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania and a Guggenheim fellow himself, the foundation adopted in 1989 a four-step plan that involved cutting costs, awarding fewer fellowships, following a more aggressive investment strategy for the endowment and raising money.
The foundation handles some 3,500 applications a year, but it is modestly run. Its staff members opt for subways over taxis, and they bring up food from the delicatessen downstairs. Its flashiest assets are its Park Avenue address, its prestigious name and the copious works by fellows that adorn the offices: shelves and shelves of books by well-known authors like Edna St. Vincent Millay, Hart Crane, Saul Bellow and John Updike, and walls lined with the work of big-name photographers like Adams and Diane Arbus.
Still, it trimmed its staff and cut the number of grants by almost half. "The cuts were really draconian," Mr. Connaroe said. "Where before we might have had 12 composers or 12 poets, now we had only six or seven."
The foundation also added two new investment experts -- Leon Levy of Odyssey Partners and S. Parker Gilbert of Morgan Stanley -- to its board of trustees and finance committee. They have helped reshape the investment strategy, which will take the foundation into some less conventional investments, like specialized hedge funds. And, for the first time ever, the foundation took on a part-time development officer to help raise money.
So far, the fund raising, now in its fourth year of formal solicitations, has been low-key. Efforts to raise money from other foundations proved difficult, so the Guggenheim Foundation is focusing on its own body of fellows and friends, calling on former fellows like Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright; E. Annie Proulx, the novelist, and Theodore R. Sizer, the educator, to write artful letters to other fellows in their fields.
"Lord knows, fund raising is not my thing," Ms. Proulx said. But she agreed to do it. "The foundation is a wonderful place to put your money if you have some -- the awards are so important," Ms. Proulx said. But she added: "Guggenheim or not, a lot of writers are not exactly rolling in the chips. So, as a group to appeal to, they have shallow pockets."
While the trustees recognize that, they still say it is the appropriate place to start.
"We are taking a rather quiet approach -- with a rifle, not a shotgun," said Mr. Lindsay, the foundation chairman. "It's going to be a slow process. It may seem too deliberate, but that doesn't worry me."
Mr. Lindsay said the goal was to be able to back 20 to 40 more fellowships by the end of the century, or enough to bring the total to about 200 per year. That would still be fewer fellowships than the foundation had been awarding each year through 1989.
So far, the campaign has taken in about $2 million of its $10 million to $20 million goal, not counting bequests or a recent pledge of $500,000 by Mr. Levy. It is also working out final details on a $1 million challenge grant from William T. Golden, a philanthropist who was a trustee.
So far, 1,776 fellows have made donations, and 97 more have designated the foundation as a recipient after their deaths. The average gift last year was $225.
But even among fellows who talk of the Guggenheim program as one of the highlights of their lives, it is a hard sell.
"They're as worthy as anything else I give to," said Sondra Perl, a professor of English at Lehman College of the City University of New York. "The Guggenheim was invaluable, and their fund-raising letter made me think. But I certainly didn't get the feeling that their existence was in any way threatened."
But there are others who appear to be more inclined to help. John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard University economist, said that he would be more than willing to contribute.
"For better or worse, I would have not written "The Affluent Society" without my Guggenheim," he said. "It gave me a year off in Switzerland to write with no interruptions. I'm eternally grateful."

HEADLINE: High-Technology Stocks Lead the Market's Broad Advance

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks advanced broadly yesterday, buoyed by gains in Novell and other technology companies.
The technology sector, which has led the market all year, was helped yesterday by the news of several multimillion-dollar deals and by a survey of portfolio managers by Barron's magazine this week that highlighted a number of technology issues favored by managers. 
 In addition, reports last week of unexpectedly strong orders for durable goods and strong economic growth in the third quarter brightened the business outlook for technology companies, analysts said.
"The earnings estimates and the profit figures that are being discussed for 1996 are too low if you have that much growth," said Tracy Herrick, chief investment strategist at Jefferies & Company in Palo Alto, Calif.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.82 points, to 4,756.57. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 3.55 points, to 583.25. Of the 90 industry groups in the S.& P. 500, computer, software and semiconductor stocks added the most to the index's gain.
The Morgan Stanley High Tech Index of 35 stocks surged 10.2 points, to a record of 348.1, surpassing its Sept. 11 high, while the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index climbed 14.14 points, to 1039.69.
More than six stocks rose for every five that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, where trading volume fell to 319.2 million shares from 379.5 million on Friday.
Novell's move to sell its Wordperfect software business and buy back as much as 10 percent of its own stock showed that technology companies are "taking positive steps to boost profitability and lower costs," said Peter DaPuzzo, managing director for equities at Cantor, Fitzgerald & Company.
Shares of Novell jumped 1 1/2, to 16 3/8, even though the company is widely expected to sell Wordperfect for far less than the $855 million it paid for it just 18 months ago.
Dozens of other technology stocks rallied. I.B.M. rose 1 3/4, to 98 1/4; Microsoft climbed 2 3/4, to 102 3/4; Intel rose 2, to 69 3/4, and Hewlett-Packard surged 3 5/8, to a record 96.
"These technology stocks should continue to do well from an order and earnings standpoint," said Christopher Fleming, money manager at the Burridge Group.
Friday's report that the economy grew by a 4.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter "was higher than expected, and people are viewing that as a sign orders are going to continue to be strong well into the fourth and first quarters," Mr. Fleming said.
Netscape Communications soared 7, to 88 1/2. The company, which first sold shares at 28 each in August, cut prices by as much as 57 percent on some of its Internet software, a move aimed at gaining customers in an increasingly competitive market.
Minnesota Educational Computing vaulted 10, to 31 1/4. Softkey International, which was down 6 at 32 1/8, agreed to buy the maker of educational software for $370 million at the same time as Softkey made a tender offer for the Learning Company, which was up 4 7/8, to 60 3/8.
Fore Systems climbed 5 1/4, to 55 3/4, after analysts at Needham & Company and Robertson Stephens & Company raised their investment opinions on the maker of computer network equipment.
Macromedia rose 6, to 36 1/4, after the software publisher linked up with Sun Microsystems, which was up 2 1/8 at 78 3/4, to build graphics and multimedia standards for the Internet.
A $2.1 billion buyout offer for CBI Industries, a maker of industrial gases, gave a boost to so-called cyclical stocks, whose business is closely tied to economic booms and busts.
Praxair Inc. offered on Sunday to buy CBI for $32 a share, driving up CBI's stock 10 5/8, to 30 3/4, yesterday. Praxair fell 1/2, to 26 3/8. Priced at a 60 percent premium to the closing price of CBI's shares Friday, the offer shows that cyclical stocks are not too expensive, analysts said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Unchanged In Optimism On Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were steady yesterday as optimism that the economy was expanding at a moderate pace returned to the market.
Bond prices fell sharply on Friday morning after a report on the gross domestic product was stronger than expected. But prices ended mixed that day, buoyed in part by optimism that a Federal budget agreement would be reached. And many in the market still expect that the Federal Reserve will again lower short-term interest rates. 
 Still, market participants are expected to avoid making any major moves ahead of a number of economic reports this week, in particular, the October employment report, which is due on Friday.
And the market yesterday was also watching the outcome of a referendum in Quebec on whether the province should secede from Canada. A vote for independence would be expected to generate a flight out of Canadian securities to the relative safety and stability of short maturities in the United States Treasury market.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged from Friday at 107 to yield 6.35 percent. Rates were mixed at the Treasury's regular weekly bill auction yesterday.
Bond prices bounced a bit early in the session after the Commerce Department released its report on consumer spending and income in September. The data were in line with analysts' expectations, and traders said the bounce was probably because there were no surprises in the numbers.
But Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, warned of the potential inflationary pressures in the higher savings rate in the month. The savings rate rose to 4.2 percent in September, from 4 percent, which was revised from 3.6 percent.
"Given the fairly robust expenditures," Mr. Chan said, "the savings rate does suggest that consumers have effectively reloaded their guns for greater expenditures during the fourth quarter if consumer sentiment improves in response to a healthier labor market."
He said the credit markets were continuing to struggle with two major themes. "One camp fears that last Friday's real gross domestic product report suggests that the economic momentum going into the fourth quarter might actually be stronger than previously anticipated, which clearly points to higher yields," Mr. Chan said. "On the other hand, the market's tone still appears to be extremely healthy. Who would have believed that the bond market would have closed higher after learning that growth was almost twice as large as the consensus estimate. Consequently, if you can't bring this market to its knees on such robust growth, then what if anything can push this market lower?"
In the corporate market, the supply of new debt will increase significantly today when the Tennessee Valley Authority prices $1.6 billion of global power bonds through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers International and Merrill Lynch International. About $1 billion of the five-year global notes are expected to be priced to yield 19 to 21 basis points more than the five-year Treasury note, while $600 million of 30-year securities will be priced to yield about 37 to 39 basis points more than the Treasury bond. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Traders report that good investor demand on the T.V.A. issue prompted a $50 million increase in the size of the 30-year noncallable security. The healthy demand was encouraging amid the flood of corporate debt now coming to market to take advantage of the lowest interest rates in 20 years. Last June, when the T.V.A. sold global bonds, the offering was so popular that it was increased to $2 billion from $1 billion.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Shows A Slower Rate of Growth

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Consumer spending rose in September at half the rate that incomes grew, the Government said today in reports that pointed to slower growth ahead.
Spending rose just two-tenths of 1 percent, to a rate of $4.92 trillion, after jumping a revised eight-tenths of 1 percent in August, the Commerce Department said. Consumer incomes from all sources grew four-tenths of 1 percent, to a $6.1 trillion annual rate, after edging up one-tenth of 1 percent in August. 
 Americans owe so much in credit card and other debt that they are slowly being forced to spend less, which could dampen holiday season sales and be a drag on the economy in the fourth quarter, analysts said. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
"Given the debt situation, it's good to see income growth coming in at higher rates than spending," said Daryl Delano, an economist at Cahners Economics Inc. in Newton, Mass.
A spurt in spending helped drive gross domestic product -- the Government's broadest measure of the economy -- up at a brisk 4.2 percent rate in the third quarter, the Government reported on Friday.
The data on spending and income, analysts said, confirm their belief that the brisk pace of expansion is likely to slow.
"Consumer installment credit has been creeping up steadily for a couple of years now and there are people who think it could be our downfall, could put an end to this expansion," Mr. Delano said. He said he expected more modest growth in the current quarter.
Norm Williams, an economist with First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said the likelihood of more moderate economic growth in the fourth quarter meant that Federal Reserve policy makers would probably hold short-term interest rates steady when they meet Nov. 15.
Most of the gain in income last month came from higher wages and salaries, which rose at a $14.8 billion annual rate after falling $6.2 billion in August. Interest and dividend income rose four-tenths of 1 percent, which also increased earnings.
But Americans saved more, with the savings rate rising to 4.2 cents of each dollar earned from 4 cents in August, the department said. Personal savings rose to a rate of $219.5 billion from $208 billion.
The Commerce Department said spending on durable goods fell a sharp 1.4 percent last month, to a $635.4 billion annual rate, hurt mainly by sluggish demand for cars.
Spending on nondurable goods including food rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to a $1.45 trillion rate, and spending for services edged up three-tenths of 1 percent, to a $2.83 trillion rate.
Consumer incomes had risen six-tenths of 1 percent in July and five-tenths of 1 percent in June. The department's figures are seasonally adjusted.

HEADLINE: New York Outlines a New Policy On Seizure of Buildings for Taxes

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
In the first major revision of New York City's housing policy in almost two decades, the Giuliani administration announced yesterday that it was ending the city's role as the landlord of last resort.
Under the change, which makes official a practice that has been in effect informally for two years, the city will no longer take over ownership and management of all buildings whose owners fall far behind on property taxes. Instead, it will give the existing owners advice and even direct financial help in paying their tax debt. 
 If that does not work, new owners, possibly including nonprofit organizations, will be found for the properties.
In addition, the city will eventually turn over to new owners the nearly 5,000 homes and apartment buildings it already owns and manages.
City officials described the new policy in interviews yesterday, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plans to discuss it in a news conference today.
New York City now pays $220 million a year to manage and maintain residential properties it owns. While the new policy will have its own costs, city officials expect them to be much lower, through savings on property-management expenses and liability claims for problems like personal injuries and lead-paint contamination.
One reason the city feels pressed to reduce its housing management burden is that much of the cost is paid by the Federal Government through community development block grants -- a source of money that may soon dry up.
"The money we use is in serious jeopardy," John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said, referring the budget-cutting mood in Washington. "And with the city's finances being what they are, there is little chance that we could make up the difference even if we wanted to."
The city imposed an informal moratorium on the seizing of buildings two years ago. The Giuliani administration also said it would work to dispose of the several thousand buildings it already owns.
"We are changing our role," Deborah Wright, commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said in an interview. Her office serves as the city's housing manager.
"We are putting in money early in the process," she said, "when the money can do the most good, rather than putting money in the back end, when buildings are in a state of crisis and are close to being unsalvageable."
The new strategy follows other Giuliani administration proposals that look for private-sector solutions to government problems. As an example, the administration is trying to sell or lease several of the city's hospitals to private companies.
"We have spent the better part of 18 months looking at the current policies," Ms. Wright said. "We now have a system that is not working for tenants, neighborhoods, taxpayers or landlords."
The city first became the landlord for thousands of New Yorkers during the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch. Before then, properties with delinquent tax bills were sold at public auction. But many of those new owners were no more able to pay taxes than the original owners, and so the buildings were auctioned again and again -- until finally many were abandoned.
Mayor Koch changed the policy and began taking over ownership and management of these properties, and eventually City Hall became the largest landlord in all five boroughs. But soon the city government was overwhelmed.
The city took over fewer buildings during the real-estate boom of the 1980's. But in recent years, as the city's real-estate market has slumped, more owners have been found in default, and the city's inventory has grown.
As of July, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the agency responsible for these buildings, owned and managed 47,025 apartments in 4,406 buildings across the city. The city has always intended to sell properties it acquires, and has been more or less successful in doing so, depending on the prevailing economic circumstances.
In the last year, the Giuliani administration has been able to sell off about 19 percent of its properties. Still, an independent consultant, Arthur Andersen Consulting, working for city without charge, estimated last summer that with no change in the current policy, the cost of owning and managing just the properties the city already owns would be $10.6 billion over the next two decades.
Under the new policy, the city will offer several kinds of help to building owners, including low-interest loans and management assistance.
If the owners still cannot pay the taxes, the city will deed the properties directly to private owners without passing them through the city's hands.
The new policy requires the approval of the City Council. Yesterday, one council member whose district would be significantly affected said she would support any change that would improve conditions for tenants.
"I have not seen the new policy proposal," said C. Virginia Fields, whose district include most of Harlem, where the city owns a large number of buildings. "I am delighted to see the city at least move forward on this issue. As long as the new program sees to it that buildings get necessary assistance, I think that we are talking about an improvement over the status quo."
Frank P. Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a housing-advocacy organization that has long criticized the city's existing policy, also expressed tentative support for the changes. But he also said he would reserve judgment until the city revealed more details about the program.
"From our point of view this is a step in the right direction," he said. "But what is missing are the details of how much they are willing to spend on the assistance, and whether the program will recognize the fact that many low-income buildings have been excessively taxed."
Under the current system, the city begins a foreclosure when owners fall behind in taxes for more than one year. At this point, owners are offered the opportunity to pay off their debt in installments. If taxes remain unpaid into the second year, the city seizes the property.
Under the new plan, the city would take over buildings only when all other measures fail. And in those instances management would be by outside contractors, not a city agency.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING;
A Plan for the Hospitalized Poor

BYLINE: By SUSAN JO KELLER 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, thinks there is a better way to pay for hospital care for the working poor. 
 The state now gives $400 million a year to hospitals to subsidize the care of patients who cannot pay; the money comes from a Charity Care Trust Fund supported by unemployment benefit reserves. That financing expires on Dec. 31, and Mr. DiFrancesco said yesterday that he would block any new arrangement that did not include his plan to divert $200 million from the fund to help people buy hospitalization insurance from private companies.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Pequots' Foxwood Casino

 BODY:

PLAYER: The Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe, Ledyard, Conn.
 
PRODUCER: Robinson & Cole, Hartford, and Direct Response, Tolland, Conn.
 
SCRIPT: Foxwoods -- the world's most successful casino. But that's only part of the story. The Mashantucket Pequots' Foxwoods Resort and Casino has become one of Connecticut's largest employers, providing jobs to over 10,000 people, strengthening thousands of additional jobs throughout Connecticut, while purchasing over $1 billion in construction, goods and services from large and small businesses and contributing over $300 million to the state. A success story born in the woods of Eastern Connecticut. Coming soon to the the city of Bridgeport: a new world-class casino, bringing over 9,000 new jobs to Connecticut. Mashantucket Pequots, committed to Connecticut's future and Connecticut's people.
 
VISUAL: The commercial opens with an aerial view of Foxwoods, then cuts to 17 images of workers. After another scenic shot of Foxwoods, it cuts to a bleak shot of the Bridgeport skyline, followed by an artist's rendition of the proposed casino. It ends with a construction worker on a steel beam, accompanied by the tribe's logo.
 
ACCURACY: The commercial accurately states the economic contributions Foxwoods has made. Its assumptions about the future in Bridgeport, however, are subject to debate. The ad says flatly that a casino will open soon, without acknowledging that the plan faces an uphill battle in the Legislature and that construction would take more than three years. Some legislators have questioned the claim that the casino will mean 9,000 jobs.
 
SCORECARD: Facing intense opposition in the legislature, the tribe is trying to take the debate outside the Capitol and use Foxwoods's accomplishments to encourage support for the Bridgeport proposal. Such image-building advs are common at the start of electoral and legislative campaigns. But it may be too late to mobilize support to influence the Legislature.
