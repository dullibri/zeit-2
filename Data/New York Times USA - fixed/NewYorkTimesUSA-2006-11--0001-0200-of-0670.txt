HEADLINE: Gathering to Celebrate Food Made the Old, Slow Way

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

DATELINE: TURIN, Italy 

 BODY:
ARTISTS have Burning Man and designers have Fashion Week. For farmers, cooks and the elite troops in the fight against McFood, there is Terra Madre.
 The event, first held two years ago, is produced by Slow Food, an international association that mixes food politics with culinary pleasure. The organization is strongest in Italy, where it was founded 20 years ago by Carlo Petrini after he staged a protest against McDonald's plans to build a restaurant near the Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
A decade later, Slow Food started Salone del Gusto to showcase small producers who couldn't compete in larger, more commercial food shows. It now draws 120,000 people and earns enough money to help fund Terra Madre, along with heavy subsidies from the Italian government.
 The association, which now has 80,000 members in 100 countries, catalogs foods and techniques that are on the verge of extinction. Slow Food also takes on small economic projects called Presidia to help develop better production and economic markets for foods like villsau sheep in Norway, the gravenstein apple in Sonoma County, Calif. or the toasty argan oil of Morocco. 
 From last Thursday to Monday, more than 8,000 people turned the building that held the 2006 Olympic speed skating oval into a kind of culinary United Nations. Chefs and people who like to eat mixed with the people who actually farm, herd, fish or otherwise create the foods that represent what Slow Food is trying to promote.
 Basque shepherds mulled over nomadic herding with Mongolian camel tenders. Indian rice growers mingled with Maine potato farmers. Fishermen traded tastes of wild Northwest smoked salmon and Sicilian Favignana bottarga. And everyone partied with the wild Louisiana shrimpers.
 Here is a look from the conference floor. 
 Thursday's opening day ceremony featured a parade of flags from 150 nations. Iraq and Iran, two countries President Bush defined as part of the ''axis of evil,'' received some of the warmest applause, as did the delegation from Lebanon. The crowd also went crazy for the Peruvian flag bearer, but it might have been for the pink hat.
 Later in the ceremony, Kamal Mouzawak, founder of the farmers' market in Beirut -- billed as Lebanon's first -- provided one of the most crystallizing moments. Beirut has lost almost all of its public gathering places, which makes the farmers' market so vital, he said. Without a place to sell local products, farmers lose hope. And without local food traditions, people lose hope, he said.
 ''If you don't dream, you don't exist,'' he told the crowd. ''So let's dream together.''
 The American delegation included Alice Waters and Michael Pollan, the high priestess and priest of American Slow Food, and a long list of other notable cooks and farmers. Dan Barber from Blue Hill had a high profile, as did Poppy Tooker, a cook from New Orleans who helped save local food icons like Creole cream cheese and wild shrimp after the hurricanes.
 For many of the 600 official delegates from the United States, Terra Madre provided a chance to meet people from countries they might not otherwise visit and to buy souvenirs like lip balm from Mali and excellent wool hats from Tajikistan. 
 Between debates comparing Italian and American agricultural policies and samples of products like Herzegovinian cheese aged in sheepskin sacks, the Americans also had ample opportunity to play at culinary one-upmanship.
 People jousted over who had the larger white truffle shaved over their pasta in Alba and who tasted the best vintages of Angelo Gaja's Barbarescos. 
 And then there was the Obscure Italian Travel competition. One public relations executive gushed about her trip to the ''undiscovered'' town of Ancona in Le Marche on the coast. ''Nobody goes there yet,'' she said. 
 For trend watchers, here's a list of what was hot at Terra Madre this year: honey, yak cheese and seeds.
 At the informal marketplace that sprang up around the conference rooms, there was probably more honey for sale than anything else. It's portable, for one thing, making it easy for Terra Madre participants in developing nations to transport it to people willing to pay $6 for a small jar. 
 At a honey workshop, beekeepers delivered a ''honey manifesto'' calling for the protection of honey gathered in traditional ways. There was also a lot of discussion about the bee shortage. Climate change, disease and pesticide use are taking out bee populations, leaving farmers with poorly pollinated fields.
 As for the yak cheese, look for it at a Slow Food event near you soon. Made on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau from boiled curds, Ragya yak cheese smells a lot like aged pecorino and has twice the fat of cow's milk cheese. The yak cheese enterprise is one of 200 Slow Food projects designed to safeguard artisan foods, and much of the money from the cheese goes to support a small school founded by a Tibetan monk.
 It was the one food Erika Lesser, the executive director of Slow Food in the United States, specifically mentioned on stage, sending out a call to arms to eat more yak cheese.
 Seed diversity was another a rallying cry. ''Every seed saved is a seed of freedom for the farmer,'' said Vandana Shiva, a physicist and author from New Delhi and a leader of the anti-globalization movement. Her seed manifesto was in the hands of many people at Terra Madre. 
 Workshops explored the disappearing stock of seed varieties and the growth of seeds engineered to produce only one crop, which sends the farmer back to the large corporations to buy more each year. 
 Alice Waters might have been the biggest American name at the event, but the real American star was Rick Knoll, a scientist-turned-farmer who works a small patch of land in Brentwood, Calif. He and his wife, Kristie, built the farm's reputation on figs and green garlic.
 Along with a handful of other farmers from around the world, Mr. Knoll's image was on promotional banners hung all over Turin on structures left over from the Olympics.
 With his long, white Edgar Winter hair and Converse sneakers, Mr. Knoll was easily recognized, and conference-goers stopped him for photos. 
 He acted the part, too. After a morning of trying to wade through seminars shakily translated into eight languages, he'd had enough.
 ''We're going over to the Salone to drink our body weight in wine,'' he said.
 The story of Terra Madre didn't play out at the cured meats seminars or the biodiversity lectures, but rather in little corners and small kitchens.
 One afternoon, a Jewish chef and a Muslim chef got together to cook for peace. Moshe Basson of the Eucalyptus restaurant in Jerusalem and Nabil Aho of the Restaurant Notre Dame of Jerusalem Center made a menu from traditional Biblical food, including green wheat soup and musakhan chicken with hummus (and let's just say it was the best hummus I ever tasted). 
 Mr. Aho said the dishes they made in Turin were designed to appeal to rich and poor, Christian, Muslim or Jew. ''We can all gather around this food,'' he said. 
 The men, part of a small group called Chefs for Peace, believe food is a common language that can help solve the Middle East conflict.
 ''In most kitchens all over Jerusalem or Tel Aviv there are Palestinian and Israelis cooking together, shoulder to shoulder, with long knives,'' said Mr. Basson. ''They are not killing each other. They are just trying to make a life.''

HEADLINE: OFF THE MENU

BYLINE: By Florence Fabricant

 BODY:

OPENING THIS WEEK

RUSSIAN TEA ROOM -- This fabled restaurant, which closed in 2002, is to reopen its ground-floor dining room for dinner on Friday. Lunch will follow in a few weeks. Gary Robins, formerly of the Biltmore Room in Chelsea, is the chef. The new owners have kept most of the decor from the tea room's 1999 remodeling intact: 150 West 57th Street, (212) 581-7100. 


CRONKITE PIZZERIA AND WINE BAR -- Michael Ayoub, who is the owner of Fornino in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and who formerly owned Cucina in Park Slope, opens this brick-oven pizzeria on the Lower East Side today: 133 Norfolk Street (Rivington Street), (212) 375-1500.

MAI HOUSE -- Translucent lotus lights define the serene new look of the former Tribakery. Michael Huynh, the chef and a native of Saigon, is ready to start cooking Vietnamese clay-pot chicken and more tomorrow: 186 Franklin Street (Hudson Street), (212) 431-0606.

ZENKICHI -- It's called a brasserie but you might call this new spot, opening Friday, a Japanese gastropub, what with small plates of dishes like miso-marinated spareribs and oyster risotto. Buttons on the tables summon waiters: 77 North Sixth Street (Wythe Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-8985.

OPEN NOW

E.U. (EUROPEAN UNION) Sara Ochs, left, who was the chef de cuisine at Esca, is in charge of this restaurant, which opened late last week. After a protracted battle over its liquor license, it now serves beer and wine. Ms. Ochs's menu features a pan-European array of dishes, including pork schnitzel and cassoulet: 235 East Fourth Street (Avenue B), (212) 254-2900.

BENJAMIN STEAKHOUSE -- Can a Peter Luger pedigree guarantee success where others, including Britney Spears, have failed? Arturo McLeod, who was a chef at Luger's, has opened his Manhattan version in the Dylan Hotel. Breakfast is served, in addition to lunch and dinner: 52 East 41st Street, (212) 297-9177.

BISCUIT BARBECUE -- Night and Day in Park Slope, Brooklyn, has been redone, with Josh Cohen, who owned Biscuit on Flatbush Avenue, in charge: 230 Fifth Avenue (President Street), (718) 399-2161.

BLT BURGER -- Laurent Tourondel's latest restaurant is an unpretentious spot that picks up on serving burgers, then cupcakes, which Mitchel London started on Ninth Avenue. The burgers include a classic and versions with kobe beef and white turkey meat: 470 Avenue of the Americas (11th Street), (212) 243-8226.

CLOSED

BOUTERIN -- After 12 years, Antoine Bouterin lost the lease for his country French restaurant at 420 East 59th Street. He's taking time off.

HEADLINE: A Master of Wine Takes a Fresh Look

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
ONE great thing I learned about Jancis Robinson: you can take her almost anywhere.
 Ms. Robinson, one of the world's leading wine writers, was in New York from Britain last week to promote her latest work, a new edition of ''The Oxford Companion to Wine,'' a magisterial 813-page encyclopedia of just about everything a wine lover could ever want to know. We were to have lunch, and while I knew she did not fit the fusspot stereotype of the British wine critic, I had never met her and didn't know her tastes and preferences. Where to take her?
This much I did know. Ms. Robinson has a clutch of intimidating initials after her name. M.W. stands for Master of Wine, a title given to the relatively few people who have passed a rigorous, exhaustive examination -- oral, written and imbibed -- like a combined M.D. and Ph.D. program. She's an O.B.E. as well -- Order of the British Empire, that is, given to those who have done Old Blighty proud, like soldiers, statesmen, rock stars and, evidently, wine writers. What does one call an officer of the O.B.E.? Lady Robinson? Your Majesty? 
 Even the sturdiest mantelpiece would collapse under the weight of her awards and honorary degrees. She speaks in terribly thoughtful sentences, delivered in a commandingly lyrical accent she describes as posh. When she is not busy writing, tasting or lecturing about wine, she puts that voice to good use, narrating BBC documentaries on such nonvinous subjects as the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, Olga Korbut or Orthodox Jewish women. Just to complete matters, her given name is literary, derived from a character in the novel ''Precious Bane,'' by Mary Webb. 
 As I thought about a place for lunch, I assumed that, like many people in a business that requires more or less continual eating and drinking, she must be weary of drawn-out formality. Yet a quick meal of nondescript food and dull wine was no answer. At long last I decided to take a chance on Fatty Crab, a casual little haunt in the West Village with a menu influenced by Southeast Asian street foods and a most creative wine list. I thought so, anyway, but what would Ms. Robinson think?
 When we met there on a crisp, bright Monday afternoon, the music was too loud, and the chairs too hard. But I discovered two things right away. First, I was to call her Jancis -- there really was no question about this. And second, Ms. Robinson is not merely one of the world's foremost wine experts, but a passionate wine lover. 
 There's a decided difference between the two. An expert might recite off-the-cuff weather conditions in the Medoc for every vintage of the 20th century, or regale you with a complete list of the grand cru vineyards of the Cote d'Or. But only a wine lover would be delighted by the eccentricities of the Fatty Crab list: not merely rieslings, chenin blancs, trousseaus and blaufrankisches, but goldmuskatellers, scheurebes and refoscos as well.
 And so it was that Ms. Robinson, 56, sat, in a subtle red-and-white patterned shirt and discreet spectacles, purring over a Muller-Thurgau she had never tasted before, contemplating a meal of green mango salad, crisp pork belly with watermelon, and rice noodles with Chinese sausage. ''Oh, I adore Chinese sausage,'' she said. Be still my heart.
 This is the third edition of ''The Oxford Companion'' that Ms. Robinson has edited since 1994, and its extraordinary wealth of new information indicates how rapidly the world of wine has evolved since the second edition was published, in 1999. Aside from new entries on topics like reverse osmosis, Yellow Tail, globalization and, of course, proanthocyanidins (components of grape tannins, and a suggestion of the depth of the scientific understanding of wine nowadays), Ms. Robinson said 40 percent of the entries had been extensively revised. The most important change she sees in the wine world?
 ''Oh, the upgrade of quality, and the enthusiasm and ambition of winemakers everywhere,'' she said. ''They are wonderfully undaunted by the difficult economic conditions everywhere.''
 Fellow British writers like Hugh Johnson have sounded decidedly doleful recently, envisioning a world of monochromatic wines conforming to dictatorial American tastes for plush, high-alcohol fruit bombs. But Ms. Robinson doesn't paint so gloomy a picture. 
 ''If you can afford something above the basic $20 bottle, it's probably the best of times,'' she said. ''These represent wines made with more ambition and expertise than ever before.''
 Looking at the Fatty Crab wine list, with bottles from places like Slovenia, Hungary and many little-known appellations, Ms. Robinson pointed to the range of different wines available to consumers today. ''They come from a much richer variety of places,'' she said. ''We're well over the besotted stage with just a handful of grape varieties.'' 
 Yet, Ms. Robinson's optimism was cautious. She is concerned that many less expensive wines may be technically perfect, but bland. And yes, she, too, is troubled by a uniformity in winemaking.
 ''As for winemaking style, I'm not sure we're in an era of diversity,'' she said, adding quickly, ''I don't want to stir things up.''
 Ms. Robinson winces when asked about unpleasant exchanges she has had in print with the American wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr., who disagreed with her assessment of a 2003 Chateau Pavie, a Saint-Emilion producer that he has championed. It is not something she would like to rehash.
 ''I hate conflict,'' she said, and rephrases her point. 
 ''I may be an idealist, but I think there are just so many players in the world of wine today, specifically so many ambitious, driven, well-educated younger producers who have traveled the world and have increasing understanding of their own patch of vines,'' Ms. Robinson said. ''Together with the need to make wines that stand out from the crowd in this overcrowded marketplace, this will effect an increase in the range of styles of wine available.''
 Ms. Robinson is not alone in her distaste for big, sweet-tasting, high-alcohol wines (none of those, thankfully, on the Fatty Crab list), and she feels that more people are coming around to her way of thinking.
 ''I sense that the pendulum swing to big, super-ripe reds has already reached its maximum,'' she said. ''I really don't think consumers want to have nothing but high-alcohol wines that taste sweet and are questionable partners for food. I'm not against these wines on principle. Some of them are very fine. But I'd like to feel they were not accepted as the single ideal they have seemed to be, specifically in California, in recent years.''
 Not that Ms. Robinson is the anti-Parker, nor does she have it in for New World wines. She's a big fan of Ridge Monte Bello (well, who isn't?), she loves the Argentine malbecs from Bodega Catena Zapata, and she said a recent trip to Australia reminded her of how many good artisanal winemakers were working there. ''I don't like this, 'The Brits taste one way, and the Americans another,' '' she said. 
 Aside from ''The Oxford Companion,'' Ms. Robinson has churned out a library of works since she started writing about wine in 1975. One of her best books, ''Vines, Grapes and Wines,'' a reference on the raw components of wine, published 20 years ago, is now regrettably out of date. She published a memoir nine years ago, ''Tasting Pleasure: Confessions of a Wine Lover.'' She has no plans to update either one. 
 These days, when she is not conversing through her Web site, jancisrobinson.com, or writing a wine column for The Financial Times, she is either working on the next edition of ''The Oxford Companion'' or the equally crucial reference ''World Atlas of Wine,'' which was handed off to her by Mr. Johnson.
 Ms. Robinson discovered wine when she was a student at Oxford. It was a bottle of Chambolle-Musigny (see Page 150 of ''The Oxford Companion''), Les Amoureuses, to be precise, that set her on her way. After three years in the travel business and a brief spell in Provence, she was convinced that wine and food were life's most rewarding subjects. She returned to London as assistant editor of a wine trade magazine. ''Never looked back,'' she said.
 Between revisions of the two books, she said, she has little time for other books. Oh, by the way, she has a husband, Nick Lander, who writes about food and restaurants for The Financial Times; three children; and a legion of admirers.
 One is Jay McInerney, the novelist, who writes a wine column for House & Garden magazine and turns especially voluble in listing the virtues he sees in Ms. Robinson. 
 ''First of all she writes well,'' he said. ''When I first got interested in wine 15 or 20 years ago, most wine writing was really dreary. Hers was refreshing, lively and really literate. It wasn't overly technical and it wasn't overly poetic, the way a lot of British wine writers are.
 ''One of the things Jancis taught me about wine was, lighten up!''
 Maybe Fatty Crab was just the right touch after all. But sitting with Ms. Robinson, even as she's swooning over the pork belly with watermelon, I find it hard to lighten up too much. Though she is traveling to promote the third edition of ''The Oxford Companion,'' I asked her what she imagines will be the main areas of revision in the fourth edition.
 She mentioned climate change, and she envisions an effective alternative to the cork that will be prettier than a screwcap. Now the ideas are flowing: genetically modified yeasts will be an issue, as scientists devise ways to deal with the higher alcohol levels. But she doesn't think the wine world will accept them. The alternative is much more careful work in the vineyard, but she believes, as vineyard land expands, it will be more and more difficult to find skilled labor. 
 Stores of great old wine will diminish. ''Maybe quite a few fakes, but most of the good stuff will probably have been drunk by your countrymen,'' she said. China will soon produce serious wine, she said, and more grape growers will farm organically.
 Speaking of farming, what about Ms. Robinson? She lives in London, but has a place in Languedoc. Has she ever been tempted to make wine?
 ''I'm afraid not,'' she said. ''I'm a terrible control freak. The idea of being in thrall to nature doesn't appeal.''

HEADLINE: Nonprofits Seem a Natural Fit for Office Condos 

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
The office condominium of Visions/Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired, a nonprofit organization in SoHo, is not a typical Manhattan workplace.
 Stone inlays in the hardwood floors serve as directional cues for those with canes. Diffuse lighting panels cut glare, enabling visually impaired visitors to see contrasting walls and furnishings. Staff members use an expansive kitchen with a washer-dryer to coach clients in life skills.
Because Visions owns its 8,000-square-foot space in a former industrial building at 500 Greenwich Street -- rather than leasing it -- the organization was able to customize the office with ease. And the benefits of ownership do not stop there. 
 ''Now that we own, we don't have to worry about being priced out of the market or spending most of our money on offices, as opposed to our program,'' said Nancy D. Miller, executive director of Visions.
 As the market for office space in New York City tightens and rents climb -- while interest rates remain low -- office condominiums are promoted as providing financial stability for small companies expecting little employee growth. Given the persistent popularity of residential condominiums, it seems logical that the city might embrace the concept of office-space ownership, which appeared as far back as the early 1980s but has not caught on here as it has in other parts of the country.
 There has even been some recent development of office condominiums in prime addresses like the Chelsea Arts Tower at 545 West 25th Street; and at 125 Maiden Lane and 14 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan. 
 Yet, even as brokers say there is obvious demand on the part of nonprofit organizations, government agencies and some small companies to own their spaces, few real estate professionals anticipate a boom in office condominiums in the city anytime soon.
 ''In recent years, some owners have agreed to convert part or all of their buildings to commercial condominium space'' on the premise that the parts are worth more than the whole, said David Lebenstein, director of the nonprofit division at the commercial brokerage firm Colliers ABR. But, he conceded, ''it is still -- no matter how you slice it -- a very limited market.''
 The Chelsea Arts Tower, a 20-story commercial condominium recently built in West Chelsea with floor sizes of 3,100 to 4,700 square feet, has attracted galleries and arts-related businesses, with units selling for about $800 a foot, said Alan Weisman, a senior managing director at Grubb & Ellis.
 Mr. Weisman said the success of the tower, which was developed as a result of numerous requests from art galleries in the neighborhood for condominiums, is not a bellwether. ''This is unique,'' he said. ''It was a clever thing to do for where we were on that site in that neighborhood for that type of user. I wouldn't call it a trend.''
 Also, in its design and appeal, the Chelsea Arts Tower is actually closer to retail space than office space, Mr. Weisman said.
 The office condominiums created through renovations at 125 Maiden Lane and 14 Wall Street in the financial district have also attracted attention for their prime locations and sizes. Both have floor areas at the high end of the range typical in office condominiums in the city, which are about 5,000 to 25,000 square feet.
 The owners of both buildings said they hoped to appeal to nonprofit organizations and government agencies. The Empire State Development Corporation, a state authority, plans to move into 125 Maiden Lane. 
 Spaces in the 350,000-square-foot Maiden Lane building, where current tenants have been offered the option to buy, range in price from $350 to $425 a foot, said Francis Greenburger, chairman of Time Equities. 
 Office condominiums in the lower floors of 14 Wall Street, which will be listed for $400 to $425 a foot, are not yet on the market. The developer, Leviev Boymelgreen, hopes to attract nonprofit organizations seeking security or companies that do not have the wherewithal to purchase a whole building, said Edan Shiboleth, director of the developer's finance and investment group.
 The company will also be marketing office condominium space at the base of 15 Broad Street, in the financial district.
 Typically, small companies, perhaps doctor's offices, accountants or architects, foreseeing little or no employee growth and trying to stabilize expenses might be candidates for office condominiums. But the biggest demand comes from nonprofit organizations, especially in New York City, which has more than 25,000 of them.
 Nonprofits are exempt from city real estate taxes when they own, which can save $5 to $10 a square foot, said Mr. Lebenstein of Colliers ABR. Owning a space also provides continuity for nonprofits, which can be subject to income fluctuations and are often in danger of being priced out of rental buildings.
 But office condominiums at prices around $400 a foot are out of the range of most nonprofits, said Suzanne Sunshine Mendel, vice president and head of the New York tristate region nonprofit practice group at CB Richard Ellis.
 ''If there was a product for $250 or $300 a foot, nonprofits could afford it,'' she said. ''But if you calculate a lease versus a buy, when you start getting up near $400 or $500 a foot, it's not worth it for a nonprofit to buy if they can sign a lease in the high $20s or low $30s a foot.''
 Several office condominiums being developed in Harlem may provide an alternative. They are an outgrowth of zoning that provides development bonuses when space is created for nonprofit or medical uses.
 For instance, half the 60,000 square feet of commercial space at 345 East 102nd Street has been leased to government, social service or health programs, and now, the developer, Glenwood Management, would like to sell the balance, for around $350 a square foot.
 ''It's advantageous to do a commercial condominium when you're dealing with not-for-profits,'' said Gary Jacob, executive vice president at Glenwood. ''That's why we're selling the space.''

HEADLINE: Venture Firm Is Giving Loans a Try 

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Charles River Ventures, one of the nation's oldest venture capital firms, has come up with an unusual program to attract promising entrepreneurs: It will offer loans of up to $250,000 to help them turn their ideas into fledgling businesses. 
 Doling out small loans is an unconventional strategy for a 36-year-old venture firm that has about $1.8 billion under management. But Charles River said it hoped that the program, to be announced Wednesday, would allow it to tap into a new generation of entrepreneurs who are increasingly starting companies on a shoestring. 
Those ventures are often backed by individual patrons known as angel investors, who typically take an equity stake before the venture firms have an opportunity to do so. 
 ''We think there are going to be a ton of companies that get started with a quarter-million to build consumer services on the Internet,'' said George Zachary, a partner at Charles River, which has offices in Waltham, Mass., and Silicon Valley. ''In an environment where a fewer number of deals are generating the majority of the gain, we think it is important to see as broad a selection of companies as possible.''
 Internet start-up companies are benefiting from the declining cost of software, hardware and bandwidth, and from the ability to market themselves through word of mouth and to generate revenue through online advertising.
 To illustrate the trend, Mr. Zachary pointed to Reddit, an Internet company that announced Tuesday that it had been acquired by Conde Nast Publications.
 The company, which lets users link to Web pages and vote on which deserve top billing, has received less than $100,000 in financing, yet had more than a million visitors last month, said Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder.
 Under the program, called CRV QuickStart, promising applicants will be invited to meet with Charles River partners, who would decide quickly whether to offer the loan. Charles River would then have a right to be part of the company's first real round of venture financing, where it would invest beside others. 
 The loans, which would be unsecured, would carry an interest rate of 6 percent, but the idea is not to become a bank.
 ''We view this as a tool of access into deals rather than a money-making proposition,'' Mr. Zachary said.
 The terms of the first venture round would not be predetermined by the loan. And the recipients would arrive at the first round of venture financing owning 100 percent of their company, Mr. Zachary said. 
 The Charles River program is one of many initiatives by venture firms that are trying to get in at the earliest stage of start-up companies.
 ''A lot of venture firms are coming up with ways to make smaller investments,'' said Ron Conway, a longtime angel investor who has financed 400 start-ups. ''I think the earlier the V.C.'s get into the food chain, the better.''
 Mr. Conway said he had not heard of a venture firm setting up a formal lending program for start-ups.
 But David Sze, a partner at Greylock Partners, which has led small investments in promising Internet start-ups like Digg, said the program could force entrepreneurs to commit to a particular venture firm before they are ready to do so.
 ''I'm not sure whether there will be an advantage to an entrepreneur,'' he said.
 For its part, Reddit is made up of three co-founders and one part-time employee. The company's top three expenses are food, Web host fees and rent for its Web servers, said Mr. Ohanian, who is 23. ''Food is probably third,'' Mr. Ohanian said, adding that the founders have maintained ''the college lifestyle of pizza and the occasional Chinese takeout.''

HEADLINE: New Czars of Conspicuous Consumption 

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Who would boast that their wares are the world's most expensive? Those selling to a select class of Russians. 
 Rich ones.
Vendors swished into Moscow this past weekend, setting up elaborate booths offering a range of high-priced products, from jets and yachts to private islands and more familiar luxury goods. 
 They were angling for a glance or hint of interest from Russia's oil barons, captains of industry and others whose origins of wealth are unclear. 
 Among them was Michael Morren, a dapper Swiss executive in a pin-striped suit, who was selling high-end cellphones for the GoldVish brand of Geneva. GoldVish handsets typically go for $18,000 to $150,000, somewhat higher than models from Nokia or Motorola. 
 For the crowd at Moscow's second annual Millionaire Fair, however, even GoldVish's usual prices didn't seem entirely appropriate. 
 The price for Mr. Morren's diamond-studded cellphone? A mere $1.27 million.
 Five years into an oil boom, Moscow is becoming one of the hottest markets for luxury goods. Already, it counts 25 billionaires, along with a healthy number of Russia's total of 88,000 millionaires.
 The GoldVish cellphone, for example, glitters with 120 carats of diamonds, encrusting a case of white gold. 
 And if the sparkle alone did not draw in customers, Mr. Morren hired a blonde model to hold up a plaque declaring: ''Certificate of the most expensive mobile phone.'' 
 Nobody was challenging that claim.
 ''Somebody is wearing a nice watch and nice jewelry,'' explained Mr. Morren, the president of GoldVish. ''And then the phone rings. It doesn't match. It's a piece of plastic. We make it match.''
 Though a good deal of the oil money is trickling down to ordinary people, the elite class of Russian rich are definitely growing richer, according to Peter Westin, the chief economist at MDM Bank, a Russian bank in Moscow. 
 He says that the gap between rich and poor is widening in Russia, though it is still not as extreme as in the United States, according to a statistical measure by the World Bank.
 Perhaps that's because poverty is shrinking here and there are still fewer rich people than in America. But they are trying to make up for lost time. 
 ''Russians always loved luxury but lived in poverty,'' said Olga V. Kryshtanovskaya, a sociologist studying the Russian elite. 
 ''This attraction to luxury became known as the 'palace style.' In a tiny Moscow apartment we would hang a giant crystal chandelier, like in a palace.'' 
 And with each passing year of soaring commodity prices, very rich Russians are taking on more of the swagger and style of Arabian oil sheiks, as well as their spendthrift habits. 
 Andrei Melnichenko, then a 33-year-old banker, married a Serbian model near Cannes in a ceremony that cost $40 million in September last year. 
 It was the social event of the year for Russian oligarchs; for the nuptials, the couple dismantled an Orthodox church in Russia and re-assembled it in France. 
 There are rich people. And then there are the Russian rich.
 ''A lot of rich people here don't say how they earn their money,'' said Karsten Jacob, a salesman for Bugatti sports cars at the fair. ''They wear sports shoes and training suits, and they walk up to our 1.3 million euro car and say, 'Where can I buy it?' ''
 Mr. Jacob was standing beside a $1.65 million Bugatti Veyron sports car that was hand-made in France. Its top speed is 253 miles per hour. Over the weekend, the display model was sold to an anonymous Russian buyer, who paid full price.
 Such conspicuous consumption is reflected in a Russian joke making the rounds. It describes how one wealthy businessman tells a friend of buying a tie for $100. ''You fool,'' the other responds. ''You can get the same tie for $200 just across the street.'' 
 Vyachislav Y. Nikishin, a client at the fair, said Russia's recent history suggested wild spending was not so foolish, after all. 
 ''Spend while you can'' is a motto that has come to shape behavior, given the sometimes short-lived prominence of entrepreneurs, business tycoons and other moneyed players in Russia's pell-mell business environment. 
 Saving money in a bank might also be seen as foolhardy, for banking crises have occurred frequently. ''It doesn't do any good to put it in a bank,'' Mr. Nikishin said. ''We have the bitter experience.''
 The Millionaire Fair, a traveling exhibit begun in the Netherlands in 2002, has had its greatest success in Moscow. At the fair's other venues, in Amsterdam, Cannes, Shanghai and Kortrijk, Belgium, people came more to gawk. Russians came here to buy. 
 Last year in Moscow, vendors did $600 million worth of business, selling gilded computer mice, curvy sports cars, Caribbean yacht charters and villas off the coast of Dubai, said Natalya A. Zadvornaya, the spokeswoman for the fair. 
 By comparison, the show in Amsterdam this year rang up sales of $300 million. 
 The Moscow fair is gaining attention. In 2005, 25,000 people showed up. This year, Ms. Zadvornaya said, 40,000 stopped by the cavernous exhibition space. 
 Not surprisingly, there was more than a touch of gaudiness.
 At one booth, a company hawked villas on an island off Panama. The island was once owned by John Wayne, and to give sales a boost, the display included a model wearing only body paint, in the image of a cowboy outfitted with bandana, vest, cartridge belt and revolvers. 
 Elsewhere, a jeweler sold a gold-plated pacifier.
 GoldVish, the bejeweled phone maker, sold 15 handsets, though not the $1.27 million phone. 
 Diamonds and gold aside, the phone is quite functional: it comes with Bluetooth, a camera, MP3 player and text messaging. The charger is included, too -- gold-plated, of course.

HEADLINE: A Gamble Bound to Win, Eventually

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
Email: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A couple of years ago, Robert E. Rubin -- eminence grise at Citigroup and the Democratic Party's economic wise man -- decided that the United States dollar was headed for a fall.
 This view put Mr. Rubin in good company. Nearly everyone who spends time thinking about the American economy believes that the value of the dollar has to fall at some point.
 The United States has been borrowing enormous sums of money from other countries, largely so that American consumers can turn around and buy the computers, clothing and other goods those countries make. Like all borrowing booms, this one will eventually subside. When it does -- and foreign investors stop buying so many dollars to lend back to us -- the dollar will drop. 
 With this chain of events in mind, a former colleague of Mr. Rubin's at Goldman Sachs had been whispering in his ear that anybody who didn't have 20 or 30 percent of his holdings tied to other currencies was ''out of his mind.'' 
 Yet as Mr. Rubin told me last week, his finances at the time were ''totally dollar-based.'' (As are yours, in all likelihood.)
 So he decided to bet against the dollar by buying options on other currencies. It turned out to be a very bad bet. 
 This is a column about why Mr. Rubin's logic made perfect sense -- why it still does, in fact -- yet why most people who have made similar bets in recent years have taken a bath. Warren E. Buffett cost Berkshire Hathaway almost $1 billion last year shorting the dollar. On the opposite end of the investing spectrum, I put a small amount of my retirement savings last year into a T. Rowe Price mutual fund that is linked more directly to foreign currencies than most foreign-stock funds are. It has delivered a return of negative 7 percent. 
 The fate of the dollar, to be blunt, often seems like one of the most boring economic subjects around. It doesn't offer obvious ''Freakonomics''-type lessons about the foibles of everyday life. Instead, it has inspired a stack of policy papers filled with terms like current-account deficit and trade-weighted exchange rate. 
 But it really is worth trying to understand what's going on. In the end, the value of the dollar will go a long way toward determining how well Americans live: which food we can afford to eat, which cars we can buy, which foreign policy we can pursue. As Mr. Rubin says: ''It is vitally important. It has the potential to affect all of us.''
 The simplest way to explain the problem is to say that the United States has been living beyond its means.
 Both the federal government and American families have been spending more money than they take in, leaving both in debt. To close the gap between our resources and our spending habits, we have borrowed from abroad. It's the only option.
 The net amount of money leaving the United States -- that is, the amount of money we need to borrow back to support our lifestyle -- has soared to $800 billion a year. ''It's just stunning,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. ''It's unprecedented.''
 The big question now is how will the situation reverse itself. It could happen gradually, with other countries slowly reducing their purchase of dollars. This wouldn't be horrible, as Americans discovered when the dollar dropped in the 1980s. But most of us would be worse off for the simple reason that foreign loans would no longer be letting us live beyond our means. 
 The other possibility is that an unexpected event -- a spike in oil prices, say -- could cause foreign investors to cut their dollar purchases sharply, bringing all sorts of economic havoc. Edwin M. Truman, an economist who spent a quarter-century at the Federal Reserve, compares the situation to a merry-go-round that is moving too fast for its underlying mechanics. It gradually loses speed, leaving its riders disappointed but unscathed, or it stops suddenly and throws some of them off their horses. 
 Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman who whipped inflation in the '80s, has become sufficiently worried to call the circumstances as ''dangerous and intractable'' as any he can remember. Yet, he laments, no one in Washington is taking steps to minimize the risks. 
 Whatever the outcome, a decline in the dollar will probably be part of it. That's why Mr. Rubin made his bet. But the dollar didn't cooperate. While no longer at the highs it reached in 2002, it has stayed strong. Mr. Rubin ended up losing more than $1 million (which, certainly, he can afford) before getting out of the currency market.
 Throughout his career -- as an arbitrage trader at Goldman, as the Treasury secretary who led the 1995 bailout of Mexico -- he has argued that decisions should not be judged solely on the outcome. Somebody could do a perfectly good job of weighing the relevant risks, make a call that maximizes the chances of success and still not succeed, because the world is a messy, unpredictable place.
 This point has usually been somewhat academic, however, because his results have generally been good. At Goldman, he rose to become co-chairman thanks partly to his trading record. In the Clinton administration, he won more than his share of policy arguments and helped guide the economy to its best performance of the last 30 years. 
 But when he talks about the dollar, you can see how hard it is, even for somebody with his self-assurance, to remain confident in the face of a failed prediction. ''I think I was right, probabilistically,'' he said recently, sitting in his Citigroup office overlooking Park Avenue. ''But I don't know. I really don't. I don't think anyone does. It's also possible that none of this could happen. It's possible that for reasons none of us can see that this will work itself out in a very copacetic way.''
 Mr. Rubin and the other dollar bears look a little like the skeptics of the real estate boom back in 2005. For years, those skeptics warned that things had gotten out of hand and that reality would soon reassert itself. And for years, they were wrong. The longer they were wrong, the more out of touch they sound. 
 How is that housing boom going, anyway?

HEADLINE: N.Y.S.E. Will Close a Trading Floor Room

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange plans to close one of the five rooms on its trading floor over the next 18 months, shrinking that space for the first time in more than a century as more shares change hands electronically. 
 The room being shut occupies 10,000 square feet at 30 Broad Street in downtown Manhattan and was opened six years ago, at the height of the technology stock bubble. It is currently home to 33 floor brokerage firms and Bear Wagner Specialists, a unit of Bear Stearns. They will be relocated, along with trading of 503 stocks, including Citigroup, Xerox and the NYSE Group, the exchange's parent company.
The decision reflects the shift to more computer-based stock trading after 214 years dominated by face-to-face haggling. 
 In October, the Big Board began lifting some restrictions on electronic transactions as part of its so-called hybrid market. That system will automate many of the tasks done by floor traders, allowing them to handle shares of more companies at the same time.

HEADLINE: An Activist, Then a Journalist, and Now a Victim of the Violence He Covered

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN; Elisabeth Malkin in Mexico City and Carolyn Wilder in New York contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When Bradley Will traveled to a state in southern Mexico last month, his goal was to document and describe the turbulence in the region, where striking teachers and their allies demanding the resignation of the state's governor have clashed at times with armed attackers.
 The conflict had received scant attention in much of the news media, but it was exactly the kind of situation that Mr. Will relished witnessing and writing about. He often traveled from New York City to Latin America to chronicle little-known disputes, and his articles made him a familiar figure in the world of the alternative media. 
On Friday, Mr. Will, 36, was fatally shot in the chest while videotaping near a barricaded road at the edge of the city of Oaxaca, the capital of the state with the same name, during a confrontation between demonstrators equipped with Molotov cocktails and fireworks and a group of men armed with pistols and rifles. Witnesses have said that Mr. Will was hit by bullets fired toward the demonstrators.
 Five people have been detained in connection with the shooting, including two local officials and two police officers. State officials are running the investigation, and a spokesman for President Vicente Fox said that the federal government could take over the inquiry if state authorities did not do an adequate job. Human rights groups and a New York-based organization that advocates on behalf of journalists have called for the federal government to take over the investigation immediately.
 ''The story of the situation in Oaxaca was not getting out,'' said Beka Economopoulos, a friend who lives in New York and works for an environmental group. ''Brad died trying to get the story of what was happening in Oaxaca out to the world.'' 
 Although Mr. Will grew up in Illinois and lived for years on the Lower East Side, he traveled from coast to coast to attend protests on a variety of issues, sometimes getting to far-flung spots by riding the rails in empty box cars.
 Mr. Will's writings appeared in newspapers and on Web sites run by the Independent Media Center, a collective of left-leaning volunteers organized in chapters around the world, who commonly act as both participants in events and chroniclers of them. Its reporters and photographers typically include personal observations as they document issues that they have strong feelings about, like the war in Iraq or the impact of global trade on the developing world. 
 Mr. Will had a long history of advocating for environmental causes and attending political demonstrations in the United States. In his travels to Latin America, Mr. Will, at times, found himself in perilous settings. In a 2005 article about squatters in Brazil, he described being shot at by the authorities and detained. Friends said that Mr. Will was haunted by violence he witnessed there.
 ''He was really affected by that,'' said Seth Tobocman, an artist in New York who discussed the experience with Mr. Will. ''He started out as an activist and became a journalist so he could tell people about what he saw.''
 In his last written dispatch, which was posted on Oct. 16 on a Web site maintained by the New York City chapter of the Independent Media Center, Mr. Will described the killing of a man in Oaxaca and said that some people in Oaxaca blamed the death on paramilitary vigilantes. 
 The images filmed by Mr. Will minutes before his death, which are on the Independent Media Center's Web site, show a chaotic scene, in which men used slingshots to shoot projectiles and gunshots can be heard. At one point, Mr. Will appears to videotape from beneath a truck, aiming his lens at a man firing a pistol. Minutes later, during the final images of the video, a cry is heard and the camera appears to fall to the ground.
 Mr. Will's funeral was held Saturday in Oaxaca. A priest splashed holy water onto his coffin and a woman bent down to kiss its side. Mr. Will's mother and father, along with two sisters and a brother, issued a statement mourning Mr. Will's death.
 ''We are grieving over the tragic and senseless loss of Brad's life,'' it read in part. ''We believe he died doing what he loved.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: City Balances Budget For 26th Year 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN (NYT); Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
New York City ended its 2006 fiscal year on June 30 with its books balanced for the 26th consecutive year, according to an annual report presented yesterday by Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. The final budget, $54 billion, included transfers and subsidies of $3.75 billion that are being used to eliminate a deficit that had been projected for the current fiscal year. Mr. Thompson warned that rising interest rates, the falling housing market and high energy costs were the major risks to the city's short-term economic growth. SEWELL CHAN (NYT)

PERSON: Clifford Geertz

HEADLINE: Clifford Geertz, Cultural Anthropologist, Is Dead at 80

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Clifford Geertz, the eminent cultural anthropologist whose work focused on interpreting the symbols he believed give meaning and order to people's lives, died on Monday in Philadelphia. He was 80 and lived in Princeton, N.J. 
 The cause was complications after heart surgery, according to an announcement by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he had been on the faculty since 1970.
 Best known for his theories of culture and cultural interpretation, Mr. Geertz was considered a founder of interpretive, or symbolic, anthropology. But his influence extended far beyond anthropology to many of the social sciences, and his writing had a literary flair that distinguished him from most theorists and ethnographers.
 He won a National Book Critics Circle Award for ''Works and Lives: The Anthropologist as Author'' (1988), which examined four of his discipline's forebears: Bronislaw Malinowski, Ruth Benedict, E. E. Evans-Pritchard and Claude Levi-Strauss. 
 Drawing on history, psychology, philosophy and literary criticism, Mr. Geertz analyzed and decoded the meanings of rituals, art, belief systems, institutions and other ''symbols,'' as he defined them.
 ''Believing with Max Weber that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning,'' he wrote in his 1973 book, ''The Interpretation of Cultures'' (Basic Books). The Times Literary Supplement called the book one of the 100 most important since World War II.
 Mr. Geertz also wrote voluminously on his fieldwork in Indonesia and Morocco. In one of his most widely cited essays, ''Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight,'' included in ''The Interpretation of Cultures,'' he analyzed the kinship and social ties that are constructed, emphasized and maintained in this form of ritual ''deep play'' as if they were ''an assemblage of texts.'' 
 In his writings, Mr. Geertz drew a careful distinction between culture and social structure, differentiating himself from functionalists like Levi-Strauss, who believed that rituals, institutions and other aspects of a culture could be best understood by the purposes they serve. 
 Whereas social structure embraces economic, political and social life and its institutional forms, Mr. Geertz said, culture is ''a system of meanings embodied in symbols'' that provide people with a frame of reference to understand reality and animate their behavior. Culture, he argued, fills the gap between those things that are biological givens for our species and those we need to function in a complex, interdependent and changing world. 
 In short, in the Geertz formulation, the question to ask about cultural phenomena is not what they do, but what they mean. Mr. Geertz also argued against the idea that one could define the essence of humanity across all cultures. 
 ''The notion that the essence of what it means to be human is most clearly revealed in those features of human culture that are universal rather than in those that are distinctive to this people or that is a prejudice that we are not obliged to share,'' he wrote in 1966. ''It may be in the cultural particularities of people -- in their oddities -- that some of the most instructive revelations of what it is to be generically human are to be found.''
 Mr. Geertz was also deeply concerned about the anthropologist's role and the discipline's methodology. Recognizing the colonialist and Western heritage of anthropology, he believed that it was difficult for anyone from one culture to represent another accurately and meaningfully. He noted that anthropologists were hardly passive, objective observers, but rather individual creators of narratives, with their own voice. 
 Arguing that ethnographic reality does not exist apart from anthropologists' written versions of it, he said that cultures and peoples should speak for themselves, with anthropologists learning to ''converse with them'' and interpret them.
 In his book ''Local Knowledge: Further Essays in Interpretive Anthropology'' (Basic Books, 1983), Mr. Geertz also addressed the question of whether someone from one culture can objectively understand another.
 For him, the anthropologist's task is to use what he called thick description to interpret symbols by observing them in use. Therefore the anthropologist must be both empirically rigorous and a savvy interpreter, akin to a psychoanalyst. In 1972 he wrote that ''cultural analysis is (or should be) guessing at meanings, assessing the guesses and drawing explanatory conclusions from the better guesses.''
 Mr. Geertz's elaborate theorizing and his later doubts about the limits of anthropological knowledge left some scholars nonplussed. As Jonathan Benthall, writing in The New Statesman in 1995, said: ''He disappoints some colleagues because he comes up with no overarching theories.''
 Clifford Geertz was born on Aug. 23, 1926, in San Francisco, the son of Clifford and Lois Geertz. During World War II, he served in the Navy.
 He received a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1950 from Antioch College, where a professor urged him to pursue his interests in values by studying anthropology. He went on to the social relations department at Harvard, where he studied with the anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn and the sociologist Talcott Parsons, receiving his Ph.D. in 1956.
 Around this time, he did the first of a half dozen fieldwork stints in Indonesia, spending 1952 to 1954 in the central Javanese village of Pare. His early work on Indonesia combined aspects of more conventional ethnography and history with concerns about economic and political development in the wake of decolonization.
 ''The Religion of Java'' (1960), his first major work, is an ethnographic description of Javanese religion. ''Agricultural Involution'' (1963) takes a big-picture view of modernization and economic development in the wake of Indonesian independence, while ''Peddlers and Princes'' (1963) focuses on development from the more microscopic level of the towns of Modjokuto in Java and Tabanan in Bali. A century of social development in Modjokuto is the subject of ''The Social History of an Indonesian Town'' (1965).
 ''Kinship in Bali'' (1975), written with his first wife, the anthropologist Hildred Storey, posited ''an underlying order in Balinese kinship practices'' in the cultural realm of symbols, patterns and ideas, despite differences in practices, or social structure, in different parts of the island. 
 ''Negara: The Theater State in 19th Century Bali'' (1981) examined the nature of royal families in tiny pre-colonial south Balinese kingdoms, while challenging the ''power-centered tradition of political theory from Machiavelli and Hobbes to Marx.
 Mr. Geertz's marriage to Ms. Storey, who accompanied him on some of his early fieldwork, ended in divorce in 1982. She is a professor emeritus in the department of anthropology at Princeton. He is survived by his wife, Karen Blu, an anthropologist whom he married in 1987; his children from his first marriage, Erika Reading of Princeton, and Benjamin, of Kirkland, Wash.; and two grandchildren. 
 After beginning his academic career as a research associate and instructor at Harvard, Mr. Geertz spent two years in California. From 1958 to 1959, he was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto; he was later an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. From 1960 until 1970, Mr. Geertz taught at the University of Chicago, becoming a full professor in 1964. He joined the Institute for Advanced Study in 1970 as its first Professor of the Social Sciences and from 1978 to '79 taught at Oxford University. 
 Because of political turmoil in Indonesia, Mr. Geertz later turned his attention to Morocco, where he began doing fieldwork in the ancient village of Sefrou in 1963, returning five more times over the course of his career. 
 Profoundly influenced by his fieldwork there, he honed his comparative and historical approach in ''Islam Observed'' (1968), which the anthropologist Edmund Leach praised as ''a highly insightful comparison between Islam as interpreted by Indonesians and Islam interpreted by Moroccans.'' 
 By the end of his career, Mr. Geertz had grown discouraged about the ability of social science to generalize or develop sweeping theories, concluding that circumstances are too different among cultures, across time, and within societies. At the same time, he was heartened by the what he called the deprovincialization of anthropology, as the profession came to embrace ever more Asian, Middle Eastern and other non-Western scholars.
 In his 1995 memoir, ''After the Fact: Two Countries, Four Decades, One Anthropologist,'' Mr. Geertz eloquently meditated on his field work and academic career, concluding that anthropology is ''an excellent way, interesting, dismaying, useful and amusing, to expend a life.''

HEADLINE: Grading a School's Grades

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

DATELINE: SIMSBURY, Conn. 

 BODY:
Standards have always been high at Simsbury High School, with A's earned, not handed out haphazardly. But in an era of widespread grade inflation, grades here actually went down. 
 Alarms went off all over this affluent, woodsy suburb northwest of Hartford. Parents became concerned that their teenagers might lose ground in the ever stiffening competition for admission to elite colleges.
Into the breach stepped Robert M. Hartranft, whose son had graduated from Simsbury, and who had little previous involvement with grading. 
 Mr. Hartranft, a nuclear engineer who had been forced to retire early because of Parkinson's disease, came up with what he thinks is a rigorous mathematical model to compare the school's demanding grading system with more lenient grading in other schools. The model, he and some local school administrators say, is a bold new way to think about grades. 
 ''I'm giving you a G.P.S. navigation system, as opposed to scraps of maps,'' Mr. Hartranft said. ''If all you have are scraps of maps, which is all that admissions offices get in the existing protocol, then this gives you an overall orientation.''
 Mr. Hartranft created an analytical method he calls the g.p.a. plot; it uses national data on grade-point averages and SAT scores to compare national grading norms with those at the local high school. The purpose, he said, is to reduce the variability and subjectivity of grades -- and to make it absolutely clear to college admissions offices that a B or B-plus at Simsbury may be the equivalent of an A at most high schools.
 Simsbury has included his statistical comparison in its admissions submissions for the last four years. In the suburb just to the north, Granby Memorial High School is using the g.p.a. plot for the first time this fall.
 Here in Simsbury, administrators and parents appear satisfied with the results of the model, even though it is unclear whether it has helped increase the number of Simsbury students admitted to elite colleges. Neil Sullivan, the high school's principal, said the proportion of students admitted by the most selective universities had increased somewhat over the last four years, after dipping slightly when the number of A's dropped sharply between 1998 and 2001. But the number of A's given out by Simsbury teachers has also increased in recent years. 
 Given how much more competitive admissions have become, Mr. Sullivan said, the g.p.a. plot may have helped raise Simsbury's overall results since it was introduced in 2003.
 Mr. Hartranft, who has disdain for what he sees as the soft, intuitive decision-making at many admissions offices, believes fervently that he has come up with a breakthrough tool to make admissions more exacting, if not scientific. Not everyone is convinced, however. School officials in Avon, a suburb south of Simsbury, have resisted the idea. 
 ''What evidence do we have that college admissions officers understand the graph and how to apply it for college admissions?'' asked Richard W. Kisiel, the Avon superintendent of schools. ''Even my board, they couldn't understand it.''
 But some college admissions deans are intrigued by Mr. Hartranft's idea.
 ''Here is a school system that's being proactive and making a thoughtful, good-faith effort to help us understand their educational community,'' said William M. Shain, dean of admissions and financial aid at Bowdoin College. ''I support some creativity in figuring out what can be cited to give us useful context. Without context, grades have no meaning.''
 Other admissions officials questioned whether it makes any sense to use SAT scores as an external standard to compare schools' grading systems. 
 ''Those kinds of correlations between SATs and grades are really tricky,'' said Robert S. Clagett, dean of admissions at Middlebury College. ''I used to be a teacher, and I would hate to have somebody take my standards and arbitrarily correlate it to the SAT. It's attempting to make a science out of what is very much an art.''
 ''There are plenty of schools out there that pride themselves on having been relatively immune to grade inflation,'' Mr. Clagett added. ''We would rather just get straightforward information from the high school.''
 The comparison of grading systems may be especially useful for students who apply to large state universities, which often process tens of thousands of applications and tend to make admission decisions largely by the numbers, Mr. Hartranft and Mr. Sullivan said. It can also be extremely helpful, they said, when students apply for merit scholarships, which are not based on financial need and are often determined strictly by grades and SAT scores.
 Jo-Ann Lardie's three children graduated from Simsbury. Her oldest did not qualify for a large merit scholarship five years ago, she said, in part because his grades were not high enough. But her second child was awarded a large scholarship by the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps, which Mrs. Lardie attributed to the g.p.a. plot.
 When local parents began contesting a grading system that many thought too harsh, Mr. Hartranft, who retired seven years ago at 55, found himself with time and analytical skills to contribute. 
 ''I'm a certified workaholic and I needed something to work on,'' he said.
 Trying to devise a rigorous way to demonstrate the demanding nature of Simsbury's grading, he said he thought through the problem for hours on end, often while lying in bed with his eyes closed to alleviate the effects of the Parkinson's.
 He decided he needed an external standard, something that would compare grades at the local school with those around the country. His solution was the SAT.
 He took the scores of 1.5 million students and graphed them against the students' grade-point averages, as reported by the students on their SAT exams. In a given year, for instance, the analysis might show that on average nationally, students with an A average had a combined SAT score of 1,150, under the old two-part aptitude test. Then he would perform the same comparison for students at Simsbury, where, on average, a student with an A average might have a combined score of 1,220.
 An individual Simsbury student's grade-point average is then plotted against the national norms; in this example, it might show that someone with an A average at Simsbury performed equivalently to A-plus students nationally.
 The analysis, Mr. Hartranft argues, is the most accurate method yet to show how grades at one high school compare with grades elsewhere. 
 Mr. Hartranft has recently developed a more complex analytical system, which he thinks enables schools to measure students within each course with more precision than an ordinary grade and also gives colleges a more rigorous way to predict how an applicant will perform in college. As with the g.p.a. plot, he offers the new method, called the Standardized Academic Scoring System, to schools without charge (details can be found at hartranft.org).

HEADLINE: Global Warming: Let's Do Better

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Budgets Falling in Race to Fight Global Warming'' (''The Energy Challenge'' series, front page, Oct. 30):
 As the evidence for global warming continues to mount, it still never breaks into the top 10 issues that concern voters. 
 Yet if the growing consensus of scientists is correct, global warming represents a greater threat to the future of our children than any of the issues that place well above it. 
 The Republicans, with their heavy indebtedness to the energy industry, would like nothing better than to keep it that way. The Democrats, who seem to fear offending any potential voter, aren't saying much about it either.
 Those who advocate doing nothing, or very little, like to point out that there is a lack of certainty in the global warming debate. But this lack of certainty should be a call for action, not inaction. 
 My daughter will soon be celebrating her fifth birthday. I can't look at her without thinking that before long she will be a young adult. I fear for the state of planet she will inherit if we continue to do nothing to protect it.
 We cannot continue to place the weight of our excesses today on the backs of our children tomorrow. They deserve better, and we can do better.

Bob Rosenbluth
Lincolndale, N.Y., Oct. 30, 2006

To the Editor:
 We can't wait for government or industry to finance searches for alternative energy sources. We have to take it upon ourselves as citizens of the earth to act now to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 
 Why can't we drive less, walk more, put out unneeded lights, lower thermostats, and so on, as well as reduce consumption, and reuse and recycle goods? 
 All it takes is a conscious effort by each of us to begin to slow global warming. Think about it. We can begin to do it now. We don't have to wait. 

Eve Winer
Flushing, Queens, Oct. 30, 2006

To the Editor:
 It is disheartening enough, from an ecological viewpoint, to note that our government devotes a shrinking budget to solving the puzzles of energy conservation and alternative energy sources. Our dependence on foreign oil is another big dimension of this issue.
 Washington would rather commit an endless flow of war dollars to ensure the flow of Middle East oil than to find a long-term solution to our energy needs. We seem to speak of oil only when we moan about the price of it. Yet it is oil that drives much of American foreign policy, and that will not change until we find efficient ways to use less of it.

Bruce J. Bloom
Southold, N.Y., Oct. 30, 2006

To the Editor:
 Despite the gloom, at least there is a public discussion about the causes and effects of global warming and the need for developing alternative energy sources.
 Missing entirely is a public discussion of how we prepare for the effects of rising ocean levels, an accelerating phenomenon well under way. 
 The melting of Arctic Sea ice cannot be stopped under the most hopeful of conditions for at least several decades, and perhaps a century or more. 
 Consider New Orleans. Why are we rebuilding that city when we know that there is a high likelihood that the Atlantic Ocean will rise three feet during the next 100 years?

John V. Kjellman
Henniker, N.H., Oct. 30, 2006

To the Editor:
 The widespread use of clean energy -- from wind, solar and hydropower -- is one of the solutions we need to fight global warming.
 While we must continue pushing for more federal financing for the research and development of low-emission energies to counter global warming, we need to look at a more powerful mechanism for catalyzing long-term change, the market. 
 In particular, we need to look at demand. 
 Stoking demand for clean energy will develop fertile markets that will inspire companies to capitalize on the opportunity and attract private-sector financing and investment, fostering additional innovation. 
 If demand is there and people know that money can be made, that will drive the change, creating the economy that will attract the money that will support the innovation. 
 As the saying goes, money goes to money.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Scandal Below the Surface,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Oct. 31): 
 At the risk of sounding like a wide-eyed naif, I'd like to suggest that those worried about the costs of a fight against the damage done by greenhouse emissions consider how much is being spent against another nebulous ''enemy,'' terrorism. 
 In fact, they are powerfully connected, in that increased alternative energy sources will reduce our need for oil found in the Middle East, and thus reduce our need to have a presence there. 
 A global war on climate change might not sound as masculine as the war being marketed, but it is ultimately more important, and is actually one we could all win. 
 For politicians without the will to curb crony capitalism, it would afford a means of doing some good while still bringing home the pork. 
 We can beat swords into solar cells.

HEADLINE: Students After the Storm, Left Alone and Angry

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
John McDonogh High School has at least 25 security guards, at the entrance, up the stairs and outside classes. The school has a metal detector, four police officers and four police cruisers on the sidewalk. 
 In the last six weeks, students at McDonogh, the largest functioning high school here, have assaulted guards, a teacher and a police officer. A guard and a teacher were beaten so badly that they were hospitalized.
 The surge hints at a far-reaching phenomenon after Hurricane Katrina, educators here say. Teenagers in the city are living alone or with older siblings or relatives, separated by hundreds of miles from their displaced parents. Dozens of McDonogh students fend largely for themselves, school officials say.
 ''They are here on their own,'' Wanda Daliet, a science teacher, said. ''They are raising themselves. And they are angry.'' 
 The principal, Donald Jackson, estimated that up to a fifth of the 775 students live without parents.
 ''Basically, they are raising themselves, because there is no authority figure in the home,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''If I call for a parent because I'm having an issue, I may be getting an aunt, who may be at the oldest 20, 21. What type of governance, what type of structure is in the home, if this is the living conditions?''
 In a second-floor cosmetology class, two of the six girls said their parents were elsewhere.
 ''I don't get to talk to her as much as I want,'' one girl, Tiffany Mansion, 16, said as she looked down.
 Her mother is in Little Rock, Ark. 
 In the lunchroom, a shy 18-year-old who was asked whom he went home to in the evenings, said: ''Nobody. Myself.'' 
 His parents are in Baton Rouge. 
 Mr. Jackson said many parents whom he had spoken to were in Baton Rouge, Houston or elsewhere. ''That's the question that's buzzing in everybody's heads,'' the McDonogh curriculum coordinator, Toyia Washington Kendrick, said. ''How could you leave your kids here, that are school-age kids, unattended?''
 The answer is as various as the fragmented social structure, which the hurricane a year ago made even more complicated. Some students describe families barely functional even before the storm. Others say pressing economic necessity has kept parents away. 
 Rachelle Harrell was living in Houston, working as a medical assistant and trying to pay off a $1,300 electricity bill in New Orleans. But she yielded to her son Justin and his cousin Kiante, both 16, and sent them back to New Orleans on a Greyhound bus while she stayed in Texas. 
 The decision anguished Ms. Harrell, 36, even though Justin was being picked on in Houston and yearned to return to McDonogh. Justin; his sister, Eboni Gay, 18; and Kiante set up housekeeping in Ms. Harrell's old house in the Algiers neighborhood. A monthly check from his mother and a job at a fast-food restaurant helped make ends meet. 
 Ms. Harrell anticipated the inevitable question. 
 '' 'Why are your children at home, and you're in Texas?' '' she asked. ''Well, I'm trying to get home. It's just crazy. But my kids know my situation. When school started, I had to work a couple of more weeks, because I had that light bill. 
 ''It's like, 'Oh my God, is everything O.K.?' I couldn't even sleep at night. O.K. Lord, if anything happens, I'm going to be seen as such a bad mama, and I'm a hundred miles from home.'' 
 Last week, she left her job in Houston and returned to New Orleans -- for good. 
 If the causes are complicated, the consequences seem evident to school officials: a large cadre of belligerent students, hostile to authority and with no worry about parental punishment at home.
 Since McDonogh reopened nearly two months ago with enrollees from 5 of the city's 15 high schools, the students have committed six ''very serious'' assaults, Mr. Jackson said. 
 A young man suddenly bent over in the milling crowd waiting for a bus after school. The police were handcuffing him, for smoking marijuana, a school official said. 
 In the halls, students jostle one another and laugh on the way to class. In some classes, students strain attentively toward the blackboard. 
 But there is tension. The storm overturned their world, teachers and administrators say, destroying houses and scattering families. 
 ''They're rebelling against authority,'' Ms. Daliet, the science teacher, said. ''You ask them to do something, they have an attitude.'' 
 In the lunchroom and in the corridors, students are ordered to tuck in their shirts. Many just grin in response. 
 ''When you have guidelines at home that reflect guidelines at the school, it's a seamless transition,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''But when it's not there, you deal with a student who's genuinely, 'I don't care, I'm going to do what I want to do.' ''
 Fights break out daily. About 50 students have been suspended; 20 have been recommended for expulsion. 
 Of the 128 schools in the city, fewer half have reopened. The state took over many of them after the storm. That change, hailed at first as a bright beginning, has proven to be partly stillborn, as teachers, textbooks and supplies came up drastically short in the state-run schools.
 The McDonogh library has no books. State officials, fearing mold, threw out all of them.
 Rundown before the storm, the school buildings are now even more battered. The stalls in a girls' restroom have no doors. 
 Recrimination and finger pointing have been ample, and state officials are on the defensive. 
 ''The same way other residents are calling it quits, teachers are no different,'' Leslie Jacobs, a member of the state school board, said. ''The teacher shortage is real. The book shortage is real. We have a labor shortage. There is a shortage of bus drivers. The whole food-service industry is short of workers.''
 Mr. Jackson is a smiling, purposeful presence, friendly but firm, upbraiding youths for slovenly dress and pursuing others along for slacking in the halls. At every turn, it can seem, an omnipresent security guard or police officer speaks to teenagers, searching for weapons or admonishing for back talk. 
 As a group milled on the street corner of the three-story 1911 brick building, a guard called out from the steps: ''He's taken his shirt off! They're getting ready to fight!'' 
 Three burly police officers quickly went up Esplanade Avenue to break up the clash. 
 Mr. Jackson conceded that the scale of the unrest had taken him aback.
 ''I knew it would happen,'' he said. ''I had some forewarning. But I didn't know it would be of this magnitude. We've seen things that really shouldn't occur in a school.''
 Several weeks ago, a teacher was ''beaten unmercifully'' by a ninth grader enraged at being barred from class because he was late, Mr. Jackson said. The teacher, hospitalized, has not returned to work. The student was arrested. 
 An 18-year-old knocked a guard unconscious. The police charged him. 
 The reputation for violence, first acquired through a shooting in the gymnasium in 2003 in which a young man with a rifle killed a student in front of 200 others, has grown. 
 Three weeks ago, a group of students summoned reporters to the school to complain about the many officers. 
 ''We have a lot of security guards, and not enough teachers,'' Maya Dawson, 17, said. 
 Jerinise Walker, 15, added: ''It's like you're in jail. You have people watching you all the time.'' 
 Mr. Jackson said the time had not come to reduce security. 
 ''When we get our students to respond in a different way,'' he said, ''then I can back off. We're trying to train our students to resolve conflict, and that's something they haven't been able to do.''

HEADLINE: For North Korean Resort, Symbol of Engagement, Nuclear Test's Fallout Is Financial 

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: ONJEONGRI, North Korea, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
South Korean officials say this resort, nestled at the foot of towering Mount Kumgang on North Korea's east coast, promotes the eventual reunification of the two Koreas by giving North Koreans at least a glimpse of outsiders and increasing economic ties between Pyongyang and Seoul. 
 But a visit to this outpost of glittering consumerism amid Communist drabness revealed the limits of the South's much-vaunted Sunshine Policy, which has sought to reform Pyongyang's reclusive Stalinist regime peacefully through economic engagement.
The tourists, mostly South Koreans in ski parkas, moved about in buses, separated from North Koreans toiling in cabbage fields by fences and soldiers standing at stiff attention. The resort itself had the feeling of an Antarctic camp, with its own generators, vegetable plots, a health clinic and a Family Mart convenience store. 
 The few North Koreans who met their neighbors from the South -- waitresses and hotel workers -- eagerly proclaimed the evils of American and South Korean aggression to their guests. 
 And while the resort has increased economic ties as hoped, some conservative South Koreans and the United States government fear the project is supplying the North with precious foreign currency to keep its leaders in luxury or, worse, to finance its nuclear program.
 As a result, the resort has become a diplomatic battleground following North Korea's nuclear test on Oct. 9. The United States has been pushing the South to close the resort. South Korea's leaders have refused. 
 The resort has also become something of a touchstone for the South's increased ambivalence over its Sunshine Policy. 
 Following the nuclear test, many South Koreans said they felt their nation has made little progress in bringing the two Koreas closer together despite a decade of engaging the North and investing hundreds of millions of dollars in capitalist projects like this one. A poll by a South Korean newspaper, JoongAng Ilbo, a day after the test found that 53 percent of respondents wanted the Mount Kumgang resort to close; 42 percent said it should remain open.
 Despite their disillusionment with engagement, though, most South Koreans remain unwilling to completely sever the growing economic ties between the two nations. They believe cutting off the North could start a war, drive North Korea into China's arms or end up hurting the North Korean people, whom they regard as impoverished cousins.
 ''The nuclear test has put Korea at a loss,'' said Lee Geun, a professor of international relations at Seoul National University, referring to the South. ''What has years of sending them cash and fertilizer accomplished? North Korea still ended up testing a nuclear bomb. But becoming hawkish isn't the alternative, either.''
 The Mount Kumgang resort was opened in 1998 by Hyundai Asan, which has spent $200 million to build its sprawling complex of roads, hotels and restaurants, as well as a port. The resort is the second-largest South Korean investment in the North, after a $300 million industrial park in Kaesong. 
 Hyundai Asan agreed to pay North Korea part of the proceeds from the resort as well as the salaries for North Korean workers. The company says it pays the North $9 million a month, or $40 a tourist.
 Since its start, the resort has provided almost a half-billion dollars in hard cash to North Korea, with no way of knowing how the regime has spent it. Even the South Korean government says it can only speculate where the money goes. Officials say they believe that the money is used, in part, to aid the local economy.
 Hyundai Asan opened the resort with high hopes that it would lure hikers from South Korea and abroad with Mount Kumgang's fabled rocky peaks and emerald-green streams, as well as help to lower tensions with the North. The company boasts that it has literally turned swords into plowshares, converting a North Korean naval base into a port for cruise ships and building a golf course on a former artillery base.
 The resort, though, has struggled to make money, in part because of high operating costs and the reluctance of many South Koreans to visit the North. The company says that the nuclear test, coming at the height of the autumn tourist season, only made things worse. Hit by a wave of cancellations, Hyundai Asan now expects about 250,000 visitors this year, down from its original estimate of 370,000.
 When asked whether closing the resort would hurt them, many of the North Korean workers, identifiable by small red badges bearing the likeness of Kim Il-sung, their nation's founder and the father of its current leader Kim Jong-il, replied proudly that the North didn't need the South's money. Asked about the nuclear test, most repeated the regime's official line in stentorian tones. 
 Kim Eun-gyeong, a waitress at one hotel, said that when she heard about the test, she stood up and clapped. ''Before, the world mocked us,'' she said. ''Now, with this nuclear test, we are safe from the United States imperialists.''
 But a few spoke more candidly, if cautiously. On a path up the mountain, North Korean women selling bags of berries and fungi for use in medicinal teas said that the resort was a chance to earn hard cash. One said she came from Pyongyang because she could make $25 a month if sales were good. Another said she was saving up for marriage.
 For their part, South Koreans appeared to be learning more about the economic divide between the two countries. The residential section of Onjeongri, a town of about 2,000, was off limits to tourists. But from a distance, its white one-story homes looked run-down, and the half-dozen taller buildings were crumbling and had broken windows. At night, the town literally vanished into the darkness because of an apparent lack of electricity, leaving the resort's brightly lighted hotels standing in a black void. 
 ''This is like being on a spaceship on an alien planet,'' said Lee Jang-chon, a retired high school teacher from Seoul. He said that since the nuclear test, many of his friends have refused to visit Mount Kumgang.
 With South Korean presidential elections next year, the resort is likely to remain a target of opposition politicians. The industrial park in Kaesong has been less controversial because it is seen as introducing capitalism and most of its payments to the North are in workers' salaries.
 ''Mount Kumgang should be shut,'' said Kim Hyong-o, floor leader for the Grand National Party, the largest opposition party, ''until we can prove those dollars aren't going straight to Kim Jong-il and to building nuclear weapons and missiles.''
 Under mounting pressure at home and from Washington, President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea is scrambling to address public concerns. Officials said that his administration is considering changes to the resort, like paying the North in rice and fertilizer instead of cash. 
 Kim Young-hyun, the resort's manager, said that North Koreans had promised that the money went into the economy. He said he had seen signs of improvement, including more colorful clothing on Onjeongri's peasants, who also appear to own more bicycles.
 ''It is difficult for us to verify and keep track of where the money goes,'' Mr. Kim said. ''But if we shut Mount Kumgang down, we are going back to the 1970s and cold war-era confrontation.''
 There are other signs that the resort is having an effect on North Koreans, even if in limited ways.
 In one conversation, after initially reciting the official line on the threat of American imperialism, two North Korean workers showed intense curiosity in the economic changes in South Koreaand China, and in how Americans viewed their country. When told that Americans regarded their government as a police state ruled with a cult of personality, they nodded their heads in apparent agreement, without refuting the description.
 The two, who could face punishment if identified, said they thought their country would eventually reform and open up.
 ''I don't see any horns on your head,'' one of the North Koreans said. ''I hope you don't see any on mine, either.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 1 about the Mount Kumgang tourist resort in North Korea, run by the Hyundai Asan company of South Korea, misstated the monthly sum that the company pays to the North Korean government. It is $900,000, not $9 million.

HEADLINE: Democrats Discover New Political Frontier

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD, Colo., Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Campaigning in suburban Wheat Ridge in the rapidly fading October twilight, Ed Perlmutter, the Democratic Congressional candidate, knocked on the door of Maxine Dunham, a registered independent.
 ''Already voted,'' Mrs. Dunham quickly reassured Mr. Perlmutter, peering out to tell him he had locked up her support. ''You can relax.''
Mr. Perlmutter is probably unlikely to relax in the final days of his closely watched race with Rick O'Donnell, his Republican opponent, as the two kick their sophisticated get-out-the-vote machines into high gear. But Mr. Perlmutter and fellow Democrats in Colorado and neighboring states believe that unaffiliated voters like Mrs. Dunham are the key to what could be a turnaround in the party's political fortunes in the region.
 Despite a Republican edge in registration, Democrats are discovering the Mountain West -- and Colorado in particular -- to be a new political frontier as the party benefits from a potent mix of changing demographics, anger over the war in Iraq, resentment toward conservative social initiatives and millions of dollars' worth of advocacy advertising. 
 Republicans acknowledge that the political terrain is shifting along the Continental Divide but argue that any realignment will be temporary and due to the Iraq war more than any other factor. 
 ''We still have more registered Republicans by a pretty significant margin,'' said Representative Tom Tancredo, an advocate of tough immigration laws who is running for re-election in a nearby district, ''but it certainly appears an increasing number of independents or unaffiliated voters are now breaking more for the Democrats than the Republicans.''
 If that trend holds, Democrats could be in for a big day next Tuesday. The Democratic candidate for governor, Bill Ritter, is leading in his race against Bob Beauprez, a Republican congressman. If Democrats can retain control of the State House and Senate, which they gained in the 2004 elections, they would have total control of the state government for the first time since the early 1960s.
 ''It really is incredible,'' said Tom Schaller, a political scientist at the University of Maryland who explores the potential for Democratic gains in the West in a new book, ''Whistling Past Dixie.'' ''They had nothing three years ago.''
 Mr. Perlmutter has consistently led in polls in the Seventh District race in the Denver suburbs. Should he win, it would give Democrats at least a four-to-three advantage in the state's Congressional delegation. The fact that two other House races are even remotely competitive illustrates the changed political dynamic after years of Republican dominance.
 In neighboring states, Democrats are seen as having a good chance of capturing a Senate seat in Montana, are battling in what should be safe Republican House seats in Idaho and Wyoming, and have their eyes on Republican seats in Arizona and New Mexico. 
 The increasingly blue tinge of the formerly red region -- some say it gives new meaning to the phrase ''purple mountains'' -- has the national party seriously considering holding its 2008 presidential convention here at the foot of the Rockies.
 Republicans are hardly surrendering. Mr. O'Donnell is pushing ahead and on Monday trumpeted an endorsement from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, hoping the McCain name would resonate with independents. 
 Using a high-tech voter identification model, Mr. O'Donnell spent more than $30,000 to mail a letter of support from Mr. McCain along with his own 38-page platform to 20,000 independents and Democrats deemed receptive to the message.
 ''It was sent very strategically,'' said Mr. O'Donnell, who believes he can pull off a victory, although he acknowledges a tough environment for Republicans. ''I picked a heck of a year to run for Congress,'' he said Tuesday as he led volunteers on a local cleanup campaign intended to send the message that he would also help clean up Congress.
 Mr. Perlmutter has also focused on independents, trying to sway them by presenting his case that Republican control of Washington has been a failure. ''I just think that over the last few days the unaffiliated voters have really been watching what is going on closely, and they are leaning to the Democratic side,'' Mr. Perlmutter said.
 Mr. O'Donnell said he believed that Democratic electoral expectations in the West were overblown and that even if Democrats did have some success, Republicans would quickly recover. 
 Analysts and activists say the Democratic rise has been building quietly but steadily. Robert Duffy, a political science professor at Colorado State University, said he thought Republicans began losing the public's confidence after 2002, when the General Assembly was not seen to be responding strongly to an economic downturn but was instead caught up in political fights over redistricting and other peripheral issues.
 ''The state legislature and the governor seemed to be incapable of doing anything about it,'' Dr. Duffy said of the economic situation. 
 He and others said that many in the West, where Republicans exhibit a pronounced libertarian streak, had also grown weary of the social agenda that stirs Republicans in the South.
 ''They want someone to provide solutions to problems, and they are tired of the government getting too much in their business out there,'' said Nancy Keenan, a former state legislator in Montana who is now president of Naral Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights group that has been actively engaged in Western Congressional races.
 In one respect, the region's conservative leaders have fallen victim to their own success. Exerting strong control over the party in many communities, conservatives have been able to deliver victories for their candidates in party primaries over more moderate Republicans. 
 But the conservatives then struggle in the general election, sometimes because of hard feelings over the primaries, and Democrats have been able to sneak in. Party infighting over an open Republican House seat in the district around Colorado Springs is considered a factor in giving Democrats a chance at that seat.
 Members of both parties say there is another important but less well-known explanation for Democratic success in Colorado: an assertive advocacy campaign by wealthy progressives in the state who have poured millions of dollars into pro-Democratic advertising through independent 527 organizations, groups so named after the provision in the tax code that allows political spending as long as it is not formally coordinated with parties or candidates.
 The 527 groups were considered instrumental in the 2004 elections, when Democrats achieved a surprising takeover of the legislature and, at the federal level, won a Senate and a House seat. They have been active again this year, particularly in an effort to unseat Representative Marilyn Musgrave, who has supported a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.
 Democrats say the 2004 gains laid the groundwork for an expansion this year because the Democratic legislature was able to work with the departing Republican governor and address pressing problems in education, health care and immigration, demonstrating to skeptics that Democrats could govern.
 Both Mr. Perlmutter and Mr. O'Donnell, competing for the open seat now held by Mr. Beauprez, have said throughout the campaign that they will bring a similar sensibility to Washington, promising to inject new thinking into a Congress that has been plagued by partisanship and stalemate. 
 Now it is up to the voters in this evenly divided district, where the romance of the Rockies meets the pressures of 21st-century suburbia, to make a choice.
 ''I think people are ready,'' Mr. Perlmutter said. ''They have seen enough ads.'' 

This is the last article in a series about how the 2006 campaign is playing out in Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, which is evenly balanced among Democrats, Republicans and independents.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: India: Central Bank Raises Rate To Control Inflation

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI (NYT)

 BODY:
The Reserve Bank of India, the nation's central bank, increased its benchmark interest rate for the fourth time this year to rein in inflation even as the Indian economy continued to expand at a furious pace. In a midterm monetary policy review, Yaga Venugopal Reddy, governor of the Reserve Bank, announced that the bank's repurchase rate, or the cost for other banks to borrow funds, would rise by a quarter percentage point, to 7.25 percent. This is in contrast to the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, which left their benchmark rates unchanged. The reverse repurchase rate, or the rate at which the central bank buys funds from other banks, will remain unchanged at 6 percent. SARITHA RAI (NYT)

HEADLINE: Play Offense, Defense or Sit Out the Game? 

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
WHEN a potentially image-destroying event occurs in the middle of an image-building campaign, what should a company do? Ignore it? Concentrate on it exclusively? Or address it briefly, then go back to image building?
 Those were the choices that the Citgo Petroleum Corporation, a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, faced in late September after Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, stood before the United Nations and likened President Bush to the devil. Not long after, a news agency reported that 7-Eleven Inc. had dropped Citgo as a supplier, intimating that the move was linked to Mr. Chavez's remarks. Rumors of a consumer boycott of Citgo stations soon percolated through the blogosphere.
No matter that none of it was true. ''We did not drop Citgo; our contract simply expired on Sept. 30 as planned,'' said Margaret Chabris, a 7-Eleven spokeswoman, who said that 7-Eleven would probably sell its own branded gasoline. Citgo sales did not fall off markedly either. 
 Nonetheless, in mid-October, Citgo ran a full-page ad in the form of a letter from Feliz Rodriguez, its chief executive, in USA Today, The New York Times and several other newspapers. The letter, with the headline ''Citgo Sets the Record Straight,'' clarified the timing on the 7-Eleven contract, and discussed Citgo's track record as a big employer of Americans, a reliable supplier of gasoline and an exemplary corporate citizen. 
 Citgo then resumed the image-building campaign that it had begun in July and that is scheduled to run through the end of March. On Monday, for example, it ran full-page ads in numerous newspapers, with the headline, ''Citgo. Fueling More Than You Might Imagine.''
 Mr. Chavez's speech has disappeared from headlines, and the flurry of bad publicity that surrounded Citgo has died down, too. But the company's handling of the episode remains a matter of lively debate among branding specialists. Some applaud Citgo; some castigate it. Here is a sample of their mutually exclusive schools of thought:
 Citgo should have ignored the 7-Eleven rumors; by trying to counteract the misinformation, the one-time ad helped to perpetuate them. ''Sure, if there's a real crisis, it's a good idea to neutralize the negative in one ad, then continue to address the positive in later ads,'' said Judy Hopelain, a partner at the marketing consultant Prophet Brand Strategy. ''But none of the people I know made any connection in their minds between Chavez's speech and Citgo, so I question whether Citgo had to address this at all.'' 
 So does Michael Watras, president of the brand consultant Straightline International. ''They should have just let it all blow over, then sometime after the election do a campaign that emphasizes their product and their brand,'' he said. ''After all, Americans don't care about any of this, they just want to put gas in their car.'' 
 Citgo had to address the issue; most people may not connect Citgo and Venezuela, but a subset of influential people most certainly do. ''Of course, Citgo knows that consumers don't use politics as a criterion when they buy gas,'' said Nicholas Donatiello Jr., president of the research firm Odyssey. ''But they needed that one-time ad to set the record straight with the reporters, the pundits, the politicians, all the members of the chattering classes.'' 
 Citgo should not have stopped with just one rebuttal ad, but should have continued to address the potential fall-out from Mr. Chavez's speech. ''By going back to the regular ads too soon, it looks like they are trying to distract people by changing the subject,'' said Allen P. Adamson, managing director for the brand consulting firm Landor Associates. ''They needed to run a few more ads, wait, make sure they are not getting clobbered in the blogosphere. Then, when they're sure they've cleared the decks, they can go back to saying, 'Hey, we're the good guys.' ''
 Citgo should have fought the misinformation, but through nonadvertising venues. ''If they were attacked, they should have countered on their Web site and with public relations,'' said Simon Williams, president of Sterling Brands. ''Instead, they ran a noticeable, impactful defensive ad, which will make the others look smarmy in contrast. In effect, they hijacked their whole corporate image campaign.'' 
 So, how does Citgo feel about its strategy and tactics? 
 To hear Jennifer Moos, general manager of brand development at Citgo, tell it, Citgo is pretty comfortable about its choices. After all, she says, the image-building campaign that began in July was always aimed at playing up, not down, the synergies between Citgo's American roots as the Cities Service Company and its current Venezuelan connection. And the reasons she offers for the campaign are of the type taught in Economics 101, not Advanced Crisis Management. 
 Citgo, Ms. Moos said, had been selling more gasoline than it could actually produce, and it had been buying high-priced gas on the open market to meet its obligations. So earlier this year it decided that it would stop selling gasoline in several locations in the Midwest, and concentrate instead on beefing up its presence in the Northeast. 
 But, the company knew its pullback could be misconstrued. ''People could assume Citgo was getting smaller, not stronger,'' Ms. Moos said. 
 So in July, Citgo began running full-page ads in newspapers, detailing its refining capacity, its program of subsidizing home heating oil for poor people in New York, its support of the Muscular Dystrophy Association -- and yes, the fact that its status as a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela gave it access to Venezuela's crude oil reserves, the largest in the Western Hemisphere. 
 When the erroneous information about the 7-Eleven contract and the rumors of a boycott surfaced, ''we had to set the record straight for our brand image,'' Ms. Moos said. No boycotts materialized; sales have not dropped off. ''So now our campaign is picking up the Citgo story again.''
 Ms. Moos would not discuss budget, but she said the campaign would include television spots and full-page ads in large newspapers, and would run through March 31. The ads will continue to stress employment, reliable supply, corporate citizenship -- ''all the areas that Citgo's marketers and distributors say they want to see addressed,'' said Shad Foos, a vice president of Barkley of Kansas City, Mo., Citgo's agency.
 Marketing experts might well add the codicil -- providing all is quiet on the blogging and rhetoric front.

HEADLINE: Thomas R. Jones, 93, Judge Who Agitated for Urban Revival

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Thomas R. Jones, a New York State assemblyman and judge who challenged Senator Robert F. Kennedy to address urban malaise and became the founding chairman of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, a leading organization in the 1960s' effort to revitalize urban ghettos, died on Friday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 93.
 The cause was prostate cancer, said his son, David R. Jones. 
Justice Jones was part of a pioneering generation of black lawyers, clergymen and other professionals who transformed Brooklyn politics after World War II by agitating for civil rights, running for office and pressing for governmental action to improve the squalid conditions of urban slums.
 Justice Jones, then a Civil Court judge, famously confronted Mr. Kennedy on Feb. 4, 1966, as the senator toured dilapidated buildings in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The judge told Mr. Kennedy that study after study of urban blight had been conducted, with little action. 
 ''I'm weary of study, senator, very weary,'' Justice Jones said. ''The Negro people are angry, senator, and judge that I am, I'm angry too.''
 Mr. Kennedy took up the challenge and that December announced the creation of what became the Restoration Corporation, with Justice Jones as its first chairman. It became a model for community development corporations around the country over the following decades.
 Before entering public life, Justice Jones was a tireless civil rights lawyer. During the war he defended black American soldiers accused of wrongdoing in occupied Europe. 
 Thomas Russell Jones was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 5, 1913, a son of Thomas S. Jones, a podiatrist, and Mabel Ward Jones, immigrants from Mount Gay, Barbados. He attended public schools and received undergraduate and law degrees from St. John's University. He was admitted to the bar in 1938.
 As a young lawyer, he was elected chairman of the New York Youth Congress, an antifascist group supported by Eleanor Roosevelt. He joined the Army in 1941 and, as a first lieutenant, took part in the Normandy invasion and was named a court-martial judge in Belgium in 1944. 
 Returning to Brooklyn, he became counsel to the local branch of the N.A.A.C.P. and an advocate against police brutality. Active in his Democratic reform circles, Justice Jones was elected to the State Assembly in 1962. In 1964, he was elected a Civil Court judge, and in 1967, a State Supreme Court justice. He considered running for Congress in 1968 and 1974 and was considered a finalist for the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, in the 1970s.
 Elsie Richardson, 84, a longtime neighborhood activist, recalled that it was she who first told Senator Kennedy during the 1966 visit that the neighborhood's problems had been ''studied to death.'' Justice Jones echoed her criticism, she said, ''and as an important person in the community, it meant something. Robert Kennedy really got an impression of where the community was coming from.''
 In December 1966, Senator Kennedy announced the creation of two groups -- one of community leaders, the other of prominent businessmen -- to cooperate in the redevelopment of Bedford-Stuyvesant. He outlined plans to build health clinics, rehabilitate housing, build playgrounds and spur commercial activity. 
 The community group, led by Justice Jones, attracted grants from philanthropies like the Astor and Ford Foundations, but there was disagreement over the proper extent of grass-roots involvement. In April 1967, he broke with the board after he called for expanding it to include more young people, civil rights activists and antipoverty workers. With the blessing of Mr. Kennedy, Senator Jacob K. Javits and Mayor John V. Lindsay, he immediately started a new group, the Restoration Corporation. 
 In June 1967, the new body received a $7 million federal grant for job training, health clinics, recreation and other programs. Justice Jones recruited Franklin A. Thomas -- then a deputy police commissioner and later president of the Ford Foundation -- to be the corporation's first executive director.
 Mr. Kennedy's assassination in June 1968 devastated Justice Jones, his son said, and eventually led him to focus more of his time on his judicial work. Describing his sensitivity to racial justice, he told The New York Times in 1974: ''I come out of a ghetto, out of the experience of a racist society. Constitutional liberties are more critical for me.''
 He retired in 1985 but remained active in legal circles. With his wife, Bertha K. Jones, whom he wed in 1941, he founded a nonprofit group to help poor children. In addition to her and his son, David, the president and chief executive of the Community Service Society of New York, his survivors include a sister, Grace Killens, and a daughter, Margaret A. DeLaCour. All are of Brooklyn. Five grandchildren also survive. 
 In 1955, during the McCarthy era, Justice Jones defended three Chinese workers in the United States who were convicted and sentenced to prison on charges of helping Communist China by sending money to friends and relatives there. The Supreme Court declined to hear their appeal. In 1980, Justice Jones accepted an invitation to speak in Beijing about the case and the American legal system.

HEADLINE: Town Looks to the Future, Again, for an Identity

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. 

 BODY:
Along barren Interstate 25 slicing through the high desert, the road signs rise up with almost comical incongruity: ''Future Site of the New Mexico Spaceport.''
 They are no hallucination. Tucked away between the Caballo Mountains and the White Sands Missile Range, 27 miles southeast of this quirkily named tribute to a wacky quiz show, lie the humble beginnings of Spaceport America, New Mexico's ambitious bid to corner a big chunk of the early market in commercial spaceflight.
So far there is little to be seen: a concrete pad and rocket launching rail, a mobile rocket assembly unit, and trailers housing mission control and observation posts. A recent test flight ended in failure. But Gov. Bill Richardson has won a $100 million commitment from state lawmakers toward a $225 million partnership with Richard Branson's space venture, Virgin Galactic. The goal is to develop a base for excursions to the edge of space by 2010, at prices more affordable than the $200,000 per person currently estimated. 
 The spaceport's great allure, said Rick Homans, New Mexico's economic development secretary, is that it borders the missile range, where outside air traffic is already restricted. Also, the weather is sunny and dry. And the elevation puts spaceships 4,300 feet closer to the moon.
 Odd little Truth or Consequences is the closest community of any size: 7,000 to 10,000 people varying with the season, a rich salsa of snowbirds, retirees, dropouts, sportsmen, fundamentalists and new-agers, where art galleries daubed in sunflower yellow and Frida Kahlo blue sprout beside thermal spas, massage studios, churches and cowboy bars.
 It has been more than half a century since this onetime roughneck boomtown, formerly known as Hot Springs, hitched itself to the futuristic technology of television and renamed itself after the popular show. Now T or C, in the shorthand of locals weary of the mouthful of a name, finds itself on the threshold of another new age and unlikely new identity: gateway to the cosmos.
 For the most part, residents seem enthusiastic.
 ''This is not just to take a rich person in the air to have fun for an hour,'' said Russ Peterson, the chief of police who is also chairman of the Sierra County commissioners. ''This is to revolutionize worldwide travel and overnight freight.'' 
 Ensconced at a back table of a popular local restaurant, the Bar-B-Que on Broadway, Chief Peterson was soon rhapsodizing over hourlong suborbital flights to China and orbiting sky-hotels, and comparing the merits of horizontal takeoffs versus vertical launchings. 
 In an admittedly difficult sell to voters, Chief Peterson said, the three counties bordering the spaceport are weighing whether to add a quarter of 1 percent to the gross receipts tax to help subsidize the venture and raise additional revenues for public works. He said space tourism would contribute its tax share. ''I don't mind making money off rich people so I can repair the roads,'' he said.
 But raising taxes does not sit well with Myrna Kohs, editor and a co-publisher of the weekly Sierra County Sentinel and owner of the local radio station, KCHS. ''I'm not going to fight the spaceport as long as the people making the money put up the money,'' Ms. Kohs said. 
 The Geronimo Springs Museum in town highlights the skepticism of Lew Wallace, the Union general and author who was governor of New Mexico Territory from 1878 to 1881: ''Every calculation based on experience elsewhere fails in New Mexico.''
 On Sept. 25, in the first test from the spaceport, a 20-foot rocket developed by UP Aerospace reached 40,000 feet of its projected 70 miles before wobbling off course and crashing in the desert for reasons still being sought. And at the annual rocketry fair called the Wirefly X Prize Cup, at the nearby Las Cruces Airport in October, the competitions to demonstrate a private lunar lander and an elevator climbing a ribbon to space were also failure-plagued and prize-less. 
 But Truth or Consequences is astir with projects beyond the spaceport. A Wal-Mart supercenter is going up, to mixed local reviews, along with a villa-ringed golf resort. And developers are moving ahead with a huge Nascar racetrack.
 In an area long revered by Indians for its bubbling warm waters, Hot Springs sprang up in 1911 as a labor camp for the Elephant Butte Dam, which created a 40-mile-long lake and recreation area -- and a sin city of gunslingers, saloons, gambling halls and brothels, including a floating pleasure palace on the lake. 
 The Depression and World War II calmed things down, and redemption of sorts beckoned in 1950 in the form of a hit radio quiz show called ''Truth or Consequences,'' which required contestants who failed to answer trivia questions to perform zany stunts.
 To celebrate the show's 10th anniversary on radio and its debut on the new medium of television, the host, Ralph Edwards, offered to telecast from a city that would call itself Truth or Consequences for a day. Hot Springs leapt at the chance, voting to change its name in time for April Fool's Day, 1950. 
 Mr. Edwards, who went on to create an even more popular show, ''This Is Your Life,'' returned here annually for a fiesta day until 1999, six years before he died at 92. 
 The sheen from the city's name change may have since dulled, with traditionalists making four unsuccessful efforts over the years to change the name back to Hot Springs, but the spaceport is adding new cachet, many say. 
 ''To stop the spaceport now would be harder than continuing it,'' Chief Peterson said. ''There are too many irons in the fire.''

HEADLINE: North Korea Will Resume Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN and HELENE COOPER; Joseph Kahn reported from Beijing, and Helene Cooper from Washington.

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
North Korea agreed Tuesday to resume nuclear disarmament talks, a first sign of easing tensions since the country's nuclear test this month. But the talks have dragged on inconclusively for three years, and the chances for rolling back the country's now-proven nuclear capability remained uncertain.
 China announced that six-nation talks would reconvene shortly after a hiatus of more than a year, and an American envoy in Beijing said they could take place in November or December.
The agreement was a procedural victory for Beijing, which scrambled to reopen a diplomatic channel even as it joined the United States and other international powers in supporting United Nations sanctions on North Korea after the Oct. 9 test. 
 But Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, has participated in multiple rounds of talks over the past several years while he accelerated his pursuit of nuclear weapons, and some analysts suspect that he agreed to restart talks now to forestall tough enforcement of sanctions and to persuade China and South Korea to ease his government's growing economic woes.
 While North Korea's decision to restart the talks is being heralded as a diplomatic breakthrough, American envoys will be returning to the negotiating table to face an adversary that now has a demonstrated nuclear capability -- a fact that America will try to minimize even as North Korea tries to exploit it, Bush administration officials and analysts said. 
 ''The dangerous possibility is that North Korea sits down at the table and says, 'We're now a nuclear state, let's deal with it,' '' said Bonnie Glaser, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
 In an interview on Tuesday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice played down suggestions that America's negotiating task would be made more difficult by the North's nuclear test. ''Nobody accepts that they're a nuclear power,'' she said. The North Koreans, she said, ''can say it all they wish.''
 Ms. Rice said the United States would work with the other participants of the talks to force the North to take a concrete step toward ending its nuclear program. She offered few details but acknowledged that two of the possibilities being discussed were a dismantling of one of the North's many nuclear facilities and the readmission of international inspectors.
 Other officials who have discussed the administration's internal deliberations have said the dismantling should begin with a facility like North Korea's five-megawatt reactor, which is continuing to produce nuclear fuel, or its plutonium reprocessing center, where spent reactor fuel can be turned into material for weapons.
 ''We understand it can't go from zero to 100 in the first session,'' Ms. Rice said. ''But the core of this is denuclearization, and we have to have concrete evidence.''
 Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state responsible for the talks, and Kim Kye-gwan, his North Korean counterpart, met secretly in Beijing under Chinese auspices to hash out terms of resuming negotiations, Chinese state media reported.
 Mr. Hill said Tuesday that he expected ''substantial progress'' at the talks and that they would resume without preconditions. But he acknowledged that previous talks had been plodding and painstaking, and promised no quick breakthrough.
 ''We are a long way from our goal, still,'' he said. ''I have not broken out the cigars and Champagne quite yet.''
 For the past year, North Korea had refused to resume negotiations on its nuclear program until the United States lifted financial penalties imposed on a Macao bank last year that have hobbled the country's international financial transactions. Mr. Hill said that he agreed to discuss the matter as part of the nuclear talks -- perhaps in a special working group that would convene at the same time as the main negotiations -- but that he had made no promises.
 The Bush administration accused the Macao bank, Banco Delta Asia, of helping North Korea to launder money from drug smuggling and other illicit activities and to pass counterfeit $100 bills manufactured by the North Korean government. In September 2005, the Treasury Department ordered United States banks to sever relations with the bank, a move that had broad ripple effects, curtailing North Korean access to the international banking system and further isolating the government in Pyongyang.
 The talks, which involve Japan, South Korea and Russia as well as China, North Korea and the United States, reached a vaguely worded agreement for nuclear disarmament in September 2005, which North Korea quickly disavowed. The talks collapsed a short time later amid mutual recriminations.
 Mr. Hill said Mr. Kim reiterated during their meetings in Beijing that putting the 2005 accord into effect should be the main focus of the renewed talks. 
 That agreement called for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a range of diplomatic, economic and energy incentives, but left most of the details to subsequent negotiations that never took place.
 ''We all reaffirmed, including the North Koreans, our commitment to the September statement and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,'' Mr. Hill said.
 Bush administration hard-liners, who have been chafing under Ms. Rice's multilateral diplomatic approach to North Korea, played down the resumption of talks, saying that America is merely back where it was a year ago before the North abandoned the talks, except now Pyongyang has the added bargaining chip of having exploded a nuclear device.
 ''Where's the stick?'' asked one administration official. ''We're celebrating the six-party talks, but we're back to endless chatter.'' 
 Gary Samore, a North Korea expert who helped negotiate President Clinton's 1994 agreement with the North, said, ''I think the North Koreans gamed this all out. They calculated they could get away with a nuclear test if they allowed themselves to be cajoled back into the six-party talks.''
 But North Korea's commitment to resume talks may reduce the chances that it will soon conduct a second nuclear test, as some in the region feared it might be preparing to do.
 Some Chinese experts have argued that North Korea needs to dispel doubts about its nuclear capabilities and complete its quest to become a full nuclear power before it will be willing to bargain away what it refers to as its ''nuclear deterrent.''
 They say that Kim Jong-il may feel he can demand a higher price for disarmament now than he could when some international experts, including some of China's top North Korea specialists, had expressed doubts that the country could make its own nuclear bombs.
 Many others disagree, including a growing contingent of Chinese officials and foreign policy specialists who take a skeptical view of the North's intentions and favor a tougher line on China's Korean War-era ally, according to numerous people involved in the debate.
 Shi Yinhong, an international relations expert at People's University in Beijing, said he believed that Kim Jong-il's agreement to return to talks was motivated mainly by his desire to head off tough enforcement of international sanctions. 
 ''His purpose has been to develop nuclear bombs and that purpose has not changed,'' Mr. Shi said. ''His goal now is to keep his bombs but reduce the penalty he has to pay by appearing to be negotiating in good faith.''
 Some Chinese experts said Beijing had made clear that it would exercise considerable economic and financial leverage on North Korea if it continues to develop its nuclear program and refuses to return to talks.
 In September, China did not sell any oil to North Korea, Chinese customs statistic show. The cutoff came before the nuclear test but after North Korea conducted a test of its ballistic missiles in July, ignoring Beijing's pleas for restraint.
 Beijing provides an estimated 90 percent of North Korea's oil by pipeline, and any sustained reduction in oil shipments could cripple the country's already weakened economy.
 Liu Jianchao, the foreign ministry spokesman, said Tuesday, before the resumption of talks was announced, that China had no plans to sever aid or trade with North Korea, but dodged questions about the oil cutoff.

HEADLINE: A Decorator Show House for More Than Show

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
IF Luz Solis writes a memoir, she is planning to call it ''The Fourth Floor,'' for the I.C.U. section of the nursing home where she went to die two years ago. Then, she weighed 90 pounds, her body ragged from cancer, AIDS and crack cocaine. ''They asked me, 'Who is your proxy? Who will sign a' -- what do you call it? -- 'a do not resuscitate order,' '' she said the other day, her husky voice breaking.
 Yet she did not die, and next Tuesday she will celebrate one month in her new life -- that is, in her new apartment, a coyly stylish one-bedroom adorned with sunburst mirrors, '70s-style rattan furniture, a tufted yellow headboard, a David Hicks-like blue-and-white rug and a collection of contemporary photography set against a blue-black wall.
''It is like a magic wand,'' she said. ''It is changing everything.'' 
 Ms. Solis, an ebullient 45-year-old woman from the South Bronx (now glowing at 150 pounds), has a decades-long resume of bad luck and bad choices. How she finds herself in an apartment created by David Netto, a young turk of interior design, is an unlikely story turning on another woman's bad luck, and on a happy accident. 
 The apartment is one of 39 in Woodycrest House, a Bronx building that has been reworked -- and decorated -- for families whose primary caregiver is infected with H.I.V. The project was organized by editors at Domino magazine and the chairwoman of a local AIDS facility, Claire Haaga Altman, who began gathering financing in the late 1990s, after the new AIDS drugs had begun to change the course and nature of the disease. Since 1991, she had been running the Highbridge Woodycrest Center, a Bronx health care facility for people with AIDS, which was essentially a nursing home for those who were very sick. But by the end of the last decade, Ms. Haaga Altman pointed out, people with AIDS were getting healthier, though still struggling with a chronic disease. (According to the New York State Department of Health, by the end of 2005, the last year for which figures are available, there were more than 170,000 people living with AIDS and H.I.V. in New York City, up from 125,304 in 2002.)
 ''The idea was to create housing with more social services than medical support,'' said Ms. Haaga Altman, who corralled $9 million worth of funding from government agencies and a private investment firm to purchase and renovate a building into one- and two-bedroom apartments for men and women trying to knit together torn-up lives. Many of these tenants would be coming from shelters, nursing homes or other sorts of ''congregate housing,'' Ms. Haaga Altman said, and perhaps reuniting with their children for the first time in years. 
 Here comes the bad luck, and the happy accident. While doing volunteer work in southern India, Ms. Haaga Altman met Sara Bengur, an interior designer from Manhattan who was recovering from a double whammy: breast cancer and a divorce. During her illness, Ms. Bengur had been thinking about how environment affects well-being, and also wondering how she might give back, as she said recently, in a very direct way. ''I was thinking about the show-house concept, but wondering how to make it permanent, and how a designer's work might directly benefit someone, rather than just be a vehicle for funding,'' she said. The morning Ms. Bengur and Ms. Haaga Altman met, they began hatching a scheme to furnish Ms. Haaga Altman's new building.
 Back home, Ms. Bengur approached Dara Caponigro, a friend and an editor at Domino, the perky young decorating magazine, and its editor in chief, Deborah Needleman, who then invited seven more designers and design firms to participate -- David Netto, the Apartment, Ruthie Sommers, Celerie Kemble, Katie Lydon, Timothy Whealon and Thomas O'Brien. It was a well-heeled group, more familiar with the angst of the very rich, as Mr. Netto said, ''With the feeling of the foot tap-tapping and 'what's this on the bill?' and 'why can't you understand what I want?' '' For these designers, he added, ''the opportunity to make someone purely happy doesn't come around a lot.'' 
 Since the early days of AIDS in the 1980s, the design industry has been agitating and fund-raising for the disease, as so many of its own were among the first stricken. But Woodycrest may be the first residential project that directly deploys the skills of decorators, who have outfitted these apartments right down to the linens, the crayons and the cutlery.
 Domino editors solicited furniture donations from retailers like Pier 1 and Ikea, and manufacturers like the vacuum cleaner company Dyson. The furnishings cost about $600,000, Ms. Needleman estimated. The decorators then gathered their own resources -- artists and smaller furniture companies like Jonathan Adler -- who donated artwork and smaller pieces.
 Traditional decorating jobs proceed from a brief given by the client. To address their multiple clients, Ms. Bengur and Ms. Haaga Altman invited a group of potential residents to a videotaped focus group last year and asked the women what their ideal home might look and feel like. Every one clamored for color -- no more institutional off-white! -- and soft fabrics and a way to keep the place clean. 
 ''How would you feel,'' Ms. Haaga Altman asked at the end, ''about living in a space designed without your involvement?''
 ''It makes me happy,'' said one.
 Another said, ''To find out that someone is putting so much thought into it, it's like 'Extreme Makeover' to have that done.'' 
 Ruthie, a single mother of a young son, also said that she had no problem with living in another person's vision, although she spoke of a hankering for a pale blue room. Ms. Bengur's two-bedroom apartments all have pale green living rooms and pale blue bedrooms. (''I did that for Ruthie,'' the designer said.)
 JAMIL, 38, is living in one of Ms. Bengur's apartments with her two daughters and her husband. She and Ms. Solis met their first week in the building, in the laundry room, and have struck up a friendship. Jamil, who asked that her last name not be used, had been living in so-called ''scatter site'' housing -- below-market-rate apartments in private buildings, without counseling, security or other support services. 
 Like many residents at Woodycrest, Jamil is struggling with addiction, said Nichole Johnson, the building's social services director. In addition to being H.I.V. positive, she said, criteria for housing there includes a recommendation from a social worker who has determined that a prospective tenant's current housing situation is detrimental to his or her health and well-being. 
 Jamil's old apartment offered ''too much freedom,'' she said. ''I'm a person who can get clean. But I can't stay clean.''
 A few weeks ago, she demonstrated a different sort of clean, brandishing the snazzy yellow Dyson that comes with each apartment. ''I'm obsessed,'' she said. ''When you go home and your house is in order like this, it's easier to incorporate the other changes in your life. The children have their part, you want to keep things right.'' 
 Ms. Solis teased, ''She had a birthday for her baby last week, and she was chasing the guests out with that thing.''
 Primed by shows like ''Trading Spaces'' and ''Extreme Makeover,'' both women said, they fell upon their new apartments gape-mouthed, and then wondered where the cameras were. Rather than feeling pandered to, or stifled by an alien aesthetic, they felt pampered and cared for, they said, an unusual experience.
 In creating his apartments, Mr. Netto thought about including touches of luxury ''that would make someone feel special,'' he said. ''A little art collection. Tufted upholstery on a headboard. Lots of mirrors, so they could see that this was them in their new homes, and because mirrors always add a bit of glamour.'' He added, ''You wouldn't dream of letting these women down.''
 Woodycrest House is now half full and will be completely rented by the end of next month, said Deborah Johnson, the vice president of property management at the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, a neighborhood organization that is finding and screening potential tenants.
 Ms. Solis lives alone in her apartment; Destiny, her 6-year-old daughter, lives with an aunt a few blocks away. Pictures of her march up and down the walls and tables. ''I lost her and the husband because I couldn't change,'' Ms. Solis said ruefully. ''You ask Destiny what she wants to be, and she'll say, 'a doctor,' '' Ms. Solis continued. ''You probably always had an answer, too; everybody does. But I never could answer that question. My dreams were cheap dreams: for a beautiful home, nice things.'' 
 But a home isn't a cheap dream; it's an anchor and a springboard.
 ''You think?'' wondered Ms. Solis, who said that on her last visit, Destiny marveled at the sight of her mother cooking in her new kitchen, in cozy pajamas and pink fluffy slippers. ''There is something about the pajamas she likes,'' Ms. Solis continued. ''She said, 'You look beautiful. You look like a real mother.' ''
 Ms. Solis's last home was a sinkhole of a one-bedroom, with black mold in the kitchen and bathroom, and a hole in the living room where the floor had rotted around the steam pipes, nearly swallowing her, at least metaphorically, she said. 
 ''In between my old apartment and here, the traffic was amazing,'' she said dryly. ''The lights were all red and nothing was moving for a very long time. It's been a long bus ride, but I just got off.''

HEADLINE: With Wages on Ballots, Restaurateurs Do the Math 

BYLINE: By REGAN MORRIS

 BODY:
If people in Montana vote to raise the minimum hourly wage on Tuesday, Lyle Nalivka, a restaurant owner, says his waiters will earn more than he does some days -- and a few of them will very likely lose their jobs. 
 Mr. Nalivka, 54, says customers at his Acoma Restaurant and Lounge in Butte like big portions and they cannot pay Manhattan prices for dinner. The wage proposal is pegged to inflation, he points out, meaning the cost of cappuccino in New York and Los Angeles would affect how much he pays his waiters each year. Generally, they make about four times the minimum wage, including tips, Mr. Nalivka said.
In addition to Montana, five other states -- Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Nevada and Ohio -- have minimum wage measures on the ballot, with plans for annual adjustments for inflation. Small businesses, and in particular restaurants, are concerned that they will be the hardest hit. Restaurants, which have an unusually high failure rate -- according to a recent Ohio State University study, 60 percent fail within three to five years -- say they will have to pass on the costs to the consumers, reduce their staffs, or both. 
 Some economists assert that businesses can afford the increases and applaud the trend of states rising above the federal hourly minimum of $5.15 (21 states already have higher minimum wages). But ask most restaurateurs and they respond with dismay about how they will make ends meet.
 For waiters and other workers who receive tip income, the federal hourly wage is just $2.13, although some states require more. The Labor Department defines these ''tipped employees'' as those who customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips. The tips are counted as wages.
 Montana does not allow the so-called tip credit and waiters must be paid at least $5.15 an hour -- for now. They will receive a dollar an hour more next year, if the voters decide to give the lowest-paid workers a raise. 
 ''My business depends on repeat customers. It's not like I can gouge a tourist,'' Mr. Nalivka said. ''I think if I can't maintain business through modest price increases, it will cost jobs.''
 If voters approve the measures, three states -- Nevada, Ohio and Colorado -- will enshrine the changes in their state Constitutions; opponents say constitutions are not where economic policy should be set because making adjustments will be difficult and time-consuming. The Colorado and Ohio proposals would increase the minimum wage to $6.85 an hour, or to about half that for employees who receive tips. Arizona's minimum wage would rise to $6.75, but the minimum for employees who receive tips would be $3 less. Missouri's would rise to $6.50, or half that for employees who are tipped. 
 At least restaurateurs in those states get to vote on the wage increases, a Los Angeles restaurateur, Jacqueline Koster, says. Beginning Jan. 1, members of the bar staff at her popular Hollywood bistro, La Poubelle, will be paid $7.50 an hour, up from $6.75. And starting Jan. 1, 2008, Ms. Koster will pay them $8 an hour, under a bill signed into law in September by California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. The governor vetoed similar bills in the past because they were indexed to inflation. 
 ''I would have preferred to vote,'' said Ms. Koster, an immigrant from France who believes that California's wage increases will encourage more illegal immigration. ''I would have voted no. I can't raise prices, because the people won't come. They can't afford to pay $40 for the steak.'' The aged New York strip at La Poubelle costs $27 and the filet mignon is $30; the restaurant serves only organic meat. 
 Dylan Bethge, 36, owner of Portland's Restaurant and Wine Bar in Phoenix, says he does not think restaurants in Arizona will be affected much.
 ''I haven't looked at it long term. I don't think it's a big issue,'' Mr. Bethge said. ''I can't see it being raised that much higher than is acceptable to us. Our alternative would be to raise prices accordingly, if we had to.''
 In Las Vegas, Mimmo Ferraro, 28, owner of Ferraro's, an upscale Italian restaurant known for its osso buco, says the wage increases would hurt the most in increased payroll taxes, because the higher the payroll, the more must be paid to the government. His family's restaurant has been in business for 21 years and has no intention of letting any waiters go, he said. But it will most likely have to raise prices, and will face the additional cost of printing new menus. 
 ''For a small-business owner off the Strip, it's difficult enough to be successful in business as it is. If payroll goes up, taxes go up,'' Mr. Ferraro said. ''The money has to come from somewhere. So it will hurt the customer.'' 
 The National Restaurant Association has been aggressively lobbying against increasing the minimum wage, which was established federally in 1938 and was last raised in 1997. 
 Tom Foulkes, vice president for state relations and grass roots for the association, says the ballot measures are in swing states, where Democrats are pushing for the minimum wage increases. 
 ''This is not a homegrown effort. This is a nationally coordinated campaign,'' he said. ''It is no mistake that the six states where these ballot initiatives are, these are high-profile political campaigns. The issue is looking to influence the outcome of the elections.''
 Alan B. Krueger, an economist at Princeton, studied the fast-food industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania after New Jersey raised its wages and Pennsylvania did not. He concluded that the threat of lost jobs did not materialize. Mr. Krueger says restaurants always fear mandated wage increases, but rarely go out of business as a result of them and restaurant employment does not decrease. 
 In states like Montana, Mr. Krueger says, it is plausible that some restaurants will move away from a tip structure altogether, to make price increases more palatable to customers. 
 ''I think the experience has been that it's mostly crying wolf, I would say mostly by the restaurant associations than by the actual restaurant owners,'' Mr. Krueger said. ''The same thing happened in the '80s when the federal wage hadn't increased for a long time and the states stepped in to act.''
 But Mr. Nalivka, the Montana restaurateur, says he is not crying wolf. To cope, he says, he will cut shifts and most likely let a few people go. A waitress losing a lunch shift will most likely not benefit from the $1-an-hour raise, because she will be working less. He also believes the pay increases will encourage his employees who do not receive tips to ask for more pay. 
 ''I very much think it's a political issue, not a practical issue,'' Mr. Nalivka said. ''I think it's something that the Democrats are using to oust the Republicans.''
 He thinks the voters will vote yes, because giving the lowest-paid members of society a raise is a feel-good issue. But waiters make good money, he says, and he thinks Montana should have a tip credit. 
 ''Even the dishwashers are above minimum wage,'' he said. ''Of course, when the servers get a raise, they're going to want a raise, too. The cooks are all going to want a bump, and the cooks get tipped, too.'' 
 ''We've just gone through a smoking ban, we've just gone through open-container laws, tougher D.U.I. laws,'' Mr. Nalivka said. ''The bar and restaurant business has been taking a lot of hits.''

HEADLINE: What Makes a Nation Wealthy? Maybe It's the Working Stiff

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and co-writes a blog at www.marginalrevolution.com. He can be reached at tcowen@gmu.edu.

 BODY:
Economists typically explain the wealth of a nation by pointing to good policies and the quality of a country's institutions. But why do these differences exist in the first place? 
 In ''A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World'' (forthcoming, Princeton University Press, http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/FTA2006.pdf), Gregory Clark, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, identifies the quality of labor as the fundamental factor behind economic growth. Poor labor quality discourages capital from flowing into a country, which means that poverty persists. Good institutions never have a chance to develop.
Professor Clark's pessimistic view is that most forms of policy advice or financial aid do not solve the problem of economic development. Unless the quality of labor rises, those would-be remedies are addressing symptoms, not causes. 
 Professor Clark's analysis counters Jared M. Diamond, who in his ''Guns, Germs and Steel'' (W. W. Norton & Company, 1999) located the ultimate sources of European advantage in geography, like safety from tropical diseases, and a greater number of available animals that could be domesticated.
 A simple example from Professor Clark shows the importance of labor in economic development. As early as the 19th century, textile factories in the West and in India had essentially the same machinery, and it was not hard to transport the final product. Yet the difference in cultures could be seen on the factory floor. Although Indian labor costs were many times lower, Indian labor was far less efficient at many basic tasks. 
 For instance, when it came to ''doffing'' (periodically removing spindles of yarn from machines), American workers were often six or more times as productive as their Indian counterparts, according to measures from the early to mid-20th century. Importing Western managers did not in general narrow these gaps. As a result, India failed to attract comparable capital investment. 
 Professor Clark's argument implies that the current outsourcing trend is a small blip in a larger historical pattern of diverging productivity and living standards across nations. Wealthy countries face the most serious competitive challenges from other wealthy regions, or from nations on the cusp of development, and not from places with the lowest wages. Shortages of quality labor, for instance, are already holding back India in international competition. 
 An independent estimate by two economics professors at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Rodolfo E. Manuelli and Ananth Seshadri, (''Human Capital and the Wealth of Nations,'' (http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/manuelli/research/humcapwealthnation5--05.pdf) suggests that if variations in the quality of labor across nations are taken into account, other productivity factors need differ by only 27 percent to explain differences in per capita income. 
 Professor Clark argues that as late as the 18th century, most Europeans had not exceeded the standard of living in hunter-gatherer societies. Until recent times, the early advantages of Europe did not allow it to escape what economists call the Malthusian trap, in which rising populations periodically offset temporary gains in living standards. 
 The turning point came when England, and some other parts of Europe, managed a small but persistently positive rate of growth, starting around the 17th century. Pro-business values spread through English society. The Industrial Revolution was not so much a revolution as a continual building of small improvements, and indeed its history shows the difficulty of achieving regular growth. The explosion of technology came only in the late 19th century, well after many incremental gains. 
 The world's poorest countries, which now have about one-fiftieth the per capita incomes of the wealthiest countries, have not kept pace. According to Professor Clark, the relative advantage of a highly disciplined and properly acculturated work force is greater for the more complex production processes of the modern world. Low morale and lax discipline will curtail simple factory production but the problem is far worse as production and management become more complex. The poorer countries remain stuck at the bottom as growing populations mean fewer resources for everyone else. Paradoxically, advances in sanitation and medical care, by saving lives, have driven down well-being for the average person. The population is rising in most of sub-Saharan Africa, but living standards have fallen below hunter-gatherer times and 40 percent below the average British living standard just before the Industrial Revolution. The upshot is this: The problem with foreign aid is not so much corruption but rather that the aid brings some real benefits and enables higher populations. 
 Professor Clark questions whether the poorest parts of the world will ever develop. Japan has climbed out of poverty, and now China is improving rapidly, but Dr. Clark views these successes as built upon hundreds of years of earlier cultural foundations. Formal education is no panacea, since well-functioning institutions are needed for it to be effective. 
 A more optimistic take might cite the power of cultural globalization. It is hard to reshape workplace norms in poor countries, but in the modern world religious and cultural ideas spread with a hitherto unprecedented speed. Perhaps television and missionaries will prove more important for economic development than privatization plans or exchange rate adjustments.
 Professor Clark's idea-rich book may just prove to be the next blockbuster in economics. He offers us a daring story of the economic foundations of good institutions and the climb out of recurring poverty. We may not have cracked the mystery of human progress, but ''A Farewell to Alms'' brings us closer than before.

HEADLINE: You Say Bangalore, They Say Bengalooru

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
In Boston, San Jose, London or elsewhere, if you were being ''Bangalored,'' it meant your job was being shipped half a world away to someone who would toil for a tiny fraction of your salary.
 Even the local politicians had come to resent the global attention. The commercial focus was westernizing Indian culture too quickly for them. So Wednesday, officials in this city changed its name to Bengalooru, the vernacular original, and the sparks are flying. The change is actually part of a trend in India and a sign of its newfound confidence. As the economy blazes ahead at growth rates of more than 8 percent, the local governments in India are trying to shed the country's colonial names, adopting local language names instead.
Bombay is now Mumbai, for instance, and Madras has been quietly renamed Chennai. But turning Bangalore into Bengalooru is causing the greatest stir. 
 It probably does not help that Bengalooru is a shortened version of ''Benda Kalooru,'' or ''city of cooked beans.'' The myth goes that a starving warrior king was fed beans by a kind old woman on the very site of this city, which is now the country's technology hub. 
 ''Bangalore represents a cosmopolitan, multicultural brand,'' said Nandan M. Nilekani, chief of Infosys Technologies, the outsourcing company, adding: ''It is not prudent to abandon the name of India's most global city.'' 
 Infosys and its domestic rival Wipro, each with thousands of employees, are among the companies credited with building the city's brand name around the world. Bangalore is now home to more than 1,000 technology firms, ranging from tiny two-person start-ups to large multinational companies like Intel, Texas Instruments and Cisco Systems. In a teeming city of seven million, the industry employs about 300,000 workers, who are turning into a rising middle-class that is giving rise to some resentment.
 U. R. Ananthamurthy, 73, a noted writer in Kannada, the local language, first proposed the name change, suggesting that it would awaken the consciousness of people to the existing inequality.
 ''In this city, people can study French or Spanish, shop in a fancy supermarket full of goods produced by multinationals, and ride in cabs driven by English-speaking drivers,'' said Mr. Ananthamurthy, adding, ''But do these people living in 'Bangalore' know that there is a 'Bengalooru'? ''
 Young, comparatively well-paid technology workers, many in their 20s, dress in the latest American and European clothing labels, speak in accented English, drive foreign cars and shop in fancy malls. Home prices are shooting up in the city, and in the last couple of years, local newspapers advertise apartments and villas costing more than $1 million. 
 But the salaries of many of its citizens working in jobs other than in the high-growth sectors have not been keeping up. There is a distinct divide between ''people who dress in a certain way, speak in a certain way and drive a certain type of car,'' and the rest of the city, Mr. Ananthamurthy said.
 Any resentment is natural in an evolving society, said S. Sadagopan, director of a leading technology school, the International Institute of Information Technology, which is based in Bangalore. ''When people are not busy creating wealth, it logically follows that they are busy distributing poverty,'' he said. 
 Others are not convinced that a name change can bridge the divide. ''Working towards the welfare of the underprivileged ought to be the priority rather than a name change,'' said Alexius Collette, chief executive of Philips Innovation Campus. 
 In the coming year, Philips will employ 2,500 workers in a new facility in the outer fringes of Bangalore. A name change would diminish Bangalore's international brand value, he said.
 Josh Bornstein, a director at the venture capital firm Footprint Ventures, which is based in Bangalore, has been working in the city for three years. ''By changing its name,'' he said, ''will the pressing issues afflicting Bangalore such as clogged roads, bad traffic and an inadequate airport get sorted out?''

HEADLINE: Junk Mail Is Alive and Growing

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Ginger Stickel, like most Americans, has been getting a lot more junk mail these days. Yesterday, for example, she received 37 pieces of mail, and 28 were junk, including a pitch for mail-order pizzas and a flier for a warehouse furniture sale. Surprisingly, she says she doesn't mind.
 ''I would rather get a catalogue over a call during dinner 10 times over,'' Ms. Stickel, a mother of two young children in Greenwich, Conn., said. ''I always open those letters, and sometimes they're useful.''
 Remember when the Internet and online marketing were going to spell the end of the direct mail business? Well, it hasn't exactly worked out that way. 
 Over the last year, marketers sent more than 114 billion pieces of direct mail -- catalogues, credit card solicitations, coupons and the like -- an increase of roughly 15 percent from five years ago, according to the United States Postal Service. And in the last year, for the first time, the volume of bulk mail, which is all direct mail, exceeded first class.
 Marketers are finding that a lot of people, like Ms. Stickel, prefer junk mail to spam and phone solicitations. And advertisers are finding that old-fashioned mailed ads work, particularly in combination with online offerings and Internet purchases. 
 Advertisers like it that mail ads, which do not get snagged in spam filters, can be aimed at just the right customers and be monitored for effectiveness. Those traits are increasingly important to companies as they slice and dice the American public into finer and finer categories.
 ''As the world becomes more digital, there is a need for tangible experiences,'' said Rob Bagot, executive creative director at McCann Worldgroup San Francisco, a part of the Interpublic Group. ''And there's nothing like a piece of paper.''
 Marketers are expected to spend $59.6 billion on direct mail this year, an increase of $15 billion since 2000 (about $10 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars), and up more than $4 billion in the last year alone, said Robert J. Coen, the director of forecasting for Universal McCann, an Interpublic agency.
 About $70 billion is being spent this year on television spots, with another $12 billion on Internet ads and $1.5 billion on marketing e-mail. 
 Direct mail has also received a lift from restrictions that began in 2003 on telemarketers, who are not permitted to phone people who join the national Do Not Call registry.
 True, a lot of direct mail is thrown out. Only about 2.15 percent of mailed ads lead to a sale or response from customers, according to the Direct Marketing Association, an industry group in New York.
 But ad executives are happy to play this numbers game because it seems to be working.
 ''If it says, 'We'll save you money,' of course you're going to look at it,'' said Andrew Shivone, a high school teacher in San Antonio. ''I pretty much throw them out, but I have no problem with getting it. They have those demographic lists, and it's funny to see what lists I get on.''
 Retailers spend the most on direct mail; next are manufacturers, mostly advertising to businesses; and then service providers and banks, the Direct Marketing Association's research has found.
 The Postal Service, suffering from a decline in the number of letters sent between individuals and in customer bills as result of the Internet, depended on direct mail for about a third of its revenue in the last year, up from 29 percent five years ago. 
 Postal officials were worried that advertisers might move online, calling the threat ''electronic erosion,'' said George T. Hurst, the Postal Service's brand manager for direct mail. But since 2000, direct mail has just gained speed.
 ''The Internet has actually been a trigger of direct mail,'' said Peter A. Johnson, vice president of research and market intelligence for the Direct Marketing Association. ''With every company now basically having a customer-facing Web site, suddenly they're having an interactivity with their customers that is much more real to them.'' Some companies that did not use much direct mail realized that there were benefits to one-to-one communication.
 E-mail advertising is, of course, cheaper than direct mail. Forrester Research estimates that marketers will spend $1.5 billion this year to send out nearly 600 billion junk e-mail messages. 
 Postage for bulk mail has risen 31 percent over the last five years, though bulk advertisers often receive lower rates. The cost of paper has also risen, but direct marketers have compensated by making their mail slightly lighter.
 Some ad executives still believe a more complete shift to e-mail will be likely eventually. In many industries, including the credit card industry, companies compete over who can attract and keep customers most cheaply.
 ''In some cases, you might have a better response rate in a nice mailing, but the cost of that mailing might make it a more expensive response than the response on the Web,'' said Philip Greenfield, chief executive of RMG Connect Worldwide, a part of the WPP Group.
 Still, e-mail from marketers can be blocked by spam filters, and reaching consumers via e-mail often requires them to agree to be on a company's solicitation list. Direct mail, on the other hand, lands in mailboxes without an invitation, but does not seem to be considered as annoying by consumers, in part because it often is related to their past purchases.
 ''At least with mail, because of the cost, they've got to put more effort into it,'' said Jim Killeen, a financial adviser who lives in Sierra Madre, Calif. ''They don't usually blanket an entire metropolitan area. I don't get mailers for women's clothing. It's useful because it's applicable to me.''
 Direct marketers want people to think there is a reason a piece of mail appeared in their mailbox. Mr. Bagot of McCann San Francisco said he tried to create ''planned coincidences,'' where consumers saw the same message in several places, leading them to think: ''Now that I've seen that thing twice, there might be something going on here.'' 
 Ad agencies are starting to change as well in response to the growth in direct mail. 
 In the past, many in the ad industry viewed direct mail as dull. Most companies did not even include spending on direct mail or promotions as an advertising expense, instead lumping them into general sales expenses and calling such spending ''below the line.''
 ''It was anything that was not considered important enough for the board of directors or C.E.O. to know about, because all they were ever talking about before at cocktail parties was television commercials,'' said Carla Hendra, the co-chief executive of Ogilvy North America. 
 But as direct marketing has become more important, some prominent agencies are seeking to integrate it into their overall ad strategy. 
 DraftFCB, an agency that was recently hired by Wal-Mart Stores, was formed over the summer from two agencies, one that had specialized in direct marketing and one that had been a traditional ad agency. 
 Ad executives expect the boom in direct mail to continue.
 Julia Grayson, operations manager at Euphoria Fitness in Winter Park, Fla., said she could resist most direct mail but not all.
 ''We're all so overwhelmed with what we do and what we read, or at least I am, so I just throw most of it away.'' Ms. Grayson said. ''But I do love catalogues. I try to throw them out, but they get me. And I'm hooked.''

HEADLINE: Big Prices, Big Risks At Fall Art Auctions

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Just when it seemed as if art auctions could not get bigger or prices go higher, along come the catalogs for this fall's important sales of Impressionist, Modern and contemporary art. Prime works by masters like Picasso, Gauguin, Cezanne, Klimt, de Kooning and Warhol fill their pages with luscious color foldouts and essays. For some of the big sales in the next two weeks, Christie's and Sotheby's have added mini-catalogs made to be portable, the CliffsNotes of the auction world. 
 And those with deep pockets are responding in droves. ''By the end of September we had already received more than 350 requests from clients asking for tickets to our evening sale, which is very unusual,'' said Guy Bennett, head of Impressionist and Modern art at Christie's in New York. ''Normally people start asking for tickets at the very end of October.'' Since Christie's main salesroom seats only 750, Mr. Bennett said, a room equipped with a closed-circuit television will be added to accommodate the overflow. 
 These evening sales have the highest estimates in auction history; they also carry the biggest risk. The auction houses have become so competitive for business that this season they have promised sellers larger and larger guarantees, undisclosed minimum sums that are paid regardless of a sale's outcome. Even the boutique firm Phillips, de Pury & Company has offered a number of guarantees for its one evening sale on Nov. 16, featuring contemporary works by some of today's trendiest artists, with record estimates.
 Guarantees protect the sellers, but the auction houses could be out hundreds of millions of dollars and stuck with warehouses full of art that goes unsold. Yet auction house experts say they feel comfortable giving so many because the market is so strong. 
 Two years ago financial analysts predicted that the art market was on the brink of topping out, but it has defied economic indicators. Many of this fall's sellers are veteran collectors -- the financiers Henry Kravis and Mitchell P. Rales, the onetime Hollywood super-agent Michael S. Ovitz and the newsprint magnate Peter Brant, to name a few -- betting that the market is nearing its top.
 Just a few seasons ago $100 million was a magic number for a single work, the barrier to break, but not anymore. Last month alone the entertainment mogul David Geffen sold three paintings -- a Jasper Johns, a de Kooning and most recently a Pollock -- to a new generation of fund managers for a whopping total of $283.5 million. Rather than scaring buyers, experts say, these private mega-deals are giving young billionaires confidence to make what they may see as last-chance purchases. 
 Even prominent art dealers are jumping into the auctions. William Acquavella, the Manhattan dealer, is selling a rare 1895 Cezanne still life at Sotheby's -- the most important painting in its sale on Tuesday -- but not without a guarantee, which experts say is in excess of $30 million. 
 ''There's a demand for these kind of masterpieces,'' Mr. Acquavella said. ''I bought the picture at the right price and think now is a good time to sell.'' He purchased the Cezanne at Christie's in London six years ago for $18.1 million; it is now estimated at $28 million to $35 million. 
 That adage that the ''3 Ds'' -- debt, divorce and death -- bring art to the market should now have an ''R'' added, for restitution. In Christie's Wednesday evening sale of Impressionist and Modern art alone, works by Klimt, Kirchner, Vuillard and Picasso recently restored to the heirs of owners from whom art was looted by the Nazis in World War II account for an estimated $125 million worth of art. Most of these works had hung for decades in museums, where the public thought they would safely stay. 
 Now they will be offered to the biggest buying pool ever. It's not just American hedge-fund billionaires who are fueling prices or, as in the 1980s, the Japanese. Financiers from Asia, Russia and India are quickly becoming collectors. And auction houses, unlike dealers, have offices around the world staffed with experts who both advise and tempt clients. 
 Christie's is once again dominating the next two weeks; both its Impressionist-and-Modern auction on Wednesday evening and its postwar-and-contemporary sale a week later are larger and more impressive than those of its archrival, Sotheby's. Solid teams of experts, long-term connections and aggressive financing are the reasons, not to mention a bit of luck. 
 Although Sotheby's and Christie's like to promote each work as a masterpiece, blockbusters really make up only a small percentage of this season's offerings. Heading the group is Gauguin's ''Man With an Ax'' (1891), a richly colored canvas painted in Tahiti. Christie's estimates it will sell for $34 million to $45 million. Although the seller identification reads only ''property of a lady of title,'' experts say it is from a member the family of the Sultan of Brunei.
 Christie's is also auctioning Picasso's soulful 1903 portrait of his friend Angel Fernandez de Soto seated at a Barcelona cafe table shrouded in tobacco smoke. Eleven years ago the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber bought it at Sotheby's in New York for $29.1 million. At the time he said he was buying it for his foundation, which supports theaters and young actors. It is now expected to sell for $40 million to $60 million, with the money going back into the foundation. 
 As important as the Picasso and the Gauguin are, all eyes will be on four Klimts that were recently on view at the Neue Galerie in Manhattan. The paintings, along with ''Adele Bloch-Bauer I,'' for which Ronald S. Lauder paid a record $135 million in June, were relinquished by Austria this year, after a long legal battle, to a niece of Mrs. Bloch-Bauer, Maria Altmann of Los Angeles, and other family members, who are selling them next week. The four works, together valued at nearly $100 million, consist of three landscapes and another portrait of Mrs. Bloch-Bauer, from 1912. 
 As soon as Christie's announced it was selling the Klimts, Mr. Lauder said he would love to buy them all for the Neue Galerie, if the price was right, especially the later portrait of Mrs. Bloch-Bauer. But whether a shopping spree is in his future is a matter of speculation. To help pay for ''Adele Bloch-Bauer I'' he has put three works by Schiele that had hung at the Neue Galerie -- two watercolors and a painting together estimated at $45 million -- up for sale at Christie's on Wednesday.
 By comparison Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern art sale, despite its 85 lots, is a tepid affair. Many of the works have been on the market in the last decade. In addition to Mr. Acquavella's Cezanne, there is ''The Card Game,'' a 1893 Toulouse-Lautrec of two women in a Paris brothel. The seller is Mr. Kravis, a former Sotheby's board member, who bought the painting privately six years ago for an undisclosed sum. It is now estimated at $5 million to $7 million. 
 This season's catalogs of postwar and contemporary art are stuffed with blue-chip names. Two artists in particular stand out: Warhol and de Kooning. The cover images of Sotheby's and Christie's catalogs are being called ''the dueling Warhols.'' Christie's shows a 1962 ''Orange Marilyn'' being sold by the San Francisco collector Roger Evans, estimated at $10 million to $15 million; Sotheby's has a 1964 self-portrait estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million. The seller is Jean-Christophe Castelli, son of the legendary dealer Leo Castelli, who died in 1999. Both Warhols were once in Leo Castelli's private collection.
 ''What has become clear is the sheer rarity of classicWarhol images of the 1960s and early 1970s,'' said Brett Gorvy, a co-head of postwar and contemporary art at Christie's. ''There are traditional Impressionist and Modern art collectors who now see that buying a Marilyn is as powerful as buying a great Picasso. He's also one artist who speaks to collectors all over the world.'' 
 Tobias Meyer, head of contemporary art for Sotheby's worldwide, says today's crop of new rich also wants de Kooning. ''De Kooning is the new Rothko of this market,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''But unlike great Rothkos, there is still enough supply.''

HEADLINE: Uptown or Down? The Whitney's Identity Crisis

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
When will the Whitney learn its lesson? Over the last two decades the museum has trotted out architectural proposals by Michael Graves, Rem Koolhaas and Renzo Piano for an expansion of its site on Madison Avenue at 75th Street. The designs have ranged wildly, from kitschy to audacious. All have been dumped with little ceremony, the victims of a hostile neighborhood and a fickle board of trustees.
 But only now has the process turned truly comical. The recent admission by the Whitney Museum of American Art that it is considering the addition of a downtown branch instead of proceeding with its on-site expansion effectively sounds the death knell for Mr. Piano's project just three months after the addition won final approval from the city's Board of Standards and Appeals. After years of stop-and-go plans and public soul searching, the museum is evidently still seeking an identity. 
As strange as it seems, the museum may be better off giving up on the Piano expansion. The Whitney has been worn down by battles with local preservationists, who never wanted any kind of addition on Madison Avenue anyway. A new site with bigger floor plates could give the curators more flexibility for exhibitions. And the city is offering the museum a choice location: a sprawling site in the meatpacking district at the foot of the High Line, an elevated public park that is one of the most intriguing urban projects in Manhattan today.
 Still, the Whitney's latest about-face points to an underlying malady. Architects are only as good as their clients. They can give conceptual form to an institution's identity, but they can't invent it. The Whitney's endless false starts are a symptom of self-doubt and internal confusion. Unless its board, led by Leonard A. Lauder, is able to muster some courage and conviction, a sudden change in site is not going to fix the problem.
 The Whitney's argument is simple enough. Adam Weinberg, the museum's director, says the price tag for the Piano addition, estimated at $200 million-plus, is too high for a building that will only add another 30,000 square feet of gallery space. (The museum's current 1966 Marcel Breuer building has 32,000 square feet of galleries.) He contends that stacking the galleries on seven floors, with relatively small floor plates, is too confining. At a new site, he hopes, the museum could carve out larger, wide-open galleries on fewer floors. 
 But this could hardly be an epiphany. That the galleries in a Madison Avenue addition would have to be stacked in a vertical composition was as true five years ago, when the museum hired Mr. Koolhaas to develop his proposal, as it is today. And the estimated cost for both was virtually the same -- $200 million or so -- and both designs provided the same 30,000 square feet of new gallery space. 
 Through its indecision, the Whitney has squandered a lot of time and money. Maxwell Anderson, the Whitney's previous director, said the museum spent nearly $6 million in architectural, engineering and legal fees to develop the Koolhaas design. One can safely assume that it has spent far more on its collaboration with Mr. Piano (who is to be retained for whatever project it pursues, the museum says). 
 The strangest thing about the Whitney's various approaches is that they express radically different architectural and curatorial points of view. Mr. Koolhaas's addition would have been one of the boldest pieces of architecture to emerge in years, while offering a powerful lesson in how to deal responsibly with historical context. 
 By accepting existing landmark constraints, including the preservation of a row of brownstones along Madison Avenue, Mr. Koolhaas seemed to imply that past, present and future need not be in violent opposition to one another. Rising in aggressive contortions behind the brownstones, his design seemed to shelter the old granite Breuer building even as it loomed over it like a gigantic cat's paw.
 Equally important, he used the design to meld a strong curatorial vision. The bulk of the museum's prewar collections would have been displayed in the late-19th-century brownstones, bigger postwar art in the Breuer building, and contemporary art in a new tower.
 The Whitney dismissed the Koolhaas design as too expensive, though Mr. Piano ultimately would do no better. But the museum's board clearly didn't feel comfortable with the design. And when it turned to Mr. Piano, the reasons seemed obvious enough. Less brash as a designer, he is also known for putting clients at ease.
 Unlike Mr. Koolhaas, Mr. Piano is not the kind of architect who will impose a strong vision on a timid board. And his design, which never quite attained the same level of imaginative power, could in some ways could be said to reflect the compromised nature of the institution. In their desire to appease local preservation advocates, museum trustees asked Mr. Piano to make some unwanted compromises, like suggesting he retain a brownstone he hoped to demolish to make way for a more generous public entrance. Most of Mr. Piano's galleries were big generic boxes stacked one atop the next, more a reflection of the Whitney's wishy-washy thinking than a clearly articulated position on how to display contemporary art.
 The question now is why we should assume that the museum could do better downtown. The Whitney is considering at least two sites: the one at the corner of Gansevoort and Washington Streets, and another on 10th Avenue in Chelsea. Both could theoretically yield more exhibition space than a Madison Avenue addition. Of the two, the Gansevoort Street site seems the more likely because of its tantalizing proximity to the High Line. 
 Since the site is city owned, it is likely to be far more affordable. And city officials, dismayed by the Dia Art Foundation's recent decision not to move there, have said they are determined to find a major cultural institution to anchor the High Line.
 Mr. Weinberg and his board have begun to outline the beginnings of a curatorial vision for a new site. He says he wants to avoid turning the Breuer building into a mausoleum, with the permanent collection uptown and contemporary exhibitions downtown. Instead he would like to see a more fluid relationship between the two spaces.
 For his part Mr. Piano, who visited the High Line site in mid-September, says it could be liberating. Gansevoort narrows as it crosses Washington, he said, so the building would be visible several blocks to the east. And its large footprint would allow him to bring more daylight into the galleries.
 But the move raises a raft of obvious questions. How will the two museum buildings relate to each other? What is the Whitney's curatorial mission? Who is its audience? Is Mr. Piano still the right architect for the job?
 No architect can magically solve a museum's identity crisis on his or her own. That will take a board with the courage of its convictions, something the Whitney has yet to show us. It's hard to imagine its getting many more chances.

HEADLINE: As Investors Covet Ethanol Plant, Farmers Resist

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: MALTA BEND, Mo. 

 BODY:
Farmers do not see fast money very often. But with big profits gushing forth from ethanol plants, dozens of Wall Street bankers, in loafers and suits, have been descending on the cornfields of the Midwest promising to make thousands of farmers rich overnight. 
 Most of them, though, are proving surprisingly reluctant to cash in.
In this sleepy town of 250, for example, people have lived on the edge of despair for decades, dreaming of a way to make their corn worth more than $2 a bushel. Seeking a way out, a group of farmers from here and surrounding communities scoured the state three years ago to raise the money for a $60 million plant that would turn some of their corn into ethanol for cars and lift their incomes.
 When ethanol prices soared to more than $4 a gallon this summer, the plant became a roaring success. 
 And that is when the big money types came knocking. New offers -- some as high as $275 million -- have rolled in just about every week from an investment bank or hedge fund seeking to buy the plant. For the farmers, particularly those who borrowed part of their investment, a sale could have meant a profit of as much as 10 times what they put in.
 So far, however, the plant owners have said no. To them -- and to many other farmers who have invested in ethanol around the country -- the ethanol plants represent more than a winning lottery ticket. Instead, they signify an emotional investment in the future of their farms and communities, a chance for greater independence and a sense of pride that they are helping make America less dependent on foreign oil.
 ''Farmers have never been the best moneymakers,'' said Mark Casner, 30, a seventh-generation farmer and a member of the board of Mid-Missouri Energy, the ethanol operation here. He is against selling out. ''They have gotten in it because they love what they do. I would be tortured if I couldn't be here doing what I do.''
 Despite the gold rush atmosphere, only two farmer-owned ethanol plants are known to have been sold to outsiders: one in Iowa and one in Minnesota.
 One mysterious investor who visited the Mid-Missouri plant a few months ago claimed to represent a pool of $11 billion aimed at ethanol investments, and outlined a bid of about $275 million. The problem? 
 ''He didn't really know what ethanol was,'' said Ryland Utlaut, a veteran of 40 years of corn farming who is the president of Mid-Missouri's board. ''That bothers me. We built this plant.'' 
 The offer, like others, was not firm enough to recommend to the members, he said, and the board, deluged with other offers, has yet to invite the man back.
 But lately some regrets have started to creep in. ''Maybe we have waited too long, '' Mr. Utlaut said.
 The ethanol market has slipped in recent weeks, so for farmers across the Midwest, the window of opportunity for big windfalls could be closing. ''We as board members do have a strong attachment to the plant,'' Mr. Utlaut said. ''But pride can make you poor.''
 Gasoline prices began surging last year and ethanol prices followed upward. In its first seven months after opening in February 2005, the Mid-Missouri plant made a profit of $6.6 million on the farmers' original investment of $22 million. Farmers who invested the minimum of $20,000 received dividends of about $6,000 each.
 The 15-member board continues to debate whether to sell even a part of the plant, let alone a controlling interest. Weeks have turned into months and the board has yet to put any proposal to the cooperative's 729 farmer-owners. A sale would require a two-thirds vote for approval. 
 ''They can almost debate themselves into paralysis,'' said Gregory J. Lynch, a lawyer in Madison, Wis., who has been advising Mid-Missouri's board and the directors of other ethanol plants.
 Mid-Missouri's board members particularly chafe at the notion of selling out to a foreign buyer, as the Iowa ethanol cooperative did when it agreed in March to sell a 60 percent interest to an Australian buyer. They look upon the source of some other proposals with deep suspicion, too.
 ''If Big Oil managed to get control of the ethanol industry we are back to Square 1, and they can set prices wherever they want,'' said Ron Linneman, Mid-Missouri's treasurer.
 From the start, local farmers saw Mid-Missouri as a way to raise the demand for their corn, which until recently had been stuck at around $2 a bushel for the better part of four decades -- not to mention the bite that inflation has taken from that price over all those years. 
 In 2002, a group of 11 farmers near Malta Bend banded together to help change that. During six weeks in early 2003, they made 82 scouting visits in a 150-mile radius, looking for farmers willing to invest in an ethanol plant. Three times a day they made their Power Point pitches in church basements and town halls, even an abandoned train depot where they shivered in the bitter Midwest winter. They drew audiences as large as 150 people and as small as 2.
 Don Arth, Mid-Missouri's vice president, struggled with whether he should remain involved in the equity drive or stay home with his wife, Donna, who was receiving chemotherapy for cancer.
 ''She said, 'This ethanol stuff is important to farmers,' '' Mr. Arth recalled. So he kept at it. Weeks later, before the fund-raising was finished, she died. ''This ethanol plant is what kept me going since she passed,'' Mr. Arth said, his voice cracking at the memory. ''It's kind of my second marriage.''
 Not long after, Mr. Arth stood with the other board members under a tent at the plant's groundbreaking. The directors were introduced, to a standing ovation from 700 people. ''That was really something,'' he said. ''I kept thinking I wished she were there.''
 Mr. Arth, 67, has mixed emotions about selling. ''You hate to see it change hands,'' he said, ''but when we get to looking at it and using a rational mentality on it, it is hard not to look at.''
 But other board members say that they are confident ethanol prices will remain strong for 10 to 20 years and that they think the plant could earn steady returns of at least 10 percent a year. More important, farmers who invested in the plant are getting 10 to 15 cents more for their corn, since Mid-Missouri is paying a premium over the local grain elevator.
 ''I have been farming for 50 years and this is something we have been waiting for all our lives: a way to increase the value of our agricultural commodities,'' said Marvin Oerke, 66, another board member. ''I would hate to turn loose this opportunity to leave something for the kids and grandkids.''
 This year, before the flood of buyout offers, the Mid-Missouri directors decided to double the size of their plant; the project is scheduled to be finished in 2008.
 The ethanol profits are just starting to dribble into the local economy. Farmers have invested in storage bins in the last two years that have added five million bushels of grain storage, giving them a greater ability to decide when and where to sell their corn to maximize the price.
 If the Mid-Missouri board did recommend selling the plant, getting the full membership to agree would not be easy.
 ''I would just as soon we keep it,'' Brent Gorrell, a farmer in Malta Bend who invested in the plant, said while lunching on fried chicken at the Waggin Wheel, a local diner. ''I don't see any price that would make me want to sell.'' 
 But other farmers who invested in the plant pester Mr. Utlaut with calls about the latest rumors of huge offers. Many of them, particularly those who took out loans to finance their share, say ''they are willing to sell part or all of their interest,'' Mr. Utlaut said. 
 On Wall Street, however, many investors find the whole farmers' debate baffling. 
 ''They are out of their minds,'' said Peter C. Fusaro, a principal at the Energy Hedge Fund Center, which tracks such funds. ''We see a glut of ethanol coming.''
 Ethanol prices have already fallen by half since peaking at $4.23 a gallon on the Chicago spot market in June. And for Mid-Missouri, which sells its ethanol on mostly long-term contracts, the price has fallen to $1.60 a gallon, from a peak of $2.68, while corn has recently surged to more than $3 a bushel.
 Outside investors are pestering farmers to sell out now so they can take part in the ethanol boom with existing plants -- before the ethanol market might turn sour. With dozens of new plants coming online next year, the wait to start construction of a new one is three years, said Ron Fagen, chief executive of Fagen Inc., the country's biggest builder of ethanol plants. 
 Still, farmers have reason to be cautious. While many offers are legitimate, others are being cobbled together by fly-by-night investor groups without ethanol experience who are willing to commit little cash upfront, said Mr. Fagen, who constructed the ethanol plant here.
 In Malta Bend, the trucks keep arriving daily to dump the farmers' corn at Mid-Missouri. And the board continues to meet about twice a month to discuss the latest buyout offers.
 ''I wish the industry weren't moving so fast,'' said David Swearingin, a board member who favors combining Mid-Missouri with another cooperative. ''Farmers are cautious, conservative people. But if we stick our head in the sand and do nothing, that opportunity for harvest may be over.''

HEADLINE: With Iraq Driving Election, Voters Want New Approach 

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MEGAN THEE; Marjorie Connelly and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
A substantial majority of Americans expect Democrats to reduce or end American military involvement in Iraq if they win control of Congress next Tuesday and say Republicans will maintain or increase troop levels to try to win the war if they hold on to power on Capitol Hill, according to the final New York Times/CBS News poll before the midterm election.
 The poll showed that 29 percent of Americans approve of the way President Bush is managing the war, matching the lowest mark of his presidency. Nearly 70 percent said Mr. Bush did not have a plan to end the war, and 80 percent said Mr. Bush's latest effort to rally public support for the conflict amounted to a change in language but not policy.
The poll underlined the extent to which the war has framed the midterm elections. Americans cited Iraq as the most important issue affecting their vote, and majorities of Republicans and Democrats said they wanted a change in approach. Twenty percent said they thought the United States was winning in Iraq, down from a high this year of 36 percent in January. 
 Even beyond the war, the Times/CBS News poll, like most other polls this fall, contained worrisome indicators for Republicans as they go into the final days of a campaign in which many are bracing for a loss of seats in both the House and the Senate. 
 In a year when there are many close races, Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans about voting and more likely to say they would support their party's candidates, although Republicans were slightly more likely to say they would actually vote.
 Fifty percent of independent voters, a closely watched segment of the electorate in such polarized times, said they intended to vote for the Democratic candidate, versus 23 who said they would vote for a Republican. 
 Among registered voters, 33 percent said they planned to support Republicans, and 52 percent said they would vote for Democrats. 
 As a rule, generic questions like those, while providing broad insights into the national mood, are often imprecise as a predictor of the outcome of hundreds of Congressional races, where local issues and personalities can shape the result.
 Voters said neither Democrats nor Republicans had offered a plan for governing should they win on Tuesday, the poll found. 
 Yet Americans have some clear notions of how government may change if Democrats win control of Congress. 
 Beyond a quicker exit from Iraq, respondents said they thought a Democratic-led Congress would be more likely to increase the minimum wage, hold down rapidly rising health and prescription drug costs, improve the economy and -- as Republicans have said frequently in these closing days of the campaign -- raise taxes.
 By a slight margin, more respondents said the threat of terrorism would increase under Republicans than said it would increase under Democrats. 
 Notwithstanding the clear expectation among members of both parties that a Democratic-led Congress would produce a change in Iraq policy, it was not clear how much influence that might have on Mr. Bush, who as commander in chief would retain the final say. 
 In addition, while Democrats have coalesced around a general position of finding a way to reduce or end American involvement in Iraq, there is substantial disagreement among Democratic Congressional leaders and candidates about exactly how to accomplish that. 
 Nearly 75 percent of respondents, including 67 percent of Republicans and 92 percent of Democrats, said they expected that Americans troops would be taken out of Iraq more swiftly under a Democratic-led Congress.
 Forty-one percent of respondents said they expected that troop levels would decrease if Democrats won control, while 40 percent said the party would seek to remove all troops. Forty-one percent said they expected troop levels to remain the same if Republicans won, while 29 percent said they thought the United States would send more troops if the Republicans continued to control Congress. 
 Those findings cut across party lines, but the poll found that Democrats were more likely to say Republicans would increase American troop strength while Republicans were more likely to say Democrats would remove all troops.
 Follow-up interviews found clear expectations about the policies each party would pursue in Iraq, even if there was disagreement about which course was correct. 
 ''If the Republicans continue in power, they would probably just want to keep doing what we're doing and doing it longer and harder because the president is Republican and he's the one who sent the troops there in the first place,'' said Ashley Robertson, 20, a Democrat from Minnesota. ''But right now I think it's a bad thing to bring them all home because it's like we went in there to try to help and we're leaving them high and dry and saying clean up our mess.''
 Pat Atley, 73, a Republican from Florida, said she expected Republicans to press for more troops in Iraq if they stayed in power, although she said she hoped they would not. 
 ''I've always felt we were never going to do any good over there,'' Ms. Atley said, adding, ''I don't think we should increase our troops because increased troops aren't going to do anything except put more of our men and women in jeopardy.'' 
 Mr. Bush's overall approval rating was 34 percent, unchanged from a poll three weeks ago, an anemic rating that explains why many Democrats are featuring him in their final advertisements, as well as why some Republican incumbents do not want him at their side. 
 That approval rating is 9 points below where former President Bill Clinton's was in October 1994 -- the election in which Republicans surprised Democrats by taking control of the House -- and 28 points below where Mr. Bush's approval rating was on the eve of the 2002 midterms. 
 In this latest poll, 56 percent of respondents said Mr. Bush's campaigning on behalf of candidates had generally hurt them, as compared with 26 percent who said a campaign visit by Mr. Bush helped.
 There was a slight increase, to 38 percent from 34 percent three weeks ago, in respondents who said they approved of how Mr. Bush was managing the economy. Similarly, there was a slight increase, to 44 percent from 40 percent in July, in respondents who said they approved of how Mr. Bush had managed the situation with North Korea.
 In a year marked by corruption scandals, 58 percent of voters said corruption was widespread in Washington; 35 percent said the Republican Party had the most corrupt politicians, compared with 15 percent who said the Democratic Party did.
 The poll found that the intensity of Democratic support for Democratic candidates was slightly greater than Republican support for Republican candidates, which could give some solace to Democrats who have been concerned that the Republican Party's formidable get-out-the-vote operation would help them eke out victories in close Congressional races. Ninety percent of Democratic voters are planning to vote Democratic, while 83 percent of Republicans said they would support Republican candidates. 
 In addition, 50 percent of Democrats said they felt more enthusiastic about voting in this election than in previous ones, compared with 39 percent of Republicans. 
 But 93 percent of Republicans said they were definitely or probably going to vote next Tuesday, compared with 89 percent of Democrats.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 27 through Oct. 31 with 1,084 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 932 saidthey were registered to vote. 
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to ensure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population.
 Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. 
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, marital status, age and education. 
 Questions about voting preferences in the 2006 elections are based on the responses of likely voters, defined in terms of registration, intention to vote, attention to the campaign, past voting behavior and length of time in the community.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. Shifts in results between polls over time also have a larger sampling error. 
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Wiring Development

 BODY:
The Inter-American Development Bank announced last month that Latin American migrants working in the United States will send a record $45 billion to their families back home this year. At that level, remittances represent the largest and most direct poverty reduction program in the region, topping by far the amounts of foreign aid provided by the United States. Most of the cash arrives in monthly wire transfers of about $300 apiece, and is spent on basics like food, shelter and health care. But development bankers estimate that some $10 billion of remittances could be saved or invested -- if people had access to banks and were encouraged to use them. 
 By banking part of their remittances, recipient families could earn interest, establish credit and provide money for local investment. The result would be more resources to help pay for schooling, starting small businesses or home ownership. Such saving and investment lead to economic growth. And growth at the bottom of the economic scale is the surest way to actually lift people out of poverty.
As it is now, most banks in Latin America that receive remittances simply dole out the sums to recipients, after collecting part of the fee paid by the sender. They make no attempt to turn the recipients into bank customers. Bank officials and the politicians that oversee them need to do more to educate the poor about banking and to offer them services. Banks need to be reminded that such lending can be profitable -- and will further broader national goals for economic growth. To that end, remittances deserve a more prominent place on the agenda at the meetings of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Group of 8 leading industrialized nations. Unless those billions in remittances are banked, money that could fight poverty is not being used to its fullest potential.

HEADLINE: Local Issues Mirror National Ones, but the Special Effects Occasionally Stand Alone

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK; Brenda Goodman contributed reporting from Atlanta and Carolyn Marshall from San Francisco

 BODY:
The election season is getting punchier in places far from the national political spotlight -- even in Eden, N.C., where 16 candidates are slugging it out for the five available seats on the Rockingham County School Board.
 One of them produced a television advertisement suggesting that the school system turned children into automatons. It is shot against a backdrop of a Pink Floyd video showing children coursing through an assembly line to the lyrics: ''We don't need no education. We don't need no thought control.''
Another candidate shows himself brandishing a light saber as a ''Star Wars'' Death Star blows up a little red schoolhouse. The message: the federal government, a ''cosmic bully,'' meddles too much in education. 
 The advertisement of a third contender, riffing on a ''new sheriff in town'' theme, shows a sheriff being killed in ''The Terror of Tiny Town,'' the 1938 all-dwarf musical Western. 
 Not every local race is quite as entertaining, but the Rockingham County election shows how national issues like education, the economy, crime and ethics have been localized.
 And the effort invested in contests for school board, city council, sheriff and state legislatures is emblematic of how much stock voters, interest groups and political parties are placing on local elections.
 ''I sort of argue it's the hidden election,'' Tim Storey, an election analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, said of the local races. ''It's very localized, but in a strange way it's more important. It's how good your school is, how good your road is, how good the hospitals are.'' 
 Some of the races, especially those for state legislatures, have attracted the national political parties. Partisan interest groups have also paid for advertisements in some races. 
 In Colorado, for example, immigration issues have been highlighted in advertisements in the State Senate contest in Jefferson County between Betty Boyd, the Democratic incumbent, and Matt Knoedler, a Republican state representative, and in the State House race between the incumbent, James L. Riesberg, a Democrat, and his challenger, David T. Owen, a Republican state senator.
 ''Special interests have discovered that if you want to get something done, you're going to have to work with legislatures and governors, because you're not going to get anything done in Congress,'' Mr. Storey said. ''They are doing television, doing very targeted walk-the-precinct strategies. State legislative groups are able to raise more money than ever before.'' 
 Some issues mirror national ones writ smaller. Take ethics. Several races have local parallels with national scandals. In San Jose, Calif., the mayor's race is being run against the background of the indictment of the current mayor, Ron Gonzales, on corruption charges. 
 Mr. Gonzales is not seeking re-election, but the two candidates running to succeed him have cast aspersions about ethics against each other. 
 In Alaska, an F.B.I. investigation into ties between lawmakers and a major oil field services company could influence several legislative races. Only one of the six legislators whose offices were searched by federal investigators is running for re-election, but some polls suggest that the investigation has created a wave of n anti-incumbent sentiment. 
 In North Carolina, Speaker Jim Black, a Democrat, is seeking re-election amid a federal and state investigation of people connected with his office. Mr. Black has not been charged, but three people have been convicted, including Mr. Black's first appointee to the state lottery commission, his former political director, and a former state representative who said he took $50,000 from a Democrat to support Mr. Black.
 The investigation is being used as political fodder, not only by Mr. Black's Republican opponent, Hal Jordan, but also by Republicans in other statehouse races who are trying to link their opponents to Mr. Black or to paint Democrats as ethically questionable.
 In other elections, crime has taken local permutations. The mayor's race in Little Rock, Ark., is a four-way contest over ways to deal with a surge in violent crime and the overflowing Pulaski County Jail.
 In South Carolina, Sheriff Steve McCaskill of Kershaw County, a Republican, has been criticized by his opponent, Sammie Tucker Jr., a Democrat and former highway patrolman, for not issuing an Amber Alert in the case of a 14-year-old girl who was kidnapped and held in an underground bunker for 10 days. Sheriff McCaskill has said the girl's case did not meet Amber Alert criteria because law enforcement officials did not have a suspect, a description of a car, or even a clear idea that the girl had been abducted.
 In the Massachusetts governor's race, the Republican candidate, Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey, has made an issue of the fact that her Democratic opponent, Deval Patrick, had advocated the release of Benjamin LaGuer, who Mr. Patrick believed had been wrongly convicted of rape. Mr. Patrick withdrew his support of Mr. LaGuer when a DNA test linked Mr. LaGuer to the crime.
 Ms. Healey has repeatedly raised the rape issue, producing an advertisement showing a woman walking in a dark parking garage and Mr. Patrick in a television interview describing Mr. LaGuer as ''eloquent'' and ''thoughtful.'' 
 The advertisement says: ''If anyone you knew actually praised a convicted rapist, what would you think?'' and concludes, ''Deval Patrick. He should be ashamed, not governor.''
 Polls, however, suggest that the advertisement has not drawn voters to Ms. Healey, and Mr. Patrick is considered comfortably ahead.
 Not every state or local election is turning on a larger national issue. In Pennsylvania, voters are angry over a raise approved last year by state legislators. It was retracted, and 17 lawmakers were defeated in the May primary. But the issue could still reverberate. 
 Indiana has two issues found nowhere else. One is the decision to lease the Indiana Toll Road to a private Spanish-Australian group, and the other is daylight saving time, which the state imposed last year on Indiana's patchwork of time zones. 
 Both issues have resulted in anger at Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican, and the Republican-controlled legislature. 
 Although some Indianans welcome the money from the lease, others are rankled that a state highway is being controlled by foreign investors. 
 And as Indianans turned their clocks back one hour on Sunday for the first time in 30 years, many business owners are grateful to be in step with other parts of the country, but some are angered by a new pattern of confusion. 
 A public employees union paid George Schricker $150 to write a song about the controversy:
 I'm losing track of time. 
 Yes, I'm losing track of time.
 I'm living in two time zones.
 I think I've lost my mind.
 I'm late for my appointments,
 like a clock that's full of grime.
 I come from Indiana, where we're losing track of time.

HEADLINE: Kosovo May Soon Be Free of Serbia, but Not of Supervision

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
In the next few months, Kosovo is likely to win independence from Serbia, concluding a titanic struggle by the United Nations and Western governments to close a chapter that began with ethnic warfare there.
 But it is unlikely to be the conclusion Western governments hoped for, after investing seven years supervising the province at an estimated cost of $1.3 billion a year. It is increasingly evident that the international authorities will need to retain far greater responsibility in Kosovo than they wanted to.
The Kosovo Albanians, the province's majority population, who demand independence, and the government of Serbia have failed to reach an agreement in nine months of negotiations. The Serbs have refused to recognize government institutions dominated by the Albanians in what has been a territory dear to Serbian religious and cultural heritage.
 The negotiations are dragging on, raising the likelihood that a solution will be imposed, ending a process that began 15 years ago with the breakup of Yugoslavia, which led to wars in Croatia, Bosnia and finally Kosovo. 
 The conflict in Kosovo began when long-running tensions between its Albanians and the Serbian-dominated local authorities turned to violence with the start of an Albanian insurgency. Yugoslavia, of which Serbia was then the dominant part, sent in troops, who committed atrocities against civilians and caused thousands to flee their homes. 
 The United States and Western Europe have hoped that a Kosovo agreement would end the risk of violent disputes over borders and alleviate the need for a heavy international civilian and military presence. A European Union-led mission is to take over from the United Nations after Kosovo's future is decided. 
 ''Everybody is anxious to solve this,'' said Joachim Rucker of Germany, chief of the United Nations mission in Kosovo. ''It is the last bit of the Balkan puzzle.''
 The Americans are eager to conclude the matter, but that action may be delayed. Since the government of Serbia would have to review any agreement, the United Nations may want to wait until after the elections that are expected there next year. 
 The Americans are no longer heavily invested in Kosovo militarily -- the United States has slightly more than 1,000 troops from the National Guard based there -- but would be expected to pay some of the costs of establishing a more independent state and would have a role in a European-led mission.
 Whatever the timing, it seems that foreign officials will retain extensive powers and continue to act as an arbitrator between the Albanians and the province's Serbian minority for some time to come, United Nations and European Union officials here say.
 With Kosovo's two million people the poorest in the former Yugoslavia, the financial costs may continue to be substantial. Per capita income is just over $1,000 a year, according to the United Nations Development Program. The International Monetary Fund projects a drop in the gross domestic product, because of general economic decline and the loss to the economy when a large United Nations mission withdraws. 
 ''I think the E.U. is going to be in for a bit of a shock,'' said Anthony C. Welch of Britain, the coordinator of a review of Kosovo's future security needs commissioned by the United Nations. ''I think their role is going to have to be a little more hands-on. And it is going to cost a lot.''
 Kosovo has remained under United Nations control since it was pried away from the Yugoslav security forces in June 1999. While it is still formally part of Serbia, the six nations overseeing the negotiations on its future say it cannot return to Serbian rule.
 The United Nations envoy to the negotiations, Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, has been drafting a settlement, but it is being kept secret. It will first have to be put to both sides in the talks and then given to the Security Council to debate. 
 The parameters of an imposed settlement are fairly clear, though, say United Nations and European Union officials responsible for planning the European successor to the United Nations mission.
 Russia opposes independence for Kosovo, contending that it would set a precedent for other breakaway states. So, officials say, it is unlikely that a Security Council resolution will grant the province full statehood. 
 ''The Security Council would issue a mandate for a mission led by the European Union and invite individual countries to recognize Kosovo,'' Mr. Welch said. Kosovo would not automatically have a seat in the United Nations General Assembly. Serbia is strongly opposed, and two-thirds of the Assembly's members would have to recognize Kosovo before it could gain a seat. 
 The European Union says it does not want to duplicate the overarching powers and cumbersome bureaucracy that the United Nations mission has had in Kosovo, which at one stage totaled 11,000 people, including international police officers. The outside presence has been a source of tension with the Albanian population, some of whom see it as a colonial occupation. As long as there is substantial international oversight, that friction is likely to remain. 
 The new office, headed by an ''international civilian representative,'' will have much more limited powers, European officials say, to be reviewed annually. Its major role would be to put a peace settlement into operation, especially with regard to protecting minorities. It would be able to dismiss local politicians, and to annul laws if they were deemed to be interfering with the peace settlement. 
 ''We will be limited in scope and in power, because we believe the philosophy has to be one of ownership and accountability,'' said Torbjorn Sohlstrom, the Swedish diplomat who leads the small team of European officials setting up the mission.
 Decentralization would grant the Serbian municipal authorities in Kosovo a substantial say over their own affairs. But opposition by Kosovo Serbs to international plans may require a more heavy-handed approach, perhaps even forcing the European mission to appoint representatives if the Serbs refuse to elect their own to an Albanian-dominated government, Mr. Sohlstrom said.
 United Nations and European officials also say a Security Council resolution could lay down much more stringent oversight measures than the ones currently being envisaged. 
 ''I think there are deep misgivings,'' said Judy Batt of Britain, a research fellow at the European Union Institute for Security Studies in Paris. ''I think they are probably horrified but know there is not an alternative.''
 The prospect of greater European responsibility in Kosovo is unlikely to be welcomed by the European Union's members, already disaffected over the costs of the union's enlargement process, especially since they are likely to bear the brunt of Kosovo's substantial economic needs.
 ''Undoubtedly a change in Kosovo status is not a magic wand for solving socioeconomic problems,'' said Frode Mauring of Norway, director of the United Nations Development Program in Kosovo. ''With the downsizing of the international community there is a risk of a recession.'' And economic difficulties can breed social unrest, he added.
 Mr. Rucker, the head of the United Nations mission, said, ''I think it is very clear: if you expect stability, this has a price tag.''

HEADLINE: City Now Expects $2.2 Billion More in Tax Collection 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Surging tax revenues will help New York City take in $2.7 billion more this fiscal year than had been expected, officials said yesterday.
 The revenues -- particularly from commercial property sales and from personal and business incomes -- have been coming in at higher levels than anticipated, accounting for $2.2 billion of the difference between the city's financial forecast in June and an updated forecast released yesterday. That difference brings the budget this year to $55.6 billion, from the $52.9 billion plan approved in June.
All told, the city expects to end the fiscal year on June 30 with $1.9 billion more than it had anticipated. That money is being set aside to reduce the deficit for the next fiscal year. Because of that transfer and the higher tax forecast, that projected deficit has suddenly shrunk to $510 million from $3.8 billion. 
 ''It's certainly a dramatic change,'' the director of the city's Independent Budget Office, Ronnie Lowenstein, said yesterday in describing the sudden spike in anticipated revenues. ''I can't remember the last time it has swung so sharply, so quickly.''
 She added, ''The economy in general and Wall Street in particular are stronger than the Bloomberg administration had anticipated last spring.''
 The forecast -- formally known as the city's four-year financial plan -- is a mandated statement of revenues and expenditures. It is regularly updated. 
 The rosier forecast covers not only the 2007 fiscal year, which began on July 1, but also extends through the 2010 fiscal year, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is to complete his final term.
 Instead of budget deficits of $3.8 billion, $4.6 billion and $4.1 billion for the 2008 to 2010 fiscal years, the city now expects deficits of $510 million, $4.1 billion and $3.6 billion.
 Mark Page, director of the city's Office of Management and Budget, said that although the residential real estate market has been stagnant, the commercial side is holding ground. The city collects taxes when properties are sold and when mortgages are recorded. 
 ''The revenues from residential transactions have been dropping pretty steadily since about last December -- almost a year now,'' he said. ''They're dropping less precipitously than we had forecast, but they're dropping. What's driving the significant increase in revenues from what he had forecast in June are commercial property transactions, where we're actually a little higher than we were a year ago.'' 
 Mr. Page, who has been the mayor's budget czar since 2002, offered hope that the commercial market might remain strong for some time longer. ''The current tight vacancy and increasing per-square-foot costs of office space, particularly in Manhattan, would suggest this will continue somewhat. We're not expecting it to continue indefinitely, but it's looking pretty good at the moment.'' 
 On the expense side of the ledger, the updated financial plan includes a few costs this year that were not anticipated in June. The biggest, $256 million, is going toward a contract settlement announced in July with the city's largest municipal union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
 In New York City, the only binding revenue estimate is the mayor's. By suddenly adding $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.5 billion to the tax revenue projections for 2008 to 2010 (not to mention $2.2 billion for this year), the city's budget officials may tempt the Council to increase spending. But the mayor still expects sizable deficits in his last years in office. 
 In the past, council members have accused some mayors of deliberately understating revenues to prevent added outlays, but no one suggested yesterday that that was the case.
 Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., who called the updated financial plan ''great news,'' said the informal deficit estimates by his office and the Council for the next few years have been comparable with the mayor's.

HEADLINE: If Long Shot Becomes Comptroller, Vast New Responsibilities Await 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
As the treasurer of Saratoga County, J. Christopher Callaghan oversaw a small upstate area's spare money, placing as much as $100 million at a time in the most basic of investments: money market funds and certificates of deposit at local banks. 
 If Mr. Callaghan wins the election for comptroller of New York, as he has a legitimate shot of doing in the wake of the scandal surrounding Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, he will be transformed into one of the world's most powerful investors.
 In a job unknown to many voters, the comptroller is the sole trustee of one of the largest and most complex investment entities, the $145 billion New York State pension fund, which invests in everything from hedge funds to blue chip stocks to venture capital.
 It would be quite a heady new set of responsibilities for Mr. Callaghan, 59, a man who does not, by his own reckoning, have enough spare cash to invest beyond his retirement savings. 
 ''My investments are not extensive,'' Mr. Callaghan said in an interview, adding that he spent his money on ''groceries, the mortgage.''
 ''Like most New Yorkers, it's pretty much paycheck to paycheck, or pension check to pension check,'' he added. 
 Mr. Callaghan, a Republican, retired during the summer after a decade as Saratoga County treasurer to pursue what seemed like a nearly hopeless bid for comptroller against Mr. Hevesi, a well-known Democratic politician once considered a shoo-in for re-election.
 But Mr. Callaghan changed the dynamics of the race when he revealed, with the help of an unnamed tipster, that Mr. Hevesi had used a state employee to chauffeur his wife for several years, a revelation that has made him a pariah within his own party and damaged his chances for re-election. 
 As Mr. Hevesi works to salvage his political career, his strategy has been to brand Mr. Callaghan as someone who is, as he said in a recent debate, ''not qualified to be the comptroller of New York.'' Among other things, the Saratoga County treasurer oversees roughly a dozen employees. ''If you think that qualifies you to run an office of 2,400 professionals, we may have a disagreement,'' Mr. Hevesi said. 
 Fellow Democrats have echoed those concerns, even as their support for Mr. Hevesi wavers. 
 ''You have to have had managerial experience, managing a rather large organization,'' said H. Carl McCall, a former Democratic comptroller who worked for several years at Citibank before he preceded Mr. Hevesi, whom he still supports. 
 He said that being the fund's sole trustee was ''the most daunting part of the job.''
 ''You have to make decisions about what asset classes you're going to put your money in: how much in bonds, how much in stocks, how much in real estate, how much in private equity,'' Mr. McCall said. 
 Republicans see it differently. ''Alan Hevesi was a state assemblyman for 20 years prior to becoming the city comptroller,'' said Ryan Moses, a spokesman for the state Republican Party. ''What were his qualifications?''
 Mr. Hevesi's staff pointed out that he was a member of the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee, which deals with finance and budget issues, before becoming city comptroller in 1994.
 Mr. Callaghan bristled at the suggestion that he was unqualified.
 ''The Democrats say that 35 years of accounting, governmental accounting, doesn't prepare me for this job,'' he said. ''They say that the approbation of my peers when they elected me president of the county treasurers association counts for nothing.''
 Mr. Callaghan's career has included serving as the budget officer of his small hometown, Waterford, and as a management analyst for the Saratoga County administrator before becoming treasurer in 1997. He said he had no investments outside of his individual retirement account and deferred compensation plan, except for shares in an insurance company. 
 ''Anybody who does a lot of investing and thinks they can manage a $140 billion pension fund is nuts,'' he said. ''That why you have the experts.''
 He has personality, if not political polish. He wears a trademark bow tie, drives a '99 Honda Civic, writes limericks and plays the piano. Early in his campaign, he appeared at state fairs beside large pictures of Mr. Hevesi at booths operated by the comptroller's office, raising the double-barreled question of when Mr. Hevesi might appear for a debate and why he was spending money on booths at fairs. 
 Mr. Callaghan has denounced a practice for which Mr. Hevesi and Mr. McCall have been criticized: taking large donations from executives at investment firms that do business with the pension fund. 
 What would he actually do as comptroller? 
 His most significant idea is borrowed from the Manhattan Institute, the conservative research group, and would probably be dead on arrival in New York. Simply put, he wants to switch new state workers to a 401(k)-style retirement plan instead of a pension with a guaranteed payout, following the trend in corporate America. Such a measure could only be recommended and would need approval by the Legislature, but union opposition would almost certainly doom such a move.
 Mr. Callaghan says he would not seek to overhaul the way the pension fund itself is managed, though he would tweak it. He does not like the idea of using the state's pension fund money for social causes, like community development, and he is suspicious of some of Mr. Hevesi's foreign investments. That includes a venture capital investment in Israel, which he has likened to ''foreign aid.'' 
 His objection to the investment, made with a company called Markstone Capital Group, was that Mr. Hevesi received a campaign donation from the family of the company's chief executive, Elliot Broidy, and played too active a role in promoting the investment to the California pension fund. 
 ''Mr. Hevesi said that he believed in the economy of Israel and so do I, that's fine, but the investment in the pension fund should not be part of Alan Hevesi's foreign policy,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean you shouldn't have foreign investments.''
 ''That investment was doubly tainted by the campaign contributions and by Hevesi's efforts to sell it to the California pension system,'' he added. 
 Matt Mullarkey, a spokesman for Mr. Hevesi, said that pension fund assets had increased more than 50 percent during his boss's tenure and that ''international investments are not foreign aid or foreign policy.'' He added that Mr. Callaghan's terminology ''demonstrates why he is unqualified.''
 Mr. Callaghan has often said that his role model is Ned Regan, the Republican who preceded Mr. McCall and served as comptroller from 1979 to 1993. But Mr. Regan, when questioned about Mr. Callaghan's qualifications, declined to respond, or to say anything about the race. 
 ''I just have decided for all sorts of reasons that I'm just not going to comment,'' Mr. Regan said.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 11, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 3 about disputed actuarial methods used by Alan G. Hevesi, the New York State comptroller, in making disclosures about the state's pension funds referred incorrectly to an investment he made in a company whose chief executive contributed to his re-election campaign. (The same error appeared in articles on Nov. 2, about the responsibilities of the comptroller's office, and on June 18, 2003, about Mr. Hevesi's decision to invest $200 million in Israeli companies.) The investment, with Markstone Capital Group, was made in a private equity fund that invests in Israel, not a venture capital fund.

HEADLINE: Developers Are Poised For Projects In Midtown

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Brookfield Financial Properties bought a development parcel on Ninth Avenue last week for well over $100 million in the latest sign, developers say, that the market is finally ripe for building new office towers in Midtown.
 For two decades, Brookfield has owned an adjacent site, across Ninth Avenue from the Farley Post Office building, between 31st and 33rd Streets, but was unable to lure a corporate tenant that far west during real estate booms in the 1980s and the late 1990s.
Now, with rents soaring and few large blocks of space available in Midtown, Brookfield, one of the largest commercial landlords in the city, decided that the time was right to acquire the adjacent parcel from Harvey Schulweis to build two, or possibly three, office towers. Combined, the properties cover five acres, about the size of Bryant Park. Under the current zoning, the company could build up to 4.6 million square feet of space, the equivalent of two Empire State Buildings. 
 In addition, SJP Properties, Vornado Realty Trust and Boston Properties are considering new commercial towers on the West Side after a six-year lull in office development.
 ''I'm extremely bullish,'' said Josh Kuriloff, an executive vice president at Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial broker. ''There is a window to build new office buildings on spec and be enormously successful as rents continue to spike. Financial institutions and global law firms will pay a premium for high-end space.''
 According to Cushman & Wakefield, the vacancy rate for prime Midtown office space has fallen to its lowest point since 2000, 4.8 percent, while the average annual rent has climbed to more than $60 per square foot.
 And two buildings that are already under construction, including the headquarters for The New York Times, have leased nearly all their space at rents that were unthinkable two years ago. The developer Douglas Durst and the Bank of America are building a 54-story, 2.1 million-square-foot tower at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas, where a law firm recently signed a deal for $100 per square foot. 
 So far this year, 31 companies have signed deals with rents of $100 or more per square foot, which is about what a developer needs today to justify building a new tower.
 So unlike Mr. Durst, who started his project with an anchor tenant, SJP Properties plans to break ground soon on a 40-story, 1.1 million-square-foot office tower at the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue without a tenant.
 ''This is the first time in 25 years that we've seen the Midtown market this strong for Class A office space,'' Steven J. Pozycki, SJP's chairman, said when the company bought the land in August for $305 million.
 Across Eighth Avenue from SJP's site, Vornado Realty Trust and the Lawrence Ruben Company recently revived talks with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to build a 1.3 million-square-foot office tower over the north wing of the bus terminal. The developers agreed in 1999 to pay the Port Authority more than $110 million for the development rights, and there were talks about building a headquarters for Cisco Systems. But the dot-com boom collapsed in 2000, along with the chances of landing a tenant.
 Since then, the two sides have been in litigation, though they now seem eager to get the project moving again.
 Vornado also owns another potential development site, the Pennsylvania Hotel, across Seventh Avenue from Madison Square Garden.
 Related Companies and Boston Properties are putting together a commercial development site on the east side of Eighth Avenue at 45th Street, according to real estate executives, that would involve using air rights from nearby Broadway theaters.
 But it can take years to obtain government approvals and erect a tower. The New York market can be fast-moving and treacherous. In 2000, when the Midtown vacancy rate was 2.2 percent, the developer Jules Demchick planned a 17-story office building for the north side of 42nd Street near 12th Avenue. But New York soon plunged into a recession, and the vacancy rate jumped, although housing prices continued to rise. 
 Mr. Demchick, a shrewd builder, switched back to his original plan, a 49-story apartment tower, which is now nearing completion, by a different developer.

HEADLINE: Latin Grammys Finally Arrive in Mambo's Hometown

BYLINE: By MICHELLE O'DONNELL

 BODY:
In Spanish Harlem more than half a century ago, a young Puerto Rican boy named Ernest Anthony Puente tapped rhythms on his windowsill on East 110th Street. He grew up to be Tito Puente, the acclaimed bandleader who put mambo on the world's musical map and made New York the center of yet another lively sound. 
 Tonight when the Latin Grammy Awards make their New York debut in a glitzy production at Madison Square Garden, it will be a fitting homecoming for the Latin music industry. Latin music can trace many of its roots back to New York, not only through Mr. Puente but through the singer Celia Cruz, and other musicians who fused their famous sounds in the city, including Mario Bauza and Mongo Santamaria. 
Given this rich history, the fact that the Latin Grammys have never before been held in New York is somewhat surprising -- especially because one of the awards shows to beat them here were last year's Country Music Awards.
 ''Symbolically, I think it has great significance,'' said Leila Cobo, the Latin bureau chief for Billboard magazine. ''When Latin music was happening in the '40s and '50s, this is where it was happening -- salsa, merengue, cha cha cha.''
 New York has since become known for inspiring other music genres, such as rap and hip-hop, and the Latin music industry is now firmly entrenched in Miami. 
 Still, for some, the best part about the Latin Grammys finally arriving in New York is not the sentimental link to the past, but the prospect of matching one of the most diverse awards shows -- which includes categories for Mexican regional music styles alongside salsa, merengue, pop and rock -- with one of the most diverse Latino populations in the country. 
 Puerto Ricans have long made up New York's largest Latino group, but they are joined now by large numbers of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil and Mexico, to name a few countries. The Latin Grammys have 47 categories, everything from tejano to reggaeton, and performers must sing in Spanish or Portuguese.
 Then there is the opportunity for Latin performers to plug in to New York's vast musical universe, especially those who want to cross over to English audiences.
 ''There is no doubt that New York makes the platform higher and wider,'' said Gabriel Abaroa, the president of the Latin Recording Academy, which sponsors the awards. 
 ''It's like all of the sudden you are playing in the big leagues,'' Mr. Abaroa added, describing the age-old experience of every aspiring nobody who tried to make it in New York. ''When you have that, you challenge yourself to make sure you deliver to the standards of this city.''
 Sometimes, the big, anonymous city delivers something back. Ricky Martin, who accepted the academy's Person of the Year Award at a banquet last night, recalled the eight months in 1990 when he lived in Long Island City after five hectic years in the boy band Menudo.
 ''I was 18 and I wanted to know what I wanted with life,'' Mr. Martin said yesterday. ''I wasn't even sure if I wanted to be back in the business. And to live anonymously and to be able to sit on a park bench and think, it was an interesting moment.''
 The awards, first held in 2000, have been staged in Los Angeles and Miami. Latin music is the only music category that has registered growth in national sales in the past two years, according to Ms. Cobo. In heavily Mexican parts of the city, like Elmhurst and Corona, Queens, where iPods are a rare sight, Latin music stores are thriving, even as other music stores go out of business. 
 While the city's Economic Development Corporation estimates that the show, which will be broadcast on the Univision television network, will generate $30 million for New York businesses, some hope all the attention will eventually give the city something else: a new movement in Latin music to call its own. 
 Perhaps, Ms. Cobo mused, there is a musical sound percolating among the city's new Latin immigrants that has yet to be discovered.
 Elena Martinez, a New York folklorist, had a more modest aim for the Latin Grammys. ''I hope it does bring recognition for the younger generation who has grown up on Shakira,'' she said. ''I don't know if they're aware of the history or the roots and a lot of those roots are here in New York City.''

HEADLINE: '07 Models Wait for Space on Chrysler Lots Crowded With '06 Cars

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
What happens when nearly half the vehicles on your dealers' lots are from the 2006 model year, and the 2007 model year is more than a month under way? For the Chrysler Group, it means stepping up zero percent financing deals in hopes of clearing the way for the newer cars and trucks.
 Chrysler said Wednesday that it would expand its incentive offers after reporting disappointing October sales figures. Things were better for its crosstown rivals, General Motors and Ford, which both said sales rose last month from a dismal month a year ago. 
In all, industry sales rose 10.3 percent, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The industry was hit hard last year by the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which sent gasoline prices spiking above $3 a gallon and devastated the economy of the Gulf region.
 Statistics released by the companies showed that 80 percent of G.M.'s dealer inventories were 2007 cars, while 76 percent of the vehicles at hand at Ford dealers were cars and trucks from the new model year.
 By contrast, only a little more than half the 509,000 vehicles on hand at Chrysler dealers are 2007 models. The figure did not include an undisclosed number of cars and trucks in an order bank that have not been spoken for by either dealers or customers. 
 The situation with Chrysler's order bank came to light last month, shortly before Chrysler reported a loss of nearly $1.5 billion for the third quarter. On Wednesday, Chrysler officials declined to specify how many vehicles remained in its bank, which swelled as high as 100,000 cars and trucks this summer before dropping to about 50,000 last month.
 On Wednesday, Steven J. Landry, Chrysler's vice president for sales, described the unassigned inventory as being a ''very small number'' but would not be more specific.
 Mr. Landry said Chrysler was committed to eliminating the order bank by year's end. The accumulation of unsold vehicles was ''not part of our business plan,'' Mr. Landry added, but he said the situation was not a major concern for Chrysler. Company auditors ''have reviewed the situation on unassigned inventory, and they're O.K. with it,'' he said.
 Ford's chief sales analyst, George Pipas, said his company's lower supply of 2006 models put Ford dealers in a strong position. ''Historically, at the end of October you're doing pretty well'' by getting to two-thirds new-model-year vehicles and one-third leftover cars, Mr. Pipas said.
 Although G.M. and Ford have more 2007 vehicles on dealer lots, they, like Chrysler, have more than 90 days' worth of cars and trucks on hand. Detroit auto companies consider a 65-day supply to be a manageable level. Japanese companies like Toyota and Honda keep even smaller supplies of unsold vehicles on hand.
 The heavy inventories at the three Detroit carmakers have frustrated dealers, who say they are being pressured to clear out 2006 models before concentrating on selling the 2007 versions. 
 Several large corporations that own hundreds of dealerships across the country -- including Group 1 Automotive, Sonic Automotive and AutoNation -- have said in recent days that they would cut back on orders from Detroit's automakers until inventories were more under control.
 ''You're trying to sell to today's market, but you have what's been produced for yesterday's market,'' said Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation, which has 335 franchises in 16 states. Mr. Jackson has said that AutoNation dealers might order 30 percent fewer vehicles in the fourth quarter from G.M., Ford and Chrysler.
 Chrysler's sales rose 1 percent in October compared with a year ago, and its market share fell to 13.1 percent from 14.9 percent, according to Autodata Incorporated, the industry statistics firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. G.M.'s share grew to 24.5 percent, from 22.2 percent, according to Ward's, with sales that rose 22 percent from a year ago, and Ford's share rose to 17.3 percent, from 17.1 percent, while its sales rose 12.3 percent.
 Toyota reported the best October sales in its history, taking 15.6 percent of the American market, compared with 15.1 last year. Its sales rose 13.6 percent, again putting it ahead of DaimlerChrysler, which includes Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz.
 Chrysler insists that new models will help it through its slump, but analysts are still waiting for evidence that the automaker is improving.
 ''On the bright side, this is probably the worst for them,'' said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with Edmunds.com, which advises consumers on buying cars. ''This is a period where a lot of their product line is really close to the end of the lifecycle.''
 Chrysler is introducing a series of new models through the end of the year that executives say will reverse the company's slump.

HEADLINE: In Cuomo's Last Administrative Job, a Program Was Tainted by Corruption

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER and MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
It was a major embarrassment for Andrew M. Cuomo during his tenure as the nation's housing secretary.
 Inept and corrupt investors, some of them nonprofit organizations, bilked a loan program aimed at turning broken-down buildings into affordable housing, leaving taxpayers with a $250 million cleanup bill. Buildings were flipped, at fraudulently inflated prices, leading to hundreds of foreclosures. Parts of Harlem and Brooklyn were the hardest hit in the nation.
Mr. Cuomo, now the Democratic candidate for New York attorney general, has made his claim of having reduced waste and fraud at the Department of Housing of Urban Development a centerpiece of his campaign. He maintains that he quickly addressed the problems and that his tenure at the giant federal agency was marked by clean audits and improved balance sheets.
 ''Once HUD detected fraud in the program, it moved quickly to work with the F.B.I. and Department of Justice and prosecute the wrongdoers,'' said Wendy Katz, a Cuomo campaign spokeswoman. 
 A review of records, though, shows that Mr. Cuomo's top administrators had been warned for years about problems with the loan program. 
 The HUD inspector general issued warnings in 1996 that were echoed in an audit released and sent to Mr. Cuomo in February 1997, just after he took over the department. 
 Two years later, the General Accounting Office, the chief investigative arm of Congress, repeated the same warnings and criticized housing officials, saying they had not followed through on an agreement to fix the loan program. Even the private auditor that Mr. Cuomo's administration had hired said the risks of losses were so significant that HUD should revamp the program, or close it.
 Mr. Cuomo and his top managers have said they mistrusted reports by the inspector general because they believed she was politically motivated. They reacted to the General Accounting Office report, records show, by calling the program ''a minor, yet still important, portion'' of HUD's operation.
 Disputes aside, many people involved in the program agree that the department's delay in acting came with a huge cost: fraudulent schemes multiplied rapidly, especially in New York City. The federal government wound up covering $120 million in defaulted mortgages nationwide and an additional $130 million to repair the buildings in the city. The plans of neighborhood groups to provide more decent, affordable housing were set back years.
 Former City Councilman Bill Perkins, a Harlem Democrat who was one of the first to raise questions about abuses in New York, has called the schemes the ''worst scandal in the recorded history of our community.''
 Mr. Perkins, now a candidate for the State Senate, said Mr. Cuomo responded to appeals to resolve the problem before he left office in January 2001. But he added that Mr. Cuomo shared some of the blame for what occurred because ''it happened on his watch.''
 ''It was so deep and so insidious,'' he said. ''It made you wonder, 'How could this happen in the first place? Who was watching it?' ''
 Ms. Katz characterized the loan program, known as 203(K), as a tiny portion of the housing department's mission and its problems as an aberration. She said that during Mr. Cuomo's administration, the General Accounting Office lifted a ''high-risk'' designation from a major part of HUD's operation, a significant accomplishment for a troubled agency. She added that Mr. Cuomo's tenure had also reaped awards for innovation from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
 ''Focusing on the 203(K) program is an attempt to use the exception to try to disprove the rule,'' Ms. Katz said in an e-mail message. ''The clear 'rule' is that Cuomo did well at reforming a department that most believed was doomed.'' 
 Mr. Cuomo's job at HUD remains his only one managing a large government agency and is arguably the only position that approximates what will be his duties overseeing 500 lawyers, and more than 1,300 other employees, if he is elected attorney general on Tuesday.
 When he was nominated as HUD secretary by President Bill Clinton in December 1996, after four years as an assistant secretary, Mr. Cuomo inherited an agency with a $19 billion budget, more than 10,000 employees and a wounded reputation from years of scandals. His first order of business was to come up with an overhaul plan that would restore the department's credibility. 
 But as the Cuomo administration worked on the ambitious remaking of the agency, some of its officials were becoming increasingly aware of, and regulators were becoming alarmed by, abuses in the 203(K) program.
 The 203(K) program is HUD's main tool for rehabilitating single-family homes. Its loans differ from typical ones insured by its parent division, the Federal Housing Administration, in that the mortgage covers both the purchase price and the restoration costs. The program also allows investors and nonprofit groups to buy and improve the properties.
 In July 1996, an interim audit by the HUD inspector general found that appraisers, investors, lenders and lawyers were colluding to value unrepaired homes as if repairs had been made, then quickly sell them at artificially increased prices.
 ''The 203(K) program, as currently designed, is too risky because it permits investors, nonprofits and lenders to walk away with big profits, leaving HUD liable for the mortgages,'' the preliminary audit noted. 
 The program had been streamlined and marketed starting in 1994. Its insured loans soared to $3.6 billion in 1998 from $400 million in 1994, according to the General Accounting Office, whose name was changed in 2004 to the Government Accountability Office.
 In response to the 1996 audit, HUD banned profit-seeking investors. But many other suggestions would go unheeded for years. Due to staffing shortages, for example, the agency declined to add procedures to monitor loans to nonprofits, a later report noted.
 On Feb. 6, 1997, a week after Mr. Cuomo was confirmed by the Senate, the inspector general's final audit strengthened the preliminary findings. Among the flaws it found: Borrowers had never made the required down payments. Nonprofit groups were not performing the construction work within the six-month time limit, if at all, and had insufficient construction experience. Loans were granted on properties that did not need rehabilitation.
 William C. Apgar, who in 1998 took over the HUD division in charge of the program, the Federal Housing Administration, under Mr. Cuomo, said that some issues raised in the audits were addressed but that the situation also required changes to the law that established the 203(K) program. For instance, the law dictated that mortgage lenders, not HUD, chose appraisers to evaluate prospective properties, an arrangement that Mr. Apgar said made the program more susceptible to fraud.
 Mr. Apgar, who now teaches at Harvard, also said that Mr. Cuomo and others in HUD's leadership were deeply skeptical of Inspector General Susan Gaffney's work, saying it often seemed aimed at undermining the department's programs and ignored positive steps taken by its management. He suggested that politics was behind some of the criticism.
 ''There was definitely a partisan aspect to it,'' Mr. Apgar said. ''There were a lot of people back then gunning for Cuomo to knock him out of politics in New York.''
 Audits and Congressional testimony show that Ms. Gaffney, who was appointed by President Clinton to oversee 700 auditors and investigators at the HUD inspector general's office, had repeatedly criticized Mr. Cuomo's plan to revamp the agency as devoting too much staff to public relations functions and too little to oversight. 
 The relationship between Ms. Gaffney and Mr. Cuomo grew so tense that she ultimately filed a complaint accusing him and his aides of harassment, which she said included leaks of bogus and damaging information about her to reporters and abusive calls from Mr. Cuomo to her at home. At the time, a HUD spokeswoman dismissed the complaint as an attempt to divert attention from problems in Ms. Gaffney's own office. 
 Other reports, however, eventually buttressed Ms. Gaffney's warnings about the 203(K) program. 
 In October 1998, the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick, working under contract with Housing and Urban Development, issued a draft study that noted high default rates and that said HUD ''had done little to address the long-term viability of the program,'' according to the accounting office.
 Then, in June 1999, the accounting office released its report, substantiating the early warnings by the inspector general, and sent a copy to Mr. Cuomo. ''HUD management has done little to address problems with the program identified by both internal and external reviews over the past four years,'' it noted. 
 The accounting office said Mr. Apgar had not focused on the 203(K) program because he ''has been devoting most of his attention to addressing issues in programs that are much larger in scope and volume.''
 In its response, Mr. Apgar's office argued that the agency was doing enough: ''The department is pleased that the General Accounting Office (GAO) has taken the initiative to evaluate such a minor, yet still important, portion of F.H.A.'s overall business.''
 The audits had examined the program in 10 states, but not in New York. Abuse of the program in the city was quietly booming, however. 
 The first public hint of that came in a tenants' rights newsletter in April 1999, followed by an article that November in City Limits, a magazine about New York urban affairs. A wave of newspaper articles followed. 
 In January 2000, city newspapers noted that a Brooklyn-based nonprofit agency, Helpline Soul Rescue Ministry, had participated in the program, even though it had no previous experience in rehabilitation work. 
 Helpline was eventually accused of conspiring with real estate brokers and a lender to obtain inflated mortgages totaling $13.7 million on 65 buildings, according to a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in 2000. The case was ultimately settled, with the defendants paying $257,000 to create a fund for tenants of the buildings. In all, nearly three dozen people were arrested, and at least 19 pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the scandal, most of them in New York.
 In early 2000, Mr. Cuomo began issuing regular press releases announcing that he was developing plans to curtail predatory lending. That spring he released plans to shore up the program against fraud, including seeking legislative changes. 
 ''Let's be clear: the 203(K) fraud in New York was the work of a criminal conspiracy of felons -- sellers, appraisers and some lenders,'' said Ms. Katz, the campaign spokeswoman. ''A dedicated conspiracy among multiple parties falsifying documents and determined to hide the facts takes time to untangle. The facts are those were criminal actions by criminals, who were caught by HUD, period.''
 But fixing the damage already wrought was an immediate concern in 2000. 
 Mr. Cuomo came to New York late that year to meet with leaders of the Abyssinian Development Corporation, the development arm of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, and other groups with experience in urban development issues. He asked for their help in working out a speedy solution, said Karen A. Phillips, who was then president of the corporation and now heads the Black Equity Alliance, a nonprofit group. 
 Mr. Cuomo's bailout plan was announced days before he left office in January 2001. He said it would be binding on the incoming administration. But the Bush administration did not agree and later negotiated its own a deal with the city to foreclose on and repair 500 buildings. That effort is nearly complete. 
 ''An effective plan was in place when Cuomo left,'' said Ms. Katz, his spokeswoman. ''The Bush administration then reversed that plan and created any lingering problems.''
 Irvin Henderson, the chairman of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an organization that seeks to promote private investment in poor neighborhoods, credited Mr. Cuomo for his changes in 2000. But he said not enough was done before.
 ''When you look at Secretary Cuomo's role,'' Mr. Henderson said, ''I think much of the criticism speaks to the fact that there just was not the oversight necessary for all of the elements.''
 On Sept. 10, 2001, Congressional hearings were held on the scandal, but they were overshadowed by the terrorist attacks the next day. By then, Ms. Gaffney had retired. But even under new leadership, the inspector general's office did not spare HUD criticism over its performance on the 203(K) program.
 ''HUD's very poor management allowed this slow-moving theft of huge proportions to go undetected, until it was too late,'' Robert C. Groves, an assistant inspector general, said in testimony.

HEADLINE: North Korea Talks: Back to the Table, Some Reluctantly

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Officially, the Bush administration is ''pleased'' -- as President Bush put it on Wednesday -- that North Korea has agreed to resume talks on nuclear disarmament. But behind closed doors at the White House and the State Department, some are less happy, saying the country's nuclear test should be answered with isolation.
 When it comes to North Korea, the Bush administration has always found itself pulled in two directions -- confrontation versus engagement -- and has generally settled on a middle course that was neither. To persuade North Korea to return to the bargaining table, President Bush agreed last week to a slight softening of his stance against direct talks with North Korea, a concession that made clear that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in charge of the policy, at least for now. 
But Ms. Rice is coming under increased fire inside and outside the administration from officials and experts who are skeptical about what diplomacy can achieve in this case, and who argue that there is no chance a new round of nuclear talks with North Korea will succeed.
 ''What's a good description? Fantasy? Dreamworld?'' said Nicholas Eberstadt, a North Korea expert with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ''All we're doing with these hapless efforts at conference diplomacy is continuing to talk while North Korea continues to build nuclear weapons.''
 A senior Bush administration official was equally pointed in criticizing the new initiative. ''In the past, the one thing we could never be criticized for was whether our tough talk meant something,'' said the official, who has participated in internal debates and would speak only on condition of anonymity about his dissenting views. ''When we gave a stick, they knew we were serious. We've lost that credibility.''
 This is not a new debate by any stretch. Within the administration, a more hawkish wing that includes Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and John R. Bolton, the ambassador to the United Nations, has chafed against talks with any American foe, be it North Korea or Iran. Meanwhile, advocates of diplomacy, including R. Nicholas Burns and Philip D. Zelikow, two of Ms. Rice's top lieutenants at the State Department, have sided with European allies in saying that the United States should engage its foes.
 But the fact that the debate has resurfaced with such vigor suggests that even North Korea's decision to test a nuclear device on Oct. 9 in defiance of American warnings has not changed the old fault lines.
 Ms. Rice has found herself in the middle of the tug-of-war as she seeks to mute international criticism of America's so-called cowboy diplomacy. On the two big nuclear proliferation issues, Iran and North Korea, Ms. Rice has helped to move the administration away from unilateralism, with President Bush offering in May to join European negotiations over Iran's nuclear ambitions. 
 Even after North Korea conducted a round of missile tests in July and three months later tested the nuclear device, the United States continued to call for it to return to six-nation disarmament talks.
 ''Pretty clearly, the president of the United States thinks we're doing the right thing,'' the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said Wednesday. ''This pathway is the best opportunity we have to achieve the objective we all share: a denuclearized Korean peninsula.''
 Ms. Rice argues that a new round of talks will be different and that the United States will wield more leverage because the negotiations will take place while North Korea is under United Nations sanctions for the nuclear test. But Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, has participated in multiple rounds of talks over the past several years while accelerating his pursuit of nuclear weapons. 
 North Korea boycotted the talks last year after the United States imposed financial penalties in September 2005 on Banco Delta Asia, a bank in Macao, accusing it of helping the North launder money and pass counterfeit $100 bills manufactured by the North Korean government. 
 For a year, North Korea refused to return to the talks, and the United States refused to lift the sanctions. The Bush administration balked at North Korean overtures for one-on-one talks, insisting that America would talk to North Korea only as part of the six-party negotiations. But last week, Chinese officials contacted the American Embassy in Beijing and proposed a three-way meeting involving the United States, North Korea and China. That step required a shift in the American line against direct talks, but in response to a request from Ms. Rice, Mr. Bush agreed.
 The chief American negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, worked out the deal in a seven-hour session on Tuesday with his Chinese and North Korean counterparts. As a concession to entice North Korea back to the talks, the United States agreed to discuss the financial restrictions arising from the counterfeiting issue, a gesture that has been criticized inside and outside the administration.
 There is ''zero chance'' that the talks will persuade North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program, said John Tkacik, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a former State Department diplomat. ''My Machiavellian mind tells me that the Chinese have worked out a deal with the Russians and the North Koreans that if North Korea comes back to the six-party talks, the main issue will not be denuclearization, it will be counterfeiting.''
 American negotiators continue to maintain the financial restrictions will remain unless North Korea stops counterfeiting United States currency. ''They have to get out of the illicit-activities business and get out of the counterfeiting business,'' Mr. Hill said in an interview Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Rife as Onion Domes, Moscow's Casinos Face Closing

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Could there be a better symbol for the new Moscow -- seductive, indulgent, awash in got-quick riches -- than the casino?
 There are more than 60 of them in the city now, neon palaces of capitalist glitter and risk that have become as ubiquitous as the onion domes of Russian Orthodoxy. One major street, Novy Arbat, has more than a passing resemblance to the Las Vegas Strip, and even a casino called the Mirage.
 There is just one cloud on this rosy horizon: they are all to be closed, though perhaps not for a while.
 Pressed by President Vladimir V. Putin, the only political authority that matters anymore, lawmakers are drafting a law that would banish casinos, slot-machine parlors and other gambling halls from Moscow, though they could be allowed to operate in a few other places. 
 Unless lawmakers buck Mr. Putin, which has yet to happen, the new law would do more to alter the cityscape of Moscow than any other since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government banned gambling -- even playing cards in public -- until the end of the 1980s and, perhaps not coincidentally, the end of its history.
 The first big casinos followed hard on the Soviet collapse, but they have proliferated since 2001, when an easing of licensing rules coincided with Russia's growing economic boom, creating a frenzy of easily disposed income. Industry officials here estimate that nearly $6 billion is spent on gambling each year in Russia.
 Moscow now has more casinos than any other city except Las Vegas and Miami, according to the World Casino Directory, an online industry association. (St. Petersburg is sixth.) That does not include hundreds of small shops with slot machines.
 ''The new Russians -- I would say 80 percent are gamblers,'' a gambler who declined to give more than his first name and patronymic, Vadim Pavlovich, said as he moved from the poker table to the roulette wheel at a casino here called Jazz Town. He estimates casually that he had lost a million dollars over time, money earned, he said vaguely, from wholesale trading. ''I have made enough to lose a million dollars,'' he said, fingering the chips in his hand.
 The gambling boom, perhaps inevitably, has generated a populist backlash that seems to have spurred Mr. Putin to act. While Russia hardly has a prudish society -- with its abundance of strip clubs, semilegal prostitution and a robust pornography industry -- opposition to gambling has become increasingly vocal.
 ''The gambling industry is highly unethical,'' said Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, a billionaire businessman and Parliament member who has long advocated a crackdown. ''It is legalized robbery.''
 Religious organizations, as well as the Public Chamber, a Kremlin-appointed advocacy council, publicly appealed this year for greater control, especially on slot machines. Two predominantly Muslim regions -- Chechnya and Dagestan -- have shut gambling parlors, while Tatarstan moved last month to restrict them to two special zones.
 On the national level, the lower house of Parliament has dickered for years over less sweeping changes to laws regulating gambling, voting already this year on a bill that would have distanced casinos and gambling halls from places like schools.
 Parliamentary leaders dropped that bill and put Mr. Putin's far stricter version on a fast track after he denounced gambling as a scourge in a public meeting with party leaders last month. A first vote on the legislation is scheduled for Nov. 17.
 ''Unfortunately, this concerns not just young people,'' Mr. Putin said last week about the effects of gambling on young people during a choreographed question-and-answer session with the public. ''Unfortunately, pensioners also leave their last kopecks and pensions there. Specialists say that this gambling addiction is even stronger than addiction to alcohol. This is a serious problem, and it has to be dealt with like the spread of alcohol in the country.''
 Mr. Putin's proposal appears to have popular support. In a recent poll of Russians by the independent polling agency Vtsiom, 65 percent of respondents favored restricting all gambling to special zones, while only 18 percent were opposed.
 The details of the law must still be put to paper, but Mr. Putin has said it would restrict all gambling to four specially designated zones -- evidently to be decided upon by his government later. The parliamentary speaker, Boris V. Gryzlov, emerged from the meeting with Mr. Putin last month vowing to allow casinos only in unpopulated areas. Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the nationalist party leader who was beside him, interjected, ''Virgin forests!''
 By all accounts, the legislation would banish gambling from Moscow and other major cities, though according to Itar-Tass, one version could create an exception for places more populated than the unspoiled forests mentioned by Mr. Zhirinovsky. Mr. Gryzlov said only that the zones would be spread across the country: one in the Far East, one in Siberia and two in European Russia.
 In a concession to existing casinos, the law would not take effect immediately but be phased in by 2009 -- time enough, supporters like Mr. Lebedev said, for owners to recoup their investments and close or relocate to the new zones.
 Already some cities or regions have lobbied for the designation and the tourism and tax revenue it could bring. They include Kaliningrad, the enclave between Poland and Lithuania, and Kalmykia, a Buddhist region on the northeast coast of the Caspian Sea governed by President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who has already built a Chess City that recently was host to the world championship.
 A small city on Moscow's southeastern outskirts, Ramenskoye, has also been cited as a potential location. A South African casino company, Sun International, has announced plans to build a large gambling and entertainment center there but said a final decision would depend on the legislation now being drafted.
 Michael Boettcher, a Briton who arrived in 1992, has built a chain of seven casinos, including some of Moscow's most prominent, including Jazz Town and another called Shangri La. He said that he welcomed restrictions because of the proliferation of casinos that did not follow industry standards, but that Mr. Putin's proposal went too far. ''Now, instead of coming with a reasonable approach,'' Mr. Boettcher said, ''they came with a club.''
 He, like others, said that gambling was too deeply rooted in Russian culture to be banished again, as it was during Soviet rule. In ''The Gambler,'' written to pay off gambling debt, Dostoyevsky suggested gambling was a compulsion somehow suited to the Russian soul. ''In my view all Russians are like that, or inclined to be,'' one character says, scolding the protagonist. ''If it's not roulette, it's something else like it.''
 Mikhail Chilkhodyants, who works in pharmaceuticals, prefers the slot machines. He meets friends at Jazz Town on occasion for an evening of entertainment. ''It's already become part of our lives,'' he said. ''Moscow without gambling will lose something.''

HEADLINE: Concentration of Competitive Races Puts Ohio at Center of Midterm Battle

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Mary Jo Kilroy is an awkward, stumbling speaker. John Cranley is a baby-faced 32-year-old whose campaign biography still highlights his election as student body president in college. Dr. Victoria Wulsin has never held elected office. 
 But, reflecting the political drift of this bellwether state a week before the midterm elections, all three of these Democrats are in competitive races to unseat once-safe Republican members of Congress. With polls showing Democrats running well ahead in Ohio races for senator and governor, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has recently begun spending money to help Dr. Wulsin unseat her opponent, Representative Jean Schmidt, adding Ms. Schmidt to its list of three other Republican targets in the state.
Republicans, meanwhile, are scaling back their support for State Senator Joy Padgett in her fight against Zack Space, a Democrat who is the city attorney in Dover, for the Congressional seat being vacated by Representative Bob Ney, a Republican who pleaded guilty to corruption charges.
 That puts four Republican seats in play. Strategists for both sides say Mr. Ney's seat is the Democrats' best chance while Ms. Schmidt is the least vulnerable of the four Republicans. 
 Ohio has been a central battleground of the midterm elections because of the unusual concentration of competitive races. The Senate seat, now held by Senator Mike DeWine, is one of a half-dozen or so that will determine control of the chamber. The 4 House seats are among about 40 that will decide control of that body. And winning the governorship of Ohio can give a party a big assist in carrying the state in a presidential election.
 Discontent with the war in Iraq, the limping regional economy and a corruption scandal in the Republican-controlled statehouse tilted the table in favor of the Democrats from the start of the campaign. But in the final days before the election, Republicans are fighting hard to hold on.
 ''It's not over yet -- it's too early to wrap things up!'' Representative Deborah Pryce said in a telephone interview Monday on her way back from an event in Maryville.
 Ms. Pryce, the fourth-ranking member of the House Republican leadership and a moderate on many social issues, is facing her first competitive contest in a decade against Ms. Kilroy, a local county commissioner. Ms. Pryce is closing the race by reminding voters, in television commercials and campaign appearances, of the federally financed projects she has helped bring to the area. 
 ''We have to do something pro-active and not just bad-mouth and be negative,'' Ms. Pryce said in an interview Tuesday on a Columbus public radio station, WOSU. ''My solid record of bringing jobs to this community is exactly what we need to do.''
 Still, Ms. Pryce's anxiety is showing. In a reversal of the customary ritual between incumbent and challenger, Ms. Pryce recently stood with a bullhorn outside Ms. Kilroy's office demanding that Ms. Kilroy participate in another debate. Ms. Kilroy has refused. 
 ''She has come up with any excuse not to,'' Ms. Pryce said in the interview.
 ''Every time she says the president's name she says mine too,'' she added with frustration, saying she believed voters would see through the efforts to tie her to President Bush.
 Ms. Kilroy, in turn, is criticizing Ms. Pryce for describing the current national economy as ''storybook,'' arguing that she is out of touch with Ohio voters affected by the region's doldrums. 
 ''Two hundred and twenty thousand jobs were lost in a six-year period here in Ohio,'' Ms. Kilroy said Tuesday, also in an interview with WOSU. Like Republican candidates a decade ago, she called for reducing the federal deficit by requiring offsets for any new spending or tax cuts.
 In Cincinnati, Representative Steve Chabot is a staunch conservative first elected in the Republican landslide of 1994. Mr. Chabot's campaign is running commercials stating: ''Some people want you to think that I've changed. I've lived in the same house for 21 years, with my wife of 33 years. I still cut our grass, and drive the same old '93 Buick. More important, I've never wavered in our fight to cut spending, stand up to the special interests and protect Social Security.''
 The advertisement is a response to a refrain of his opponent, Mr. Cranley, that ''Washington changed Steve Chabot.'' Mr. Cranley, a city councilman, is running as a fiscal conservative, pledging not to accept a raise until the federal budget is balanced. Accusing Mr. Chabot of having abandoned his commitments to a balanced budget, Mr. Cranley recently won the endorsement of The Cincinnati Enquirer, which picked Republicans for most other races.
 Mr. Cranley is also attacking Mr. Chabot over his support for the Iraq war, reminding voters that Mr. Chabot recommended making Saddam Hussein ''a principal target'' shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and that he once praised Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's job performance as ''exemplary.'' (Mr. Chabot says he, too, has some criticisms of the conduct of the war.)
 In the governor's race, polls show that Representative Ted Strickland, the Democratic candidate, has a commanding lead over J. Kenneth Blackwell, the Republican who is Ohio's secretary of state. Representative Sherrod Brown, the Democrat who is running for Senate, is also ahead of the Republican incumbent, Mr. DeWine, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee has stopped spending to support Mr. DeWine.
 The Democrats received an additional boost this week when the actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, campaigned with Mr. Brown to highlight Mr. DeWine's opposition to embryonic stem cell research. Mr. Fox became famous playing the conservative son of liberal parents in a television show set in Columbus, and his appearance dominated television news coverage around the state that day. 

In Their Own Words
Remarks Tuesday in interviews with radio station WOSU in Columbus, Ohio, by Mary Jo Kilroy, the Democratic candidate for Congress in Ohio's 15th District, and Representative Deborah Pryce, the Republican incumbent:

MS. KILROY
 " I don't support the kind of tax cuts that at a time of war, at a time of sacrifice, give huge tax breaks to those who need it the least. The Paris Hilton estate tax cut, for example. We don't need to make that estate tax permanent so that the Paris Hiltons of the world can make even more money. And it is a shame and it is wrong that Deborah Pryce and this Congress are holding the minimum wage hostage to an estate tax
 That is wrong. That is another kind of example of the wrong priorities we have in Congress. It is wrong to deny minimum wage workers who have worked for $5.15 an hour, seeing the buying power of that $5.15 go down over the last 10 years, to deny them a $2.10 raise, and while Congress gave itself $30,000 in raises. ''

MS. PRYCE
 " I think the first thing we need to do is make sure that the tax cuts in place remain in place. My opponents and her party already promised to undo the Bush tax cuts The average family of four will have their taxes raised by $2.000. My opponent may not think that is a lot of money, but it is a lot of money to the average family
 We have almost record employment. When I was in school -- and I didn't take a lot of economics -- but our level of unemployment was about textbook perfect. There is enough work out there. There are help-wanted signs. Now, granted, Ohio is still on the rebound. I am talking about nationally. Ohio, we still needto do a lot of work here
 We have to do something pro-active and not just bad mouth and be negative. My solid record of bringing jobs to this community is what exactly we need to do.''

HEADLINE: Bush Works to Solidify Base With a Defense of Rumsfeld

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
With less than a week before the election, President Bush sought to rally Republican voters on Wednesday with a vigorous defense of the war in Iraq and a vow to keep Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in office until the end of Mr. Bush's term.
 Mr. Bush appeared on Rush Limbaugh's radio program, whose audience is a reservoir of conservative voters, to criticize Democrats as lacking a plan for victory in Iraq. 
 Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney also spent another day going after Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee two years ago, for remarks that Republicans say insulted the intelligence of American troops in Iraq.
 ''Anybody who is in a position to serve this country ought to understand the consequences of words,'' Mr. Bush said, ''and our troops deserve the full support of people in government.''
 Mr. Kerry said in a statement issued on Wednesday by his office that his ''poorly stated joke at a rally was not about and never intended to refer to any troop.'' 
 As Mr. Bush worked to solidify his base, Democratic and Republican Party committees were making some of their final moves on the electoral chessboard. The Republican Senate committee reported spending nearly $1 million on television advertisements in Maryland and more than $800,000 in Michigan. The Senate seats in those states are held by Democrats and have generally been considered safe, but the investments by Republicans suggested a hope of making them competitive.
 Democrats sought to expand the contest for the Senate as well by buying air time in Arizona to rattle, if not defeat, Senator Jon Kyl, a Republican thought to be headed for relatively easy re-election. Democratic officials would not disclose how much they were spending.
 Mr. Bush, in an interview with wire service reporters on Wednesday, said he intended to keep Mr. Rumsfeld at the Pentagon and Mr. Cheney in the vice presidency until he leaves office in 2009. Both are controversial figures, even among some Republicans, but they are also popular with conservatives who form the foundation of Mr. Bush's political and electoral strategy.
 With polls showing a majority of Americans unhappy with the course of the war and many Republican candidates distancing themselves from Mr. Bush on it, the White House was taking a gamble on making Iraq the central subject of discussion in the final week of the campaign. His embrace of Mr. Rumsfeld carried particular risk, since some Republican candidates have joined nearly all Democrats in seeking his dismissal.
 Democrats responded to the Republicans' efforts with new advertisements accusing Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld of botching the war and making the United States less safe. A television spot from the Democratic Congressional committee said, ''The White House is in denial as top generals warn that Iraq may be sliding into full-scale civil war.''
 A veterans group released an advertisement on Wednesday in which Iraq war veterans and Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who is retired and who was a Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, criticize the war. ''Because of Iraq, there are more terrorists in the world,'' one veteran says. 
 Democrats also criticized Representative John A. Boehner, the No. 2 Republican in the House, as seeming to shift responsibility for problems in Iraq from Secretary Rumsfeld to the uniformed military.
 ''Let's not blame what's happening in Iraq on Rumsfeld,'' Mr. Boehner said in an interview on CNN on Wednesday afternoon. ''But the fact is, the generals on the ground are in charge, and he works closely with them and the president.''
 Seeking to a draw a parallel to the flap over Mr. Kerry's comments, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, demanded that Mr. Boehner apologize to the generals.
 ''John Boehner ought to be ashamed,'' Mr. Reid said in a statement. ''He's blaming our troops for failures in Iraq.'' 
 Republican leaders hoped to buck up morale among conservative Christians, a normally reliable source of Republican votes. A sizeable number of such so-called values voters have told pollsters that they are unhappy with Mr. Bush and the Republican-led Congress and might stay home on Election Day or vote for Democrats.
 James C. Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family and an influential voice among evangelical Christian voters, said on his radio program this week that Democrats and the news media were trying to suppress the conservative vote by reporting on unhappiness among evangelicals.
 Mr. Dobson also warned that a Democratic takeover of Congress would bring ''crippling setbacks in the battles against abortion and gay marriage.'' 
 In recent days, Mr. Bush and his surrogates have sought to rally Republicans by raising the specter of what they call unreconstructed liberal Democrats leading powerful committees if the Democrats regain control of Congress. Mr. Cheney took aim at one of them, Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who is in line to become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax laws.
 Mr. Cheney said late last week that Mr. Rangel knew nothing about the American economy and would raise taxes as soon as he took over the committee.
 Mr. Rangel responded by using a profanity to question Mr. Cheney's parentage. He said in an interview Wednesday that he was sorry for his choice of words, but not for the thought. He said he hoped that if the Democrats won control of Congress the nasty language on both sides would cease.
 ''I can take a political shot,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''But my family and friends and constituents deserve better from the vice president of the United States.''

HEADLINE: In the Race For Governor, A Big Divide On School Aid

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
As attorney general, Eliot Spitzer has performed a legal high-wire act on education aid.
 He dutifully fought a lawsuit seeking billions of dollars more for the New York City schools, while insisting that he personally disagreed with the position he had to take as the state's top lawyer. Now, Mr. Spitzer promises that if he is elected governor, he will resolve the case by providing a total of up to $8.5 billion more a year for the city and for other needy school districts statewide.
Mr. Spitzer's willingness to allocate vastly more education aid to the city sets him apart not only from his Republican opponent, John Faso, but also from Gov. George E. Pataki and former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who, despite their party and policy differences, both fought the suit, now 13 years old. 
 ''This is something that has to be solved not just because it's a litigation but because it's the right thing to do,'' Mr. Spitzer said recently. Mr. Faso counters that the state already pays enough for schools -- $32 billion a year -- and does not get sufficient value. 
 Perhaps no issue in the governor's race holds greater import for the near-term future of New York than education. Lower courts have ordered at least $4.7 billion a year more for New York City's schools, and a final ruling from the state's highest court is expected in December. 
 That will set the stage for a showdown on school aid, an issue that turns every lawmaker into a pit bull intent on taking home the biggest bone and raises hard questions about what the state can afford. 
 Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, says the state could afford to keep his promise by closing hospitals and slashing Medicaid costs. Mr. Faso insists that the increased education costs would be so great that Mr. Spitzer would have to raise taxes. 
 Mr. Faso, a former Assembly minority leader steeped in the intricacies of education aid, agrees with Mr. Spitzer that the financing system needs an overhaul so that districts with the greatest needs get priority. But he insisted, in an interview, that increases in spending would be a mistake. 
 ''We have to examine how we are spending the $32 billion, K through 12, that we are now expending,'' he said. ''I don't subscribe to the notion that simply putting more into the existing system is wise or necessary.'' He added, ''As I travel around the state -- you know there are over 700 school districts; 650 of them think they are not getting enough from the state.'' 
 The budget question is only the start of the policy challenges facing the state on education: New York's high school graduation rate ranks about 40th in the nation and near last for minority students. Just under half of New York's eighth graders read proficiently and in poor, urban areas the number is even lower. Many policy makers say the state's economic prospects hinge on improving schools. 
 ''For New York State to succeed and become vibrant again, education and economic development have to become top priorities,'' said Abraham M. Lackman, who has been both a top budget aide to the Republican-controlled State Senate and a New York City budget director. 
 ''The next governor has got to spend money on education, and he has got to make sure it gets results,'' added Mr. Lackman, president of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, a private policy group based in Albany.
 Neither candidate came up through the public school system. Mr. Spitzer attended Horace Mann, the prep school in Riverdale, and Princeton University.
 Mr. Faso, whose father worked as a janitor in the Catholic grammar school that he attended on Long Island, went on to Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens and the State University of New York at Brockport. 
 Still, despite their disparate backgrounds, the candidates have some surprising agreements, with Mr. Spitzer more enthusiastic than many other Democrats on providing alternatives to traditional public schools. 
 Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Faso alike say they would fight to lift a state cap that has limited the number of charter schools to 100 statewide. An effort to do that was blocked last session by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. 
 At the same time, the two candidates say they would provide some relief to school districts like Albany and Buffalo, where officials say the publicly financed but privately managed charters are a fiscal drain on the regular schools. And both candidates favor expanded tax credits to help parents afford private schools or tutoring.
 When it comes to New York City, both candidates support reauthorizing mayoral control of the school system, which will expire in 2009. And both favor merit bonuses and salary differentials for teachers in hard-to-staff schools and in areas with a shortage of teachers, like math, science and special education. 
 Yet Mr. Faso says that the SUNY system from which he graduated is doing well, while Mr. Spitzer says that SUNY lacks the prestige of systems like those in California and Michigan. ''Our public higher educational system should be on par with the finest in the nation,'' he said in an interview, a competitive glint in his eye. ''I don't think it is right now.'' 
 Still, higher education issues are almost certain to be overshadowed by the battle over school financing. 
 Mr. Faso says officials should await the final ruling from the Court of Appeals. He noted that it could substantially reduce the amount ordered to New York City by the lower courts because of increases in state aid in recent years, including $11.2 billion in financing for school construction authorized this year. 
 Taking direct aim at the state's powerful teachers unions, Mr. Faso also has very specific goals to reduce costs to local school districts. He would seek to eliminate laws that he says make it difficult to renegotiate labor contracts and virtually impossible to fire tenured educators. He would also like to allow school districts to offer 401(k) retirement plans instead of pension packages. 
 Mr. Spitzer, on the other hand, has the unions' support and recently toured a charter school in Brooklyn run by the city union, the United Federation of Teachers. The union president, Randi Weingarten, boasted of creating a model school with no more than 25 students per class and two teachers in each room. 
 She said she believed her members would be better off with Mr. Spitzer: ''We put our money where our mouth is, and I believe the man standing to my right is going to do exactly the same thing when he is elected governor.'' 
 Mr. Spitzer, who has consistently led by wide margins in the polls, has not been as specific about many of his education proposals. His opponent in the Democratic primary chided him for not releasing a detailed education plan -- and he has yet to do so. But he says that additional spending is needed for things like smaller classes, longer school days and years, wider availability of pre-kindergarten and improved teacher training. 
 In one case, discussing details got him into trouble. He recently infuriated Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg by telling the Daily News editorial board that New York City should pay a share of any court-ordered increase in aid for the city's schools. 
 The mayor fired back, saying the city would not pay a dime. And Mr. Faso also pounced, asserting that Mr. Spitzer had suggested that the reauthorization of mayoral control could be part of the negotiations over financing. He accused Mr. Spitzer of planning ''to resort to the normal barter and trade mechanisms of Albany'' by holding mayoral control ''hostage.'' 
 Mr. Spitzer quickly tamped down the spat, saying that he had not pegged a specific amount for the city's share and that the issue was subject to negotiation. 
 Policy advisers to Mr. Spitzer say he now hopes to give a major education address in mid-November -- as the governor-elect.

HEADLINE: Worries About Earnings Depress Shares

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday for the first time this week after a slowdown in manufacturing added to concern that earnings forecasts were too high.
 United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, led a decline in the Dow Jones industrial average. The Nasdaq composite index had its biggest loss in eight weeks after sales at Garmin, the maker of portable navigation devices, trailed analysts' estimates and its shares tumbled.
The drop in the factory index of the Institute for Supply Management ''raises a real question about how serious the slowdown is going to be,'' said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company in New York, which manages about $10 billion. ''It brings into question earnings,'' and that can be ''lethal'' for stocks, he said. 
 The Dow industrials fell 49.71 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,031.02. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 10.13 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,367.81. The Nasdaq declined 32.36 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,334.35.
 Drug retailers slumped on speculation that they would have to make acquisitions after the CVS chain agreed to buy Caremark Rx for about $21 billion. Drug-benefit managers dropped, led by Express Scripts, after the offer for Caremark fell short of the stock's market price.
 Stocks retreated after the drop in the factory index for October wiped out initial gains, tied to higher-than-expected earnings from companies like MasterCard and Cigna.
 The factory gauge fell to 51.2 from 52.9 last month. Economists had expected 53, a Bloomberg survey showed. Readings above 50 signal expansion. A report on Tuesday showed that consumer confidence dropped unexpectedly, and the government said a day earlier that household spending rose less than forecast.
 United Technologies declined $1.47, or 2.2 percent, to $64.25, the biggest drop in the Dow average. Alcoa, the aluminum maker, lost 43 cents, to $28.33, adjusted for a dividend payout.
 Among drugstore chains, CVS dropped $2.32, or 7.4 percent, to $29.06 for the second-biggest slide in the S.& P. 500. Its takeover of Caremark ignited speculation that rival drugstore chains would be forced to pursue deals of their own to compete.
 Walgreen, CVS's larger competitor, slid $1.57, to $42.11, while Rite Aid slid 16 cents, to $4.52.
 Caremark slumped $1.06, or 2.2 percent, to $48.17, after accepting CVS's offer of $48.76 a share, which was 1 percent less than its own closing price Tuesday. Medco Health Solutions, its biggest competitor, fell $2.83, to $50.67. Express Scripts slid $3.73, to $59.99.
 Garmin sank $8.43, or 16 percent, to $44.98, the biggest decline in more than two years. Garmin's sales increased 62 percent last quarter to $408 million. Analysts on average had estimated $423.4 million, according to Thomson Financial. Sales in the auto unit missed projections.
 Shares of MasterCard and Cigna advanced after their quarterly earnings exceeded analysts' estimates. 
 MasterCard jumped $10.97, or 15 percent, to $85.07, the biggest gain since it went public in May. It said third-quarter profit surged 82 percent because its cardholders spent more and new pricing for overseas purchases bolstered revenue.
 Cigna rose $1.99, to $118.97, after reporting that net income rose 15 percent as membership grew. The company also said full-year income from operations would be $8.85 to $9.15 a share, up from its August forecast of $8.30 to $8.80.
 Bonds were up, with the price of the benchmark 10-year note rising 9/32, to 102 14/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 4.56 percent, down from 4.60 percent.

HEADLINE: October Sales Were Weak At Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Where are Americans spending all the money they're saving on gas? Not at Wal-Mart, it seems.
 Wal-Mart Stores was one of several large retailers, along with Target and Costco, to post disappointing October sales totals yesterday. The results suggest that lower- and middle-class Americans are holding on tightly to their wallets even as energy prices fall and wages rise.
 With the holiday shopping season approaching, the consumer's reluctance to spend raises questions about how robust holiday sales will be.
 As Wal-Mart reported a meager 0.5 percent rise last month in same-store sales -- those at stores open at least a year -- the company, the world's largest retailer, also warned that November was probably going to be even worse. In a statement, it said sales this month were ''estimated to be approximately flat.'' That would be the company's worst performance in more than 10 years. 
 In response, Wal-Mart is expected to make sharp price cuts weeks before the traditional start of the holiday shopping season, the Friday after Thanksgiving. The company, which has already cut the prices of 100 popular toys, is expected to focus its next round of price cuts on electronics.
 The unimpressive retail results helped deflate stock prices on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average, in which Wal-Mart is a large component, closed lower for the fifth straight day. Wal-Mart shares fell 56 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $48.29. The drop accounted for about a third of the Dow's 12-point loss yesterday.
 Stocks also fell yesterday as the Labor Department reported that worker productivity did not improve in the third quarter as wages rose and a measure of inflation ticked higher.
 Target and Costco also reported October sales yesterday that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. While both reported gains from a year earlier -- 3.9 percent and 4 percent, respectively -- they were outperformed by many major department stores, which have recently been among the strongest performers in the retail industry. 
 Federated Department Stores, owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, said its same-store sales jumped 7.7 percent. J. C. Penney reported an 8.1 percent sales gain. Nordstrom, the high-end department store based in Seattle, said sales grew 10.7 percent. 
 The slowdown in business at big-box retailers like Wal-Mart is one sign that some consumers are cutting back as the weakening housing market is dragging down overall economic growth.
 But even as the economy continues to downshift, wages are increasing and Americans are finding themselves with more disposable income, in part because of falling gas prices. Instead of spending that money, low-and middle-income consumers appear to be sticking to their budgets.
 ''Energy prices have come down, so wouldn't that give a lift to the lower-income consumer who has been most hurt by the rise?'' said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers. ''It's a little bit of a question mark.'' 
 Mr. Niemira said one possible explanation was that lower-income Americans were spending that extra cash at department stores. ''Is that consumer shopping elsewhere? Are they now moving to Penny's and Kohl's, which are having booming sales?'' 
 There is some evidence to suggest that Americans are putting more money aside. This week, the Commerce Department reported that the national personal savings rate in September came the closest it has in a year and a half to being positive. It was negative $15 billion, its healthiest level since May 2005.
 Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at the investment firm ITG, said that the reaction of consumers to falling gas prices had been a mirror image of what they did when prices soared: by and large, they did not alter their spending habits. ''They ignored it on the way up, and they're ignoring it on the way down.''
 Recent surveys have given a split picture on consumer confidence. Last week, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment hit the highest level since July 2005. But numbers released by the Conference Board this week showed that consumer confidence waned in October.
 ''Consumers aren't expecting the economy to take off, nor are they expecting it to head into a recession,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the consumer research center at the Conference Board. 
 Ms. Franco said that consumer spending was not likely to show big gains in the next few months. She forecast growth through the rest of the year as ''basically more or less the same.''
 For the holiday shopping season, that could spell trouble for retailers. But the always-resilient American consumer is a hard animal to predict.
 ''Betting against Christmas is a loser,'' Mr. Barbera said. 
 Despite the restrained consumer spending and conflicting signals on consumer confidence, wages have risen. The Labor Department reported yesterday that the average hourly wages of American workers rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.7 percent in the third quarter. But productivity was surprisingly unchanged; economists had expected about a 1 percent gain.
 Economists said that two forces appeared to be at work: a slowing economy that was dragging output down and a tight labor market that was driving costs up.
 ''Slowing growth leads to falling productivity, and that is exactly what is now happening,'' Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors, said in a research note. ''Even though labor compensation increased less rapidly, it was still fast enough to continue the ominous surge in unit labor costs that began last year.''
 Though rising labor costs mean that American workers are earning more, higher wages can also lead to higher prices for goods and services. And the Federal Reserve is closely watching data on inflation as it decides whether to resume raising interest rates, keep them steady or start cutting them to stimulate the economy. 
 The Labor Department report showed that higher pay and flat productivity combined to produce a higher jump than expected in one measure of inflation, unit labor costs, which rose 3.8 percent in the third quarter, at an annual rate.
 The broader slowing of the economy also manifested itself in new statistics on manufacturing released yesterday by the Commerce Department. Factory orders rose 2.1 percent in September, less than expected, and nearly all of the increase was accounted for by a cluster of orders for large aircraft.

Broadway

'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)

'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Indifferently directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap operatic contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' ' The brilliant choreographer Twyla Tharp interprets the Bob Dylan songbook less than brilliantly. And when a genius goes down in flames, everybody feels the burn (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, , are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)

'ASCENSION' Brandon Ruckdashel makes a stunning debut in Edmund De Santis's clever comic mystery about a priest, a beautiful young man and a mother's accusation of sexual abuse (1:30). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Anita Gates)

'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)

*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'EMERGENCE-SEE!' Daniel Beaty's solo show takes stock of the urban African-American mind in the new century, as dozens of men and women flock to Liberty Island when a slave ship mysteriously appears in New York Harbor. The performance captivates; the material doesn't (1:15). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE GIVEN' Grim without being rewarding, Francine Volpe's drama involves a stripper, a gay man with H.I.V., another gay man who wants to become infected with H.I.V., and a married man who becomes a bit more than a good customer at a strip club. The playwright seems to be hoping that the mixture proves explosive, but it's merely distasteful (2:20). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)

* 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)

'MY DEAH' ''The mind of a beauty queen is a thing to fear!'' John Epperson, a k a Lypsinka, brings his love of cultural deconstruction and reconstruction to this lovably trashy spoof of a certain exalted Greek tragedy, in which a scorned woman sets about chicken-frying her own children to get even with the no-account man who done her wrong. Nancy Opel and Maxwell Caulfield lead the cast in offering big servings of honey-baked ham (1:30). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)

'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)

'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp workroom, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35) Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, third floor, (212) 760-2615. (Rob Kendt)

'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)

'THE VOYAGE OF THE CARCASS' The playwright Dan O'Brien succeeds admirably at evoking an atmosphere of tedium and claustrophobia. His play-within-a-play -- a vehicle for Dan Fogler-- is about a failed expedition of Arctic explorers frozen up together for seven years, who turn out to be a trio of sophomoric actors bickering in embarrassing dialogue about their lives, their relationships and their gas pains as they work together on a play about a failed expedition of Arctic explorers frozen up together for seven years. If this seems repetitive, it gives only a hint of the tedium in store for audiences (2:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1515. (Anne Midgette)

'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned punch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison d'etre is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

'THE FLOOD' This eager, accomplished show about a devastating deluge in a small Illinois town has a majestic score by Peter Mills and Cara Reichel and an able, ingratiating cast. Unfortunately they're playing uninvolving, cookie-cutter characters (2:00). The American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Kendt)

'THE THUGS' Rumors of death at a law firm make Adam Bock's new play a chilling little nightmare (1:15). SoHo Rep, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)

Long-Running Shows

'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line,'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'THE CARTELLS' Douglas Carter Beane is giving some of his actor friends something constructive to do on Monday nights with this ridiculous staged soap opera about a dysfunctional oil family. Each week brings a different episode, rehearsal time is minimal (cue cards are involved), and the actors -- Brian d'Arcy James, Joanna Gleason and Elizabeth Berkley among them -- are having a great time (50 minutes). Comix, 353 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 524-2500; closes on Monday. (Genzlinger)

'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. The detailed puppets are hard to read even in this small theater, and not all of the vignettes live up to the show's initial promise. Still, there's a lot to like, starting with the narrator: an alligator named Silas Leech, voiced in the plummy tones of the musician and actor Gavin Friday (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Monday. (Midgette)

'KING LEAR' The ''promised end'' comes with disarming swiftness in this Classical Theater of Harlem production, starring Andre De Shields, which clocks in at just over two hours, not including an intermission. There's nothing distilled about Mr. De Shields's vigorous performance in the title role, but his impressive energy is not always productively channeled, and the supporting cast is uneven (2:10). The Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'KRANKENHAUS BLUES' Sam Forman's bizarre tale of an actress, a playwright and a clown in a Nazi camp goes off the deep end fast, but there's a great monologue about cheese (1:15). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates)

'SHAY DUFFIN AS BRENDAN BEHAN: CONFESSIONS OF AN IRISH REBEL' Mr. Duffin's uneven, often charming one-man show offers Behan's thoughts on drinking, great men, drinking, politics and drinking (1:15). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates)

'A SMALL MELODRAMATIC STORY' Small, yes, melodramatic, not so much. Stephen Belber's minor drama about a woman in Washington and the two men and two mysteries in her life benefits from sharp but unshowy performances, but feels like cop-show leftovers nonetheless (1:40). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'TRUTH $(the heart is a million little pieces above all things$)' The virtuoso storyteller Mike Daisey's new monologue, which addresses issues about lying, memoir and the James Frey scandal, is less funny than his previous work but just as engaging and intellectually curious (1:40). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman)

'YOHEN' Philip Kan Gotenda's drama about an interracial marriage may not be completely believable but has two lovely low-key performances and genuine warmth. The West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 868-4030; closes on Sunday. (Gates)

'ABSOLUTE WILSON' (No rating, 105 minutes) This appreciative look at the life and work of the theater artist Robert Wilson includes a notably candid interview with the man himself, as well as mostly friendly testimony from friends and experts and glimpses of his strange, difficult and often thrillingly original work. (A. O. Scott)

'AS THE CALL, SO THE ECHO' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Vietnamese) Keir Moreano's muted yet moving record of his father's experience as a volunteer physician in Vietnam documents a journey that's substantially more philosophical than medical. Following Dr. Alex Moreano, an ear, nose and throat surgeon from Albuquerque, as he treats advanced disease and reflects on his profession, the movie presents a portrait not of a saint but of a complicated man who understands that one of the lives he's saving is his own. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not-quite-simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)

'THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI' (No rating, 76 minutes) David Lee Fisher has used cinematic magic to superimpose living, speaking actors onto the original sets of the silent-film classic. It's discombobulating, but interesting. (Neil Genzlinger)

'CATCH A FIRE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) The director Phillip Noyce revisits, with energy and a lot of bad editing, the ordeal of an ordinary black South African who became a foot soldier in the war against apartheid. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'CLIMATES' (No rating, 97 minutes, in Turkish) The story of a man and a woman, one of whom murders the other's love, and a haunting portrait of existential solitude. The Turkish writer and director Nuri Bilge Ceylan also stars. (Dargis)

'COCAINE COWBOYS' (R, 118 minutes) A hyperventilating account of the blood-bathed Miami drug culture in the 1970s and '80s, Billy Corben's bottom-feeding documentary chronicles the explosion of South Florida's ''cocaine economy'' and the ensuing turf wars between the Colombians and the Cubans. Overflowing with cops and coroners, snitches and smugglers, the movie struggles with an atmosphere of unrepentant greed and a director overly impressed with his subject matter. (Catsoulis)

'CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD' (PG, 109 minutes) This movie ostensibly depicts the enlightenment of Neale Donald Walsch, the author of the popular series of inspirational books. But it merely becomes a maudlin feature-length advertisement for him and for them. (Andy Webster)

'DEATH OF A PRESIDENT' (No rating, 93 minutes) This fake-umentary, the subject of much hyperventilation since it was shown at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, imagines what might happen if George W. Bush were assassinated. Condemned as irresponsible wishful thinking by some, hailed as a brave artistic statement by others, the movie, directed by Gabriel Range, is far too banal to merit such strong responses. Its formal cleverness wears thin and after a while exposes a lazy, pretentious form of provocation. (Scott)

* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)

* '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)

* 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)

'FLICKA' (PG, 110 minutes) A ridiculous redo of Mary O'Hara's 1941 children's novel that confirms that nothing should ever come between a girl and her horse, especially a saddle. (Dargis)

* 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)

'JAAN-E-MANN' (No rating, 165 minutes, in Hindi) This good-natured Bollywood musical is a romantic triangle set in New York. Personable stars partly make up for the excesses of the genre. (Anita Gates)

* 'JONESTOWN: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PEOPLES' TEMPLE' (No rating, 85 minutes) The scariest aspect of this powerful, meticulously chronicled history of Jim Jones and his flock, who committed mass suicide in Guyana on Nov. 18, 1978, is that so many of the followers of this demented demagogue appear to have been intelligent, idealistic, life-loving people. Watch this documentary and shudder. (Holden)

* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)

* 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)

* 'THE PRESTIGE' (PG-13, 128 minutes) Entertaining, spirited and shamelessly gimmicky, Christopher Nolan's new film tells the intricate tale of two rival magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman) practicing their art in late-Victorian London. Scarlett Johansson is the lovely assistant. (Scott)

* 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)

'RUNNING WITH SCISSORS' (R, 116 minutes) From Augusten Burroughs's best-selling memoir, this movie is a showcase of high-quality acting (especially from Annette Bening) without much in the way of dramatic coherence or emotional power. (Scott)

'SAW III' (R, 107 minutes) The franchise rasps on with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the masked sadist whose fondness for men in chains continues unabated, playing marriage counselor to a couple whose young son has been killed in a car accident. Having learned the (knotted) ropes on ''Saw II,'' the 27-year-old Darren Lynn Bousman returns to direct, while James Wan and Lee Whannell push their original story to ever new heights of monstrousness. In the end, the most depressing thing about this franchise is not the creativity of the bloodletting but the bleak view of human nature, specifically our talent for ruining the present to avenge the past. (Catsoulis)

* 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)

'THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' (R, 84 minutes) A prequel to a remake of a 1974 movie that spawned several sequels and numberless copycats, this hateful trash asks: how many chainsaw massacres can one state possibly contain? (Lee)

'20 CENTIMETERS' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Spanish) During narcoleptic spells, a pre-op transsexual prostitute dreams that she is the star performer of huge, spicy (and frustratingly hit or miss) song-and-dance numbers. (Laura Kern)

* 'THE WILD BLUE YONDER' (No rating, 81 minutes) An artful mixture of carefully culled and originally produced material, Werner Herzog's self-described ''science fiction fantasy'' purports to tell the story of an alien species beset by misfortune. Brad Dourif stars alongside some floating astronauts and a few exquisitely beautiful underwater drifters. (Dargis)

Film Series

Film & Television Archive are sponsoring this sequel to their Shaw Brothers series, honoring the Chinese movie studio that spread the gospel of martial arts films.

Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

TRACE ADKINS (Wednesday) A brawny performer who likes to sing about his scars and working-class bona fides, Mr. Adkins already had 10 hits in the country Top 10 before ''Honky Tonk Badonkadonk'' last year. But that ode to the voluptuous -- which brought a nugget of black slang to truckstop jukeboxes across the country -- cemented his image as a drawling ruffian who is not above a kinky gimmick. At 7:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $45. (Ben Sisario)

BLACK KEYS (Tonight) This guitar-drums duo from Akron, Ohio, aims to summon elemental forces with gruff, spare blues-rock, though a lack of imagination (''My heart's on fire/With a strange desire'') impedes its progress. With the Black Angels. At 9, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $25. (Sisario)

* THE CLIPSE (Tomorrow) Four years ago this Virginia rap duo rose all the way to No. 4 with sly rhymes about the criminal life and brilliantly minimal rhythm tracks by the Neptunes. Since then the Clipse, made up of the brothers Gene and Terrence Thornton, have struggled in music-industry purgatory but remained active in the underground, and at the end of the month will release ''Hell Hath No Fury'' (Re-Up Gang/Jive), one of the most eagerly awaited hip-hop albums of the year. A CMJ Music Marathon show, with Trae, Kidz in the Hall, Jokaman, Catchdubs and DJ Chill. At 10:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario)

DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE, TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS (Wednesday and Thursday) Not all rock revolutions are loud. Death Cab for Cutie, one of the handful of groups that defined emo at the turn of the millennium, launched a thousand bands with gentle, sinewy guitar; library-level vocals; and songs that found heartbreak everywhere, including glove compartments. For loudness, make sure to come early for Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, a veteran pop-punk band from New Jersey whose leader is one of the best songwriters in the game. At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; Wednesday sold out, $39.50 on Thursday. (Sisario)

DECEMBERISTS (Tonight) He might not exactly have a lot of competition, but Colin Meloy, the songwriter and strategist of this ascendant band from Portland, Ore., can set old Irish epics and alliterative fables about Dickensian chimney sweeps to shambling folk-rock like nobody else. The band recently released ''The Crane Wife'' -- based on a classic Japanese story -- on Capitol Records, and plays at the CMJ Music Marathon as an example of success. With Alasdair Roberts, a Scottish folk singer. At 8, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $29.50. (Sisario)

THE FALL (Tomorrow) Nearly 30 years ago, this British band laid out with jagged guitars and the tuneless slur of its leader, Mark E. Smith, a reductionist ''three R's'' of pop: ''Repetition, repetition, repetition.'' Umpteen albums later, the Fall is a cornerstone of post-punk, and Mr. Smith still finds ways to make repetition sound new. A CMJ Music Marathon show, with Yikes, Iran, and Women and Children. At 6 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 260-4700, bowerypresents.com; $22. (Sisario)

KEVIN FEDERLINE (Tomorrow) Schadenfreude has a face, and it is Mr. Federline, the husband of Britney Spears, who, despite vicious ridicule online and elsewhere, has persisted with his feeble rap career. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)

GOB IRON (Wednesday) Jay Farrar of Son Volt and Anders Parker of Varnaline have built careers on the idea of ragged, rock-tinged ''roots'' music: a little less grungy than Neil Young, a bit more plebeian than Bob Dylan. They delve deeply into country, blues and folk on ''Death Songs for the Living'' (Transmit Sound/Legacy), their new joint album as Gob Iron. With liberal interpretations of songs by the Carter Family, Josh White and Stephen Foster, Mr. Farrar and Mr. Parker repaint centuries of American music in gray, relentlessly bleak tones: even Clarence Ashley's sprightly and elliptical ''Coo-Coo Bird'' gets a despondent rewrite as ''Nicotine Blues.'' At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15. (Sisario)

AL GREEN (Tonight and tomorrow night) As unpredictable as Al Green concerts can sometimes be -- maybe he will perform only gospel, maybe he will do some of his transcendent 1970s soul ballads -- the pattern is always the same: he throws some roses to the women in the front rows, begins to sing, and the rest is rapture. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $175. (Sisario)

* GUNS N' ROSES (Sunday) Only Michael Jackson inspires more morbid curiosity than Axl Rose, who has spent 12 years and a reported $13 million recording the next Guns N' Roses album with a steadily rotating cast of replacements, only occasionally coming up for air and paparazzi. But he has been a common sight lately -- showing up in public (which is unusual) and completing tours (even more unusual) -- fueling speculation that the album, ''Chinese Democracy,'' is ready for release soon. Patient fans are not holding their breath. At 8:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $39.50 to $89.50. (Sisario)

PADDY KEENAN (Tonight) Mr. Keenan, who plays uilleann pipes, comes from a family of itinerant Irish musicians, and has been one of Ireland's most influential traditional players since he helped start the Bothy Band in the 1970s. At 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950, nyu.edu/pages/irelandhouse; $15. (Jon Pareles)

* 'THE MUSIC OF BOB DYLAN' (Thursday) Paying tribute to Bob Dylan's genius is the easiest thing in the world: rock bands, folk singers, pop stars and everybody in between have been doing it for four and a half decades by simply singing his songs. But this starry benefit for the Music for Youth Foundation, which supports music education, has some intriguing angles: Natalie Merchant and Philip Glass; Clap Your Hands Say Yeah; Ramblin' Jack Elliott with the young singer-songwriter Jennifer O'Connor; Cat Power; Bob Mould; Allen Toussaint, the musical statesman from New Orleans; Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth; and Sandra Bernhard; not to mention Patti Smith, Rosanne Cash, Joan Osborne, Ryan Adams, Jay Farrar, Al Kooper, Warren Haynes and Medeski Martin & Wood. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 836-1853, musicforyouth.org; sold out except for V.I.P. packages. (Sisario)

'REGGAE CULTURE SALUTE 2006' (Tomorrow) The big reggae concert this fall should be relatively free of the controversy that has dogged so many other recent reggae shows: homophobia. With a tribute to Joseph Hill, the stalwart leader of the socially conscious group Culture (''Share the riches with the poor/Before they share the poverty with you''), who died in August at 57, and performances by Steel Pulse and the struggle-for-survival singer Luciano, this is a celebration of reggae's old-fashioned family values. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com or tsoproductions.com; $45 to $75. (Sisario)

SECRET MACHINES (Tonight and tomorrow night) The slowly unfolding, keyboard-driven compositions of Secret Machines have a stark, minimalist side; a glimmer of country; some pulsating; and a streak of Pink Floyd grandeur that swells to fill the room. There's a haunted undercurrent amid the pomp. At 9, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; sold out tonight, $27 tomorrow. (Pareles)

SIMON SHAHEEN AND QANTARA (Tomorrow) A virtuoso on the violin and the oud, Mr. Shaheen, a Palestinian who has long lived in New York, is a master of traditional styles who also likes to experiment. His band, Qantara, bends toward jazz, Western classical and Latin music. Also on the bill is Chiara Civello, a stylish young Italian jazz-cabaret singer. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)

STUART A. STAPLES (Tomorrow) Mr. Staples, the singer of the British band Tindersticks, has apparently taken his woeful, hesitating baritone and gone solo: he has moved to France and released two albums by himself. The latest, ''Leaving Songs'' (Beggars Banquet), has a not-so-subtle theme that comes through in songs like ''Goodbye to Old Friends,'' ''That Leaving Feeling'' and ''Already Gone.'' At 8 p.m., St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org; $30. (Sisario)

ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow night) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Stephen Holden)

JAMES TAYLOR (Thursday) The Mr. Nice Guy of baby-boom pop, James Taylor is all mild-mannered vocals and gentle guitar, turning memories of fire and rain into lullabies. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Pareles)

* VOXTROT (Monday and Tuesday) Like Morrissey and Ray Davies, Voxtrot's Ramesh Srivastava uses the small scale, tight script and jangly energy of the pop song to focus emotionally compelling character studies, and surrounds the antsy guitars with tasteful chamber arrangements. The combination has catapulted this Austin, Tex., band from the handmade-CD level to indie darlings in just a year or two. With Annual and Finally Punk on Monday, and Mahogany and the Ballet on Tuesday. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)

WITCHCRAFT (Wednesday) No, that's not Black Sabbath playing some long-lost track from 1971. It's Witchcraft, a Swedish band that even in a deeply retro metal culture stands out for a remarkable simulacrum of its heroes' knuckle-dragging fuzz-blues, even down to Magnus Pelander's helium-voiced Ozzy Osbourne. If Black Sabbath made it look easy, Witchcraft makes it look even easier. With Alana Amram and the Rough Gems, and Danava. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario)

Jazz

BILL BRUFORD'S EARTHWORKS (Tonight through Sunday night) Twenty years ago the drummer Bill Bruford, best known for his work with the progressive rock band King Crimson, formed Earthworks, a group that served both sides of the jazz-rock divide.

CHICK COREA ELEKTRIC BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) An unapologetic (though intermittent) fusion institution for the last 20 years, this group features the synthesizers and other assorted keyboards of Chick Corea, along with the energetic contributions of Eric Marienthal on alto saxophone, Frank Gambale on guitar and Dave Weckl on drums. This engagement's substitute bassist, Victor Wooten, is likely to adapt easily to the group's hyperrhythmic style. (Through Nov. 12.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $50 at tables, $35 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

He comes with a flexible rhythm section -- the pianist Laurence Hobgood, the bassist Robert Amster and the drummer Willie Jones III -- along with a guest saxophonist, Bob Mintzer, and the Escher String Quartet. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Chinen)

BEN GERSTEIN COLLECTIVE (Sunday) The trombonist Ben Gerstein has led this experimental ensemble since 2000, enlisting some of the brightest young inside-outside players in the city. Here he presents the band as well as some sympathetic colleagues, like the guitarist Miles Okazaki and the tenor saxophonist Jonathan Moritz, in groupings of various sizes. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

ROY HARGROVE BIG BAND (Tonight through Monday night) The trumpeter Roy Hargrove, a paragon of small-group hard bop since the early '90s, has also intermittently led a big band over the years. Its current roster includes prime talent like the saxophonist Ron Blake, the trumpeter Maurice Brown and the pianist Stephen Scott. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $25. (Chinen)

* HIGHLIGHTS IN JAZZ (Thursday) The latest installation of this long-running jazz series features a bluesy trio led by Mose Allison, the irrepressible singer-songwriter and pianist; a swing-oriented duo consisting of the clarinetist Ken Peplowski and the guitarist Marty Grosz; and a bebop quartet led by the alto saxophonist Charles McPherson, with Ronnie Mathews on piano, Ray Drummond on bass and an unannounced drummer. At 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street, between Greenwich and West Streets, (212) 220-1460, tribecapac.org; $30; students, $27.50. (Chinen)

DAVE HOLLAND QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Characterized by rhythmic assertiveness, tight counterpoint and an unconventional blend of timbres, this widely acclaimed ensemble features the bassist Dave Holland alongside the trombonist Robin Eubanks, the saxophonist Chris Potter, the vibraphonist Steve Nelson and the drummer Nate Smith. At 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

GEORGE LEWIS, IKUE MORI, MARINA ROSENFELD AND MIYA MASAOKA (Tuesday) Electronic textures and open-form improvisation provide the common ground for this ensemble, with Mr. Lewis on trombone, Ms. Mori on laptop computer, Ms. Rosenfeld on turntables and Ms. Masaoka on koto. At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA (Tonight) Mr. Mahanthappa is an alto saxophonist with quick reflexes and a razor-sharp tone, and he has lately pursued some conceptual and compositional ambitions. Here, leading something he calls the Sporty Brown Trio, he focuses more on pure interplay; his improvisational partners are the pianist Craig Taborn and the percussionist Gerry Hemingway. At 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

RUSSELL MALONE AND ROMERO LUBAMBO (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Malone and Mr. Lubambo are two of the finest guitarists working in the jazz idiom, with Mr. Malone's emphasis on post-bop and Mr. Lubambo's on modern Brazilian dialects. Camaraderie will probably eclipse competition in their encounter, which also involves the bassist Esperanza Spalding. (Through Nov. 12.)

* ROSCOE MITCHELL/CONNIE CROTHERS (Thursday) Mr. Mitchell, the estimable avant-garde saxophonist and composer, presents two new pieces: ''White Tiger Disguise,'' performed by the vocalist Thomas Buckner and members of the S. E. M. Ensemble; and ''Far Side,'' a tribute to his former Art Ensemble of Chicago colleague Malachi Favors Maghostut, featuring the bassists Reggie Workman, Harrison Bankhead and Jaribu Shahid. Ms. Crothers will perform a separate solo piano program, freely improvised but divided into four sections. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $10. (Chinen)

At 7:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $82.50. (Chinen)

JEREMY PELT QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jeremy Pelt has an incisive trumpet style, evocative at times of Freddie Hubbard, but he is by no means a derivative talent. His working quartet, with the pianist Frank LoCrasto and the bassist Vicente Archer, welcomes the firepower of a guest drummer, Lenny White. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $25. (Chinen)

* DJANGO REINHARDT NY FESTIVAL (Tuesday through Thursday) What began as a salute to this immortal Gypsy guitarist has evolved into a smorgasbord of buoyant swing. This season's stars include the guitarists Dorado Schmitt, Samson Schmitt and Tchavolo Schmitt -- Gypsy swing tends to be a family affair -- along with the accordionist Ludovic Beier and others. Special guests will include the trumpeter Dominick Farinacci (Tuesday) and the saxophonists James Carter (Wednesday) and Joel Frahm (Thursday). (Through Nov. 12.) At 8 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

* ROSWELL RUDD AND THE MONGOLIAN BURYAT BAND (Tomorrow) The irrepressible trombonist Roswell Rudd recently made a fascinating album, ''Blue Mongol'' (Sunnyside), which chronicled his collaboration with traditional Mongolian throat singers. He reprises that experiment here, with an ensemble that includes the vocalists Badma Khanda and Battuvshin Baldantseren. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Chinen)

JOHN STETCH (Tonight) Mr. Stetch has often worked in a solo piano setting; he has no fewer than three albums in that vein. Selections from each will be featured in this recital at Fazioli Salon, a solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $20. (Chinen)

Strickland, his brother, on drums. At 7, Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, Ext. 344, rmanyc.org; $20. (Chinen)

VISION CLUB SERIES (Tomorrow) This off-season outreach of the Vision Festival presents two very different ensembles: a trio consisting of the guitarist Joe Morris, the alto saxophonist Rob Brown and the drummer Whit Dickey, followed by a group called Local Lingo, featuring Jason Kao Hwang on violin and Sang Won Park on vocals and East Asian stringed instruments. At 7:30 and 9 p.m., Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; cover, $10 a set (students, $7). (Chinen)

KENNY WERNER (Tonight through Sunday night) Mr. Werner is a well-seasoned pianist who tempers his technique with a kind of questing spiritualism. He corrals a group comprising the tenor saxophonist George Garzone, the trumpeter Matt Shulman, the bassist Scott Colley and the drummer Antonio Sanchez. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

 Opera

'CARMEN' (Tonight) In her first season at City Opera, Vanessa Cariddi plays the Gypsy; Kerri Marcinko and Daesan No, two other newcomers, are Micaela and Escamillo. Scott Piper, who has a promising voice, is Don Jose, and Gary Thor Wedow conducts. At 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Anne Midgette)

'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' (Tonight) The Metropolitan Opera's famous double bill featuring lust, murder and beautiful music continues, still starring Maria Guleghina, Franco Farina, Patricia Racette and Salvatore Licitra. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $205. (Bernard Holland)

'COSI FAN TUTTE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) This intelligent, well-sung New York City Opera production of what may be the most perfect opera ever written has another performance. Key singers in the ensemble cast are Julianna Di Giacomo and James Maddalena. Julius Rudel conducts. At 8 p.m. tomorrow and 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 t0 $125. (Holland)

'The Elixir of Love' (Wednesday) The director Jonathan Miller has created an all-American version of Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that's dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elisir'' is a delightful opera, and that prevails whatever you think of the director's conceit (using the word advisedly). A new cast takes over this week, with the American tenor Leonardo Capalbo making his company debut as Nemorino, and Georgia Jarman, a fine soprano, as his Adina. Gerald Steichen will conduct. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)

'HANSEL AND GRETEL' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In James Robinson's 1998 production for the New York City Opera, Engelbert Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel'' is updated to the 1890s, the time of its composition, and transplanted to New York. The woodsy cottage where the children live is a Lower East Side tenement. They run off into a snowy Central Park. And the witch's abode? A fancy Fifth Avenue mansion, of course. Jennifer Rivera and Jennifer Tiller share the role of Hansel; Jennifer Aylmer and Julianne Borg share the role of Gretel. Steven Mosteller conducts. The opera is performed in English. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 and 5:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125 tomorrow and Sunday at 1:30; $37 to $125 on Sunday at 5:30. (Anthony Tommasini)

* 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) In the Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella's visually beautiful production, the abstract staging deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and, most daringly, a life-size puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domas as Butterfly and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)

'RIGOLETTO' (Monday and Thursday) Three artists made their Metropolitan Opera debuts when the company recently revived Otto Schenk's grimly realistic 1989 production of ''Rigoletto.'' On opening night on Oct. 25, each artist showed promise but performed unevenly. The tenor Joseph Calleja was an expressive and youthful though vocally tentative Duke of Mantua. The coloratura soprano Ekaterina Siurina as Gilda was almost his opposite: technically exquisite, with a sweet and sizable voice, but emotionally cautious. Friedrich Haider conducted an animated performance that sometimes turned driven. The veteran baritone Juan Pons was the powerful, if blustery, Rigoletto. (Olga Makarina fills in for Ms. Siurina on Thursday.) Monday at 8 and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini)

'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The news was supposed to be that Andrea Gruber was singing her first Tosca, decked out in the stage jewelry Swarovski created for Callas's first Met Tosca in 1956. The real news on opening night on Saturday turned out to be the debut of the conductor Nicola Luisotti, who actually conducted this piece as if it mattered. Jose Cura was a bad-boy Cavaradossi who hid his own light under an air of nonchalance, and whose climaxes seemed to be torn out of him against his will (it worked for everything but ''E lucevan''); James Morris was animated into a semblance of flexibility by all the excitement. Ms. Gruber had to cancel on opening night because of illness, but plans to sing the rest of her scheduled performances. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 tickets remaining tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Tuesday. (Midgette)

Classical Music

BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This converted coffee barge is one of the most intimate chamber music halls in the city, and its programs are growing more varied. Tonight the cellist Leslie Parnas and the pianist Doris Stevenson collaborate on sonatas by Britten, Chopin and Shostakovich. Ms. Stevenson is joined by Mark Peskanov, the violinist, and Jeffrey Solow, the cellist, for the Mendelssohn C minor Trio (Op. 66) tomorrow and Sunday, in a program that also includes the Brahms Violin Sonata No. 1 and Barber's rich but too infrequently heard Cello Sonata. And on Thursday Ariadne Daskalakis, a violinist, and Roglit Ishay, a pianist, take over for an adventurous program of works by Lutoslawski, Raff, Faure and Mozart. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30; Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65+ tonight and Thursday only. (Allan Kozinn)

* BAVARIAN RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight through Sunday night) Classical music is a field given to hyperbole, so the statement that this is one of Germany's best orchestras, led by one of the world's best conductors, might sound like empty hype. But it's true. As if to underline it, Mariss Jansons, music director of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, is showcasing three of the classical world's most notable stars: Karita Mattila sings ''Four Last Songs'' tonight; the eccentric Gidon Kremer plays Bartok's First Violin Concerto tomorrow; and the gifted but controversial pianist Lang Lang makes a bid at seriousness by appearing with the orchestra on Sunday in Beethoven's First Piano Concerto. The orchestra will also play symphonies by Shostakovich (the Sixth), Sibelius (the Second), and Beethoven (the Seventh). At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $98. (Midgette)

YEFIM BRONFMAN, GIL SHAHAM AND LYNN HARRELL (Sunday) Chamber collaborations by star soloists often have an ad hoc quality, a sense that coming together to make music is rewarding for the musicians but not always so enlightening for listeners. Whether that will be the case here remains to be seen, but Mr. Bronfman's piano playing, Mr. Shaham's approach to the violin and Mr. Harrell's work on the cello have several qualities in common, most crucially warmth of tone and attention to detail. They are performing Mozart's Piano Trio in C (K. 548), Shostakovich's Piano Trio No. 2 in E minor (Op. 67) and Schubert's Piano Trio in E flat (D. 929). At 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $82. (Kozinn)

'ELLIOTT CARTER: TIME PRESENT' (Tomorrow) They call it a docu-concert: an evening devoted to Mr. Carter, the 97-year-old composer, that mingles live performance and excerpts from films created by Frank Scheffer. The full-length documentary ''A Labyrinth of Time'' will be shown in the afternoon. In the evening, performances of Mr. Carter's music by Fred Sherry, Tara Helen O'Connor, Charles Neidich and others alternate with film excerpts, including the world premiere of a short film Mr. Scheffer made about Mr. Carter's cello concerto. Film screening at 4:30 p.m., performances at 8 p.m., Roy and Nina Titus Theaters, Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10; $8 for 65+; $6 for students. (Midgette)

* 'THE CAVE' (Tonight and tomorrow night) This collaboration between the composer Steve Reich and the video artist Beryl Korot explores Jewish, Muslim and Christian perspectives on the Cave of Machpelah, in Hebron, where Abraham and Sarah are buried. Tensions have run high at the site for centuries, but when Mr. Reich and Ms. Korot, who are married, wrote the work in 1993, they envisioned its more peaceful potential: Abraham's sons, Isaac and Ishmael (the fathers of the Jews and Arabs, respectively), had, after all, come together to bury their father at the site. Ms. Korot's video interviews with Israelis, Palestinians and Americans offer fascinating glimpses of divergent beliefs, and here as in other Reich scores, the vocal inflections of the speakers yield ample melodic and rhythmic material. Mr. Reich and his ensemble perform the work, with Brad Lubman conducting. At 8, John Jay College Theater, 899 10th Avenue, at 59th Street, Clinton, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $45. (Kozinn)

EMMANUEL CEYSSON (Monday) Mr. Ceysson, a 22-year-old harpist, makes his New York debut playing Bach's French Suite No. 3 in B minor, Faure's ''Chatelaine en sa tour,'' Marius Constant's ''Harpalyce,'' Marcel Grandjany's Rhapsody for Harp and String Quartet, Henriette Renie's ''Ballade Fantastique,'' the premiere of Benjamin C. S. Boyle's ''Suite Sylvanesque'' and Ravel's Introduction and Allegro for harp, string quartet, flute and clarinet. Guest artists are Marya Martin, a flutist; Jose Franch-Ballester, a clarinetist; and the Jupiter String Quartet. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 and $35. (Vivien Schweitzer)

CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) A program of serious Central European music led by the equally serious American composer Leon Kirchner.

At 5 p.m. on Sunday and 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Holland)

EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow and Sunday) This period-instrument ensemble, led by Frederick Renz, offers a program called ''The King's Musick: Henry VIII and the Tudor Court, Circa 1500.'' The performance consists of pieces from ''Henry VIII's Song Book,'' which includes the king's own compositions, part songs, instrumental consorts and other tidbits from composers of his court and the Chapel Royal. The group will play selections for singers and instruments including sackbuts, lutes and recorders. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m.; Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330, earlymusicny.org; $40. (Schweitzer)

FRETWORK (Tomorrow) This viol consort is making its Miller Theater debut with ''Jewish Musicians at the Tudor Court,'' featuring music by Bassano, Lupo, van Wilder, Duarte and Gough. The program is inspired by the recent research of Roger Prior, a musicologist who says the majority of the instrumentalists in the Tudor royal household were Spanish and Portuguese Jews who had settled in Italy after 1492 and were then recruited by Henry VIII. At 8, Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $21 for students. (Schweitzer)

GLENN GOULD FILMS (Tomorrow) ''Glenn Gould Unveiled,'' Lincoln Center's retrospective about the enigmatic Canadian pianist, continues with two black-and-white films made in 1959. ''Off the Record'' and ''On the Record'' depict Mr. Gould's private and public lives, respectively; ''On the Record'' includes clips of him at a recording session in Manhattan, playing the Italian Concerto. Later tomorrow, an interview with Humphrey Burton will be shown, which includes Mr. Gould performing excerpts from Strauss's ''Metamorphosen,'' ''Three Ophelia Songs'' and Burleske in D minor for piano and orchestra. At 2 and 4 p.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $15. (Schweitzer)

HELENE GRIMAUD (Wednesday) This French pianist, also an author and the founder of the Wolf Conservation Center, begins her recital with Busoni's transcription of the Bach Chaconne. It will also include Chopin's Berceuse in D flat and Barcarolle in F sharp, and Brahms's Two Rhapsodies (Op. 79). At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $76. (Kozinn)

JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Wednesday) Those old enough to remember this quartet as a pack of cutting-edge youngsters will be shocked that it is celebrating 60 years of existence, and is still playing the music that made it famous, namely Bartok's six String Quartets. (Through Nov. 10.) At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)

* LYRIC CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF NEW YORK (Wednesday) For the second program of its ninth season, this music society presents the dynamic, technically nimble American violinist Timothy Fain, a 1999 winner of the Young Concert Artists Auditions and a performer with a burgeoning career. He plays in recital with the pianist Richard Bishop. The program includes a premiere by Randall Woolf and a recent work by Kevin Puts, as well as music by Mendelssohn, Mozart, Chausson and Saint-Saens. At 7:30 p.m., Kosciuszko Foundation, 15 East 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, lyricny.org; $45. (Tommasini)

ZUKERMAN CHAMBERPLAYERS (Sunday) This group was formed three years ago when Pinchas Zukerman, the violinist and music director of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, teamed up with four young proteges: Amanda Forsyth, a cellist (and his wife); Jethro Marks and Ashan Pillai, both violists; and Jessica Linnebach, a violinist. On Sunday the ensemble plays Mozart's String Quintet in G minor (K. 516) and Brahms's String Quintet No. 2 in G (Op. 111.) F. Murray Abraham, who played Antonio Salieri in the film ''Amadeus,'' kicks off the proceedings by performing Salieri's soliloquy on Mozart's genius. At 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40. (Schweitzer)

* AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow) The company's more venturesome fall season -- compared with the parade of evening-length story ballets at the Metropolitan Opera House in the late spring and early summer -- ends with three performances offering its typical mixed repertory; all three should give pleasure. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, abt.org; $26 to $93. (John Rockwell)

LAWRENCE GOLDHUBER (Tonight through Sunday) O.K., O.K., we know this is billed as ''theater,'' that dull alternative art form. But Mr. Goldhuber has many dance fans, so we thought we'd let you know he's performing ''SWELL(ing) Relatives,'' an excursion into the world of a man who must hold down his floating possessions with 1,000 potatoes. Valeria Vasilevski is the director. (Through Nov. 12.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 10, Sunday at 5:30 p.m., La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15.

At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 431-9233, joyce.org; $15. (Rockwell)

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

* Bronx Museum of the Arts, 'Tropicalia: A Revolution in Brazilian Culture,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sunshower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)

Brooklyn Museum: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Roberta Smith)

* Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament,' through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal peity. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)

* SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,' through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Grace Glueck)

Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Americans in Paris: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7719, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)

The Met: 'Coaxing the Spirits to Dance,' through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)

MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,' through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honore Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots, among them Francois Boucher, Hubert Robert and Jean-Baptiste Greuze; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck)

* Museum of modern art: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)

NEWARK MUSEUM, the Jewish Museum: 'Masters of American Comics,' through Jan. 28. Organized by the Hammer Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it made a splash, this show has come east, cut in size and split between the far-flung Newark and Jewish museums, in which it looks cramped. Art Spiegelman, one of the masters who helped instigate the exhibition, felt so aggrieved by the circumstances that at nearly the 11th hour he pulled his work. Still, the show shouldn't be missed. It spotlights artists like Chris Ware and Gary Panter, amazing state-of-the-art talents and endearing in the tradition of all those shy, gifted kids who drew endlessly in their rooms when other kids wouldn't play with them, dreaming about someday telling the world, ''I told you so.'' Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street, (973) 596-6550, newarkmuseum.org; and the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman)

P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Katrin Sigurdardottir: High Plane,' through May 7. Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir's ''High Plane V,'' a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)

The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Picasso and american art,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velazquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Kimmelman)

Galleries: Chelsea

Robert Colescott: 'A Survey of Paintings' It's good to have Robert Colescott back in town for his first New York solo show here since 2000. Now 81, Mr. Colescott has been dealing in a slap-in-the-face way with race, class, sex and American life for nearly 40 years. His early pictures, like ''George Washington Carver Crossing the Delaware'' (1975), were riffs on museum classics; the five paintings from the 1990s in this mini-survey are a lot harder to pin down. They're richly and expressively painted; they don't hinge on a joke or a clear-cut contrast between good and bad, though they tend to feel bad, in a bad-dream way, and sick-joke funny. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com, through Nov. 11. (Cotter)

Other Galleries

Anant Joshi Cities in Asia are changing fast. They're going up and coming down at about equal speed. Urban culture, flooded with global goods and media, is changing too. Inevitably, such transformations have a big impact on art, and they are the subjects of new work by Anant Joshi, who lives and work in Mumbai. Paintings show a vision of the city modeled on commercial packing materials. Small sculptures, monuments to consumerist chaos, are assembled from hundreds of miniature toys, all made in China. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com, through Nov. 18. (Cotter)

Last Chance

TAUBA AUERBACH: 'YES AND NOT YES' Operating in the gap between Conceptual Art, abstraction and graphic design, this San Francisco artist makes large ink drawings based on naval semaphore, the binary language of digital technology, the interior shapes of capital letters and much else. The results might be called abstraction by other means and are rife with hidden meanings, arcane facts and other conundrums, especially if the gallery's description sheet is studied. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

* Karen Kilimnik This sharp, witty, low-key show is spun around a Napoleonic theme, with a full-scale battle tent sitting in the gallery and paintings of Gericaultian steeds and soldiers inside and out. But any incipient Romanticism is cut with impurities -- walk-ons from Hollywood, refugees from Allure magazine -- as if to keep everything off-balance and confused. Although Ms. Kilimnik has a reputation as a celebrity fantasist, she's a conceptual artist with a cool, watchful, resistant eye. Everyone agrees that full recognition of her accomplishment and influence is long overdue. May it begin here. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

Michaela Meise This ultra-space show by the Berlin-based artist Michaela Meise is filled with oblique references to the city and its history of undergrounds and outsiders. There are pictures from the film ''Hair,'' shot in Central Park; excavation pictures of the African Burial Ground in Lower Manhattan; and one of the British composer Benjamin Britten, who lived in New York as a pacifist during World War II. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, eighth floor, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

KEN PRICE: 'SCULPTURE AND DRAWINGS, 1962-2006' The largest New York exhibition yet devoted to Mr. Price's polymorphous ceramic sculptures reviews four decades of progress, offers an array of powerful new small pieces and introduces his first attempt at something bigger. It invites us to contemplate his transubstantiation of Los Angeles finish fetish and the relationship of his jewel-like surfaces to the random vastness of Jackson Pollock's drip paintings. When will a New York museum give this amazing artist the retrospective he deserves? Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Realtors Say the Stars Are Aligned for Housing

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
IT may go down as the ''Got milk?'' moment for the housing sector.
 Just as dairy associations, with their widespread ads, have tried to convince Americans of the many benefits of milk, the National Association of Realtors will begin promoting the notion that buying a home is an unalloyed good in a $40 million campaign that boldly declares: ''It's a great time to buy or sell a home.'' 
The ads will try to counter the drumbeat of dour housing data and news by making the case that historically low interest rates, a large supply of homes on the market and the group's forecast of rising prices next year make now an ideal time to buy a home. 
 The campaign, which was developed by the Most Agency, based in Newport Beach, Calif., starts today with full-page ads in The Wall Street Journal and USA Today. It will make its way into other newspapers, including The New York Times, over the weekend and onto television and radio networks early next year.
 ''In visiting our local associations and state associations, we were hearing our members saying, 'God, we are getting beat up out there,' '' said Thomas M. Stevens, who is president of the trade group that represents 1.3 million real estate agents and owns a real estate brokerage firm in the Washington area. 
 ''We think we need to tell them that the stars are aligned right now and the conditions are ideal for buyers,'' he added.
 Independent economists, however, are somewhat more skeptical. Many predict that sales and prices, as measured by the association, which fell in August and September from a year ago, may decline further because there are too many homes on the market and because the rapid run-up in prices has put homeownership out of reach of many.
 ''You can make the case that prices will rise in areas of the country that did not have a bubble,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers. But ''in the hot markets, I would say you are in for a two- to three-year adjustment in prices, not a collapse but a steady drop in prices.''
 Mr. Harris recommends that buyers base their purchase decision on whether they intend to live in an area for a few years, not on the outlook for home prices.
 Showing how perilous the art of forecasting can be, the ad by the National Association of Realtors cites a 4.3 percent increase in the number of existing home sales contracts signed in August, from July, as evidence that ''prices over all have stabilized.''
 But Wednesday, new data released by the association showed that contract signings fell 1.1 percent in September, from August, and 13.6 percent from September 2005. A spokesman said that the first ads were prepared before the latest figures were available and would be updated next week.
 Mr. Stevens dismissed the idea that the campaign, the first of its kind undertaken by the association, could be viewed as a sign of desperation. He noted that sales were on track to hit their third-highest level in 2006; 2005 and 2004 rank first and second.
 ''You can't have a record year every year,'' he said.

HEADLINE: China Courts Africa, Angling for Strategic Gains

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Billboards here show elephants and giraffes roaming the savanna. Traffic has been curtailed, construction sites shut down and even the sky has been tantalizingly, if temporarily, blue.
 Beijing has put on its best face to court Africa, ''the land of myth and miracles,'' as official posters call it. Political leaders of 48 of the 53 African countries, including 40 heads of state, are to arrive this weekend for a huge diplomatic event, the China-Africa forum.
The official purposes of the three-day event are to expand trade, to allow China to secure the oil and ore it needs for its booming economy and to offer aid to help African nations improve roads, railways and schools.
 The unofficial purpose is to redraw the world's strategic map by forming tighter political ties between China, which has the world's fastest-growing major economy, and Africa, a continent whose leaders often complain about being neglected by the United States and Europe. 
 ''African leaders see China as a new kind of global partner that has lots of money but treats them as equals,'' said Wenran Jiang, a political scientist at the University of Alberta who has studied Chinese-African ties. ''Chinese leaders see Africa, in a strategic sense, as up for grabs.''
 China's enthusiasm for Africa has raised concerns among many in the West while the United States is distracted by its efforts to curb terrorism, and France, Britain and other former colonial powers exert less influence in Africa than they once did.
 China does not follow the international lending standards intended to fight corruption in the region. It has embraced the leaders of Sudan and Zimbabwe, two countries that are under heavy pressure to improve their poor human rights records. Major oil companies have complained that China uses its influence to secure business opportunities for its state-owned companies. 
 Chinese officials say those concerns are overblown or hypocritical, and they deny that they have a grand scheme to create an exclusive sphere of influence in Africa. But China has nearly $1 trillion in foreign currency reserves, boundless entrepreneurial energy and a strong drive to compete there on its own terms.
 ''The Western approach of imposing its values and political system on other countries is not acceptable to China,'' said Wang Hongyi, a leading specialist on Africa at the China Institute of International Studies. ''We focus on mutual development, not promoting one country at the expense of another.''
 China's economic goal is to secure Africa's abundant supplies of oil, iron ore, copper and cotton at the lowest possible prices, analysts say. Chinese companies view Africa as an open market, neglected by Western multinationals, that they can cultivate with their trademark low-priced goods.
 But if the goal is mostly mercenary, not unlike European objectives in Africa 150 years ago, the method is avowedly anti-imperialist. 
 The forum's slogan -- ''Peace, Friendship, Cooperation, Development'' -- underscores China's pledge not to discriminate or intervene. It even invited the five African countries -- Burkina Faso, Malawi, Gambia, Swaziland and Sao Tome and Principe -- that still extend diplomatic recognition to its rival Taiwan, though none agreed to attend.
 In the long term, Chinese officials say they hope not only that the overture will give their companies an edge in the competition for resources, but also that it will give their diplomats an advantage at the United Nations and other international organizations, where African countries can constitute a powerful voting bloc.
 Unlike China's initial push into Africa under Mao, which aimed to support the Socialist governments of postcolonial Africa, the focus is now on commerce. 
 ''China has offered Africa a new model that focuses on straight commercial relations and fair market prices without the ideological agenda,'' said Moeletsi Mbeki, a South African businessman and political analyst.
 ''They are not the first big foreign power to come to Africa, but they may be the first not to act as though they are some kind of patron or teacher or conqueror,'' he added. ''In that sense, there is a meeting of the minds.''
 The event in Beijing, like most big political affairs in China, promises to be long on ceremony and propaganda and short on substance. President Hu Jintao is meeting a procession of heads of state. 
 The state media have promoted the ''three 50s'': 50 years of Chinese-African cooperation, 53 African countries, $50 billion in two-way trade (a projected figure for 2006). China Central Television is conducting a nationwide survey to select 10 outstanding African icons. Contenders include Cleopatra, South African diamonds and the Sahara.
 Chinese diplomats hint that by the end of the meeting they will unveil a variety of trade and aid concessions. These may include a list of African goods that can enter China tariff-free, increases in aid and technical cooperation and debt forgiveness.
 China's trade with Africa is growing faster than with any other region except the Middle East, increasing tenfold in the past decade, to just shy of $40 billion last year. China buys timber from the Congo Republic, iron ore from South Africa and cobalt and copper from Zambia. An estimated 80,000 Chinese expatriates live in Africa, selling shoes, televisions and everything else the world's factory produces.
 More vitally, Africa has helped quench China's growing thirst for oil. Angola, which China cultivated assiduously in recent years, has edged out Saudi Arabia as China's largest foreign source of oil.
 Sudan, shunned by the West for its genocidal civil war in Darfur, was a net oil importer before China arrived there in 1995. China has since invested heavily in oil extraction, helping Sudan export about $2 billion worth of crude annually, half of that to China.
 Beijing's aggressive pursuit of commodities has often been accompanied by generous aid programs, low-interest loans and other gifts that some Western interests say undermine efforts to foster good governing in Africa. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have expressed their concerns that China's unrestricted lending, including a $2 billion credit line for corruption-plagued Angola, has undermined years of painstaking efforts to arrange conditional debt relief.
 Some African economists complain, too, that China wants to extract raw materials for industry and then sell manufactured goods back to Africa, a mercantilist pattern that failed to bring sustained growth in the past.
 China has also prompted concerns among human rights groups by using the threat of its veto in the United Nations Security Council to protect Sudan and Zimbabwe against international sanctions. The rights groups say China's arms exports to Sudan fuel the conflict in Darfur, which has claimed at least 200,000 lives and has forced more than two million people from their homes.
 ''China insists that it will not interfere in other countries' domestic affairs, but it also claims to be a great friend of the African people,'' said Sophie Richardson of Human Rights Watch. ''But that doesn't square with staying silent while mass killings go on in Darfur.''
 For years, Chinese officials insisted that such concerns were the internal affairs of the countries involved, but they have recently changed their stance somewhat.
 Zhai Jun, an assistant foreign minister responsible for African affairs, said last week that the Africa forum would address human rights and good government, and he specifically mentioned Sudan.
 ''The humanitarian situation in Darfur should be improved,'' Mr. Zhai said. ''We will adopt our own method and use the upcoming summit to do our part.''
 Even if China does speak out on some rights issues, its basic strategy of engaging African countries on their own terms remains the core of its foreign policy.
 Mr. Jiang, of the University of Alberta, said that unlike in the cold war, when China's foreign involvement was motivated by ideology, Beijing now had a commercial strategy as the developing world's biggest beneficiary of globalization to unite with the region most conspicuously left behind. 
 It will be up to each country's leaders, and ultimately each country's people, to decide how to use the wealth, he said. ''From China's perspective the Western powers and Western companies have had their chance in Africa and really nothing has happened,'' he said.
 ''China is trying a different approach,'' he added. ''It is saying, 'Let us have a chance.' ''

PERSON: Samuel B. Casey Jr.

HEADLINE: Samuel Casey, 78; Led Pullman 

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Samuel B. Casey Jr., who as president, chief executive and chairman of Pullman Inc. in the 1970s oversaw the company's transformation from a manufacturer of luxury railroad cars to a builder of vast construction projects, died Oct. 12 in Naples, Fla., his hometown. He was 78. 
 The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Helen Angell Casey.
On Dec. 1, 1970, 10 weeks after he was named chief executive, Mr. Casey called a meeting of Pullman executives and told them to go after his job, because he planned to raise annual revenue above $1 billion within a decade and then resign. He did.
 By the time Mr. Casey took over, Pullman had diversified into building freight cars and, through acquisitions, into engineering and construction. Mr. Casey expanded those operations. In the early '70s, Pullman signed $75 million in contracts with the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Soviet Union for design work at a huge truck factory on the Kama River, 550 miles east of Moscow. The project was a showpiece of the Soviet Union's five-year economic plan.
 Within two years, construction teams had beaten their deadline and the Russian winter and had completed the shells of factory buildings covering 85 acres. ''Simply incredible,'' Mr. Casey said in January 1974, after a visit to the site. ''It is cold as charity out there, 33 degrees below zero, but the buildings are closed.'' 
 Under Mr. Casey's direction, Pullman built bridges, roads and airport runways. In October 1978, eight years after arriving, he resigned as president and chief executive to become chairman, while announcing that Pullman had record revenue of more than $1.8 billion -- up from $700 million in 1970. Two years later, the company was acquired by Wheelabrator-Frye Inc., which soon stopped producing railroad passenger cars. 
 Samuel Brown Casey Jr. was born on Oct. 14, 1927, in Pittsburgh, the son of Samuel and Constance Connelly Casey. His father was president of the John F. Casey Company, a construction company started by his grandfather in the 1890s that became a prime contractor in building the Pennsylvania Railroad. 
 Mr. Casey's studies at Pennsylvania State University were interrupted by service in the Army Air Corps. He completed his bachelor's degree in civil engineering at Penn State in 1950. Ten years later, he took over as president of the family company.
 In addition to his wife of 26 years, Mr. Casey is survived by two daughters, Margaret Curl and Ann Murray Casey, both of Washington; two sons, Samuel Casey III of Washington, and John Dobbins of Chicago; and five grandchildren. His previous marriage, to Margaret Fox of Pittsburgh, ended in divorce.

The woman accused of arson and six counts of murder in a fire at a hotel in downtown Reno spent more than 17 years in prison for second-degree murder for her role in a 1987 killing. The woman, Valerie Moore, 47, left, and two others were convicted in the beating and stomping death of Kathleen Kennedy, 32, an unemployed Reno waitress. The authorities said Ms. Kennedy was killed after arguing over money and refusing Ms. Moore's sexual advances. Prosecutors said Ms. Moore struck the woman in the head with a rock. State corrections records obtained by The Associated Press show Ms. Moore was convicted Sept. 24, 1987, for the killing in February 1987. She was paroled in June 2005.

HEADLINE: A Virginia Sheriff Is Charged With Selling Drug Evidence 

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
The sheriff of Henry County, Va., and 19 other people were charged yesterday with taking part in a scheme to sell drugs and other evidence seized from dealers back to the community.
 The charges against the sheriff, H. Franklin Cassell, followed a lengthy investigation by the United States attorney's office in Roanoke.
Federal investigators began to suspect that the Sheriff's Department was involved in drug trafficking in 2005, officials said, when drug enforcement officials in Philadelphia intercepted a package containing the drug ketamine that had been mailed to a house owned by a sergeant with the department. Ketamine is often used in so-called date rapes. 
 Among the 20 people charged are 13 current and former officers in the department, a former United States Postal Service employee and a state probation officer.
 The United States attorney, John L. Brownlee, said at a news conference that the scheme had involved officers and former officers working with drug dealers to distribute ketamine, cocaine, marijuana and steroids. The members of the department worked with a drug ring to take a variety of items seized from criminals, including not only drugs but also firearms, cash, automotive equipment and even lawn mowers, the indictment said.
 ''It is disgraceful corruption that they would take narcotics seized from the community,'' Mr. Brownlee said, ''and then members of law enforcement would put them right back out there.''
 The Associated Press quoted Sheriff Cassell's lawyer, John Lichtenstein, as saying: '' He's served with great dedication. Now we get an opportunity to answer the accusations.''
 Charges in the indictment include racketeering conspiracy, weapons violations, narcotics distribution, obstruction of justice and perjury.
 Investigators said Mr. Cassell, who has been the sheriff since 1992, had either ignored or encouraged illegal activities among his staff and had told his officers to lie to investigators.
 Mr. Cassell was quoted by investigators as saying that the only way to acquire wealth was to be ''a little crooked and not get caught,'' The A.P. reported. 
 Mr. Cassell led a department of 96 officers in a county with a population of about 58,000 near the North Carolina border. The area's tobacco industry was replaced years ago by textile and furniture manufacturing, but unemployment has climbed into the double digits in the last few years.
 The state police and other county officials are helping run the sheriff's office in the wake of the arrests, officials said.
 The investigation found that since 1998, ''sworn officers, employees and associates of the Henry County sheriff's office engaged in a continuous scheme to steal narcotics, firearms and other contraband from the seized evidence property room,'' a statement by Mr. Brownlee's office said.
 The indictment said Sheriff Cassell had ''covered up these illegal activities by failing to pursue investigations, by agreeing to disclose sensitive law enforcement information to the offending parties in order for them to avoid detection and arrest.''
 The package federal investigators intercepted had been mailed to William R. Reed, a private citizen who told federal investigators he had been the middleman in a scheme to buy and sell drugs with the help of members of the Sheriff's Department and others. 
 The sergeant who mailed it to Mr. Reed, James A. Vaught, later agreed to cooperate with investigators, officials said. Mr. Vaught told investigators he had been paid off by a drug ring that included Mr. Reed to use his house in Martinsville, Va., to distribute drugs.
 The indictment also said Mr. Cassell had tried to help Mr. Vaught in a money-laundering scheme ''to disguise the source of monies represented to have been derived from the distribution of cocaine.''

HEADLINE: Scandal Just Part of Battle To Be New York Comptroller

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
To follow the state comptroller's race this year has been to feast on a daily diet of charges about chauffeurs and bodyguards, and whether an $82,688 reimbursement to the state for services performed for an official's wife is sufficient and the possibility that bow ties might finally be back in style.
 All this admittedly juicy political theater has somewhat obscured the weightier issues at stake: the state comptroller holds a vastly powerful post, as the sole trustee of some of the nation's largest pension funds, with close to a million active and retired members in state and local governments and more than $145 billion in assets to manage.
Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, the Democratic incumbent, has repeatedly pointed to the pension funds' growth under his stewardship as a reason that he should be re-elected, despite what he calls his mistake of failing to reimburse the state for his use of a state employee to chauffeur his ailing wife. He and his Republican rival, J. Christopher Callaghan, have traded barbs about who is better suited to the task. 
 ''When I started, there were $95 billion in that fund,'' Mr. Hevesi said in a recent television interview. ''We now have $145.7 billion four years later, after paying out $20 billion in benefits. We were listed by The Wall Street Journal in the top five best-managed funds in the country, 99.7 percent fully funded.''
 News that the funds are growing -- after the first three years of the decade, when the value of their assets shrank -- is good news for any comptroller to report. But Mr. Hevesi's assertion that the pension plans are 99.7 percent fully funded -- a term that means they have enough assets to meet all future obligations -- appears to rely on an actuarial method that accounting rule makers intend to disallow for disclosures about governmental pension plans.
 That method makes a pension plan appear to be fully funded, or close to it, at all times, no matter what the true economic condition of the plan is. While it is considered a good method for figuring out the contributions that a pension plan needs, it is considered misleading for reporting a plan's financial health.
 The Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which sets the rules for public-sector accounting, announced in August that it planned to remove the method from its list of accepted methods for reporting purposes, following an article in The New York Times that raised questions about such methods.
 Laura L. Anglin, the deputy comptroller for retirement services, said that if the state were already using the new method to describe its pension funds, ''We believe it would show us at 100 percent, or slightly over 100 percent'' fully funded. 
 The state has not yet done the new calculations, though.
 The growth of the pension funds' assets during Mr. Hevesi's first term was helped, as Mr. Hevesi acknowledged in his one debate with Mr. Callaghan this year, by the stock market's performance. 
 David Loglisci, the deputy comptroller for pension investment and cash management, also cited the comptroller's decision to make more alternative investments, including those in private equities, international stocks and real estate, for the growth. He said that those investments had performed better than traditional pension investments and noted that the comptroller's office had won passage of a state law this year to allow an increase in the use of such alternatives. 
 But as the funds' assets have grown during Mr. Hevesi's four-year tenure, so have its obligations, because thousands of active workers have earned another four years' worth of benefits. Because of the actuarial method the state uses to disclose its pension information, it is not clear if the asset growth has kept pace with the growth of the plan's long-term obligations.
 And the payments made to the fund each year by state and local governments have grown sharply in recent years. They contributed $2.7 billion to the pension funds this year, more than 10 times the $263 million they contributed in 2002, the year before Mr. Hevesi took office. Those payments are now beginning to decline again, but they remain higher than they have been in years.
 Even Mr. Hevesi's opponent, Mr. Callaghan, has said that he does not blame Mr. Hevesi for the staggering rise in government contributions to the funds, which have been a drain on local governments throughout the state and have added pressure to increase property taxes. The increases were largely needed to offset losses the pension funds suffered in the stock market on investments made before Mr. Hevesi took office, and to pay for generous new pension benefits that were approved by the Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki over the past decade. 
 But they highlight the importance of good pension fund management, even for those who will never collect a government pension.
 Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Callaghan have a number of real policy differences when it comes to the pension funds. Mr. Callaghan supports switching future state workers to 401(k)-style retirement plans to save the state money -- a change the Legislature would be unlikely to approve. Mr. Hevesi has derided the plan as risky for future retirees. 
 And while Mr. Hevesi proudly points to his shareholder activism -- using his clout as a huge institutional investor to urge governance changes in firms and to invest the funds in projects to create housing and spur economic development in upstate New York -- Mr. Callaghan has said that the only criterion in investing the pension funds should be earning a good return. Mr. Hevesi says it is possible to do well and to do good at the same time.
 And Mr. Callaghan has attacked Mr. Hevesi for taking campaign contributions from firms that earn large fees by doing business for the pension funds. In particular, he has raised questions about a venture- capital investment in Israel that Mr. Hevesi made with a company whose chief executive contributed to his campaign. 
 Aides to Mr. Hevesi say that campaign contributions do not influence investments, and that while he has long supported campaign finance reform, he lives by the current rules. 
 The question of campaign contributions and pension fund investments is not unique to New York. The board of California's $150 billion teachers' pension fund is scheduled to vote on Friday on a measure intended to end what officials there called ''pay-to-play'' practices. The measure would place a cap on campaign contributions and gifts to pension board members by money managers or others seeking to do business with the fund. 
 Anne Sheehan, a member of the pension fund board, who has been pushing for the measure, said the amount of the cap had not yet been decided, but she thought $250 would be appropriate. 
 New Jersey recently established rules against pay-to-play practices at its state pension fund. So did Connecticut, after its former state treasurer and sole pension trustee, Paul J. Silvester, pleaded guilty to federal charges in connection with a scheme to collect kickbacks from potential money managers.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 11, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 3 about disputed actuarial methods used by Alan G. Hevesi, the New York State comptroller, in making disclosures about the state's pension funds referred incorrectly to an investment he made in a company whose chief executive contributed to his re-election campaign. (The same error appeared in articles on Nov. 2, about the responsibilities of the comptroller's office, and on June 18, 2003, about Mr. Hevesi's decision to invest $200 million in Israeli companies.) The investment, with Markstone Capital Group, was made in a private equity fund that invests in Israel, not a venture capital fund.

HEADLINE: Study Sees 'Global Collapse' of Fish Species

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
If fishing around the world continues at its present pace, more and more species will vanish, marine ecosystems will unravel and there will be ''global collapse'' of all species currently fished, possibly as soon as midcentury, fisheries experts and ecologists are predicting.
 The scientists, who report their findings today in the journal Science, say it is not too late to turn the situation around. As long as marine ecosystems are still biologically diverse, they can recover quickly once overfishing and other threats are reduced, the researchers say. 
But improvements must come quickly, said Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, who led the work. Otherwise, he said, ''we are seeing the bottom of the barrel.''
 ''When humans get into trouble they are quick to change their ways,'' he continued. ''We still have rhinos and tigers and elephants because we saw a clear trend that was going down and we changed it. We have to do the same in the oceans.''
 The report is one of many in recent years to identify severe environmental degradation in the world's oceans and to predict catastrophic loss of fish species. But experts said it was unusual in its vision of widespread fishery collapse so close at hand. 
 The researchers drew their conclusion after analyzing dozens of studies, along with fishing data collected by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and other sources. They acknowledge that much of what they are reporting amounts to correlation, rather than proven cause and effect. And the F.A.O. data have come under criticism from researchers who doubt the reliability of some nations' reporting practices, Dr. Worm said. 
 Still, he said in an interview, ''there is not a piece of evidence'' that contradicts the dire conclusions.
 Jane Lubchenco, a fisheries expert at Oregon State University who had no connection with the work, called the report ''compelling.''
 ''It's a meta analysis and there are challenges in interpreting those,'' she said in an interview, referring to the technique of collective analysis of disparate studies. ''But when you get the same patterns over and over and over, that tells you something.''
 But Steve Murawski, chief scientist of the Fisheries Service of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, said the researchers' prediction of a major global collapse ''doesn't gibe with trends that we see, especially in the United States.''
 He said the Fisheries Service considered about 20 percent of the stocks it monitors to be overfished. ''But 80 percent are not, and that trend has not changed substantially,'' he said, adding that if anything, the fish situation in American waters was improving. But he conceded that the same cannot necessarily be said for stocks elsewhere, particularly in the developing world. 
 Mr. Murawski said the Bush administration was seeking to encourage international fishery groups to consider adopting measures that have been effective in American waters. 
 Twelve scientists from the United States, Canada, Sweden and Panama contributed to the work reported in Science today.
 ''We extracted all data on fish and invertebrate catches from 1950 to 2003 within all 64 large marine ecosystems worldwide,'' they wrote. ''Collectively, these areas produced 83 percent of global fisheries yields over the past 50 years.'' 
 In an interview, Dr. Worm said, ''We looked at absolutely everything -- all the fish, shellfish, invertebrates, everything that people consume that comes from the ocean, all of it, globally.'' 
 The researchers found that 29 percent of species had been fished so heavily or were so affected by pollution or habitat loss that they were down to 10 percent of previous levels, their definition of ''collapse.'' 
 This loss of biodiversity seems to leave marine ecosystems as a whole more vulnerable to overfishing and less able to recover from its effects, Dr. Worm said. It results in an acceleration of environmental decay, and further loss of fish.
 Dr. Worm said he analyzed the data for the first time on his laptop while he was overseeing a roomful of students taking an exam. What he saw, he said, was ''just a smooth line going down.'' And when he extrapolated the data into the future ''to see where it ends at 100 percent collapse, you arrive at 2048.''
 ''The hair stood up on the back of my neck and I said, 'This cannot be true,' '' he recalled. He said he ran the data through his computer again, then did the calculations by hand. The results were the same.
 ''I don't have a crystal ball and I don't know what the future will bring, but this is a clear trend,'' he said. ''There is an end in sight, and it is within our lifetimes.''
 Dr. Worm said a number of steps could help turn things around.
 Even something as simple as reducing the number of unwanted fish caught in nets set for other species would help, he said. Marine reserves would also help, he said, as would ''doing away with horrendous overfishing where everyone agrees it's a bad thing; or if we banned destructive fishing in the most sensitive habitats.''
 Josh Reichert, who directs the environmental division of the Pew Charitable Trusts, called the report ''a kind of warning bell'' for people and economies that depend on fish. 
 But predicting a global fisheries collapse by 2048 ''assumes we do nothing to fix this,'' he said, ''and shame on us if that were to be the case.''

HEADLINE: Consumers Signal Change In '08 Election 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The consumer confidence numbers are out, and they indicate the Democrats will take back the White House in 2008.
 Such a forecast may seem a little bold, coming as it does just days before a midterm election, long before either party has chosen a presidential candidate and well before anyone can be sure how the economy will be performing then.
But the history of the consumer confidence index, as measured by the Conference Board, shows that it has been a solid indicator of what will happen two years later. The rule is simple: If voters just before midterm elections think the future looks significantly better than the present, then the incumbent party will keep the White House. On the other hand, if voters think the future looks worse, then they are ready for a change. 
 It is worth noting that the overall level of the index is irrelevant. In October 1982, the economy was in recession, the overall consumer confidence index stood at just 54.3, one of the lowest ratings ever, and many Democrats were confident that Ronald Reagan would be a one-term president.
 But the overall consumer confidence index has two parts -- the current situation and expectations. The current-situation index then was at an abysmally low level of 17.8, which is about as low as it can go. The expectations index was at 78.6, more than 60 points higher. People thought the present was bad, but they thought the future was less bleak. 
 Two years later, Mr. Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.
 This year, consumers show considerable confidence. The overall October figure released this week was 105.4, far above what it was in 1982, or, for that matter, in 2002, two years before George W. Bush won a second term.
 But the view of the current situation is much better than that of the future, bad news for the incumbent party. The current-situation index is at 124.7, while the expectations index is at just 92.6. That is a difference of 32.1 points, and bad news for the Republicans.
 The consumer confidence index is based on answers to just five questions, with the current-situation index based on opinions of existing business conditions (good, bad or neutral) and whether jobs are easy or difficult to get.
 The expectations index asks for views on whether business conditions will improve or worsen over the next six months, whether there will be more or fewer jobs, and whether people expect their own income to rise or fall over that period.
 The board has been asking the questions since 1967, but the numbers now available are based on an index in which the 1985 average equals 100.
 The first midterm election for which numbers are available is 1970, when the figures showed people expected a substantially better future than present. In 1972, Richard M. Nixon overwhelmingly won re-election.
 Similarly, in 1982 and 1986 the future seemed brighter, at least as measured by this index, and the incumbent party won.
 In October 1994, the figures came in at a current-situation reading of 90.9 and a future of 87.9, but the incumbent Democrats did win re-election two years later. That could be seen as the only case when the indicator did not work, but the indicator's author -- this columnist -- finesses this by asserting that a rejection of the incumbents requires a substantial margin.
 In 1974, 1978, 1990 and 1998 the expectation index was 10 points or more below the current-situation index and, as forecast, the incumbent party was thrown out.
 The largest margin ever seen just before a midterm election came in 1998, when the current-situation reading was 165.2 and the expectation figure just 88.7. That predicted the Republicans would regain the White House in 2000, and they did, albeit by a very narrow margin.
 Perhaps the lesson is that a president is better off if things are not too good, because when they are great it is hard to expect improvement. Expectations now are higher than they were in 2002, but the view of the current situation is a lot higher than it was then.
 It is possible to think this is all a coincidence, and it is doubtful this analysis will lead any of the numerous Republican hopefuls for 2008 to drop out. But if the index works again, a Democrat will win in 2008.

HEADLINE: Tom Cruise and Partner To Control United Artists

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Now playing: Tom Cruise, the sequel.
 The film star, who took a beating when Paramount ended his longstanding production deal last summer, has found not just a home, but a new career direction that could point the way for expensive actors who are struggling in cost-conscious Hollywood.
Mr. Cruise and his producing partner, Paula Wagner, will take charge of United Artists, the famous production company started by Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford, the company said Thursday.
 For Mr. Cruise, gaining control of United Artists undoubtedly provides a sense of vindication that he is still a force in Hollywood after he was unceremoniously cut loose this summer from a 14-year deal with Paramount Pictures. Sumner M. Redstone, chairman of Viacom, Paramount's parent company, said at the time that Mr. Cruise's ''recent conduct has not been acceptable to Paramount.'' 
 He was referring to Mr. Cruise's couch-jumping on Oprah Winfrey's show, and his frequent mentions of his belief in Scientology. Mr. Redstone claimed that his behavior had cost the studio as much as $150 million in movie ticket sales for ''Mission: Impossible III.''
 ''He was embarrassing the studio,'' Mr. Redstone recently told Vanity Fair. ''And he was costing us a lot of money.''
 Ms. Wagner will be named chief executive of United Artists and Mr. Cruise will be an executive and producer associated with the studio under an unusual arrangement that gives them a minority share of the company. Ultimately Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., which owns United Artists, hopes that investors take a direct stake in both the unit and Mr. Cruise's career. ''The studios and talent don't trust each other,'' Harry E. Sloan, MGM's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview Thursday. ''We need to start a dialogue.''
 For MGM, which is owned by private equity firms in partnership with the Comcast Corporation and the Sony Corporation, the deal offers an alliance with a major star on terms more manageable than the huge fees he commanded from Viacom's Paramount Pictures for expensive films like last May's ''Mission: Impossible III.'' It also offers a way to unlock the value of the United Artists name, which carries enormous cachet, but has been attached to only a few films lately.
 The deal also offers a fresh twist on recent trends that have seen investors become directly involved with film producers, even as stars seek more creative and financial control over their careers. Established producers like Joel Silver and Ivan Reitman are among those who have made partnerships with outside investors, allowing them to finance films intended for distribution by studios.
 Initially, Mr. Cruise and Ms. Wagner will have authority to produce about four movies a year, for distribution by MGM. Neither Mr. Cruise nor Ms. Wagner put up any capital, Ms. Wagner said. Mr. Cruise may or may not star in the pictures, and will remain free to work as an actor for other studios.
 Mr. Sloan and his team have been working to revive MGM as a full-blown movie and television distribution company. Last year, several producers in Hollywood had sought to buy United Artists but were unsuccessful. So far MGM's recent track record as a distributor of other producers' movies is unimpressive.
 ''School for Scoundrels,'' which starred Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Heder, brought in only $17.2 million at the domestic box office when it was released in September. The World War I epic ''Flyboys'' flopped, bringing in only $12.8 million. 
 Mr. Sloan said MGM was trying to create a new studio model in its dealings with Mr. Cruise and Ms. Wagner. The company will finance United Artists' first few movies, with budgets of $40 million to $50 million -- relatively modest amounts, by current Hollywood standards -- and will pay for the unit's overhead. 
 After that, Mr. Sloan expects to approach outside investors to finance United Artists' movies in partnership with Mr. Cruise, who will share an ownership stake in the operation with Ms. Wagner. If investors are not interested in financing the films, MGM said it would pay for them all. 
 Those outside investors could be hedge funds, wealthy individuals or investment banks. According to Mr. Sloan, the proposed United Artists financial model will spread risk more equally between the studio, talent and the outside investors than a conventional Hollywood deal.
 Mr. Sloan said he expected to announce United Artists' first movie soon. When asked if outside investors would still be interested if United Artists' initial movies flopped, he laughed and joked, ''We'll take the model out to investors before the first picture opens.''
 Recently, some financial funds have seen disappointing results from their investments in studio films. Legendary Pictures, which has a five-year, $600 million deal with Warner Brothers Entertainment to co-finance and co-produce deals, for instance, was an investor in some of that studio's more noticeable summer duds, including ''Lady in the Water'' and the animated ''The Ant Bully.'' 
 ''The actors are not going to have a cakewalk,'' said Harold Vogel, the author of ''Entertainment Industry Economics.'' ''These investors don't say, 'Oh, it's so glamorous to go to a party.' They aren't that dumb. Instead they say, 'You will get your money, but we get ours first.' ''
 Mr. Cruise seems to be hedging his own bets by staying on the market as an actor for hire. Also, films already in development under their Cruise/Wagner Productions moniker can be produced by other studios, although Ms. Wagner said she and Mr. Cruise were in negotiations with Paramount to buy back some of the projects they developed there.
 When asked to comment on Mr. Cruise's new deal, Mr. Redstone said, ''I wish Tom and his associates the greatest good fortune in their venture.''
 Ms. Wagner said she hoped United Artists would become a home for talent, in keeping with the company's roots. The studio was originally founded in 1919 by Mr. Chaplin, Ms. Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and D. W. Griffith. In later years, it became associated with MGM, and for decades was controlled by the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, who ultimately engineered the sale to its current owners.
 Unlike Mr. Silver and Mr. Reitman, who expect to focus on low-budget thrillers and comedies, United Artists expects to make mainstream films of considerable range, Ms. Wagner said. She added that United Artists' financial backers would have no creative input; their role would be limited to how money was spent. ''We are not looking to make a film that makes people unhappy,'' she said.
 Of course, that is harder than it seems. Other well-known Hollywood personalities have tried to start talent-friendly studios over the years with limited success. Revolution Studios, to choose one relatively recent example, was started in 2000 by the veteran producer and executive Joe Roth, who said he too wanted to bring actors deeper into the process of creating artful films at a reasonable cost, like the old United Artists. But the deal he cut with Sony to create Revolution was not renewed after a string of disappointments, and he is now going to be a Sony producer.
 ''I'm still reeling,'' said Ms. Wagner of the day's news. ''The ink is not dry on this. If you have a movie, send it our way. We are still figuring this all out.''

HEADLINE: European Bank Hints at a Rate Increase

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank signaled on Thursday that it would raise its benchmark interest rate for the sixth time in a year when it meets in December, as it tries to curb inflation in an expanding European economy.
 ''Strong vigilance remains of the essence,'' the central bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said after the regular meeting of the bank's rate-setting council.
 That phrase has previously been used to hint that a rate increase is coming the following month. 
 Evidence that the recovery continues apace came Thursday from Germany, where the unemployment rate dropped to a seasonally adjusted 10.4 percent in October, from 10.6 percent in September. That was the lowest reported in over two years.
 Using unadjusted figures, the jobless rate fell to 9.8 percent -- the first dip below 10 percent in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, since November 2002.
 Since last December, the central bank has raised its benchmark rate for the 12-nation euro area five times, to 3.25 percent.
 An increase next month, widely anticipated by financial markets for several months, is likely to bring it to 3.5 percent.
 Mr. Trichet said the central bank would reveal more about its plans for next year when it meets in December and reviews the quarterly growth and inflation projections prepared by the bank's staff.
 ''We will do all that is necessary to ensure price stability,'' he said.
 Mr. Trichet gave enough subtle hints to suggest to some analysts that the central bank would raise rates again in 2007.
 He painted a picture of an economy that will weather a significant increase in the German sales tax and a slowdown in the United States without much trouble.
 But the euro zone will continue to experience higher-than-normal inflation, Mr. Trichet said, suggesting that the bank would need to tighten credit further.
 ''The E.C.B. is happily letting the markets believe that there is more to come,'' said Audrey Childe-Freeman, chief Europe economist at CIBC World Markets in London. ''But the bank is never going to precommit itself explicitly.''
 Some other central bank watchers expressed doubt over whether the central bank rate increases would continue into 2007.
 ''Our conclusion is that the E.C.B.'s bark will be worse than its bite,'' said Ken Wattret, chief euro zone economist at BNP Paribas in London. ''They won't get as far as another rate increase because events will overtake them.''
 Wattret and other economists argued that the central bank's currently sanguine view of growth in the euro area next year would be upset by the slowdown in the United States, where economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter.
 With slower growth, central bankers will be reluctant to squeeze the economy more with higher rates, Mr. Wattret said.
 Mr. Trichet has said that when the United States loses one percentage point off its growth rate, it drags down growth in the euro nations by about 0.2 percent.
 But Mr. Wattret, among others, argues that the impact on Europe is bound to be greater -- even if the American economy does not experience a collapse in the housing market, a much-feared event that has so far not occurred.
 The German sales tax increase remains the subject of considerable debate as well, though the outcry over that increase, to 19 percent on Jan. 1 from 16 percent, has calmed since the beginning of the year.
 Skeptics tend to believe that the increase will shake confidence in the recovery next year, creating now-unanticipated ripple effects.
 Mr. Trichet said on Thursday that it ''remains likely'' that inflation will remain above the bank's target of ''close to, but below'' 2 percent in 2007 -- a condition that helped the bank justify past rate increases.
 And he said that lower oil prices, though they have reduced inflation over the last two months, would also support economic growth, which has an inflation-accelerating effect in the subsequent months.
 ''We are not reasoning short term,'' Mr. Trichet said. ''We are reasoning medium term.''
 The central bank said that the German sales tax increase would create ''some volatility'' in growth rates early in the next year.
 Over all, the bank stressed that the European recovery, after becoming stronger than anticipated a year ago, seemed likely to continue into 2007.

HEADLINE: Avoiding Calamity on the Cheap

 BODY:
A much-anticipated study on climate change ordered up by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has attempted to calculate the economic costs of global warming. Though necessarily conjectural, the study warns that if we continue on our current course, atmospheric temperatures could rise four degrees or so in this century, producing a hugely disruptive mix of rising sea levels and withering droughts. 
 This in turn would drain the world economy of trillions of dollars, with social and economic costs on a scale ''similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century.''
 The study, led by Sir Nicholas Stern, former chief economist of the World Bank, says that the only way to avoid that dismal outcome is to slash worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide by investing hundreds of billions of dollars in cleaner technologies. The report has been criticized for overestimating the consequences of warming and underestimating the costs of mitigation. Still, its basic point seems unassailable: failure to act now will exact much greater penalties later on.
 Developing and deploying the necessary technologies will require a collective global effort. But the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases, the United States, is doing scandalously little. A detailed examination by The Times's Andrew Revkin pointed out that Washington spends only $3 billion a year for all energy research and development. Of this, only a fraction -- $416 million, according to the Energy Department -- was spent last year on climate-friendly, renewable technologies like wind, solar power, cellulosic ethanol and hydrogen. By contrast, Washington spends $28 billion on medical research and $75 billion on military research. 
 The administration claims that it is in fact doing more, especially if various tax incentives for cleaner fuels like ethanol are included in the mix. Even so, in an age when people are worried not only about warming but also about the country's growing dependence on imported oil, the federal effort on alternative energy sources is pathetically small.
 The Bush administration's lack of commitment to research might not be quite so lamentable if it had been prodding the private sector into investing in cleaner energy. Private capital is not likely to emerge in big enough quantities unless a significant cost is attached to carbon emissions -- either in the form of a carbon tax or a mandatory cap on emissions. But the administration has refused to ask Congress to impose either.
 Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, the atmosphere has served as a free dumping ground for carbon gases. If people and industries are made to pay heavily for the privilege, they will inevitably be driven to develop cleaner fuels, cars and factories. Most of the industrialized world has accepted the need for either carbon taxes or strict regulation, and Europe has already imposed a cap on emissions from its cars and factories. 
 Mr. Bush and many in Congress remain steadfastly opposed -- still convinced, it appears, that calamity can be avoided on the cheap.

HEADLINE: Bush Shores Up His Base As Democrats Spot Opening

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and ANNE E. KORNBLUT; Anne E. Kornblut was traveling with the president.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Trying to save a threatened Western Senate seat, President Bush on Thursday urged Montana voters to re-elect Senator Conrad Burns to help place conservative judges on the federal bench. And in Arizona, Democrats decided to pump money into the race for Senate, saying early voting patterns showed an unexpected opening.
 Working his way through a region that has traditionally been reliably Republican, Mr. Bush used stops in Billings, Mont., and later in Elko, Nev., to raise the specter of Democrats blocking his judicial choices. 
''Senator Conrad Burns understands the importance of having good judges on the federal bench,'' said Mr. Bush, saying he was happy to be in a place where cowboy hats outnumbered ties. He acknowledged the sharp tongue that has sometimes caused trouble for Mr. Burns and contributed to his tough re-election fight against the Democratic challenger, Jon Tester. ''You might call him a plain-spoken fellow,'' the president said.
 While Mr. Bush was going to bat for Mr. Burns, Democrats were mounting a new effort against Senator Jon Kyl in Arizona, in a race the party had almost given up on. But Democrats said a poll of early voters had found strong support for their candidate, Jim Pederson, inspiring $1 million in last-minute spending by the national party. 
 Republicans challenged the poll findings, but Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the survey of Arizonans who had already cast their ballots ''could be a harbinger of a wave.''
 Mr. Schumer conceded that the Montana race, where Mr. Burns has been struggling for months, has tightened. But he remained optimistic about his party's chances, saying the incumbent had never come close to cracking 50 percent in polls.
 Working to make certain they do not get surprised in an East Coast race, Senate Democrats also placed a new advertisement in Maryland trying to tie the Republican candidate, Michael J. Steele, to Bush policy on the war in Iraq. 
 The party, though it believes it has the contest in hand, remains nervous about the potential appeal of Mr. Steele, an African-American, to the state's large, and usually Democratic-voting, black population. Last week he was endorsed by several well-known black leaders in Prince George's County, a populous and predominantly black Washington suburb.
 The new commercial revisits Mr. Steele's recent statements of support for the war and notes that his Democratic opponent, Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, opposed the war at the outset. ''We need a senator who does what's right for us, not George Bush,'' the advertisement says.
 Doug Heye, a spokesman for Mr. Steele, the state's lieutenant governor, said Democrats were trying to sidestep important local issues like education and economic empowerment. ''Ben Cardin is running against George Bush,'' Mr. Heye said. ''Michael Steele is running for Maryland.''
 The political maneuvering came as the parties and candidates made last-minute adjustments to try to cover all their bases. Mr. Bush continued to try to rally voters in heavily Republican areas, and was staying out of New England, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where his low approval ratings may make him a liability in important races.
 ''We're focusing his energy on places where he can best turn out the vote for Republican candidates,'' a senior administration official told reporters traveling with the president on Air Force One. ''These are all races that are close. These are all races that are likely going to come down to turnout. And so that's the nature of all these visits.''
 Mr. Bush has refused to express any of the pessimism that other Republicans have voiced as they face the prospect of losing control of the House and perhaps the Senate as well. 
 ''We've been through this before,'' Mr. Bush said in Montana, referring to tough races of the past. ''We are going win these elections because we understand the values and priorities of the American people.''
 But there was some confusion at the White House on Thursday about just which elections were taking place. One spokesman initially told reporters there was no Senate race in Nevada this year, though the incumbent Republican, John Ensign, has a Democratic opponent who should be at least passingly familiar, since he is Jack Carter, the son of former President Jimmy Carter. The White House later acknowledged the mistake.

HEADLINE: City Ends Deal With Developer Of a Long-Delayed Golf Course 

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The idea was as simple as it was bold: Take a former garbage dump in a corner of the eastern Bronx and turn it into a championship-caliber golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus where Tiger Woods might tee off one day. 
 But in the eight years since the Giuliani administration awarded a contract to a developer to transform the 222-acre site in Ferry Point Park, not a single blade of grass has been planted, and the city has spent more than $8 million cleaning up a toxic stew of arsenic, lead and leaking methane gas.
Yesterday, the Parks Department announced that it had terminated its agreement with Ferry Point Partners, throwing into doubt the future of the golf course project and leaving Throgs Neck residents worrying what might happen next.
 ''We've agreed to end the contract, as the terms could not be fulfilled,'' said Warner Johnston, a Parks Department spokesman. The news was reported yesterday in The New York Post. City officials said the city would open the project to new bidders within the next few months. 
 The golf course was originally scheduled to open in 2001, but its opening date was pushed back, most recently to 2009. Over the years, the estimated cost rose to $84 million from $22.4 million in 1998.
 During that time, nearly two million cubic yards of dirt were dumped at the site, creating giant mounds on the area. One cubic yard is equal to about 202 gallons. 
 People bought homes for as much as $500,000 across the street from the landfill in anticipation of its transformation into a top-notch public course where a round of golf would have cost as much as $150.
 But given the years of delays, Dorothy Poggi, president of Ferry Point Advocates, said the contract termination was not unexpected. ''This was the only outcome that could have happened, so I'm not surprised,'' said Ms. Poggi, a longtime opponent of the plan.
 At various times, Ferry Point Partners has enlisted several high-powered officials to support its cause, including Rudy Washington and Robert Harding, who were deputy mayors under Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Edward C. Wallace, a former city councilman.
 J. Pierre Gagne, the chief operating officer of Ferry Point Partners, said yesterday that stringent government regulations had been the primary cause of his group's problems. He said that as the cost of the golf course increased, the deal no longer made economic sense. 
 Mr. Gagne, who said his group had spent more than $20 million on the golf course, said he would be willing to bid on the project again if it were restructured.
 ''We can't be faulted, and the city can't be faulted,'' he said. ''I want to finish what I started.''

HEADLINE: General Plays Down Discord Between U.S. and Iraqis 

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
The top American military spokesman here on Thursday played down recent discord between the American and Iraqi governments, saying that while there had been ''disconnects,'' the leaders of both countries were working closely to achieve political stability in Iraq.
 ''A transition is not always a pleasant thing to watch as it happens,'' the spokesman, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, said during a news briefing in Baghdad. ''We need to have more dialogue, as was clearly evidenced by the fact that there have been some disconnects that have occurred in this transition period.'' 
On Tuesday, in the latest public flare-up of tension, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, under pressure from Shiite political leaders and outraged Baghdad residents, demanded that American troops remove a week-old cordon that had been set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City as part of the search for a missing American soldier.
 General Caldwell said Thursday that a ''tremendous amount of political activity'' was under way to secure the release of the soldier, who was reported taken on Oct. 23 after he left the fortified Green Zone, without permission, to visit relatives in central Baghdad. 
 ''There is ongoing dialogue that is being done at different levels at this time,'' the general said, though he refused to provide any details of those conversations. 
 General Caldwell confirmed that the soldier was Specialist Ahmed Qusai al-Taie, a 41-year-old Iraqi-American reservist, and that he was married to an Iraqi woman. His wife was among the relatives Specialist Taie was visiting when he was abducted, the general said, adding that officials believed that the soldier was still alive and being held by his original captors. 
 The American command has dedicated more than 2,000 American troops and more than 1,000 members of Iraqi security forces to the search operation, which has focused on Sadr City and the central Baghdad neighborhood of Karrada, where Specialist Taie was taken. The authorities suspect involvement by the Mahdi Army, a large Shiite militia that controls Sadr City and is loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr.
 The manhunt has angered some American troops in Iraq, who have privately complained that the military should not expend any additional resources, or put any troops at further risk, to search for a soldier who had violated military rules and exposed himself to danger by leaving his post without military protection. 
 But on Thursday, perhaps addressing those complaints, General Caldwell said, ''We never stop looking for our service members.'' 
 Prime Minister Maliki's demand to end the search cordon put additional strain on an increasingly fractious relationship between him and President Bush. 
 The Iraqi leader has wrestled for more independence from his American protectors, including greater control of Iraq's security, which is dominated by the Americans. According to General Caldwell, the prime minister announced an initiative this week to expand the Iraqi military by about 18,700 troops.
 The top American military commander in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., said last week that Iraqi security forces still needed 12 to 18 months before they would be ready to take full control of the country's security. But Iraq's president, Jalal Talabani, offered a more conservative prediction, saying during a speech in Paris on Thursday that Iraq's security forces would be ready to assume full responsibility in two to three years.
 ''Two to three years are needed to build our security forces and say goodbye to our friends,'' said Mr. Talabani, who is on a six-day visit to France.
 General Caldwell said some measurements of violence in Iraq had indicated a decrease since the holy month of Ramadan ended early last week, including a 23 percent drop in casualties across the country from the week before.
 ''Those statistics are promising, but as I've said before, one week does not constitute a trend,'' he cautioned.
 Indeed, a wide range of attacks on Thursday drew from the entire repertoire of tactics used by the country's death squads and criminal groups: vehicle bombs, mortar bomb attacks, bombs concealed along urban and rural roadways, ambushes, assassinations, drive-by shootings and kidnappings. 
 At least 37 people were killed, including civilians and security forces, and 97 wounded in more than two dozen incidents reported by the authorities in Baghdad, Baquba and Kirkuk, three of the country's largest cities.
 In Baghdad at least five people were killed and 53 were wounded when a bomb hidden on a motorcycle exploded in a crowded marketplace in Sadr City. 
 Separately, attackers shot and killed the dean of Baghdad University's economics and management college, his wife and their son at the college's front gate, an Interior Ministry official said. 
 An American military patrol opened fire on guards working at a building associated with the Supreme Judiciary Council, killing four and wounding one, the ministry official said. The circumstances of the shooting remained unclear. A bomb exploded in a crowded market in the New Baghdad neighborhood, killing one and wounding 22, the official said. 
 In Diyala Province, gunmen opened fire on two oil tanker trucks, igniting the trucks and killing five people inside, a provincial police official reported. Other gunmen killed a judge and his son in the provincial capital of Baquba, the police official said. 
 An American soldier died in what was called ''a noncombat-related incident'' north of Baghdad on Thursday, the American military said. 
 It said in another statement that Iraqi security forces operating about three miles from the Iranian border had ''intercepted six heavily loaded donkeys.'' The donkeys were hauling 53 Soviet- and Italian-made antitank landmines and one antitank projectile, which the troops confiscated and destroyed. No humans were captured, the statement said, and the donkeys were set free.

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Political Parody, Upstarts Outrun the Classics

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
The pre-election episode of ''The Simpsons'' on Fox on Sunday contains a harsh critique of the Iraq war. The conservative movement to ban gay marriage was skewered on the most recent episode of ''Freak Show,'' an animated series on Comedy Central. Political issues are so topical that on tomorrow's HBO comedy special, ''Blonde and Bitchin','' even Roseanne Barr interrupts her fat jokes to state, ''I hate the president.'' 
 ''Saturday Night Live,'' however, is filling its airtime on NBC with a Darrell Hammond retrospective. Tomorrow's show consists of clips of his most memorable impersonations, from Chris Matthews to Bill Clinton. Mr. Hammond brilliantly imitates many public figures, but President Bush is not one of them. A look back at highlights from Mr. Hammond's career is overdue and welcome, but the timing on the eve of the midterm elections seems odd, to say the least.
 And that divide pretty much sums up the landscape of political and social satire on television. 
 ''S.N.L.'' is now in its 32nd season, and, not so surprisingly, it is no longer the lodestar of political comedy. The series long ago ceded cutting-edge lampoonery to smaller, nimbler cable shows on Comedy Central like ''South Park'' and ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' which spent the week before the election in Ohio for the Midwest midterm ''midtacular.''
 And unlike ''The Simpsons,'' which has stayed consistently acerbic and funny for more than 16 years, ''S.N.L.'' has slumped and soared since its heyday in the era of John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Gilda Radner. The show can idle for several seasons, then suddenly a new talent -- Eddie Murphy in 1981, Will Ferrell in 1995 -- snaps the comedy back into the limelight. Ratings falter, as do the jokes, but except for occasional sports events, ''S.N.L.'' remains the most-watched series on Saturday nights. It can still be funny, even though it seems tamer, more wedded to television parodies and celebrity impersonations than inspired lunacy. 
 Three decades ago ''S.N.L.'' was unique, but even then it was not always daring or brilliant; even the earliest episodes had many boring or lame conceits. Like ''60 Minutes'' or the presidency of John F. Kennedy, ''S.N.L.'' benefits from telescoping hindsight: if only we could all be judged by our own best 10 minutes. 
 The show still looms large in boomer and Gen-X culture. The fall season opened with two homages to ''S.N.L.'' on NBC: ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,'' a dramatic behind-the-scenes look at an ''S.N.L.''-like show by Aaron Sorkin, and ''30 Rock,'' a sitcom version by Tina Fey, who was the head writer of ''S.N.L.'' So far neither series has become a major hit. And so far the real ''S.N.L.,'' which has a pared down cast, has not stood out much either. Yet it still draws top guests. Last week's show, starring Hugh Laurie (''House''), began with a joke about cutbacks at NBC: Lorne Michaels, the longtime executive producer of ''S.N.L.,'' sat in an armchair and announced that to save money, NBC sold the top of the show to a foreign government. The comedian Sacha Baron Cohen stepped in as Borat, the backward reporter from Kazakhstan. ''Live from New York, home of the Jew,'' Borat said. ''It's 'Saturday Night.' ''
 The show's format has changed remarkably little over the decades. Lately, however, the writers have played catch-up with cable and YouTube. ''S.N.L.'' now has returned to animated shorts. (Last week there was a parody of Republican campaign ads that featured a cartoon Hillary Rodham Clinton popping out of a pregnant woman's stomach like the monster in ''Alien'' and offering trick-or-treaters ''condoms or abortion pills.'') 
 Video shorts are a new tack: last season the only sketch that resonated far beyond the show's usual fan base was ''Lazy Sunday,'' a two-minute tape of two white guys rapping about cupcakes and a matinee of ''The Chronicles of Narnia.'' That video rocketed around the Internet thanks to a new phenomenon called YouTube. Now these shorts are a regular feature. 
 Cast members who break through with imaginary characters the way Dana Carvey or Mike Myers did are rare. Nowadays the show relies on impersonations, and those are only as good as the actors doing them. In some cases (Mr. Aykroyd, Mr. Ferrell), the actors are so inherently funny that they capture the comic essence of their character without mastering their mannerisms. As this week's retrospective proves, when Mr. Hammond becomes Mr. Clinton, he does both. Will Forte, the actor who currently impersonates the current president, however, does not, which could help explain why tomorrow's episode looks backward, not forward. 
 There are some beloved ''S.N.L.'' traditions that seem obsolete. No matter who is at the anchor desk, ''Weekend Update'' cannot compete with the immediacy and acuity of ''The Daily Show'' or ''The Colbert Report.'' 
 And it is much harder for actors performing live in front of a network audience to be as provocative as an animated series. (On a recent ''S.N.L.'' episode a joke about Senator Bill Frist that mentioned Terri Schiavo was greeted by the audience with shocked silence.) 
 As its roman numeral suggests, ''Treehouse of Horror XVII'' is a recurring Halloween special on ''The Simpsons,'' but this year it looks at horrors beyond the holiday; the cartoon's underlying message is somberly censorious, not whimsical. Aliens invade Homer Simpson's hometown of Springfield. ''You said we'd be greeted as liberators,'' one little green man says to another, questioning the merits of ''Operation Enduring Occupation.'' The other alien retorts that Earth had to be stopped from developing ''weapons of mass disintegration.'' 
 The show's producers decided to cut the last line of the episode because it was too heavy-handed: the two aliens look over the smoking ruins of the town square and the sounds of gunfire, and one says, ''This sure is a lot like Iraq will be.''
 The political commentary on ''South Park'' and ''Freak Show'' is not any more subtle. ''South Park'' took on embryonic stem-cell research on a recent episode. Cartman tries to sell stolen frozen embryos to the highest-bidding research lab. (When the government closes down those experiments, he tries to sell them to seafood wholesalers.) Kenny dies again, and this time it's because the government's ban on stem-cell research prevented a cure for his unnamed muscular disease.
 The most recent episode of ''Freak Show'' is even more bellicose, lampooning Log Cabin Republicans and labeling efforts to ban gay marriage as a cynical scam to detract attention from Iraq and the economy. It's a bipartisan clubbing: Senators hold a hearing to screen a spilled-guts video game called ''Blood Crusade III: The Race to Genocide.'' It turns out that it's not the violence that incenses the legislators, it is an imagined gay subtext. The Republicans bay for censorship, but it is Senator Clinton who leads the charge for a recall.
 ''S.N.L.'' steers a safer, steadier comic course. Its longevity suggests that even in a dizzy era of streaming video and cable cartoonization, there is merit to mainstream iconoclasm.

HEADLINE: Some Californians to Pick Their Utility at the Polls 

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WOODLAND, Calif., Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Gene Stille says he is tired of paying the Pacific Gas and Electric Company roughly $300,000 a year in extra electricity bills for his small chain of Nugget supermarkets. If his stores were just a few miles east, in the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, he said, his costs would be that much lower.
 ''I can't see any reason to pay all that extra money'' to P.G.&E., he said, considering that it charges roughly 40 percent more than its publicly owned counterpart based in the state capital.
Mr. Stille cannot move his stores, but he hopes to do the next best thing: swap the utilities. 
 On Tuesday, voters will decide whether Mr. Stille's stores and 77,000 other Yolo County customers will switch to the municipal utility. Such a move is a rare event these days in California, where corporate-owned and publicly owned power systems fought long and bitter battles going back more than a century over the role of electricity in state politics and the economy.
 If the switch takes place, Mr. Stille, like other residents of this table-flat farming area, will not necessarily enjoy significantly lower electricity costs right away.
 But he and many others here are tempted enough to abandon P.G.&E. that the company has poured $10.4 million of its shareholders' money into trying to defeat the plan, even though it would lose just 1.5 percent of its customers. The utility, which is worried about Yolo County setting a precedent, is the sole donor to the no campaign. 
 ''I am confident that we will win this,'' said Peter A. Darbee, chief executive of the PG&E Corporation. PG&E owns the utility Pacific Gas and Electric, which supplies power to about 15 million people in Northern California.
 Advocates for the switch -- a coalition of business owners, local officeholders and a few dedicated public power advocates -- have spent less than $1 million, most of it raised in small amounts. Volunteer crews have gone door to door seeking votes.
 The election here is a small but significant sign of modern-day efforts around the nation to expand publicly owned power, which achieved its greatest gains in the Progressive era early in the 20th century and during the New Deal of the 1930s, but has grown little since.
 The movements are fueled in good part by discontent in many areas where electricity rates are on the rise and the power industry has failed to deliver on its promise of lower prices from restructuring.
 Drives to make the switch are under way in much of Massachusetts. Six towns in Iowa are studying the idea, along with cities in Colorado, Connecticut and Louisiana, according to the American Public Power Association, a trade group for public power agencies. 
 In Oregon, the Portland City Council made an offer for the Portland General Electric unit of the bankrupt Enron, but its offer was rejected in 2004, even though it was willing to pay more than the top bid. 
 One main reason municipal utilities can offer lower rates is that they are able to borrow tax-free, giving them lower interest rates than corporate utilities. They also often get cheap hydroelectric power from government dams, pay much smaller salaries to executives and do not have to pay dividends to shareholders.
 In the California fight, the Sacramento utility district has promised to cut rates by 30 percent, but it will take back all but two percentage points of that in a surcharge to pay P.G.&E. for its equipment. The district also promises benefits to local governments and nonprofits equal to the property taxes that P.G.&E. now pays.
 The Sacramento district says that the surcharge could end in as little as five years, but P.G.&E. says the charge may last for a quarter-century. 
 Mr. Darbee said that if voters approved the switch, his company might demand as much as $567 million for its poles, wires, transformers and other distribution equipment. That is about five times the $110 million to $130 million that three reports for local government agencies estimated they are worth.
 ''We think a jury would award us $400 million,'' he said. 
 Mr. Darbee argued that ''it is inappropriate for politicians'' to take away part of P.G.&E.'s business ''just because they think they can do a better job.''
 The state Constitution gives elected city councils and county boards of supervisors authority to grant exclusive franchises to utilities, like those P.G.&E. obtained here more than a century ago. But it also allows voters to terminate those franchises.
 The Sacramento district is the second-largest public power operation in the state, after the municipal power agency that serves the city of Los Angeles.
 For the switch to occur, two ballot measures in Yolo County and one in Sacramento County must be approved by majorities. With no hot races, turnouts are expected to be low, both sides say. 
 The Yolo County vote grows out of the economic wreckage left behind by Enron, which was one of the PG&E Corporation's biggest trading partners at the height of the California energy crisis in 2000.
 Enron's manipulations of California's flawed electricity restructuring plan helped send state electricity prices soaring and caused blackouts and brownouts. The debacle pushed the P.G.&E. utility into bankruptcy and forced the state to take on $11 billion in debt that, with interest, is expected to weigh on taxpayers for about two decades.
 ''That's when our reputation fell,'' Mr. Darbee said. 
 In the latest J. D. Power survey of residential customers' satisfaction, the Sacramento district ranked second among 55 large utilities in America, while P.G.&E. was at the edge of the bottom fourth.
 Enron was one of the most aggressive champions of replacing government-regulated prices. These provide an established profit for utilities on their investments but can lead at times to wasteful spending because there is no built-in incentive to seek the lowest cost or the most efficient way to meet the energy needs of customers.
 A switch to the Sacramento district is supported by the councils of all three cities in the area -- Woodland, the college town of Davis and industrial West Sacramento -- as well as the boards of supervisors in Sacramento and Yolo Counties. All three daily newspapers in the area also favor the move. 
 Eleni Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis, president of the largest land development firm in the Sacramento area, said that ''support for the annexation among business leaders is overwhelming.'' 
 She donated $300,000, saying she regards the utility district as a benefit to the community in many ways, from helping plant trees and quickly restoring power after blackouts to serving as a training ground for up-and-coming government leaders.
 ''The district has drawn smart people who care about our community, put all the upside back into our community and are at the cutting edge of utility service,'' she said.
 But not everybody is persuaded that the municipal utility offers a substantial advantage over P.G.&E.
 One P.G.&E. supporter, Dudley Holman, president of the Yolo County Taxpayers Association, said that he objected to allowing the government to seize the utility's distribution system through eminent domain.
 Another opponent of the switch is Peter Defty, president of Vanguard Inflatables, which makes rafts for running whitewater rivers.
 The real issue, Mr. Defty said, is that ''the politicians botched deregulation and we had deregulation in name only,'' on terms that gave utilities, generating companies and market traders opportunities to increase their profits and pass the costs on to customers.
 He said it was difficult to see how the Sacramento district could achieve long-run savings as long as it would have to buy much of the power for Yolo customers in the same markets.
 ''The politicians are going for this because the disparity in rates'' between P.G.&E. and the Sacramento utility district ''is at an all-time high,'' Mr. Defty said. But ''it won't last because the era of cheap energy is over.''

HEADLINE: New Consumer-Directed Plans Reduce Premiums But Carry Higher Annual Deductibles 

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON and MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
What are your chances of staying healthy for the next 12 months? Care to place a bet?
 Those are the questions for many of the tens of millions of working Americans now engaged in the annual health-benefits enrollment process and who for the first time have the option of signing up for the relatively new kind of coverage known as a consumer-directed health plan.
But because the plans can pose risks and uncertainties, many employers are still not offering them. And even where the plans are available, most experts do not expect more than a small fraction of workers to choose the coverage. 
 Meant to save employers money -- possibly workers, too, if their gambles pay off -- the plans dangle the lure of lower monthly premiums than conventional coverage. The trade-off is a higher annual deductible, the money the member must pay to cover medical expenses before the insurance kicks in. 
 With the new plans, the deductible is at least $1,000 for an individual but can go much higher.
 In some cases, these plans also feature a health savings account that lets the employee set tax-sheltered money aside to spend on medical bills, whether in the coming year or farther out in the future. 
 Some versions also help members figure out the best doctors to go to and are more generous than conventional coverage in paying for care meant to keep people healthy. In some cases, consumer-directed plans are the only type of coverage offered.
 If all this sounds more complicated and risky that conventional health insurance, it is. Despite heavy promotion by insurance companies, corporate benefit consultants and even cheerleading by President Bush, employers have been slow to push consumer-directed health plans and workers have been even slower to choose them. 
 ''It's a risk thing that you take,'' said Judy Rosenthal, a working mother in Independence, Mo., who has experimented with four plans in five years.
 Several years ago, Ms. Rosenthal chose a $1,000 deductible with a relatively low $126 monthly premium for herself and her two young sons. Three months later, one son broke his leg. Right off the top, she had to pay $1,000 before the health plan picked up the remainder of her son's bills. 
 ''I got scared and went to a $250 deductible for the next year,'' said Ms. Rosenthal, who works as a research coordinator at Discover Vision Centers, an eye care chain. The premium was $326 a month that year, 2003. But it kept going up -- to $388 in 2004 and $440 for 2005, when she switched plans again. 
 ''I couldn't afford that,'' she said. So to reduce her monthly outlay, she gambled on a plan with a $2,500 deductible with a $230 monthly premium. 
 ''Last year, I came out ahead,'' Ms. Rosenthal said. ''With kids, you never know.''
 During her employer's enrollment period this year, for coverage beginning July 1, Ms. Rosenthal signed up for a $1,500 deductible plan with a $323.81 premium. Over the Fourth of July weekend, one son hurt his back playing baseball. Ms. Rosenthal quickly burned through her own $1,500 on a visit to an orthopedic surgeon and subsequent physical therapy.
 Because consumer-directed health plans have been around for only a short time and adopted by relatively few workers, it is hard to know yet whether they are meeting the goal of making people better consumers of health care. 
 The evidence ''shows that greater cost-sharing leads to reduction in health care use and expenditures,'' said Melinda Beeuwkes Buntin, an economist who led a study of the plans that was released last month by the research center Rand. ''But what we don't know is how this will affect overall health quality and patients' health.'' 
 That is why, despite the prospect of saving money on their employees' health benefits, many companies are also cautious, mindful that their workers could end up worse off. 
 ''Large employers are not rushing pell-mell into these products,'' said Peter V. Lee, the chief executive of the Pacific Business Group on Health, a San Francisco-based employer group. 
 During the enrollment season for 2006, only 7 percent of employers that offer health benefits made consumer-directed plans an option, according to a widely respected annual survey conducted jointly by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, which was released in late September. 
 The report estimated that fewer than three million workers and their dependents were enrolled in such plans. Many consultants and insurers say the numbers are actually much higher -- at least twice Kaiser's estimate -- but that would still be only a small fraction of the 70 million or so American workers covered by employer health insurance. 
 Last year, the Kroger supermarket chain, one of the first large companies to offer a consumer-directed plan linked to an individual health savings account, managed to persuade only 5 percent -- or 3,500 of its 70,000 eligible employees -- to sign up. To attract more employees in the current sign-up period, Kroger is adding a $500 match to employee contributions to the health savings account. 
 In an individual health savings account the annual contribution cannot exceed the plan's annual deductible. But it can grow tax-free until the money is withdrawn and can be added to year after year. And employees keep it, even if they change jobs. Nationally, employees have opened about 1.2 million accounts holding about $1.5 billion, according to a survey of 60 administrators of health savings plans by Steve Davis, managing editor of Inside Consumer-Directed Care, a trade newsletter. 
 ''We think health savings accounts give our associates a long-term interest in the economics of health care that wasn't there before,'' said Mike Stoll, vice president for corporate benefits at Kroger. 
 So that employees do not skimp on the preventive medicine that can stave off much more expensive health conditions, many of the plans provide 100 percent coverage for such basics as yearly physicals or annual mammograms. The insurer UnitedHealth Group is the leading provider of consumer-directed plans, with 1.8 million members. By combining financial incentives with the help people need to make better health care decisions, UnitedHealth said, its patients with chronic diseases who are enrolled have 12 percent fewer emergency room visits than those in traditional plans. 
 Even Kaiser Permanente, the health plan best known for its classic H.M.O.'s, plans to offer consumer-directed products in California next year. And Medicare, the federal insurance program, is experimenting with some form of health savings accounts in 39 states. 
 ''We're getting there,'' '' said Tracy L. Bahl, a UnitedHealth Group executive who manages health benefits for large employers. While adoption may be slower than anticipated, he said, ''the trajectory still remains positive.'' 
 The real attraction of the plans for employers is the potential savings. UnitedHealth points to its own study of 50,000 workers in these plans, which found that the average cost of care for members decreased 3 to 5 percent, compared with an increase of 8 to 10 percent in UnitedHealth's traditional plans. 
 Some employees are enthusiastic about consumer-directed coverage. About half the 5,000 eligible workers at the Visant Corporation, a printing and marketing company in Armonk, N.Y., are enrolled in a plan with a deductible of $1,000 for an individual and $2,000 for a family. 
 For Brian Hartman, a 36-year-old Visant finance executive, the company this year contributed $600 to a health reimbursement account -- a savings vehicle similar to a health savings account except that the employer keeps its contributed money if the employee leaves the company. For doctors in the network, the plan covers 90 percent of fees, and those fees are discounted for plan members. 
 Mr. Hartman said that his former health plan, a traditional preferred provider -- P.P.O. -- plan, with a $500 deductible for each member, had covered only 80 percent of doctor fees. That coverage ''was not so great,'' Mr. Hartman said.
 Now, ''I'm really impressed with the level of discounts at the different doctors we go to in the new plan,'' he said. ''We don't have a co-pay. There is no paperwork.''
 Other people in consumer-directed plans have been disappointed, though. Don Cohon of Muir Beach, Calif., tried the new approach and went back to more traditional coverage. 
 He switched back after an expensive bicycle accident in February 2005 that sent him to an emergency room. Even before he was examined Mr. Cohon incurred a $12,000 ''trauma activation fee.'' Although he spent less than three hours in the hospital, after X-rays, a CT scan and treatment for some bruises, his total bill came to $25,000. 
 Mr. Cohon, whose plan had a $2,500 deductible, was responsible for $6,200 of the charges. 
 He eventually managed to persuade the hospital to forgive the bulk of that amount. But he is now enrolled in a traditional plan offered by his employer, the Edgewood Center for Children and Families, a non-profit social services group. 
 ''It's much better coverage,'' he said. ''It's not a high-deductible.'' 
 Even for consumers who try to make careful use of the health care system because they are now paying a larger share of cost, high medical bills can be inevitable. ''It sounds good to say you need skin in the game,'' said Dr. Greg M. Silver, a family physician in Clearwater, Fla. 
 In his case, the ''skin'' was a plan with a $5,000 deductible. And he was careful to choose family doctors and a hospital that were in the plan's network -- the hospital where Dr. Silver was a department chairman. But when his son had to have an appendectomy at that hospital, he discovered that none of the specialists there were in the network. 
 Dr. Silver ended up depleting his health savings account to pay the $8,000 in medical bills he was responsible for. ''I learned the hard way,'' he said. 

Questions to Ask When Picking a Plan
 The calculus will vary, depending on the person's circumstances and the details of the health plan offering. But in trying to choose between a traditional plan and a consumer-directed one, here are some of the main issues to consider. 
 What health care services am I likely to use? If you have a chronic condition, add up the cost of drugs you take and doctors you see. Be sure to include the costs of any yearly checkups or tests. 
 How much of my health care costs am I responsible for? Carefully compare premiums, deductibles, co-payments and the maximum out-of-pocket amount you are liable for in a year. Some consumer-directed plans cap your personal outlays at lower levels than traditional plans.
 What is covered? A doctor or hospital out of the plan's network may cost much more in a consumer-directed plan, but if you stay in-network these plans may pay 100 percent of preventive care or even the drugs and doctor visits for a chronic condition.
 Can I save toward future health care costs? A health savings account linked to the plan, if that is an option, may help you build savings for an early retirement, and there are tax advantages. The plans can be even more attractive if the employer matches part of the contribution.
 How can I learn more? Ask your employer or the insurer for more information or links to Web sites that may provide further guidance in determining whether a specific plan is right for you.

HEADLINE: Dow Moves Back Below 12,000

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street ended a dismal week with yet another decline yesterday, after oil prices jumped on word of possible attacks in Nigeria near production sites. The rise in oil prices sapped enthusiasm over a Labor Department report that the unemployment rate fell to a five-year low.
 The Dow Jones industrial average logged its first six-day consecutive drop since June 2005 after crude oil rose $1.26, to $59.14, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. American diplomats in Nigeria warned that militants were planning a series of kidnappings and bombing attacks in the coming days in areas where oil is extracted. 
The Dow closed down 32.50 points, or 0.27 percent, to 11,986.04. It was the average's first close under 12,000 since Oct. 19, when it finished above that milestone for the first time.
 Broader stock indicators also closed lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.04 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,364.30. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.23 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,330.79.
 For the week, the Dow fell 0.86 percent, the S.& P. 500 lost 0.95 percent and the Nasdaq was off 0.84 percent.
 The Labor Department said the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent last month, from 4.6 percent in September, easing some concerns that the economy has slowed too quickly. 
 For more than a week, investors have been nervous about the strength of the economy after a stream of disappointing data. While Wall Street wants growth to cool so the threat of inflation will dissipate and the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates, a precipitous slowdown could slice into consumer spending and corporate profits.
 Though the 92,000 new jobs last month fell short of the 125,000 economists expected, figures for August and September were revised sharply higher. October was the third consecutive month that the unemployment rate showed a decline.
 Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist and director of asset allocation for Trusco Capital Management, said the employment figures suggested that the economy had more power than expected going into the holiday spending season but warned that the strength could make the Fed uneasy. 
 ''Investors have to digest the notion that the Fed is going to remain poised to lift interest rates as we go into 2007,'' Mr. Gayle said.
 The markets showed little reaction to a second dose of good economic news yesterday. The Institute for Supply Management, an organization of corporate purchasing executives, said its index of the service sector rose to 57.1 in October, from 52.9 in September; the reading was stronger than expected.
 Yesterday brought another batch of mixed earnings reports. Electronic Arts, the video game maker, reported stronger-than-expected results, while the grocery chain Whole Foods Market lowered its 2007 forecast.
 Electronic Arts rose $6.24, or 11.8 percent, to $59.24 after its fiscal second-quarter profit proved to be better than Wall Street expected, and the company raised its forecast for the year.
 Whole Foods, however, warned Wall Street that the coming year would be one of transition and that sales gains would probably moderate. Whole Foods fell $13.86, or 23 percent, to $46.26.
 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, the casual restaurant chain, fell $12, or 26 percent, to $34 after it reported a weaker-than-expected third-quarter profit and reduced its full-year forecast.
 Duke Energy fell 40 cents, to $31.06, after reporting that lower natural gas prices, plant problems and increased costs hurt third-quarter results.
 Yesterday's economic data sent bonds falling sharply. The price on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 30/32, to 101 8/32. 
 The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.71 percent, from 4.59 percent late Thursday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices rose.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Lesson No. 1: Home Is Not a Piggy Bank

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Economists are fond of pointing out that ''there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.'' But for several years, as interest rates have fallen, homeowners have gotten something pretty close to it.
 Anyone who had been diligently paying down a mortgage and others who had just sat back and watched their home appreciate in value were able to refinance and take out the difference between the value of the home and what was still owed, known as equity. Not only did they remove the increased equity in the home as cash, most people were paying lower monthly payments.
''People have literally picked up their house at the foundations and shook it upside down like a piggy bank,'' said Ed Smith, chief executive of the Plaza Financial Group, a mortgage brokerage firm in La Mesa, Calif., near San Diego.
 Since January 1999, according to figures compiled by Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and James Kennedy, a Fed staff economist, in a Federal Reserve Board paper, more than $2.62 trillion has been extracted by homeowners through refinancing and home equity loans. 
 But as rates have gone up, the extraction has continued. In the first six months of this year, even with interest rates rising, more than $511 billion was extracted from homes through cash-out refinancing and home equity loans, and that was more than the amount taken out for all of 2005, a record year for mortgage equity extraction.
 More homeowners did cash-out refinancings in the third quarter of this year than at any time since 1990, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. Many of them, Freddie Mac said, were scrambling to get out of interest-only mortgages that will soon reset at a higher interest rate.
 ''A lot of folks are squeezing out the last bit of equity from their homes,'' said Celia Chan, director for housing economics at Moody's economy.com. 
 Economists argue over what effect that money, which they call mortgage equity withdrawal, has had on consumer spending. Homeowners cash out to pay off more expensive credit card debt, remodel the house to build more equity, or just have fun. They may very well have used it to buy another house or not spent it at all, but added it to savings. Economists really are not certain.
 ''I guess it is one of those mysteries,'' said Christopher D. Carroll, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University. ''I don't think anyone knows what the answer is.'' 
 Nevertheless, mortgage equity withdrawal is closely watched as an indicator of the general economy because, Mr. Carroll said, ''there is a lot concern that a cooling housing market could result in a sharp fallback in consumer spending.''
 A recent paper that Mr. Carroll helped write contends that for every $1,000 change in housing wealth there is an immediate propensity to consume about $20 more. The wealth effect, as the phenomenon is called, is twice as high for housing wealth as it is for stock wealth, Mr. Carroll and his associates said. 
 Economists will argue for many years to come how much a decline in home prices damped consumer spending. But this much is already clear -- it is a lot more expensive to tap home equity. It is one reason economists predict consumer spending will slow in 2007 and even more in 2008. 
 The slowdown is already being seen in home remodeling. The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard found that over the last 12 months homeowners have spent only 1.6 percent more on remodeling projects than they did in the preceding 12 months. That rate was running at close to 20 percent throughout 2005 and the first four months of 2006.
 Homeowners with equity built up in their home can still get at it, but it is no longer free money. Unlike the situation five years ago, when a person seeking to refinance heard the same thing from nearly every mortgage broker and lender -- do it! -- now the advice is varied.
 The best thing to do in most cases is to leave the equity alone. No one expects home prices to appreciate sharply. A cautious consensus among economists is developing that prices will decline in some areas, but that the depreciation will not be sharp or prolonged. But should home values fall, a homeowner who has depleted the built-up equity risks finding himself paying a mortgage on a home that is worth less than the mortgage.
 There is another change in the market that could block a homeowner's desire to borrow against the increased value of the home. ''Lenders are being very cautious today as they do appraisals,'' said Patty McGill, president of Money Marketing, a mortgage broker in Frederick, Md. ''They are scrutinizing appraisals so they are not lending on phantom equity.'' 
 She said she had done very little equity extraction business recently. These mortgages carry higher interest rates than first mortgages because lenders view them as riskier. It is usually about two percentage points above the prime rate. Right now you can get one for about 9 percent to 10.25 percent compared with borrowing at about 6 percent on a fixed 30-year loan.
 Sometimes, and a homeowner has to analyze this carefully because it is not always the case, a homeowner might be better off refinancing the first mortgage than taking out the home equity loan, even if that means refinancing at a higher interest rate.
 If you have a mortgage at 5 percent, why would you give it up for an even larger one at 6 percent? Opinion is divided on this issue. Mr. Smith, for example, is an advocate of the ''blended rate,'' the marketing term lenders use for paying an interest rate that is higher than the one on the first mortgage, but lower than a second mortgage's. But the fact remains that it will cost homeowners more.
 ''If you reach out to tap equity, but can't afford to make the payments, what use is it?'' Mr. Smith asked. ''Most people's income has not grown to allow them to tap it. If you pull money out,'' you have to pay for it eventually. 
 Some mortgage brokers say that some homeowners become obsessed with the low interest rate they are paying on their first mortgage and do not realize that a new first mortgage might be cheaper than adding the home equity loan. ''We call that low rate the 'cocktail rate,' because it is the one people brag about at cocktail parties,'' said Neil Sweren, president of the mortgage brokerage company Allymac Mortgage Services in Owings Mills, Md. 
 He is recommending a 30-year loan, with the payments in the first 10 years being interest-only. Take a homeowner who borrowed $425,000 a number of years ago to buy a home that is estimated to be worth about $620,000. The homeowner has convinced himself that he should use about $75,000 of that increased value to fix up the house, where he intends to stay for 10 years. 
 The homeowner could pay about $562 a month to borrow the money in a home equity loan.
 In Mr. Sweren's plan, he would trade in the original $425,000 30-year loan with a fixed rate of 5.5 percent on which he had been paying $2,413 a month. He would borrow $500,000 at 6.5 percent. Under the new first mortgage, the monthly payments during the first 10 years would be $2,708, or $295 more than the old one, a 12 percent increase. 
 Of course, without the interest-only feature, that payment would be another $452 a month. 
 In the 11th year, the payment jumps to $3,727 a month for the next 20 years. In that period the entire loan must be paid off. The homeowner pays $567 a month more than he would have paid with a conventional 30-year loan.
 If it sounds like a losing proposition, you are not alone in that opinion. Still, Mr. Sweren said the larger the overall debt, the more sense it makes to arrange a refinance rather than a home equity loan. Most people are not going to go for deals like that and will leave the piggy bank undisturbed. 
 Ms. Chen, the economist, predicts that there will be a lot fewer equity withdrawals in 2007. ''I don't think there is a compelling reason to extract equity at this point,'' she said. ''People will just wait.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Hits 5-Year Low 

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The labor market for American workers is continuing to improve, the latest government statistics showed yesterday, with job growth advancing in recent months and the unemployment rate falling last month to the lowest level since May 2001.
 In a report that eased concerns that economic growth might be faltering, the Labor Department reported yesterday that the jobless rate, seasonally adjusted, dropped in October to 4.4 percent, from 4.6 percent in September.
 The government, in its initial estimate, said that employers added a modest 92,000 jobs last month -- but it revised the two previous months up so strongly that they outweighed any evidence of weakness. And economists suggested that the new numbers for October may not be any more reliable than the earlier initial estimates and could be revised higher once the Labor Department collects more information.
 ''What this report says is the job market is still going to be a source of strength for the economy,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist with PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. ''Concerns about the economy snowballing down the hill and picking up momentum as it heads for a crash landing are just not consistent with this kind of job data.'' 
 As employers added more people to their payrolls, paychecks are starting to improve as well. The average hourly wage gain in October surpassed inflation by the largest amount since early 2002.
 Adding to the picture of a strengthening job outlook, the amount of time unemployed Americans spend out of work has shrunk for the third consecutive month.
 As a result, economists predicted that the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates steady, with some now arguing that its next move may be up, rather than down.
 Coming just four days before the midterm elections, the new job numbers added fuel to the political debate.
 The Bush administration quickly trumpeted the low unemployment rate as evidence that its tax cuts have stimulated growth and claimed that a Democratic takeover in Congress could harm the economy.
 ''Now is the time to make these tax cuts permanent,'' said Rob Portman, the White House budget director. ''Otherwise, we put all this strong economic growth we're talking about at risk.''
 Democrats pointed to the rather tepid job growth figure from last month as a sign that the economy remains vulnerable. And they said that the tax cuts approved early in the Bush administration have little to do with today's economic performance.
 ''Job growth in October was too modest to allay concerns about whether job opportunities will expand in the coming months,'' Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said in a statement. ''Staying the course on the president's policies has failed to deliver greater prosperity and economic security for most families.''
 Labor market conditions are uneven, with the auto industry and housing cutting back, particularly in the Midwestern industrial belt, while government and most other business sectors show strength elsewhere in the country. 
 In general, though, workers are in their best shape in years. Until recently, wage increases had been trailing inflation. With overall price increases slowing as energy prices fall -- general prices are running at roughly 2 percent -- the 3.9 percent gain in hourly wages over the last year is beginning to go further. 
 Hourly wages rose in October by 15 cents, to $16.77, the government said.
 With greater tightness in the labor market -- beyond the low jobless rate, which only measures those actively in the labor market, the share of the working-age population that is employed also reached its highest point in five years. And economists said that many workers are beginning to enjoy more leverage with their employers.
 For their part, employers have been hiring at a more robust pace than first appeared. The government nearly tripled its estimate of job growth in September, to 148,000. It also revised August's numbers, to 230,000 from 188,000.
 But there were some signs of weakness, particularly in private- sector job growth. Government jobs last month accounted for nearly two-thirds of the reported 92,000 added jobs, a sign that some economists say is worrisome.
 ''We actually had a pretty hefty boost in government jobs,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a research organization in Washington. ''If you want the job machine to be humming, you've got to do a lot better in the private sector.'' 
 But Mr. Bernstein agreed that ''the job market is relatively strong.''
 ''Unemployment is low,'' he added, ''and we're finally generating wage gains that are likely to beat inflation.''
 Compared with the employment boom of the late 1990s, though, job growth remains relatively modest. Moreover, the percentage of the working-age population that is employed, at 63.3 percent, is still below the peak of 64.7 percent, set in April 2000. 
 The job outlook in housing and manufacturing has dimmed. Home builders are cutting back, eliminating an estimated 26,000 jobs last month. Manufacturers shed 39,000 jobs, led by the shrinking domestic automobile companies.
 The government jobs data, which is laid out in two separate surveys each month, provided a typically mixed picture.
 The household survey showed that employment growth was strong, while the payroll report, which has been repeatedly revised lately, suggested that it was more modest. They often send opposite signals in a given month, since one is based on hiring records while the other is based on a survey. Factors like self-employment, informal employment and people joining or dropping out of the labor pool can account for some of the differences.
 In October, the preliminary estimate of 92,000 new jobs from the business survey compared with an estimate of 437,000 new workers in the household survey.
 ''The truth is probably somewhere between the two,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief United States economist at Bank of America. ''But even if that is the case, it would suggest that the labor market is very strong.''
 The combination of a taut job market and rising wages will probably keep the Fed from cutting interest rates anytime soon, economists said. If anything, they said, it might raise them next year if the economy picks up steam. 
 ''The Fed can't possibly think of reducing rates with an unemployment rate that continues to sink,'' said Richard Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research. ''And the Fed can't truly justify lowering rates in this inflationary environment.''

Jobless Rate Fell in Canada
 OTTAWA, Nov. 3 (Reuters) -- A rush of hiring in the western oil fields pushed Canada's unemployment rate down to 6.2 percent in October, close to a 30-year low.
 Economic growth in the oil fields of Alberta helped create a larger-than-expected 50,500 new jobs last month, Statistics Canada said on Friday.
 October was the second consecutive month of job gains after a three-month downturn.
 ''A stunningly strong report,'' the chief strategist at TD Securities, Marc Levesque, said. ''Canada's job market still looks like it is plowing along at a pretty solid clip.''
 Some 15,000 factory jobs were lost nationwide, mostly in central Canada's manufacturing hub. Those losses were offset by more jobs in construction, education, business, building, public administration and other support services, the agency reported.

HEADLINE: Record Holds, for Now, In a Changed Ivy League

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
The most hallowed Ivy League career football record -- 4,715 yards rushing by Ed Marinaro of Cornell -- still stands after 35 years. Marinaro, a 56-year-old actor, admitted he would like his record to last forever. Any honest athlete would, he said.
 But Marinaro, the runner-up to Pat Sullivan of Auburn for the 1971 Heisman Trophy, has also adjusted his perspective. The Ivy League is different now. Teams play 10 games a season; they played nine until 1980. And athletes can play four years instead of three. 
''I would like to look at my record for what it was; it was a different era,'' Marinaro said recently in a telephone interview from his home in Los Angeles.
 Marinaro's record could fall as early as today, when running back Clifton Dawson and Harvard (6-1 over all, 3-1 Ivy League) play host to Columbia (3-4, 0-4). Dawson, a senior from Scarborough, Ontario, needs 174 yards to break the record.
 Dawson is no sure thing. Ten years ago, Cornell running back Chad Levitt was on a pace to break Marinaro's record with ease. But Levitt broke his arm in the next-to-last game of his senior season, only 58 yards shy of tying the record.
 Perhaps Dawson's record should carry an asterisk. This will be his 39th game at Harvard; Marinaro played 27 at Cornell. Marinaro had five 200-yard games as a senior; Dawson has three 200-yard games in his career, none this season.
 And yet, Dawson and Marinaro have a lot in common. Marinaro said he admired Dawson because he understood the circumstances under which Dawson has attained his yardage. Now, as then, Ivy League athletes carry a heavy academic load.
 ''It's a very small fraternity,'' Marinaro said, ''and one I'm proud to be a part of.''
 Dawson, an economics major, did not follow a conventional route to get this far. He was born in Canada and spent most of his childhood near Toronto, but for four years, he lived off and on with his father in Jamaica. He switched high schools twice, looking for academic challenges. 
 Harvard is Dawson's second college. He enrolled at Northwestern, then asked to be redshirted as a freshman so he could find a niche on campus. During a holiday break, he decided to give up an athletic scholarship and transfer to Harvard.
 ''I evaluated what I wanted out of college,'' Dawson said Thursday. ''I wanted to get the best education I could get.''
 Harvard Coach Tim Murphy, among others, was dumbfounded. Ivy League rosters do not have many transfer students. Dawson, one of 10 siblings, was not from a financially secure family, either.
 ''Quite frankly, we didn't get much of a sniff at him in high school; he wanted to play major college football at a good school, and Northwestern was a good choice,'' Murphy said.
 Dawson qualified for financial aid, and he showed up for training camp in August 2003. The Harvard coaches had not seen Dawson except on film.
 ''First practice, we said, 'Whoa! He's such an explosive back,' '' Murphy said. ''We got smart his second or third game here and made him the starter. What makes him such a great football player is that he's the most consistent, productive, durable player I've ever been around.''
 Dawson rushed for 1,187 yards as a freshman, setting an Ivy League record. As a sophomore, he set Harvard's single-season record with 1,302 yards rushing. He ran for 1,139 yards last season, becoming the Crimson's career rushing leader.
 Princeton, which had allowed 587 yards by Dawson in his first three games against the Tigers, held him to a season-low 64 yards Oct. 21 and outlasted the Crimson, 31-28. 
 ''We tried to keep as many people on him as we could,'' Princeton Coach Roger Hughes said.
 Murphy said that N.F.L. scouts had told him that Dawson, once regarded as a possible free agent, might be worthy of a draft choice. Dawson said he would like to play pro ball, but he planned to earn his degree first.
 ''Should things not work out professionally, I would have no regrets whatsoever,'' he said.
 Dawson said he would love to meet Marinaro, who parlayed his football success into an acting career. ''Just using football as a means to venture into other domains is interesting,'' he said.
 Marinaro, who regularly goes back to Cornell for fund-raisers and reunions, said that the Ivy League should be a model for all colleges. 
 ''You get guys who really want to be part of the whole experience,'' Marinaro said.
 That is why, more than three decades later, Dawson ended up at Harvard. Not everything in the Ivy League has changed.

HEADLINE: High Risk Cuts Champions' Careers Short

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Around 5:30 Saturday evening, the Breeders' Cup World Championships will be in the books, thoroughbreds in eight divisions will have been crowned and $20 million in purses disbursed. Immediately afterward, another lucrative but more melancholy contest will begin: the race to the breeding shed of some of the best horses the public barely had a chance to know.
 Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the $5 million Classic. If Bernardini, the 3-year-old sensation who has won six consecutive races, runs to his even-money odds and the victory in the marquee race, he will almost certainly be retired to stud at one of the breeding farms of his owner, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. 
If Invasor, a victor in eight of his nine career starts, comes home first, he is likely to be retired, too. He is owned by Sheik Mohammed's brother, Sheik Hamdan, who has his own formidable breeding operation, Shadwell Farm.
 George Washington is owned by the breeding organization Coolmore, and it has already decided the Classic will be the finale for the horse, a 3-year-old colt who has dominated mile grass races in Europe. 
 In fact, George Washington's trainer, Aidan O'Brien, admitted that the only reason they are running him on the dirt for the first time, at a mile-and-a-quarter distance that he has never tried, was to increase his value as a stallion.
 ''We felt like George had proved all he could prove on the turf,'' O'Brien said. ''He's run against all the best milers. He has nothing to prove by running a mile on the turf again. It's probably not fair to him, but it is our job to try and expose the horses as much as possible for the breeders.'' 
 Thoroughbred racing may be an old sport steeped in tradition, but it also is a fragile one increasingly prone to what-if situations. One example was in the Preakness Stakes when Bernardini ran alongside the Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro for about 15 seconds.
 Barbaro broke his right hind leg in those opening yards and will never race again. He is exceeding expectations, however, in what continues to be a recovery of many months from what is usually a fatal injury. Bernardini not only ended up winning the second leg of the Triple Crown, but he has proved to be a remarkably talented colt in what will also most likely be a brief career.
 Although the overwhelming outpouring of support for Barbaro reaffirmed the profound connection people can have with a racehorse, the careful handling of Bernardini is a reminder of how thoroughbreds also remain a valuable commodity.
 Sheik Mohammed, who has spent billions of dollars on the sport over the past 25 years, had Bernardini skip the Belmont Stakes in order to have a fresh horse for the summer and fall campaign in an effort to win Horse of the Year. If the plan succeeds, Bernardini will have little left to prove on the racetrack. 
 ''You can't blame them if they retire him,'' said the Hall of Fame trainer Bobby Frankel, who campaigned the 2004 Horse of the Year Ghostzapper. ''The economic risk is just too great. The Maktoums have invested a lot of money in the sport, and care about it. But just the insurance alone on the horse to race another year will cost millions of dollars. They can afford it, but a lot of owners cannot. And why gamble?''
 Frankel said Frank Stronach, the owner of Ghostzapper, took a great risk by bringing him back as a 5-year-old after his undefeated championship year. Stronach bucked a trend in which top horses are retired prematurely so their owners can cash in, he said, so fans could watch a preternaturally fast horse for a little longer.
 Frankel, however, said Stronach, an auto parts magnate, racetrack owner and breeder, did not add additional insurance for Ghostzapper. After his one and only race as a 5-year-old -- a smashing victory in the Metropolitan Mile -- a fractured bone was discovered in his left hind leg. 
 So Ghostzapper was sent to the breeding shed where he now commands $150,000 a coupling, which he can perform more than 100 times a year. That number often doubles for sires that are shuttled to countries like Australia to take advantage of the different mating season in the Southern Hemisphere.
 Tom Albertrani, the trainer of Bernardini, said he had not been told the sheik's plan for the colt. He was an assistant trainer to Bill Mott when Cigar won 16 consecutive races from 1994 to '96 and was twice named horse of the year. Cigar, who was owned by Allen Paulson, competed into his 6-year-old season.
 For months, Albertrani has said that Bernardini is as talented as Cigar. He has worked for Sheik Mohammed for the past year and believes he is as much a sportsman as Paulson. 
 Still, horse racing has changed. 
 ''It does seem that these great horses come along and just when the public gets to know them, they leave the racetrack,'' he said. ''It's just the way it is.''

HEADLINE: Marathoners Who Rest Better in New Jersey

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Hans Mensert traveled 3,600 miles from the Netherlands to take in the sights of every borough of New York City as he runs the marathon tomorrow. But as a prelude to his big day in the big city, he has been touring the hot spots of Secaucus, N.J.
 Mr. Mensert, a 6-foot-10 funeral director from Schiedam, a town near Rotterdam, is one of hundreds of foreign runners who have been bunking in Secaucus and other parts of New Jersey this week to avoid the high prices and after-dark intensity of Manhattan. 
 He and about 300 other Dutch men and women are filling rooms in three hotels in a retail and office complex a few miles west of the Lincoln Tunnel. Some 300 German runners and supporters have been staying in a Holiday Inn there.
 ''I always say New York City is the most wonderful town in the world, but when you want to sleep, go out of it,'' said Hans van Vliet, one of the leaders of Mr. Mensert's group. 
 Since Wednesday, they have been boarding buses for the short ride to Manhattan to shop, eat, attend shows and shop some more. But they have also been pumping money into businesses in northern New Jersey, like the discount outlets near Giants Stadium and the Jersey Gardens Mall near the Port of Newark.
 On Wednesday night, they took over Cheeseburger in Paradise, a Secaucus restaurant, where one of their own, D.J. Gertie, mixed traditional Dutch tunes. The restaurant's manager, Hector Reyes, said the lively Dutch crowd provided a nice boost on a normally quiet midweek evening and did not drive away any regulars.
 ''It definitely helped,'' said Mr. Reyes, who will play host to the group again tomorrow after the race.
 Tonight, thousands of marathoners are expected at Tavern on the Green in Central Park for the traditional pre-race pasta buffet. But for some staying the night in New Jersey, the Holiday Inn in Hasbrouck Heights is offering its own carbo-heavy buffet, said Sally Altman, the hotel's director of sales and marketing. The hotel will also open its restaurant at 5 a.m. on Sunday, adding pasta to the usual breakfast offerings to accommodate runners before they board buses for the starting point on Staten Island, she said.
 Ms. Altman said she had been attracting marathon tourists for years with the hotel's convenient location and lower prices. While they may be frugal, she said, they do not simply hole up in their rooms. 
 ''They might be saving money on a room in New Jersey, but they're spending it out in a mall,'' Ms. Altman said. ''They spend a lot of money, especially on food and drink.''
 Indeed, Mr. van Vliet, who is a radio anchor in Rotterdam, said he told his group members to take an empty suitcase for all the new clothes and electronics many would bring home. 
 With the dollar fairly weak against the Euro, the prices, even in Manhattan, are ''much cheaper than Holland,'' he said. He also tells his charges to sign up for a Macy's credit card for a 10 percent discount. 
 ''Everyone here has a Macy's card,'' Mr. van Vliet said yesterday, gesturing toward several dozen runners having breakfast and chattering in Dutch in a banquet room at the Holiday Inn in Secaucus. ''We love Macy's.''
 A study commissioned by the marathon's sponsor, the New York Road Runners Club, found that the typical runner spends nearly $2,500 during the week, including about $1,000 for lodgings, contributing to a total economic impact of $170 million.
 Of course, the bulk of that spending occurs in Manhattan, where hotels have been nearly filled all week with a mix of business travelers, Halloween revelers, attendees of the Latin Grammy Awards and the marathon crowd. Some of the runners have also spilled over into other boroughs.
 Kathy Duffy, a spokeswoman for the Marriott hotels in New York, said the Brooklyn Marriott, which opened 280 additional rooms a few weeks ago, filled 120 of them this week with runners from the Netherlands and 70 more with marathoners from Belgium. ''Across the board this looks like a busy week, but the marathon does help our weekend business,'' Ms. Duffy said.
 Even though his group is staying in a lower-rent spot across the Hudson, Mr. van Vliet said he thought those per-runner spending estimates sounded low. Mr. Mensert agreed. 
 He said his trip, including transportation, hotel and daily breakfast, had cost a little more than $2,000, and that did not include the shopping spree. Besides buying several CDs of Miles Davis that he could not find in the Netherlands, Mr. Mensert said, he had been haggling with merchants in Times Square over a Nikon digital camera he hopes to buy before leaving on Monday.
 ''They all started with $1,400, but one said, 'for my special friend, $1,100,' '' Mr. Mensert said over breakfast. He said he was still hoping to find a lower price.
 ''I came back just for the city, the audience, the atmosphere,'' said Mr. Mensert, who has run in the two previous marathons. ''It's amazing.''

HEADLINE: Prospect of a Job Lures, Then Frustrates, Thousands

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The call for job applications seemed routine; certainly nobody at corporate headquarters gave it much thought. A new candy store that would be opening in Times Square needed workers. Starting pay was $10.75 an hour.
 But by midmorning yesterday, a huge, swelling, discontented crowd of job seekers was milling around the sidewalks of Midtown Manhattan, not far from Macy's in Herald Square, filling the air with curses.
The crowd put a human face on jobless statistics at a time when the city's unemployment rate, 4.5 percent in September, was the lowest since 1988. 
 Several thousand people -- mostly young, black and Hispanic -- had shown up to apply for fewer than 200 positions, only 65 of them full-time jobs. They came, they said, because of a phrase that had leapt out of the advertisements for the jobs: ''on-the-spot hiring.'' But there were too many people clogging the sidewalk outside the building on Eighth Avenue between 35th and 36th Streets where the company was conducting interviews, and everyone was abruptly told to go home and mail in the job applications. 
 Tamika Jones, 28, a Brooklyn mother of three school-age children, looked at the faces of other disappointed job-seekers and said: ''This is what unemployment looks like in New York City. I wanted to cry.''
 Alphonzo Puzie, 31, from the Bronx, used to work in a laundry and is desperate for work. ''I was very disappointed,'' he said. ''It burns the spirit.''
 Many had arranged for baby sitters, traveled from other boroughs and New Jersey, and lined up as early as 1 a.m., only to be told eventually that there were no more jobs being offered that day.
 The doors to the building at 519 Eighth Avenue were supposed to open at 10 a.m., but because of the large crowd, officials opened them an hour earlier.
 Midtown South, the precinct house around the corner on 35th Street, dispatched traffic officers and officers on horseback because of the swelling crowds. 
 Sgt. Kevin Hayes, a Police Department spokesman, said, ''We responded to the location based upon the amount of people that had gathered.'' Four people were given summonses for disorderly conduct and released, he said. An ambulance was called for one man who had suffered an asthma attack.
 Mars Inc., the maker of M&M candies, is opening the store next month, at 1600 Broadway, at 48th Street, a few feet away from the store of its rival, Hershey's.
 Mars needs cashiers, receptionists, shippers, people to wear M&M costumes, and workers called ''customer service ambassadors.'' The starting pay, $10.75 an hour, is much higher than the state's $6.75 minimum wage.
 Newspaper advertisements and fliers promised more: ''medical, dental, vision, 401(k) plan, paid time off, tuition reimbursement plan, bonus potential and opportunity for growth.''
 The flier added, ''The Rewards Are Sweet!''
 ''Why did they make us wait out here so long?'' said Assana Lloyd, 24, of the Bronx. ''It was cold and windy.'' Young men and women stubbed out cigarettes on the sidewalks and complained bitterly.
 Jose Munoz, 19, of Queens, stood in line and lost out on a day's pay as a driver's helper for United Parcel Service. A part-time employee, he makes $8 an hour, he said, and hoped for a Mars position because ''this was a full-time job.'' 
 Not every applicant was young. Michel Ernest, 47, of Brooklyn, used to work in a recycling plant in Passaic, N.J. ''I want any kind of job,'' he said. ''I'll work in the kitchen if they have a kitchen.''
 Phil Levine, a spokesman for the Mars Retail Group, which is in charge of hiring for the Times Square store, said the company had been caught off guard by the turnout.
 ''Much to our surprise and amazement,'' he said, ''there were a lot more people who wanted to work for us than we expected.'' Mars had expected only several hundred applicants, and planned to spend six days filling the positions.
 Now it is rethinking its strategy and is asking everyone to mail in applications or apply online at www.mmsworld.com.
 Mars interviewed several dozen people and hired ''a handful'' before it suspended interviews, said Rebecca Cisek, a Mars spokeswoman.
 ''When the crowds became unmanageable,'' she said, ''it became clear we couldn't possibly talk to all these people.''
 Mars has two other M&M stores, in Las Vegas and Orlando, and did not have a similar job crush at those places. ''Most people would not have expected 5,000 to 6,000 to show up for a few hundred jobs,'' Mr. Levine said.
 Sunny Choudhry, owner of Creative Graphic & Sign Inc., saw the line curling in front of his shop at 36th Street and Ninth Avenue.
 ''All those people applying for that many jobs,'' he said. ''It's so sad that it's funny.''

HEADLINE: In Races for Governor, Party May Be Secondary 

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Katie Kelley contributed reporting from Denver.

 BODY:
A few of this year's 36 governors' races have been buffeted by the fierce winds blowing out of Washington over the question of which party will control Congress. But many more have been focused on the traditional state-centered issues that have little to do with party: personal popularity, the local economy, education and the environment. 
 Though Democratic candidates are expected to fare better than Republicans, political scholars and party strategists all over the country say the governors' races are often out of sync with the broader national trends.
 Some candidates, like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in California, a Republican, have swerved to the left in seeking re-election. Meanwhile, some Republicans, including Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. of Maryland, have argued that a Republican in the governor's chair is exactly what voters should want this year to check a Democratic-controlled legislature. 
 The select club of 50 governors is an increasingly potent force, set apart in the nation's political system, many scholars say, and moving to its own rhythms outside the thrum of partisan Washington combat. As the two major national parties have become more ideologically separated and locked in their positions, the governors -- who must continually compromise and moderate their positions -- are less constrained by the party labels that come after their names. 
 That makes governors' races harder to assess, but it also explains why their ranks have become such an incubator for presidential hopefuls in recent election cycles. Compared to Congressional candidates, governors look like individuals and less like party functionaries peeking from pigeonholes. 
 In Connecticut, one of the most Democratic states in the national vote, voters are almost certain to retain Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican who took office in 2004 after a corruption scandal forced her predecessor, John G. Rowland, from office. In Tennessee, Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, has been more than 35 points ahead of his Republican opponent in recent polls -- even as the closely watched Senate race between Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., a Democrat, and Bob Corker, Republican and former mayor of Chattanooga, has been locked in dead heat. 
 In Rhode Island, Senator Lincoln Chafee, a Republican, has been consistently behind in the voter surveys even as the Republican governor, Donald L. Carcieri, has surged ahead of his challenger.
 ''Governors are concretely responsible for practical things, and the closer you get to the ground and more concrete the discussion is, the less polarized it tends to be,'' said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies local and state government.
 ''The Democratic wave is cresting and breaking very selectively,'' Mr. Galston added.
 That is not to say that Democrats are bracing for bad news on Tuesday, or that Republicans are preparing Champagne, but few people are expecting a sweep of 1994 dimensions. That year, the Republicans gained eight governors' seats in a single election night and sent two Democrats who had occupied the national stage, former Govs. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Ann W. Richards of Texas, heading for the exits. Ms. Richards was defeated by a Republican upstart named George W. Bush.
 This year, most experts are predicting a gain of at least five seats by the Democrats -- all in open seats created by term-limit retirements -- with that party's best hopes in Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York and Ohio. In Colorado, for example, Bill Ritter, a Democrat and the former district attorney in Denver, has been consistently ahead of his Republican opponent, Representative Bob Beauprez, in voter surveys, showing strength even in areas of the state that do not traditionally support Democrats.
 Other governors' races are being classified as tossups by nonpartisan groups like The Cook Political Report, including Iowa's, which has an open seat created by the retirement of Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat considering a race for president, and Minnesota's, where Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, has struggled to a tie with his challenger in voter surveys. 
 But a net gain of five new seats, assuming no losses elsewhere, would give the Democrats a majority of governors for the first time since 1994, and the leading voice in groups like the National Governors Association. Complicating the predictions for both parties are voters like Theresa Wagner of Minnesota and Shawn Frost of Colorado.
 Ms. Wagner is a 32-year-old research scientist and registered Republican living near Minneapolis who said she was undecided a week before the election.
 ''This year, to be quite honest, I'm not sure I'm not going to be voting Republican across the board, and the governor's race is one of them where I haven't made up my mind,'' she said in an interview at the Minneapolis airport, where she was waiting to catch a flight.
 Ms. Wagner said she voted in 2002 for Mr. Pawlenty, but thinks that he has become too close in his policies to the Bush administration and that his no-new-taxes pledge has hurt local education.
 Mr. Frost, 30, who was having lunch with his wife at a crowded sandwich shop in downtown Denver, said he was planning to vote for Mr. Beauprez in part because he wanted to defend the Republican Party from attack.
 People who follow state governments say that factors are in play this year that might appear to have little or nothing to do with votes and politicking, but that under the surface are huge and probably helping Democrats.
 The federal government has encroached on the traditional powers of the states in recent years like the complicated rules of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 and a Congressional overhaul of the court system that shifted power in handling class-action lawsuits toward the federal judiciary and away from the states. 
 Six states also have on their ballots voter referendums that would raise the minimum wage, and many backers of those measures have made overtly anti-Washington, anti-Republican pitches to voters, criticizing Congress for failing to act.
 All those issues, and perhaps as well the money that can be raised from groups like state trial lawyers' associations that want business back in state courts, are nudging governors toward independence this year, regardless of party.
 ''The tensions get aggravated because you have such a conservative Congress, and most governors not that conservative -- they're pragmatic,'' said John Kincaid, a professor of government and public service at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa. ''So even if a Republican governor won't necessarily oppose the president, he will go the other way.''
 The No Child Left Behind law is particular unpopular in Arkansas, for example, according to voter surveys. Its association with the Bush administration is not helping Asa Hutchinson, the Republican candidate for governor, a former congressman and a senior official in the Department of Homeland Security, said Todd Shields, the director of the Diane D. Blair Center of Southern Politics and Society at the University of Arkansas.
 ''There's been a string of issues that have been very difficult for Republicans here to campaign on,'' Mr. Shields said.
 Governor Schwarzenegger of California, who has been leading in voter surveys going into the election, said that the federal government was failing to protect the environment and that action by the state was the only course. 
 In Wyoming, Gov. Dave Freudenthal, a Democrat who appears to be heading for easy re-election in a heavily Republican state, said this week that his staff would hold meetings in the month to discuss the impact of an energy corridor for electricity transmission lines that federal land managers have proposed in the western part of the state.
 In New York, Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat who has been far ahead in voter surveys in his race for governor, has embodied the anti-Washington stance most of all, many experts say, having made his reputation as the state's attorney general by pursuing white-collar criminals and saying federal regulators had failed to catch them.

Governors' Races to Watch
Thirty six states will elect governors on Tuesday. In some places, Republicans are struggling against what voter surveys suggest will be a Democratic wave, but in other states, Democrats are not in the lead. The one certainty is that every race is different. Here's a sampling. Incumbents are in bold type. KIRK JOHNSON

Alaska
A former Democratic governor, Tony Knowles, is in a close race against Sarah Palin, a Republican banker and the former mayor of a town near Anchorage. This being Alaska, the race features energy issues, including which candidate has the best shot of getting a big natural gas pipeline built. An independent candidate, Andrew Halcro, a Republican former state legislator, has picked up support, partly at Ms. Palin's expense.

Arkansas
President Bush and other administration heavyweights have repeatedly campaigned on behalf of Asa Hutchinson, the Republican candidate who was a member of Congress and a senior Homeland Security official. But Attorney General Mike Beebe, a Democrat, seems to have trumped those efforts. State surveys show Arkansas residents are not happy with Washington Republicans, and recent polls show Mr. Beebe ahead by at least 15 points.

Idaho
Idaho has been among the most Republican states in national elections, but voters seem undecided between the Democratic candidate, Jerry Brady, a newspaper publisher, and three-term Representative C.L. Otter, a Republican. Mr. Otter has been hurt in some heavily Mormon areas by a revival of what he calls old history: a drunken driving arrest many years ago and his victory in a ''tight jeans'' contest in a Boise bar. But Mr. Brady has not gained much traction linking Mr. Otter to the Bush administration.

The theme here has been checks and balances, with Gov. Robert L.

Most voter surveys show his opponent, Mayor Martin O'Malley of Baltimore, with the slimmest of leads, and he can take no comfort in the many voters who expressed anger at Republicans but also said they like the governor and think he has done a pretty good job.

Figures are based on telephone polls conducted among likely voters except in Arkansas and Colorado where the polls were conducted among registered voters. Likely voters are identified in different ways by different polling organizations, usually by factors like registration, stated intention to vote, past voting behavior and interest in the campaign. The margin of sampling error for the polls range between plus or minus 4 and 5 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Seeing the Climate Policy for the Trees

BYLINE: By Stuart E. Eizenstat. 
Stuart E. Eizenstat was the chief American negotiator of the Kyoto Protocol as an under secretary of state in the Clinton administration. He is on the advisory board of Sustainable Forestry Management.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THERE is a little recognized but vital element to re-engaging the United States in solving the problem of global climate change: forests. Creating financial incentives to protect forests and promote tree planting would be attractive to poor nations but also to American companies and farmers, giving the United States government a potent political reason to get involved in international climate policy. 
 And time is running out. The recent British-commissioned report by Sir Nicholas Stern emphasized the urgency of strong action now -- from all countries -- to avoid massive economic disruption in future decades. One major obstacle preventing American participation in an international climate regime is the lack of binding commitments on the part of developing countries. This is where forestry comes in. 
The Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions recognized the need to finance climate-friendly projects in developing countries. This was the rationale behind the Clean Development Mechanism, which was set up to grant tradable credits to approved projects, and which can be used to satisfy a country's Kyoto commitments by offsetting its greenhouse gas emissions. 
 The Kyoto signatories expressly limited land use and forestry projects that can get credits to those involving afforestation (tree planting on non-forested land) and reforestation (tree planting on previously forested land). This last-minute compromise, driven principally by the negotiation dynamics at the time, effectively disqualifies important efforts to reduce the rate of deforestation (and thereby reduce the emissions from such activity) in developing countries because such efforts are not eligible to receive credits under Kyoto.
 The European Union's emissions trading scheme, which provides the chief Kyoto compliance mechanism for the union's members, has gone even further, excluding all forestry credits, including those from afforestation and reforestation projects.
 This has created a huge and inexplicable gap in international climate policy: deforestation from burning and cutting alone is responsible for as much as 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is also grossly unfair to the large numbers of rural poor in undeveloped countries who depend upon forests for their livelihood. They are among the most vulnerable to the harm wrought by climate change and would be most responsive to economic incentives favoring sustainable forest management.
 World Bank studies show that forestry projects give local people and their governments a critical incentive to manage their landscape sustainably. Concerns regarding forestry credits -- whether they were truly leading to the reduction of carbon emissions -- are already being addressed by the Clean Development Mechanism's board, which continues to approve guidelines to assure their environmental integrity, and through negotiations among the Kyoto parties.
 Providing credits for protecting existing forests and other land use practices not eligible under Kyoto, as well as expanding the use of already permitted forestry credits, is clearly consistent with the objectives of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and with Kyoto, under which industrial countries commit to promoting ''sustainable forest management practices, afforestation and reforestation.''
 Most important, the additional income that poorer countries would receive from expanded use of forestry offsets could motivate their participation in a post-2012 regime. The recently formed Coalition of Rainforest Nations (a group of 15 developing nations) advocates expanding forestry credits to include efforts to protect existing forests. China and India both have significant interests in extending economic growth to their rural poor, controlling and reversing the spread of deserts, restoring depleted watersheds and expanding their domestic forestry industries -- all of which could benefit from further integration into the carbon markets.
 This issue will be discussed at the climate change meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, next week, and may provide a crucial first step for developing countries to agree to binding emissions reductions in any future international regime. There are also opportunities for the United States, the most notable abstainer from Kyoto. A more expansive approach to forestry offsets under any domestic program would help American companies play a role in reducing emissions by giving them additional flexibility in meeting targets.
 American farmers would also find this attractive as they look for new sources of revenue at a time when there are pressures to reduce domestic agricultural subsidies. Like the Soil Bank program of the 1950s, which resulted in extensive tree planting on marginal agricultural lands by paying farmers to ''bank soil,'' forestry credits could offer a new revenue stream for American farmers willing to ''bank carbon'' by planting trees. 
 The growing domestic consensus for action was punctuated most recently with the announcement by Govs. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and George Pataki of New York that California's greenhouse gas reduction program would be tied to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative being started by seven Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. 
 But this patchwork of programs is far from enough. Without re-engagement at the federal level, there is a limit to the role that the United States can play. Given the scale of the effort required to tackle climate change, we need to pursue real emissions reductions anywhere we can find them. As long as forestry credits meet strict standards to ensure their environmental integrity, they offer a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cheaply, while at the same time providing an incentive for developing nations and the United States to join in combating the greatest environmental threat to our planet.

HEADLINE: Chancellor Cites Stark Favoritism At a Top School 

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN

 BODY:
With its exceptional students, multitude of field trips and fund-raising parents, the New Explorations Into Science, Technology and Math school is widely admired as an oasis in the New York City school system, more like an elite private school than the public school it is. 
 But the Department of Education says that is precisely the problem, at least when it comes to admissions.
Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said the school's practices were a ''stark and different'' example of the kind of favoritism that he has been trying to eliminate from the city's array of coveted schools and gifted programs.
 Officials say an examination of the school's most recent kindergarten admissions documents shows that school officials were looking not only at students' performance, but also at how involved their parents were likely to be. 
 A child who scored 58 out of a perfect 88 was accepted with the written note, ''Mom has a great vision,'' while an applicant with a 59 was rejected, with the comment, ''Mom is pregnant with number 3, did not feel she could juggle her life for our vision.'' In other examples, a child who scored 64 was accepted -- ''Mom works here,'' said a notation -- while one with a 66 was rejected, with notes that the parent interview was ''vague,'' as ''Dad had limited English.''
 It is not clear that the comments about the parents were the decisive factors in any acceptances or rejections. But Education Department officials say parents' qualities should not have been considered at all.
 ''In my view, public schools do not interview family members for admission to public schools, period,'' Mr. Klein said in an interview yesterday. ''It turns out they were doing it.'' 
 Mr. Klein's campaign to make school admissions equitable and more transparent has drawn the ire of many middle-class parents who say he is meddling with programs that help keep thousands of families from abandoning the public schools. But his supporters have charged that some of the programs discriminate against black and Hispanic children. 
 Mr. Klein said he believed the practices at the New Explorations school, which has kindergarten through 12th grade and is known as NEST, were unique in the city. ''However, I do think favoritism based on who you know is something that has existed, and we have done everything we can to try to make the process based on the merits and immune from favoritism,'' he said. 
 A core group of parents active in NEST's PTA say the school has often been singled out for scrutiny because of its high standards, its tendency to buck the system and, most recently, their own success last year in scuttling a plan by Mr. Klein for the school to share its Lower East Side building with a charter school.
 After the parents filed a lawsuit and held news conferences and rallies, Mr. Klein relented on the charter school. He installed a new principal at the same time, though, and the school's founding principal, Celenia Chevere, retired under pressure.
 Education Department officials say the notations on candidates for the school were made by Ms. Chevere or her staff members. She did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
 Now, a group of parents are rebelling against the new principal, Olga Livanis, saying she is destroying the school's special nature. 
 Among their complaints are that Dr. Livanis eliminated single-gender math and science classes for high school students, increased class sizes, spread the college adviser too thin and slashed the amount of time devoted to community-building. They say she is constraining them and teachers with bureaucracy, insisting, for example, that teachers fill out paperwork after collecting money for field trips and questioning the parents' practice of paying teachers for baby-sitting during PTA meetings. 
 At a meeting last week, nine members of the PTA executive committee resigned in protest against the changes. When eighth graders started speaking against the principal, other parents said they were being used, and the meeting became so heated that the police were called to break it up. On Monday, the Department of Education began an audit of the PTA's finances. 
 In a phone interview, Dr. Livanis stood by many of her changes. She said it did not make sense to have high school classes with a handful of students, that the college counselor still had a manageable load and that she was only following department regulations regarding paperwork.
 She expressed hope that parents critical of her moves would come around and noted that she had received support from many others. ''I feel like I've made very minor changes in accordance with what's expected with regulations,'' she said. ''I would like to get across to people that I am here for the education of their children.'' 
 She declined to speak about how the admissions process worked previously but said that from now on parents would not be interviewed. 
 Officials at the Department of Education said that the school's prior practices could not be defended and made available a supervisor's report on the admissions process to prove their point. The report said that the school's offers of acceptance were ''in clear violation'' of its obligation to accept students in ''rank order'' based on factors like test results and observed activities. 
 The officials said the focus on parents was only part of what was wrong with the process. They also said the school improperly screened out some kindergarten applicants instantly based on preschool reports, without allowing them through the normal testing and interview process. They also found that in some cases, the applications of rejected children noted that they had special needs.
 ''Student has serious health concerns -- not a match'' read a comment pertaining to one rejected applicant with a score of 61, higher than a number of children who got offers. 
 Of the 211 applications reviewed, the very top scorers were admitted and the very lowest were not. The discrepancies occurred among the bulk of those ranked in the middle.
 Emily Armstrong, one of the PTA members who recently resigned and who helped Ms. Chevere found the school, described the comments, as related to her by a reporter, as ''irrelevant in light of the thousands of kids who got put through the admissions process'' over the years. 
 Ms. Armstrong described NEST as a school that takes equal pride in the hundreds of thousands of dollars its PTA has raised over the years and the fact that students who cannot afford extras like the senior trip to Europe are quietly subsidized by those who can. 
 ''I know the different countries, languages, races, economic levels, family situations, nationalities that the NEST kids were; they were from all over the place,'' she said. ''I think you would find that at any kind of school -- private, public, college -- you're going to find people who have incredibly close scores who are going to contest them.'' 
 During the 2004-5 academic year, the school population was described as 52.6 percent white, 8 percent black, 20.4 percent Hispanic and 19.1 percent Asian and other. 
 Despite the criticism of Dr. Livanis, some parents want to give her a chance. Mark Alhadeff, who fought alongside Ms. Armstrong and others against sharing space with the charter school, said it was time for parents to get off their ''war footing,'' saying that while NEST was great last year, it could be improved. 
 ''I've come to interpret Dr. Livanis as a peace offering from Joel Klein,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Athletes Get New College Pitch: Check Out Our Tutoring Center

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Chris McFoy, a wide receiver at the University of Southern California, answers to about half a dozen coaches. Off the field, his coaching staff has been much larger. 
 Like many U.S.C. athletes, Mr. McFoy has had a lot of help during his five years as a student. During his freshman season, he met weekly with four tutors, one for each of his classes. He also met with a learning specialist who composed ''action plans'' to organize his schedule and help him plan for tests and papers. U.S.C. and most other N.C.A.A. Division I-A universities also use student ''class checkers'' who traverse campus to make sure athletes are where they are supposed to be.
''There's no way that you should do bad,'' said Mr. McFoy, a 23-year-old senior. ''You have to really not care about your grades, or your life in general, to mess up.''
 Bigger stadiums and better training facilities are no longer enough to attract some of the most talented football prospects. The competition to create a top athletic program now extends to efforts that help ensure that players survive in class. 
 Louisiana State University, a perennial championship contender, spent $15 million to build an academic center for athletes. The University of Georgia, another top-10 football program, built a new facility for $7 million. At Temple University, long home to one of the nation's worst football programs, officials increased the academic support budget for athletes by 34 percent in the aftermath of poor academic performance that led to scholarship losses.
 All of the nation's more than 100 major college athletic departments employ some type of academic support program. So do some Ivy League colleges and other smaller institutions. The National Collegiate Athletic Association said Division I athletic departments spend at least $150 million annually on such programs. 
 Few in college athletics doubt the importance of helping student athletes succeed. But while college officials say these programs are necessary because athletes must devote so much time to their sports, few other students whose time is consumed by jobs or activities receive as much assistance. Another issue is oversight: The educational support centers often report to the athletic director, who has an interest in keeping athletes eligible to compete, instead of to the academic leadership. 
 ''I think that the people who work in it should be working for the provost,'' said Jim Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten Conference. 

Investing in Support
 U.S.C. spends $1.5 million annually on tutors and other academic support for its student athletes, more than most programs. The university has 14 1/2 staff positions in its Student Athlete Academic Services Department, having added four positions in the past six years, to serve its 550 student athletes. 
 ''We're looking for every opportunity to get ahead,'' said Pete Carroll, the football coach.
 Louisiana State's academic center for athletes opened in 2002 and has a corporate sponsor, Cox Communications. A review in Architectural Record called the ornate design by Victor Trahan III ''sleek,'' ''inspiring'' and ''almost monastic in character.''
 Georgia's $1.3 million budget for academic tutoring for its roughly 600 athletes is the same amount that the university spends on its centralized campus tutorial program for its 25,000 undergraduate students. Dell Dunn, the university's vice president for instruction, said the budget for all of Georgia's tutoring services outside athletics rose by $200,000 when programs in individual departments were included. 
 Georgia's center for athletes, which was built in 2002, features rows of computers, plush furniture and an electronic check-in system to make sure athletes put in their minimum study hours. The center has 17 full-time staff members and more than 60 tutors.
 ''It's getting competitive -- that's one of the reasons why we have this center,'' said Becky Galvin, an academic counselor and tutorial coordinator at Georgia. ''The coaches started hearing from kids that so-and-so had a nicer academic center. We had a good academic program, but we didn't have all the bells and whistles.''
 New N.C.A.A. rules can reduce the number of scholarships for colleges whose student athletes do not meet minimum academic standards, a change that has fueled the building boom and budget increases for academic centers. The money usually comes from the athletic department, from ticket sales and television deals, and from the N.C.A.A. 
 On some campuses, tutoring programs have run into trouble recently. At the University of South Carolina, the senior associate athletic director for academic support arranged for tutors for junior college players not yet enrolled at the university. 
 At the University of Tennessee in the late 1990s, a tenured English professor, Linda Bensel-Meyers, found that athletic tutors were doing too much of the work themselves and that the athletic department had the influence to change grades. Bensel-Meyers was ostracized for bringing her findings public, and she later left for the University of Denver. 
 ''Based on my experiences, I would have to say that athletic academic assistance centers serve more as academic evasion centers,'' Ms. Bensel-Meyers said. 
 Many universities have developed training and monitoring programs for tutors, and rules govern how much assistance they can provide. For example, tutors at Tennessee cannot type papers for athletes. Most universities make the tutors sign an integrity contract saying they will not perform work for athletes. 

Teaching Independence
 At Southern California, Mr. McFoy is a success story. He graduated after four years with a degree in economics and, in his fifth year on campus, is pursuing a double major in political science as he plays football as a ''redshirt'' senior. 
 Magdi el-Shahawy, U.S.C.'s director for student athlete academic services, said Mr. McFoy's experience was ideal. He did well enough eventually to be excused from mandatory team study halls, and he no longer required tutors for all of his classes. 
 ''Our goal in this profession is to create independent, self-regulated learners and teach them what they need to survive,'' Mr. Shahawy said. 
 Mr. Shahawy's program includes about 50 tutors, all of whom are students, in addition to the 14 1/2 staff positions. He reports to both the provost and the athletic director. 
 Mr. McFoy said his academic career had not been without incident. Once or twice, he said, he was fined $10, which was taken from his athletic stipend, for missing an appointment with a tutor. 
 Even though his grade-point average was high enough that tutors became unnecessary, he sometimes continued with them anyway. ''I knew that they would help motivate me,'' Mr. McFoy said. ''Why not? It's free.''
 Mr. Carroll tries to make academics competitive, like football. U.S.C. has instituted a points system in which athletes can get in trouble with their coaches if they are not attending class or handing in assignments. 

Taking Action at Temple
 Colleges without the money to pay for such programs can find it harder to recruit and to compete. The struggles at Temple, a public university in Philadelphia, illustrate what can happen.
 Last year, the university's football program lost nine scholarships because of its athletes' academic shortcomings, the most of any Division I-A program. In what Temple's athletic director, Bill Bradshaw, called ''crisis management,'' he said all five Temple academic counselors either resigned or were notrehired for their positions. That led to an overhaul that included luring a counselor from Notre Dame and the 34 percent budget increase for academic support. 
 ''How does Wendy's succeed when it doesn't have McDonald's budget?'' said Temple's coach, Al Golden. ''We have to be creative.''
 Formal academic support for college athletes traces back to 1964, and as with just about every major development in college sports, money was a factor. 
 The president of Notre Dame at the time, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, asked the fencing coach and engineering professor, Mike DeCicco, to start a program to tutor student athletes. 
 Television money had become important in college football, and Father Hesburgh worried that universities might sacrifice academic integrity to keep players eligible so they would have strong teams to cash in on television payouts. 
 To keep that from happening at Notre Dame, Mr. DeCicco began tracking the progress of athletes in class through contact with their professors. If players missed classes, Mr. DeCicco would threaten them with the fencing saber hanging over his desk. 
 A few years later, Sports Illustrated described Mr. DeCicco's program in an article on Notre Dame's high graduation rate. Calls and visitors came from places like Arizona State, Kentucky and Michigan. 
 ''It was like someone had opened the faucet,'' Mr. DeCicco said. 
 The career of one Temple linebacker, Leyon Azubuike, a redshirt sophomore, shows the difference the right people can make. In less than a year, Mr. Azubuike has gone from a struggling student with a 1.8 grade-point average, on the brink of becoming ineligible, to a confident student with a 2.2 average.
 When Mr. Golden was hired last December, he made his entire staff build two and a half hours into their daily schedules to help the players personally, with a special focus on academics. 
 Mr. Golden took the pool table out of the players' lounge and replaced it with more computers. 
 He posted a list of players not attending class or handing in assignments on the door of the Temple football facility for everyone to see. He takes one shift a week himself to check players' classes personally. 
 He made his players get to know their professors, sit in the front row, and not wear hats to class. ''If you're not going to class, you're going to be suspended,'' Mr. Golden said.
 Temple increased its academic support staff to nine from six. Peter D'Alonzo, the lead coordinator and a learning specialist at Temple, installed the same program he used at Notre Dame. Freshmen are now mentored by students in Temple's law school. Students below a 2.4 average are given mandatory study hours and intensive tutoring; Mr. D'Alonzo compared it to doing homework in front of Mom and Dad at the kitchen table.
 Mr. Golden said ''incredible doesn't do justice'' to the academic turnaround. The team had a grade-point average of more than 3.0 during one session of summer school, and Mr. Bradshaw said the university expected to increase its Academic Progress Rate, the measure the N.C.A.A. uses to gauge progress of student athletes. 
 But Mr. D'Alonzo is pushing for the tutorial staff to report only to the provost. Noting that the athletic department has an interest in keeping athletes eligible to compete, he said, ''It's entrapment.'' 
 Mr. Azubuike had failed the most basic math course, Math 45, offered by Temple. He credited the new football staff with giving him the confidence and guidance to get a B in the course the second time. He said he was on pace for a B in Math 55, ''something I never could have imagined before.''
 He is looking forward to raising his average even more by retaking a few classes this summer. 
 ''The biggest difference to me was their love for the student athlete transcended football,'' he said. ''I've been in few situations where the coach cares as much for you personally and academically as they do athletically.''

A Busy Day in the Life
 U.C.L.A.'s athletic department spends more than $1.5 million a year on academic services for athletes. Even the brightest athletes, like the freshman cornerback Alterraun Verner, who had a 4.15 grade-point average in high school, take advantage of them. Many college students are busy with jobs and other activities, but officials say that athletes often require special academic help because of the heavy demands on their time. Here is a look at a typical day for Verner.

After a 9 a.m. weight-lifting session, Verner, center, showers and heads to class. Despite getting A's in both of his summer classes, Verner meets with tutors for all three of his classes. ''The tutors help make up for the time that we don't have.''

After a history lecture, Verner settles into his second class, English 3. Today's theme, sentences, parallels the twists of Verner's day. ''Every word has a function and a reason to be there,'' says Lisa Gerrard, center, the lecturer.

Verner hustles from class to his mandatory training-table lunch, where check-in is required. Halfway through his plate of chicken, steak and potatoes, he checks his watch, ditches his lunch and hustles off to a meeting. ''Time be a flyin','' he says.

At the special-teams meeting, the coach, John Wristen, gives a spirited talk using curious phrases like ''Zorro'' coverage and ''protecting the cup'' and pleading, ''Be my policeman.'' He lays out everything in 15 minutes.

Three meetings spill into an intricately planned, two-hour practice. ''It's really like they have two full-time jobs,'' U.C.L.A.'s senior associate athletic director, Petrina Long, says of the balancing act between football and classes.

The hourlong tutoring session for Verner's Education 92F class is taught by Joel Hurwitz, left, a U.C.L.A. senior who wears a Spider-Man shirt and a baseball cap. Verner then heads to the library for a few hours to finish two essays.

HEADLINE: Russia Offers Changes to U.N. Resolution on Iran's Nuclear Plans

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Russia on Friday submitted a broad revision of a draft resolution designed to curb Iran's nuclear program, and the United States promised counterproposals, casting talks on the subject into increasing doubt and delay. 
 An hourlong meeting of ambassadors from the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany ended with no discussion of specifics, and a decision to circulate the amended drafts among the six governments, said John R. Bolton, the American ambassador.
 ''In light of the extent of the Russian changes, we decided that we'll refer all these back to capitals and meet again at some later date, and that's basically all we decided,'' he said.
 The United States has pressed for speedy action, but Russian and Chinese reluctance to impose broad sanctions on Tehran is expected to carry the talks into the coming weeks.
 The working draft, drawn up two weeks ago by Britain, France and Germany, responds to an earlier Council resolution demanding that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment activities by Aug. 31, a deadline that Tehran ignored.
 The resolution would prohibit any technical or financial assistance that could benefit Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, freeze the assets of any Iranians involved in nuclear activities and bar them from international travel.
 Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, said his government objected to the proposed sanctions and wanted the measure to be redrawn to encourage the Iranians to return to talks on its nuclear program.
 He said Russia, which is helping to build Iran's first nuclear power plant, at Bushehr, agreed that the resolution ought to ''preclude'' the possibility that countries assisting Tehran end up providing the means to produce weapons.
 ''But at the same time,'' he said, ''another key element of our philosophy is that it should leave the doors open for our talks with Iran and should not contain things that have no useful purpose and lead people away from the goal of a negotiated outcome to this complicated nuclear program issue.''
 Earlier in Moscow, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei I. Kislyak, said that the draft required ''major fine-tuning.''
 Although officials in Russia have expressed concern about a nuclear Iran, they have strenuously objected to imposing sanctions. They argue that continued diplomacy is the best way to persuade Iran to abandon any weapons programs.
 Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, said his country would be offering ''language changes.'' Asked what China objected to in the current draft, he said, ''I think it's a bit tough. It might corner the Iranians.''
 In an apparent reference to statements from American officials linking the nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea, Mr. Wang said, ''The case of the Iranians is different from North Korea. You cannot just apply the same standards.''
 He said that any sanctions had to be imposed in stages rather than at once and ''had to be in some way putting some political pressure on the Iranians to come back to the negotiations.''
 Mr. Churkin said Russia wanted all references to Bushehr removed from the draft. ''We do believe the Bushehr project does not have anything to do with concerns about non- proliferation because it is clearly a peaceful nuclear power plant that we are helping the Iranians to build,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Economy Cools

 BODY:
The latest information about the economy leaves no question that it has slowed down by just about every measure -- housing and manufacturing, retail sales and job growth, and others. 
 Even the recent increase in compensation is generally believed to be a sign of coming layoffs, not a harbinger of wage inflation. When business dries up at firms and factories, employers don't cut back immediately. So for a time, pay and benefits hang in there. As for the recent improvement in the unemployment rate, sorry to say, it's an aberration. The job market won't turn up in any meaningful way when the overall direction of the economy is down.
All of this information has fed the debate on the dominant economic question of the day: Is the United States economy headed toward the longed-for soft landing, in which it cools without contracting. Or is another recession inevitable? It's an interesting question, but in many ways it also is a diversion.
 Most Americans are ill prepared for an economic deceleration, even if it ends in a soft landing. When economic basics like income and insurance coverage are taken into account, most working families are no better off now than they were when the economic expansion began in late 2001. 
 They have been held back, primarily, by lousy pay. In 26 of the past 30 months, wages for most of the work force have failed to outpace inflation, even as corporate profits have hit historical highs. 
 The wage stagnation was masked, in part, by rising home equity that allowed many families to borrow heavily. It was cheap and easy money. But that debt burden could turn onerous as rates on adjustable mortgages rise. If jobs and housing head south together, the picture that emerges is one of families with inadequate -- if any -- financial cushions for the tough times ahead. 
 And, if the landing isn't soft -- the odds are about 50-50 now -- the economic pain is likely to be exacerbated by the fact that policymakers will have a narrow range of responses from which to choose.
 The traditional remedies for a downturn are cutting taxes and cutting interest rates. But the reckless tax cuts of the last five years already point to worsening deficits in the future, leaving no room in the federal budget for more tax cuts. 
 The nation's poor financial condition could also muffle the generally salutary effects of interest-rate cuts. That's because the nation's persistent indebtedness could provoke a fall in the dollar, in which case higher interest rates would most likely be needed to attract the foreign loans the government needed to operate. 
 The figures from one month or one quarter are not enough to divine the future. So we can all still hope that economic reality won't bite. But given the nation's constrained circumstances, hoping is about all we can do.

HEADLINE: Visions of Manhattan: For the City, 100-Year Makeovers

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Imagine a Manhattan given over to a new Central Park, with a crystalline city floating above it. 
 Or a series of self-propelled islands floating around Manhattan, docking as needed and providing extra space for concerts and green markets (or cordoning off visiting dignitaries so that their caravans don't disrupt traffic).
 Or that the populations of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx have been moved into Manhattan and stacked 65 stories high, so that those four boroughs could be used purely as green space. 
 These were among the 10 radical, sometimes quirky, visions of New York 100 years from now, presented by teams of architects and engineers in a competition that ended on Thursday. 
 Organized in connection with ''Engineering an Empire,'' a History Channel series that examines the achievements of ancient civilizations, the competition called for each team to design a 22nd-century ''City of the Future'' for a prize of $10,000. Similar competitions are to be held in Chicago on Nov. 17 and in Los Angeles on Dec. 8. A national champion will ultimately be selected from among the three winning teams and awarded another $10,000.
 In New York the firms, all local ones, were handed their challenge on Oct. 26 at 5:30 a.m. Their brief was to envision the city in 2106, striving for a high level of innovation and technological sophistication. Polished presentations were due a week later, at 5:30 a.m. on Thursday. Assembling at 8:30 a.m., the teams had four hours to put the presentations together in the Vanderbilt Room of Grand Central Terminal. 
 ''Rome wasn't built in a day, and I'm now pretty sure New York can't be built in a week,'' said one of the competing architects, Craig Konyk. 
 At 12:30 p.m., time ran out. ''Teams, please stop building,'' ordered the architect Casey Jones, who with Reed Kroloff, his partner, was a competition adviser. ''Time is up.''
 Then the judges filed in: the architects David Rockwell and Billie Tsien; Ray Gastil, the Manhattan office director of the city's Department of City Planning; Terrence O'Neal, president of the New York State chapter of the American Institute of Architects; and Paul Goldberger, architecture critic at The New Yorker. 
 During the next three hours, the judges moved from one project to another, asking questions. ''What is happening in the other boroughs?'' Ms. Tsien asked the Urban Research Group, the team that suggested emptying every borough except Manhattan of its inhabitants. ''Whatever the city needs to support itself,'' replied Moji Baratloo, one of the group's architects. ''It's a conceptual idea to understand what it would mean to free up land.'' 
 As Laurie Hawkinson of Smith-Miller & Hawkinson Architects sought to defend her team's presentation, Mr. Goldberger suggested that it wasn't architectural: a series of postcards depicting New York as the architects hoped or expected it would be. The computer-generated images included a giant pool in place of Central Park; an all-night golf course; a yellow cab that would take a passenger from New York to Boston in 45 minutes (at $7 a mile); a hot dog served by a mechanical arm; street signs in Chinese as well as English.
 Diane Lewis and colleagues at Diane Lewis Architect drew on a History Channel program on ancient Rome, ''not to see history as something past, but as a structural example,'' she said. (That segment won an Emmy Award for picture editing this year, and each team in this competition was sent a copy as possible inspiration.) 
 She created what she called a ''quadrata,'' with major streets going down one mile and up one mile, forming an overall cube. ''The Romans looked at infrastructure as architectural,'' Ms. Lewis said in an interview. ''Quadrants were connected into the grid of the city.''
 The Lewis team also created its own social institutions in place of Roman models -- instead of the Forum, a United Nations for Freedom of the Press; rather than a Pantheon, an international peace institute. ''We are interested in a postphilanthropic Manhattan,'' Ms. Lewis said. (In deliberating later, the judges agreed that this was an intriguing idea that had not been sufficiently developed.)
 The team from Konyk Architecture came up with ''Cloud 09,'' a city floating in air. It included a vertical subway system of high-speed lifts, or ''vrams''; annexed Hudson and eastern Bergen counties in New Jersey; and envisioned office buildings as so technologically advanced that ''business travel would cease to exist,'' Mr. Konyk said. ''Travel would be strictly for recreational purposes.'' 
 Mr. O'Neal asked: ''Where do you see the common man in your vision?'' 
 With computers in every school, Mr. Konyk replied, ''I think the common man is technically advanced.''
 Sustainability was a common theme. ''How can we use New York as a model for the rest of the world to create a sustainable environment?'' asked Jonathan Marvel of Rogers Marvel Architects. His team conceived of parkland that would create a green ribbon around the edge of Manhattan and a system of pneumatic tubes that would collect and tag sorted household waste for recycling. These are ''all ways you as an inhabitant take an active role in solving problems of sustainability on an active scale,'' Mr. Marvel said.
 The top prize went to the team from the Architecture Research Office firm, which, acknowledging global warming and climactic change, explored the idea of harnessing the water that would ultimately flood the streets. Avenues would become ''vanes,'' watery channels with buildings above them, a team member, Adam Yarinsky, suggested. 
 The group's formal proposal invoked modern and ancient architectural precedents. ''If the Miesian skyscraper and the Parisian arcade can account for one-half of the vane's pedigree,'' the team said in its presentation materials, ''the aqueduct and the Roman baths answer for the other.'' 
 After the judges' hasty deliberations, Daniel L. Doctoroff, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, presented the prizes. He said his office was preoccupied by many of the same concerns as the contestants -- ''parks and open space and pedestrianization and transportation'' -- though it might not be looking quite as far ahead. 
 ''It's so exciting for me to see this group of architects and designers think so creatively about the future,'' he said. 
 Mr. Marvel's team won the honorary mention for technological advancement. The Terreform group won the mention for best presentation, with a proposal that involved eliminating privately owned cars in Manhattan; it predicted that 60 percent of the city's population would be walking to work by 2038. 
 Over all, the proposals conveyed a confidence that amid energy shortages, population increases and global warming, New York's urban problems could be addressed and even solved. 
 Surveying the flooded streets in the Architecture Research Office proposal, Ms. Tsien asked, ''Do you see it as optimistic or elegiac?'' 
 Mr. Yarinsky replied: ''I see it as optimistic. The way a city transforms.''

HEADLINE: Fairer Pay for the City Council

 BODY:
Imagine that you have held a demanding job for seven years without a raise. That might seem outrageous. And that is what the New York City Council would have you believe, just as it is about to accept a salary raise of 25 percent -- to $112,500, the second-highest in the nation. 
 We would have more sympathy if the Council also moved to overhaul rules that allow members to collect politically linked bonuses and earn -- in several cases -- hundreds of thousands of dollars in outside income.
Council members are the only elected officials in the city who can vote themselves a raise, and unlike many legislative bodies, they don't defer the increase to future Council members as they should. It is also the only part-time elected position in the city. 
 Those who do treat it as full-time work -- often giving up lucrative private-sector positions for a job that is limited to two terms of four years -- can reasonably argue that their current base salary of $90,000 is too low. But others insist on keeping their day jobs, and a handful earn so much outside income it's a wonder they have time to serve. Dominic Recchia Jr. of Brooklyn, Oliver Koppell of the Bronx and David Weprin of Queens each collected more than $200,000 in outside income in 2004, according to a study by the nonpartisan good government group the Citizens Union.
 Keep those eyebrows up. Most Council members receive bonuses, from $4,000 to $28,500, for heading committees or holding leadership positions. These little goodies, known as lulus, have traditionally been doled out or withheld by the Council speaker as rewards for toeing the line, or punishment for showing too much independence. The mayor-appointed commission that recommended the pay raise also called this practice ''ripe for reform.''
 Because of the city's financial crisis, Mayor Michael Bloomberg skipped a Council pay review in 2003. The city is in better shape now. But that is still not a good reason to rush a big payday without also reforming the Council's compensation rules.

HEADLINE: Where Cars Are King and Gasoline Costs a Mere 12 Cents a Gallon

BYLINE: By JENS ERIK GOULD

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
At the moment, this country is an automaker's dream.
 A 1999 Jeep Cherokee in decent condition that may sell for $6,000 in the United States goes for $15,000 here. A 1992 Toyota Camry is worth around three times its Kelley Blue Book value.
General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler, meanwhile, are racing to increase production at their assembly plants here, and they are still falling behind demand. 
 What is driving this car bonanza is the high price of crude oil in this oil-exporting country. With all the extra income, the government of President Hugo Chavez is spending heavily on salary increases, public works projects and state enterprises that fill the economy with money that filters down to Venezuelans' pockets.
 In other countries, people with newfound money in their pockets might buy houses. But in Venezuela, a soaring market has made homes too expensive for most. Investing abroad is tricky because of currency controls, and few people are accustomed to trading on Venezuela's small stock exchange. 
 Add to that a reluctance to put money in bank accounts as the inflation rate continues to climb -- it rose to 15.5 percent in October, the highest rate in Latin America, according to Barclays Capital.
 Cars, then, are often the purchase of choice and, because of that, they do not depreciate here as they do in the United States and in Latin America's other big car markets. Also, it does not hurt that government subsidies and price controls lock gasoline prices at 12 cents a gallon. 
 ''It's like the U.S. housing market,'' said Marc N. Scheinman, professor of marketing at the Lubin School of Business of Pace University. ''Where we trade up in houses, the Venezuelans trade up in cars, and it's like having gold.'' 
 Brazil, the regional giant, sells eight times as many vehicles as Venezuela. Still, the small but lucrative Venezuelan market expects to double its 2004 sales of nearly 135,000 cars, to more than 300,000 this year, according to the Venezuela Automotive Chamber. That is roughly equivalent to the number of cars sold in a week in the United States. 
 G.M., Ford and Toyota are capturing the largest share of Venezuela's market, with a joint operation by Hyundai and Mitsubishi, and Fiat and DaimlerChrysler behind them. Besides the American automakers, Toyota and Hyundai-Mitsubishi have assembly plants in Venezuela.
 With Argentina posting sales increases similar to Venezuela's and Mexico attracting billions in auto industry investment, American automakers' success in the region is a stark contrast to their woes at home. 
 Ford's Venezuela sales, for instance, increased 65 percent in September from the year before, and there are waiting lists for some models.
 Although sales in the United States -- a vehicle market 57 times the size of Venezuela's -- have a much greater effect on the bottom line, carmakers can point to success overseas as evidence that their best days are not necessarily in the past.
 ''Our global revenue is up and is, in fact, at record levels,'' Robert A. Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman, said in a recent interview in Detroit. That is true in large part because G.M.'s sales are growing 30 percent annually in China, he said. 
 Yira Villegas, who lives in Caracas, said she purchased a 2005 Mazda Allegro new last year for 35 million bolivars, or $16,279. One year later, private vendors on www.tucarro.com, popular among Venezuelans looking to buy and sell used cars, are offering the same car for a nearly identical average price, 34.4 million bolivars, or $16,000.
 ''People aren't necessarily buying cars just to drive,'' said Luis Enrique Cardenas, president of the Venezuela Automotive Chamber. ''They're also buying cars as if it were the investment of a small investor.''
 Gustavo Diaz, 34, who was purchasing a Chevrolet Optra at a dealership in Caracas, was giving up on buying a Toyota Yaris after spending five months on the waiting list. ''We'd try for an apartment but it's much easier to buy a car,'' he said. ''A car is a good investment because it will have more value in little time.'' Responding to rising demand, Ford Venezuela has recently increased output of its Fiesta, Ka and F350 models and restarted production of the Explorer, making Venezuela the only country outside the United States that assembles that model. 
 Over the last two years, Ford has increased its distribution capacity in Venezuela, expanded its work force by 20 percent at its Valencia assembly plant and renovated every dealership in the country. 
 Rolling more vehicles per day off the assembly line, workers say they feel the pressure to produce more.
 ''If you're spending money you don't want to wait six months to get a car,'' said Wilmer Jimenez, who has worked at the plant for 20 years.
 Ford has still not been able to satisfy demand for the Fiesta model despite raising its production by 70 percent in April, said Eduardo Serrano, president of Ford Motor of Venezuela. 
 Despite rapid investments by automakers, production is still about 20 percent behind demand, according to Rafael Carias, vice president of Fadam, an association that represents automobile distributors in Venezuela. ''Last year, the market exploded in an unexpected way and it took everyone by surprise,'' Mr. Carias said. 
 The leftist Chavez government is responding by seeking more foreign investment, notably from nontraditional automakers in politically allied countries. Venezuela and the Iranian Automotive Industry Development Company have struck a deal to build an assembly plant to make inexpensive vehicles for the domestic market, while Venezuela plans to build its first auto parts factory with the Hungarian company Ples Rt. 
 ''We need more plants to satisfy the demand,'' said Jesusita Ayala, general director of goods and capital at the government's Ministry of Light Industry and Commerce. 
 Seeking to reduce Venezuela's traditional dependence on American markets, Mr. Chavez has signed numerous economic cooperation deals in recent months with countries like Syria, Belarus, Angola and Indonesia. Ms. Ayala said some of the agreements could yield more investments in the auto industry. 
 But industry experts warn that if history is any indicator, the current boom in Venezuela could be short-lived because the Venezuelan economy's dependence on crude oil prices makes it volatile. The car market has historically soured when oil prices drop and the government compensates by devaluing the bolivar, making new cars more expensive because, although assembled here, nearly 70 percent of their parts are imported.
 The economy is also often subject to political unrest. In 2003, the Venezuelan market sold only 63,000 cars, according to the Venezuela Automotive Chamber, just 21 percent of this year's projected sales, as the economy suffered in the wake of two months of national strikes and turmoil, including a failed coup against Mr. Chavez in 2002.
 ''We're passing through a great period right now, but we've also had very bad years,'' said Oscar Gonzalez, president of the Castellana Motors Chevrolet dealership in Caracas.
 ''It's a roller coaster.''

HEADLINE: Acquittal on One Charge and Mistrial on Others for Two in McKesson Case 

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Two former executives at the McKesson Corporation were acquitted of a conspiracy charge yesterday, but might be retried on six other charges involving a $9 billion accounting scandal at the country's biggest pharmaceutical distributor. 
 The two former executives, Charles W. McCall and Jay Lapine, were acquitted on one charge of conspiracy, but a mistrial was declared on six counts of securities fraud after the jury failed to reach a verdict.
Mr. McCall, the former chairman, and Mr. Lapine, the former general counsel, were charged with falsely booking $100 million in revenue and then covering up a conspiracy to inflate McKesson's profit shortly before its 1999 merger with HBO & Company, a health services software maker based in Atlanta.
 The McKesson case was one of the biggest accounting scandals at the time, causing investors to lose billions of dollars and at least four former McKesson executives to plead guilty to fraud charges.
 The verdict was the second time that prosecutors were defeated in a trial involving former McKesson executives. The company's former chief financial officer was acquitted in a nonjury trial last year. 
 In other major accounting scandals, several former corporate executives have been convicted. 
 "We've been sandwiched between so much negative press about corporate executives that to get an acquittal in that environment was just amazing," said Ted Wells, the lawyer representing Mr. McCall. 
 "I would hope that upon reflection the U.S. attorney's office would decide not to retry the case given the acquittal on the conspiracy count and also the age of the case."
 Mr. Lapine's lawyer, Marcus S. Topel, could not be reached for comment.
 Kevin V. Ryan, the United States attorney in San Francisco, said in a statement that he was disappointed with the conspiracy verdict. He did not indicate whether he would seek a second trial on the remaining charges.
 After six days of deliberation, a jury in federal court in San Francisco acquitted both men of conspiracy but remained deadlocked on the remaining counts.
 Albert Bergozi, the former HBO president and later a McKesson manager, pleaded guilty in 2003 to securities fraud, admitting that executives conspired to make the McKesson merger more attractive. 
 But once it discovered the conspiracy, McKesson fired Mr. McCall and ultimately had to restate 15 months' worth of financial results.

HEADLINE: Makers, Sellers and Managers of Drugs Do Deals 

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
MIXED messages about economic growth and corporate profits drained some optimism out of the market this week, but a string of mergers and acquisitions helped to rebuild some momentum.
 Corporate legal problems mounted, with one big conviction, another guilty plea, one major new case filed, a former chief executive sentenced to prison and a critical report by regulators that may lead to civil or even criminal charges against one of the world's biggest oil companies.

POWERFUL MEDICINE -- In a bid to cope with stricter efforts to contain prescription drug costs, CVS, the nation's second-biggest drugstore chain, agreed to buy Caremark Rx, the leading pharmacy benefits manager, for $20.6 billion.
The transaction would transform CVS, which trails only Walgreen among drugstore chains, into the country's biggest pharmacy benefits manager. These managers, which account for three-fourths of the $235 billion spent on prescriptions every year, run drug-buying programs for corporations, unions and insurers. 
 Pharmacy benefits managers face a powerful threat from Wal-Mart, which is cutting the cost of about 300 generic drugs to $4 a month.

BUSY BANKERS -- Two other significant takeovers were announced.
 Merck & Company agreed to pay $1.1 billion for Sirna Therapeutics, which is focused on developing therapeutics based on ribonucleic acid interference, a mechanism for inactivating particular genes. Merck and Sirna hope it may be used one day to kill viruses or tumors by turning off their genes.
 On the same day, Schneider Electric, a French maker of electrical components, offered $6.1 billion for American Power Conversion, to become a formidable force in the sale of products to protect businesses from power failures.
 Smith & Nephew, for one, is in talks to acquire Biomet, the maker of artificial hips and knees, for about $9 billion.

CLOUDY OUTLOOK -- Consumer confidence slipped last month, according to the Conference Board, a private research group. Energy prices fell and the incomes of Americans rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.5 percent, the quickest pace since June.
 Even as incomes rose, spending barely budged, the Commerce Department said. That helped to slow the rate at which Americans were depleting their savings, although the nationwide personal savings rate remained negative.
 Statistics showing slowdowns in manufacturing and construction raised doubts about whether the economy would rebound later this year.

A VERDICT, FINALLY -- A federal court jury in Bridgeport, Conn., convicted Walter A. Forbes, former chairman of the Cendant Corporation, of masterminding an accounting fraud that was, at the time it was discovered in 1998, the largest on record.
 The verdict came in the third trial of Mr. Forbes over eight years. Jurors could not reach a verdict in the earlier cases. This jury found Mr. Forbes, 63, of New Canaan, Conn., guilty of conspiracy and of submitting false reports to regulators. It acquitted him of securities fraud. 
 Mr. Forbes, who is free on $1.2 million bail, is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 17. He may be sent to prison for as long as 25 years.

CHARGES, AT LAST -- Capping a 27-month investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued nine former executives at the Delphi Corporation, accusing them of having manipulated the company's finances to project a healthy facade while it descended into bankruptcy.
 In all, the S.E.C. charged 13 people at Delphi, an auto parts supplier, including its former chief executive, J. T. Battenberg III, and its former chief financial officer, Alan S. Dawes. Four defendants worked for companies hired by Delphi and its former parent, General Motors.
 The S.E.C. immediately settled charges against six defendants, including Mr. Dawes, who agreed to pay $687,000 in penalties. Mr. Battenberg said he was not guilty.
 Analysts said investigators might use information from Mr. Dawes and others to advance a related investigation of accounting methods used by G.M.

MORE JAIL TIME -- The former chief executive of Computer Associates International, Sanjay Kumar, 44, was sentenced to 12 years in prison and fined $8 million for orchestrating a huge accounting fraud at the company, now known as CA.
 Mr. Kumar pleaded guilty in April, along with Stephen Richards, the company's former top salesman, and seven other company executives. They admitted to inflating revenue to get bonuses. Mr. Kumar, who netted a $330 million bonus in 1998, will report to prison Feb. 27. Mr. Richards will be sentenced on Nov. 14.
 William F. Sorin, the former general counsel of Comverse Technology, pleaded guilty last week to criminal conspiracy in a different stock-option manipulation scheme. His sentencing is set for Feb. 9.

BP TROUBLES GROW -- The oil company BP had ''significant knowledge'' years ago of the problems that caused a deadly accident at its Texas City, Tex., refinery in 2005, a federal safety panel said. The explosion and fire killed 15 workers and injured 180.
 The panel, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, said BP's cost-cutting contributed to the disaster. BP was already under attack for an oil spill in Alaska, poor maintenance of the trans-Alaska pipeline and accusations that its traders tried to corner the propane market.
 A lawsuit filed by a young woman who lost both her parents in the blast and fire is scheduled to go to trial next week in state district court in Galveston.

SLOW THE PRESSES -- Daily newspapers suffered one of the sharpest circulation declines in at least 15 years, as new media competed for readers' time and attention.
 Over all, average daily circulation dropped by 2.8 percent during the six-month period ended Sept. 30, compared with the period last year, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Sunday paper sales fell by 3.4 percent.
 Under pressure from its shareholders, the Tribune Company, which publishes The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune and Newsday, is seeking to sell itself -- in pieces, if necessary.

HEADLINE: Should They Win Control of Congress, the Democrats Have a Plan 

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Republicans like to say that Democrats have no ready agenda should they seize power in Congress, save for one particular piece of business.
 ''If they get control of the House and the Senate, they're going to run up your taxes,'' President Bush warned a crowd in Nevada on Thursday.
But Democrats say Republicans have it wrong on both counts. They say they are prepared to move on a package of legislation and rules changes in the first 100 hours Congress is in session next year, should they take control of the House or Senate. And they promise to pursue a broader long-term program that touches on national security, health care, employment, energy and education. 
 They say it is Mr. Bush and Congressional Republicans who are enacting a back-door tax increase by failing to fix the alternative minimum tax, which is hitting more middle-income families.
 ''Democrats are offering a new direction for America that will provide real tax relief to middle-income families, spur economic growth that will produce good-paying American jobs, and we will do it in a fiscally responsible way,'' Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader who would become speaker in a Democratic-controlled House, said on Friday. ''And Democrats will ensure that strong economic growth benefits all Americans, not just the privileged few.''
 Republicans say the Democratic approach would force tax increases, since the party is proposing to increase spending while also imposing so-called ''pay-go'' budget rules that would require most new spending to be offset by a new source of revenue, not added to the federal deficit. 
 ''You have their social agenda, which involves a lot of new money,'' said Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio and the current majority leader. ''Secondly, they want to institute pay-go rules. If you put the pay-go rules in and you increase spending, the only answer is raise taxes.'' 
 Democrats, many of whom opposed Mr. Bush's push to lower tax rates on investment income, say they can find other ways to pay for their programs, like a greater effort to collect billions of dollars in unpaid taxes. They also say they intend to produce savings by initiating negotiations with drug companies to lower Medicare prescription costs and by eliminating some subsidies for the oil and gas industry.
 ''Despite the president and the Republicans saying we will raise taxes, that is not what we will do,'' said Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi.
 Ms. Pelosi has outlined a plan to move quickly on pet Democratic initiatives as soon as Congress convenes in January if her party holds the majority. They include legislation to enact all the antiterrorism initiatives recommended by the Sept. 11 commission, increase the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, allow the government to negotiate Medicare prescription drug prices, eliminate some corporate subsidies for the oil industry, cut in half the interest rate on federally subsidized college loans and impose new restrictions on dealing with lobbyists.
 Some of those proposals are also elements of the Democratic ''Six for '06,'' the shorthand for the party's longer-term agenda. 
 Under that plan, Democrats would push for new policies in Iraq, including beginning the withdrawal of troops for deployment elsewhere. They would also seek to double special forces devoted to pursuing Osama bin Laden and others in terrorism networks, institute screening of all cargo containers entering the country and increase spending on the National Guard and emergency workers. 
 Democrats say they would also prohibit any increase in Congressional pay until the minimum wage was raised and eliminate tax breaks that encourage companies to move jobs out of the country. They would make permanent an expired tax deduction for college tuition costs; encourage alternative energy production; renew the push for expanded stem cell research and enact new incentives for personal saving.
 Republicans say that such initiatives do not come cheap and that Democrats will have to resort to tax increases to find the money. And Mr. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Congressional Republican leaders have repeatedly pointed out that Democrats can increase taxes simply by allowing some of the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and extended over some Democratic objections to expire.
 Those assertions set off a row this week with Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who would become the new chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in a Democratic-led House. Mr. Rangel and his advisers say that given the likelihood of small margins between the two parties in the House and Senate, any tax legislation would have to be done in concert with the White House and Republicans.
 ''Regardless of who is in control next year,'' Mr. Rangel said Tuesday, ''Democrats and Republicans are going to have to come together. Congress will have to work with the administration to provide real tax relief for middle-income families and find solutions to issues like Social Security and tax reform.''
 Democrats also say that most of the tax cuts do not expire until 2010 and that any action will depend on the economic climate and the federal budget situation. And they say Democrats strongly support many of the most popular tax breaks, including a higher child tax credit and elimination of the so-called marriage penalty. 
 As for the lower rates on stock dividends and capital gains, John Buckley, tax counsel for Mr. Rangel, said, ''If the budget is good, who knows what happens in 2010. If the budget is not, then all sides are going to have to look at this.''
 Mr. Buckley said Democrats wanted a permanent fix in the alternative minimum tax, which was initially established to make certain that affluent Americans with significant deductions did not escape taxes altogether, but which is now reaching a growing number of upper middle-income earners. He said the creeping alternative tax is reducing the benefits of the Bush tax cuts for Americans who fall under it.
 ''The president has accused us of increasing taxes without lifting a finger,'' Mr. Buckley said. ''But his budget does not include any A.M.T. relief, so he is increasing taxes without lifting a finger.''

HEADLINE: For U.S. and Top Iraqi, Animosity Is Mutual

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The cycle of discord and strained reconciliation that has broken into the open between Iraq's Shiite-led government and the Bush administration has revealed how wide the gulf has become between what the United States expects from the Baghdad government and what it is able or willing to deliver. 
 Just in the past 10 days, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has rejected the notion of an American ''timeline'' for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq; and demanded speeded-up Iraqi control of its own military.
The estrangement has developed despite the two governments' mutual dependency. The Maliki government needs the United States for the protection its 150,000 troops afford, and without which, most Iraqi politicians agree, the country would slide into full-blown civil war. For the Americans, success for the government that won a four-year term in January's elections seems central to any hope for an orderly American disengagement from Iraq. 
 Without doubt, there has been an element of political grandstanding by Mr. Maliki that reflects his need to rally support among fractious Shiite political partners and the restive masses they represent. With American pressures focusing on the need for political concessions to the minority Sunnis by the majority Shiites -- the principal victims of Saddam Hussein's repression, and, since his overthrow, the main targets for Sunni insurgent bombings -- the prime minister cannot afford to be seen to be at America's beck and call.
 Still, the differences between the new Shiite rulers and the Americans are real and growing. And the paradox of their animosity is that the primary beneficiary of the rift is likely to be their common enemy, the Sunni insurgents. Their aim has been to recapture the power the Sunnis lost with Mr. Hussein's overthrow -- and to repeat the experience of the 1920s, when Shiites squandered their last opportunity to wrest power and handed the Sunnis an opening to another 80 years of domination.
 The bitterness between the Shiite leaders and the Americans reflects widely divergent views of the government's responsibilities. The Americans want Mr. Maliki to lead in forging a ''national compact,'' healing bitter splits between Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds over the division of political and economic power.
 The timeline that Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador, set out last week -- prompting an acerbic protest from Mr. Maliki -- foresaw framework agreements over coming months. Central issues include disbanding the militias that have been responsible for a wave of sectarian killing, the future division of oil revenues, and a new approach to the Baathists, who were the bedrock of the Hussein government, that will strike a fairer balance between holding the worst accountable for their crimes and offering others rehabilitation.
 But Mr. Maliki is not well cast for the role of national conciliator, and has shown a growing tendency to revert to type as a stalwart of a Shiite religious party, the Islamic Dawa Party, which had thousands of its followers killed under Mr. Hussein.
 Like most other current Shiite leaders, Mr. Maliki spent decades in exile, and lost family members in Mr. Hussein's gulag. By nature, he is withdrawn and, American officials say, lacks the natural ease, and perhaps the will, to reach out to politicians from other communities, especially Sunnis.
 The Americans say that a self-reinforcing dynamic is at play, with the growing sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shiites, responsible for thousands of deaths this year in Baghdad and surrounding areas, causing politicians from both groups to pull back from the vision of a shared life.
 Instead, positions have hardened. In the case of Mr. Maliki, who heads what is nominally a ''national unity'' cabinet, this has meant an increasing tendency to act as the steward of Shiite interests, sometimes so obtrusively that Sunnis, and to a lesser extent Kurds, have accused him of blatant sectarianism.
 The issue of greatest concern to the Americans -- and to Sunnis -- has been Mr. Maliki's resistance to American pressure for a crackdown on the Mahdi Army, the Shiite militia that the Americans say has been in the forefront of death squad attacks on Sunnis. The Shiite cleric who leads the militia, Moktada al-Sadr, controls the largest Shiite bloc in Parliament and backed Mr. Maliki in the contest among Shiite groups to name the new prime minister. 
 Another Shiite militia, the Badr Organization, is controlled by Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, who is both a powerful rival to Mr. Maliki in Shiite religious politics and another mainstay of the government. 
 So for Mr. Maliki, American demands for action to disband the militias have revealed in their sharpest form the tensions between his role as national leader and as steward of Shiite interests. Compounding his dilemma, public opinion among Shiites, particularly in Sadr City, the Mahdi Army's main stronghold, has coalesced around the militiamen, who are seen by many as the only effective protection against Sunni insurgents who have killed thousands of Shiites with their bombings of marketplaces, mosques, weddings, funerals and other public gatherings.
 The failure of American troops to stop these bombings is a source of anger among Shiites, who have woven conspiracy theories that depict the Americans as silent partners for the Sunnis. And the rancor finds a favorite target in Mr. Khalilzad, who has become a figure of contempt among some senior Shiites in the government for his efforts to draw the Sunnis into the circle of power in Baghdad. It has become common among Shiite officials to say that the envoy harbors an unease toward Shiites engendered by growing up in a Sunni family in Afghanistan that distrusted Hazaras, Shiite descendants of Genghis Khan.
 For months, Mr. Maliki has argued against forcible moves to disband the militias, urging a political solution and pointing to cases in which Mr. Sadr himself has approved, or at least not opposed, raids on death squad leaders whom he has described as renegades from the mainforce Mahdi Army. Publicly, the Americans have backed the prime minister; privately, they say the country cannot wait while sectarian killing rages unabated. The result has been an uneasy, and at times volatile, compromise.
 American commanders have picked off some of the most brutal Shiite death squad leaders on a raid-by-raid basis, sometimes with Mr. Maliki's approval, and sometimes, as in the case of a disputed Sadr City raid last week that failed to capture the wanted man, known as Abu Derar, without it. In one case last month, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top American commander in Iraq, intervened to release another alleged Mahdi Army death squad leader captured in a raid in west Baghdad after Mr. Maliki demanded he be freed, apparently to assuage Mr. Sadr.
 American dissatisfaction with the Maliki government goes far beyond the ambivalence over the militias. When the government was sworn in on May 20, Mr. Khalilzad and General Casey said it had six months to take a broad range of political actions that would build public support, and make the war winnable. When President Bush made a six-hour visit to Baghdad in June, he said he had looked Mr. Maliki ''in the eye'' to determine if America had a reliable partner, andreported that he was convinced the new prime minister met the test.
 High among American priorities was the need for effective government after a largely wasted year under Mr. Maliki's predecessor, Ibrahim al-Jaafari. American officials have told reporters in background briefings in recent weeks that little has changed, with the budgets of many government departments, including the Health Ministry, controlled by officials loyal to Mr. Sadr, being used for what the Americans say amounts to wholesale looting.
 In the past week, Mr. Maliki has added a new, potentially incendiary grievance against the Americans. In interviews that preceded a placatory teleconference call with President Bush last weekend, he said the poor security situation across Iraq was the Americans' fault, and demanded a more rapid transfer of command authority over the war. With apparent unconcern for the war's growing unpopularity in the United States, he demanded more American money for the buildup of Iraq's own forces, and for reconstruction of the country's infrastructure, on top of the $38 billion the Bush administration says it has already spent on civil and military aid to Iraq since the toppling of Mr. Hussein in 2003 and the nearly $400 billion for America's own deployments.
 Mr. Bush responded by dispatching his national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, on an urgent trip to Baghdad on Monday, and agreeing to work on ways of accelerating the transfer of authority, especially in regard to the Maliki government's ability to control the deployment of Iraqi troops.
 What the Bush administration's public comments omitted was any reference to the deep frustration among American commanders at the continuing weakness of many Iraqi Army units, which have been plagued by high levels of indiscipline, absenteeism and desertion. Some American officers say that as many as half of the listed 137,000 Iraqi soldiers are effectively undeployable.
 The situation has its keenest effects in Baghdad, where American commanders say the war will ultimately be won or lost. In the stepped-up effort to clear the city of insurgents and death squads, begun in August and acknowledged by American commanders to be faltering, American troops have accounted for two-thirds of the 25,000 deployed, after Iraqi commanders delivered two of the six battalions they promised. 
 The result, American officers involved in the operation have noted, is that what little security there is in the city -- and, ultimately, the survival of the Maliki government itself -- relies far more on American than Iraqi troops.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. CANDIDATES TURN THEIR FOCUS TO THE ECONOMY 

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and ANNE E. KORNBLUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Republicans seized on a drop in the unemployment rate to assert on Friday that tax cuts were invigorating the economy, highlighting just four days before the election an issue that party strategists are counting on to offset bad news about the war.
 The Labor Department announced Friday morning that the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.4 percent in October -- down from 4.6 percent in September and the lowest rate since May 2001, when it was 4.3 percent. [Page C1] 
Within hours, President Bush mocked Democrats for predicting that the administration's tax and spending policies would wreck the economy.
 ''If the Democrats' election predictions are as good as their economic predictions, we're going to have a good day on November the seventh,'' Mr. Bush said, drawing a long cheer from a crowd in Joplin, Mo., where he was campaigning for Senator Jim Talent, who is in a close race. 
 ''The facts are in,'' Mr. Bush said at another campaign stop on Friday. ''The tax cuts have led to a strong and growing economy, and this morning, we got more proof of that.''
 As Mr. Bush was attempting to shift the election debate to the positive domestic news, however, Vice President Dick Cheney was addressing head-on what polls showed was the Republicans' greatest political liability: the administration's determination to follow through on the war regardless of public opinion or election outcomes.
 ''Full speed ahead,'' Mr. Cheney said in an interview with ABC News that was taped for broadcast Sunday, two days before the election. 
 ''It may not be popular with the public,'' he continued. ''It doesn't matter in the sense that we have to continue the mission and do what we think is right. And that's exactly what we're doing. We're not running for office.'' 
 Although battle plans always change in times of war, the vice president said, ''I think, again, we've got the basic strategy right.'' 
 Later, at a campaign stop in Iowa, Mr. Bush addressed the subject of the war, calling the cause ''noble and necessary'' and accusing the Democrats of ''second-guessing'' without offering an alternative. 
 ''I'm going to tell you something point-blank,'' Mr. Bush said. ''If I didn't think we could win, I'd get our troops out.''
 Separately, two former Pentagon advisers who were closely identified with the argument for invasion, Richard N. Perle and Ken Adelman, told Vanity Fair magazine that they would not have supported the invasion if they had known how ''incompetently'' the administration would manage it. Both have previously criticized the administration's conduct of the war. 
 In the ABC News interview, Mr. Cheney declined comment, saying that he had not read the article.
 And most Republicans on the campaign trail did their best to focus on the day's economic news. 
 The figures showed that the pace of job creation for the month was somewhat lower than anticipated. But the government substantially increased its job growth estimates for the previous two months. Stock prices fell, in part because investors concluded that the Federal Reserve would judge the economy to be so strong that it could not consider reducing interest rates. 
 Congressional Republicans fanned out to reinforce Mr. Bush's message, saying that if Democrats won control of Congress they would raise taxes and jeopardize prosperity.
 ''This is what we have been campaigning on,'' said Peter J. Roskam, a Republican state senator in a close race for a Republican-held House seat in the Chicago suburbs. 
 ''Democrats want to nationalize elections and make it all about international affairs and whatnot,'' he added. ''But when it comes down to making the tax cuts permanent, this is a district that gets it.''
 All year, Republicans have been frustrated by their inability to get more credit for what the statistics suggest is a healthier economy, especially when gasoline prices have come down from their peaks. 
 ''The media seems focused on Iraq, Iraq, Iraq,'' said Mr. Roskam's spokesman, Jason Roe. 
 Mr. Roskam is running against Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat who lost both legs as an Army helicopter pilot in Iraq. On Friday, the National Republican Congressional Committee placed $1.1 million in television advertisements against Ms. Duckworth, beginning a weekend barrage. The advertising purchase was the largest that the House campaign committee made Friday, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission.
 Republicans said they relished the chance to get back to debating tax cuts and the economy. Brian Nick, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said, ''For us to be successful on Tuesday, there obviously needs to be other issues than Democrats hitting us with 'staying the course.' '' 
 Democrats have countered by saying that although unemployment has declined, it remains slightly higher than it was when Mr. Bush took office. They say many families are working harder to keep up their quality of life, even as the wealthy benefit from the administration's policies. 
 In Midwestern and industrial states hard hit by foreign competition and job losses, Republicans remain on the defensive. In Ohio, where four House seats and one Senate seat are in play, reminding voters of the economy's strength has become risky for some Republicans. Representative Deborah Pryce, a powerful Republican in a toss-up race, is under fire from Democrats for calling the economy ''storybook.''
 While Mr. Bush was talking up the economy in Missouri, the Republican Senate candidate in Michigan was portraying the same glass as half empty. ''More bad news for Michigan,'' the candidate, Mike Bouchard, said in a news release, arguing that his state had failed to keep pace with the broader recovery. Mr. Bouchard sought to blame the Democratic incumbent, Senator Debbie Stabenow, noting that unemployment in the state had risen sharply since she took office.
 The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee responded to Mr. Bush's campaign stop for Mr. Talent with a television commercial attacking him. ''Talent voted for tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas,'' the advertisement says. ''We have lost over 60,000 manufacturing jobs, and Talent is helping to ship jobs out of the country.''
 Mr. Bush's campaigning has been unusually light for a sitting president, and he heads to his Texas ranch on Saturday night to celebrate the 60th birthday of his wife, Laura Bush. They will return to Washington to watch the election results.

HEADLINE: To the Barricades Once More 

BYLINE: BY PHILIP WEISS

 BODY:
''WHO knows what power is?'' Cameron Mackintosh said, cutting off a question, as he went into the kitchen of his New York apartment for a fresh cup of coffee. 
 It was a day off, and Mr. Mackintosh, the British producer, had just received a book of photographs of his Scottish castle, the first of many presents for his 60th birthday on Oct. 17. It put him in a reflective mood. He seemed just as happy to leaf through the pictures pointing out the mist on the cove or Frank, who runs the boats, as to talk about the reasons he was in New York: the American premiere of ''Mary Poppins'' and the revival of ''Les Miserables.'' 
Reflective is not one of the words usually associated with Mr. Mackintosh. Those would be: big, artful, lavish, tear-jerking. English music hall meets global passion on a stage near you, and the helicopter wins. Mr. Mackintosh remade the modern theatrical spectacle and transformed Broadway and the American road (not to mention old cinemas from Vienna to Tokyo) with his big four: ''Cats,'' ''Les Miserables,'' ''Miss Saigon'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera.'' At 50, he was knighted, partly because of his shows' impact on Britain's 's economy. And now ''Phantom'' is the longest-running show on Broadway.
 But the high points came 15 years ago. Since then Mr. Mackintosh has had a long bout of mixed results and forgettable titles. ''Martin Guerre,'' ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' ''Moby Dick,'' ''Putting It Together,'' ''The Fix.''
 ''Anyone in this business has to be prepared to hold themselves up to scorn and ridicule, that's the nature of the theater,'' said his friend Freddie Gershon, who owns licenses of shows with Mr. Mackintosh. ''The hits,'' as Mr. Mackintosh explains, ''don't come down like a conveyor belt.'' 
 Even so, his gut is famous. And what is it telling him about ''Mary Poppins,'' which opens on Nov. 16 at the New Amsterdam, and the revival of ''Les Miz,'' which, somewhat scaled down, opens at the Broadhurst on Thursday, almost three and a half years after ending its 16-year Broadway run? 
 ''In the end they will be as successful as the public wants them to be,'' he said. ''I'm going to be delivering two great pieces of theater. I can't do anything more than that.'' He did not reveal the advance sales on ''Poppins,'' saying only: ''I'm always a little nervous. But they're pretty good. I'll need to carry only one pair of underpants around with me.''
 But this is the last time he'll do two big shows together, he said, and he's not looking for new material. Come January Mr. Mackintosh plans to put all calls on hold and spend eight months rotating among his estates. There are pigs to cook in Scotland, venison in Somerset, seafood in Malta. ''I fancy razor clams,'' he said. ''You look at the tide tables, dig them up.'' Now and then he will look in on the seven London theaters he owns and is restoring. He sighed philosophically: ''Owning a lot of stuff is a nightmare. Because of the responsibility.''
 The next day was the first run-through of ''Mary P.,'' as he calls it, at the New Amsterdam, and he shed his rubber Crocs for cap-toed shoes before doing what he does best: meddling. He was rushing around in the dark to give notes to the various creative people in the show, covering everything from the banjo plucking in ''Jolly Holiday'' to the set change on ''Chim Chim Cher-ee.'' Now and then he reached for someone else's pad and pencil, but generally he is too instinctual and immediate for paper.
 ''Cameron is part everything. He wears as many hats as we wear,'' says George Stiles, the composer of the show's additional songs, who sometimes finds himself worn down by the process. ''He can be a bully,'' said Richard Eyre, the director of the London and the Broadway ''Poppins.'' ''But I've never known him gratuitously to bully as it were, as a sort of psychological need. To him what matters more than anything in the world is the project, that is the passion and the thing that he gains his identity from.'' 
 John Caird, director, with Trevor Nunn, of the original London and Broadway productions of ''Les Miz'' and of the revival, echoed that, saying, ''His interventions are admirably lacking in ego.'' 
 Mr. Caird is from the Royal Shakespeare, and Mr. Eyre is from the National. Mr. Mackintosh has always gone for top-drawer talent. But if his shows have elegance, he likes to scrape off the subtlety. He wants to carry you off with a simple story. He likes big numbers to build and explode like fireworks. ''They all have high art credentials -- T. S. Eliot, Victor Hugo, 'Madame Butterfly' -- but you don't have to know that,'' said Garrett Eisler, who writes a theater blog (playgoer.blogspot.com). ''He succeeded at mass-producing them in part because they were not English-language dependent,'' Mr. Eisler added. ''The Brazilians and Japanese were taken in by the spectacle.'' 
 If you suggest that Mr. Mackintosh is still the 8-year-old who fell in love with musical theater when he saw the London show ''Salad Days,'' with its magic piano, a member of his creative team will correct you: he is 6. ''He acts childlike in his enthusiasm,'' Mr. Gershon said. ''He becomes maniacal.''
 In the darkened theater Mr. Mackintosh jumped to his feet. The rooftop of the Banks family house in Poppins had suddenly descended from the heights of the New Amsterdam flies to the stage, with Mary Poppins and Bert on it. 
 ''Florenz Ziegfeld would be proud,'' he crowed. (This was before the recent glitches in the set.) ''For me to finally have a show in the theater that Flo Ziegfeld built, the most famous impresario ever ---- '' 
 A thin man in glasses shot up the aisle and grabbed Mr. Mackintosh's sleeve. ''Hello, darling, I bring love from the east, '' Thomas Schumacher said and was instantly gone. 
 Mr. Schumacher, who heads Disney's theatrical arm, was just back from Europe. Mr. Mackintosh and Disney are producing ''Poppins'' together. The show has been playing in London for almost two years to celebratory reviews, though ticket sales are said to be falling off. There are longstanding rumors of enmity between the producers, but both say -- loudly -- that they get along fine. 
 ''If there was something juicy, where we have fallen out -- we just haven't,'' Mr. Schumacher said. ''It's a junior-/senior-partner scenario. I'm in the room with someone who has a lot of experience.''
 Mr. Mackintosh added: ''We've never quarreled. That's shocking and true. People have always wanted it not to be true.'' 
 Others are not particularly eager to comment on their relationship. Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, who has worked with Mr. Mackintosh, said, picking his words: ''How easy is it to get along with Cameron? You'll be talking with Tom Schumacher. He can tell you how easy it is.'' 
 I told Mr. Schoenfeld that Mr. Schumacher had said it was a walk in the park. Mr. Schoenfeld replied: ''He says it's easy? Huh. Well, there you are, there you are. He's very creative, Cameron.''
 It was a shotgun wedding: Disney held the rights to the ''Mary Poppins'' songs, by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman, from its 1964 movie, but Mr. Mackintosh held the theatrical rights. 
 In the early 1990s he began courting P. L. Travers, the author of the Mary Poppins books, who was then in her 90s. She had famously disliked the saccharine movie.Mr. Mackintosh told her he loved the books and aimed to restore the ''sharp tone'' of the storytelling and the ''Travers reality'' of witty characters who spoke in an English manner. Ms. Travers sold Mr. Mackintosh the rights for perpetuity, for about $75,000, a lot of money then, he said, and signed the clause saying that the musical could use the Disney material. Ms. Travers died in 1996 at 96. ''She liked him very much,'' said Diana Rawstron, a lawyer in London and trustee of Ms. Travers's estate. ''She felt that he would be true to her original work.''
 But some at Disney -- which with hits like ''The Lion King'' and ''Beauty and the Beast'' had recently discovered stage musicals -- disparaged Mr. Mackintosh's plans. ''They would say Cameron wants to make her old and nasty and a mean lady,'' Mr. Schumacher said, referring to Mary Poppins. 
 The hurt still shows in Mr. Mackintosh's broad face. ''I was upset,'' he said. ''It was bizarre. I was astonished by the combination of stupidity and arrogance. That anybody in a position like that would do, would say the kinds of things they did to me. It shows that they know nothing about the theater.''
 Mr. Mackintosh, who is billed as a co-creator of ''Mary Poppins,'' brought in Mr. Stiles and Anthony Drewe to write new songs and additional lyrics He also did a lot of work on the musical himself. He said he cried like a baby when he finished mapping out the story, when the nanny told the children she was going. ''I think he wishes he could be the author,'' Mr. Gershon said. Mr. Mackintosh sang some of the songs himself when he and the new songwriting pair presented the new material for Michael Eisner, Disney's chief executive, and his wife, Jane, in the producer's New York apartment. 
 Mr. Mackintosh is childish and devilish when he's on, and he was on that night, and ''lubricated,'' he admitted, with whiskey. ''Really it's about family values,'' he explained. ''America is geared to the family. Thanksgiving, Labor Day, those are all family events. While all we have is Christmas. And we have mistresses.''
 Mr. Schumacher recalled that afterward, when he took Mr. Eisner and his wife down to Seventh Avenue to get a cab, Mr. Eisner said to him, ''You know it's no accident that he is so successful.'' In Hollywood many achieve success by accident, Mr. Schumacher said later. 
 Mr. Mackintosh's father was a trumpeter, and his mother was a former actress from Malta. The women in the family doted on the boy, and when he started producing, they went to work for him. 
 Today, full of adoration, he tells happy stories about his family. 
 Mr. Mackintosh likes to have people swirling around him. He loves food and cooking and buildings. But one-on-one feels like too much intimacy for him. ''You may have noticed he's a shy man, he doesn't talk much about himself,'' Mr. Eyre said. ''I'd be very surprised if you'd learnedanything about Cameron's inner self.'' Making musical theater a viable art form has been Mr. Mackintosh's mission in life, Mr. Eyre said, ''conscious or not.'' 
 MR. MACKINTOSH ran up the stairs of 890 Broadway, the main rehearsal space in the city, two at a time, to check in on rehearsals of ''Les Miz.'' It was probably the 10,000th time he has seen Eponine, the young lover in ''Les Miz,'' sing ''A Little Fall of Rain'' and die onstage, but when Celia Keenan-Bolger did it, Mr. Mackintosh's face flushed, and he wiped away tears with his fingertip.
 He is often said to be as quick to anger as he is to cry, and his rages are legendary. Asked about his temper, Mr. Mackintosh said primly: ''I don't usually outburst with mistakes. But when it's repeated, mistakes become stupidity and that's what makes me cross.''
 Some in the business say that Mr. Mackintosh is hardheaded, and it can be glimpsed whenever another producer's name came up. He boasts that the rehearsal hall that he refurbished at 890 Broadway is bigger than the one that the Shuberts did in the building; that he could have saved the Mark Hellinger Theater from being turned into a church if only the Nederlander Organization had made a deal with him to get ''Les Miz''; that Garth Drabinsky built his empire on the deluded belief that there would be no end to long-runners like ''The Phantom of the Opera.'' It's no surprise that Disney despaired of trying to fight him. 
 Still, Mr. Gershon, his friend and business partner, said that in recent years Mr. Mackintosh had been humbled by the deaths of friends, as he realized he didn't have the power to do anything about it. His wit has darkened, Mr. Gershon added. He looks back a lot and seems to derive pleasure from narrating his failures. 
 ''Once in that early period, I did a production of 'An Inspector Calls,' by J. B. Priestley, and I managed to get J. B. Priestley to come to what was a regional rep tour,'' Mr. Mackintosh said. ''You know he was a great man. And I took him for a drink to the pub afterward. I went, 'Oh Mr. Priestley, to have you here has really been wonderful, it's been so kind, it's such a brilliant play.' And he said, 'Aye, lad, it would need to be, to survive your production.' ''
 Was he deflated?
 ''Oh, no, I just laughed,'' Mr. Mackintosh said. ''It's very hard to deflate me. I'm like an upmarket wash cycle. My career will keep going, and I will hopefully come back into fashion. Look at Rodgers and Hammerstein. Their musical that most resonates is the one they wrote at the end of their career, 'The Sound of Music.' ''
 ''Of course there's something timeless about nuns and Nazis,'' he added.
 As for Mr. Mackintosh's planned sabbatical and his interest in looking after his properties, Mr. Caird is dismissive of the idea that Mr. Mackintosh might be mellowing into a country squire. 
 ''I can't see him changing. I don't think he knows how to be anybody else but Cameron.''
 Mr. Mackintosh puffed up another two flights of stairs at 890 to get to an audition for the part of the child Cosette. Thirteen perfect 7- and 8-year-old girls from the New York region were there to sing the tear-jerker ''Castle on a Cloud.'' 
 ''Look at Cameron, look at Cameron,'' Mr. Caird, in his stocking feet, told the girls, getting them to move their eyes as they sang. Then he shooed them to the end of the room so he could huddle with the producer. ''Let's cull,'' Mr. Caird said with cold English relish. 
 The production staff all agreed on the same three girls, and in the next round Shaun Kerrison, the associate director, began to abuse them. Mr. Kerrison snarled at each performer to move a set of folding chairs across the space as she sang. (This is a scene from the show.) The first girl had great presence; the second girl had a strong, perfect voice; the third was utterly terrified and seemed about to dissolve in her Abercrombie T-shirt. She ran away from Mr. Kerrison and held the chair in front of her face as she sang. 
 Yet she (Carly Rose Sonenclar) was the one they picked. Mr. Mackintosh's eyes welled with pity as he explained it. ''She was vulnerable. You felt this was a girl that was abused; and that is the situation she is in.'' She had done all that Mr. Mackintosh ever asked of the theater: She transported him.

SIZE MATTERS
 How Height Affects the Health, 
 Happiness, and Success of Boys -- 
 and the Men They Become.
 By Stephen S. Hall.
 388 pp. Houghton Mifflin. $26.
To the many indignities visited upon shorter than average males -- lower incomes, disadvantage in mate selection, cut rates for their deposits at the local sperm bank, long odds of making the N.B.A. -- has now been added this one: short people are stupider than tall people. That's the finding of a recent study by two Princeton economists who conclude, painfully for those of us who are south of 5 feet 9 inches, that the reason taller people make more money is that they are smarter. 
 That finding was published too late to make it into Stephen Hall's provocative book, but it's in keeping with the litany of obstacles arrayed against short men that he documents in ''Size Matters.'' Consider the very word ''stature.'' Its primary definition refers to physical height, but it can also connote everything from presence and charisma to virtue and importance; on a metaphorical level, height and worthiness of esteem are linked in the human mind. ''Nobility of soul accompanies tallness of body,'' wrote one 18th-century German physician, reflecting the conventional wisdom of the time. Repeated studies in the modern era have shown that people unconsciously ascribe positive qualities to the tall: in addition to being deemed more intelligent, tall people are automatically considered more likable, more dependable and more commanding. It seems that benefits accrue to the tall beginning almost from birth, and then keep accruing, leading to what is, generally speaking, a society where the tall lead and the short follow -- an ''altocracy,'' as Hall puts it. Only 3 of 43 American presidents -- James Madison, Benjamin Harrison and Martin Van Buren -- have been under 5 feet 7 inches, and it is well known that the taller of two presidential candidates usually wins the election.
 The association of height with cultural desirability and even existential value has deep historical roots. The Roman historian Tacitus, writing in the first century A.D., associated height with both strength and moral virtue. Drawing on Tacitus and his successors, King Frederick William of Prussia became obsessed with recruiting -- and breeding -- an army of behemoths in the early 1700's. His so-called Potsdam Giants regiment was led by a man reported to be over 7 feet tall, and included at least one mercenary well over 8 feet; none of the Giants were under 6 feet. (James Tanner, the dean of human growth studies, has observed that this was probably the tallest group of men assembled before the advent of professional basketball in America.) Other militaries emulated Frederick (taller soldiers had longer strides, could thrust their bayonets farther, and had an easier time reloading their long rifles) and Hall argues that it was at this point in history -- when tall soldiers were more coveted than shorter ones -- that the market (and moral) value of height first became institutionalized. 
 As a man of a mere 5 feet 5 and three-quarters inches himself, Hall is on something of a quest, seeking not just to understand the science and culture of stature but also to come to terms with what the cartoonist Garry Trudeau has called his ''inner shrimp'' -- that distinctive ''I'm smaller than the rest of the world so I hope I don't get beaten up'' outlook that is imprinted at an early age and never dispelled, no matter what our final adult heights. Mixing traditional science reporting with personal anecdote, Hall ranges widely across popular culture and the scientific literature to explore such issues as what the average height of a population can reveal about culture and society (Why are the Dutch so tall? And why are Americans becoming relatively shorter?), and how the Food and Drug Administration's approval of human growth hormone as a ''treatment'' for undersize children in 2003 changed the politics and science of height. Here's an interesting philosophical question: If what matters psychologically is relative height, by treating short children with growth hormone, aren't we creating a whole new class of undersize ''victims,'' the untreated kids they surpass in height? Have we launched an arms race of avoiding shortness? If so, it's not hard to understand why. As Hall puts it, height matters because ''it clearly has an impact on social perceptions, romantic interactions, workplace hierarchies and our self-perception long after we've stopped growing.''
 As a formerly Very Short Person, I found two of Hall's arguments especially interesting. The first is that how tall you end up as an adult matters less than when you grow. Hall cites a wealth of evidence suggesting that how much you are paid in adulthood is determined by how tall you were at age 16. Everything that happens during the crucible of adolescence -- when ''personality ... is perched on a fulcrum of self-esteem so fragile it's like an I-beam balanced on an egg'' -- is emblazoned deeply into consciousness, and stays there. Even after becoming a six-foot-tall adult -- not to mention a famous, multimillionaire cartoonist -- Garry Trudeau declined to attend a high school reunion because ''adolescent hierarchies have a way of enduring; I'm sure I am still recalled as the Midget I myself have never really left behind.''
 The other appealing argument Hall makes is that there is evolutionary and moral value in being puny. Darwin himself intriguingly suggested that while there is a general evolutionary bias toward greater size, survival-of-the-fittest pressures on our ancestors, who were smaller than their primate competitors, may have led to the development of human intelligence. Or, as Hall speculates, ''the relative smallness and weakness of smaller human ancestors might be responsible for nothing less than the birth of civilization.'' Speaking from his own experience, Hall surmises that being short as a boy forced him to develop not only greater mental quickness and wit but also greater empathy and understanding. 
 And made him also, perhaps, a more appealing mate than his alpha male competitors. (Hall is happily married -- to a woman almost four inches taller -- with two kids.) Herewith some advice for the ladies: When surveying the scrum that is the schoolyard (or the boardroom), resist the strapping breast-beater at the top of the pile and consider the runt at the bottom. He's less likely to become president, but he might turn out to be the better husband.

 An American Life.

How should we think about the very rich? The easy answer, of course, is to mime their uncritical celebration by television and Madison Avenue -- even though great wealth has provoked sharp doubts and even bitter anger since the nation's founding. In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson subtly anticipated our complex feelings by substituting ''the pursuit of happiness'' at the end of Locke's familiar statement that all men had an inalienable right to ''life, liberty and property.'' Benjamin Franklin then offered practical application of his co-signer's implicit ideals by telling in his autobiography how, after business success, he'd found a far richer life cultivating science, philosophy and public service. Getting and spending, these founders seemed to say, should be thought of as instruments, not ends, lest we (their heirs) recreate Old Europe's ancient inequalities, and thereby undermine our fragile new democracy. 
 A century later, a second American revolution, ignited by industrialization, gave us a new generation of leaders -- we might even call them the second founders. But as they swept away Jefferson's hopes for an enduring rural, agrarian and small-town America, their new world of cities, factories and vast inequalities indeed revealed all the dangers our original founders had feared. 
 Presiding over that Gilded Age (or robber-baron era, if you prefer), those second founders -- the Rockefellers, Fricks, Morgans, Goulds, Carnegies and Mellons -- between the Civil War and 1900 transformed America into the world's largest and fastest-growing economy. Exercising far more unchecked power than today's billionaires, these gargantuan figures grew rich beyond imagining, but also nearly overturned democracy, as poverty and corruption spread like a plague across the land. 
 David Nasaw's ''Andrew Carnegie'' and David Cannadine's ''Mellon'' recreate those tumultuous times through the often related stories of two of the best-known second founders. Yet reading these two hefty biographies (between them almost 1,700 pages), one quickly sees that their subjects' contrasting characters, behaviors and worldviews -- and the reactions they produced -- give us much to reflect on, including our own era of globalization and postindustrial titans.
 At first glance, Carnegie and Mellon look a good deal alike. Both were of Scots descent (Carnegie freshly arrived, Mellon a first-generation Scotch-Irish American). Both acquired fortunes in the violent, exploitative and dankly polluted world of coal-and-steel Pittsburgh, the Silicon Valley of its day, through ingrained Calvinist self-discipline and persistence -- calling them ''inspired'' at what they did is not too strong -- but also, despite their pious denials, through ruthlessness and deceit. Eventually both also won fame and influence as more than industrial titans, Carnegie as America's best-known philanthropist and Mellon as one of the nation's longest-serving secretaries of the Treasury and as founding donor of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. 
 But there the similarities end, and a revealing set of juxtapositions emerges. Carnegie was always far better known, not just because his authentic rags-to-riches life fit the Horatio Alger archetype (unlike Mellon, who'd been born to wealth) but, more important, because he -- also unlike Mellon -- early on mastered the new ''science'' of public relations, cultivating the press as assiduously as Donald Trump has done today. The popularity of his autobiography and of essays like ''The Gospel of Wealth'' in fact made him an unusual Gilded Age star -- Bono-cum-Warren-Buffett is the best analogy -- because even as he helped drive the forces upending the old Jeffersonian world, Carnegie was declaring (seditiously, quite a few fellow plutocrats thought) that all the new wealth was ''not chiefly the product of the individual ... but largely the joint product of the community,'' and that therefore, while ambitious men might naturally pursue great fortunes, those riches should be returned in one's lifetime to do public good. To the era's compassionate conservatives, his famous claim that ''the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced'' deftly attached the first founders' values to the new super-rich, an updated affirmation of both Calvinist ''election'' and democracy's community duties (though to middle-class reformers and working-class radicals, such talk was scandalous pettifoggery, a bromide that substituted charity for equality).
 Who was this unusual man? Carnegie had migrated to Pittsburgh in the 1840's as a young boy who grew into a diminutive dynamo -- he was just over five feet tall -- of charm, diligence, intelligence and stamina. As Nasaw -- a historian at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York -- fluidly and colorfully tells the story, Carnegie swiftly rose from teenage messenger to district manager of the powerful Pennsylvania Railroad, promoted by bosses who valued his whirlwind drive and mastery of railroads' complex accounting and scheduling systems. 
 He soon discovered how smart young railroad men made real money. Following his bosses, he borrowed heavily to invest in the stock of railroad contractors who'd secretly taken the railroad managers as silent partners, thereby assuring a steady flow of well-padded contracts. By his mid-30's, Carnegie had followed this early ''crony capitalism'' to his first fortune, at which point he decamped for Manhattan and further fortune, first by selling the bonds of the same railroads and suppliers, then by managing his growing investments in them. 
 Yet over the next 30 years, he was hardly a conventional capitalist: working only a few hours each day, he spent most of his time as a budding author, world traveler (he usually spent half the year abroad), patron of the arts and bon vivant who chastely charmed (as best one can tell, since he lived with his mother) attractive women half his age, as well as an ever-growing list of presidents, prime ministers, scientists, professors and poets on both sides of the Atlantic.
 Riding the winds of industrialization, his fortune soared. Shifting shrewdly from iron to steel, then from rails to structural steel, he constantly reinvested in modernization -- as well as in clandestine price-fixing and market-pooling deals, hefty rewards for pliant Republican legislators and party bosses (he hated Democrats), and when needed, ruthless suppression of organized labor. (His avowed support for both ''socialism'' and Herbert Spencer led one wit to call him a ''Socialist Darwinist.'') 
 When his partner Henry Clay Frick violently put down the Homestead strike in 1892, the damage to Carnegie's cherished reputation was enormous -- but he was privately soothed by the profits he and Frick made thereafter. Expanding to produce steel-plate armor for the American and Russian navies, by 1900 Carnegie was manufacturing half the nation's structural steel and soon after, thanks to J. P. Morgan's purchase of his empire, he arguably became the world's richest man.
 Still boundlessly energetic at 65, Carnegie threw himself into a new role as the world's pre-eminent philanthropist. Many thought he resembled Santa Claus -- he was now plump and wore a snow-white halo of hair and beard -- as he bestowed free public libraries by the hundreds here and abroad; offered free tuition to students and pensions to professors; built scientific research centers, art galleries, music halls and museums; endowed a fund to honor everyday heroes; and -- as World War I grew closer -- earnestly financed all manner of projects devoted to world peace. The war's carnage shattered not just the Gilded Age's residual faith in benign private wealth but the confidence of its most visible exponent: Carnegie died, cut off from friends and influence, less than a year after the war ended.
 Andrew Mellon, who presided over a much more diverse business empire -- an iron-and-steel fortune, Gulf Oil, Alcoa, Koppers, Carborundum, the Mellon National Bank, and extensive insurance, real estate and shipbuilding investments -- by comparison comes across today as a paler, more pinched, much less likable or even interesting figure. Unlike Carnegie, Mellon was unusually reserved, even dour. (For years, he walked daily to his office past scores of employees without speaking a word.) He was also, for most of his life, parsimonious. On his death bed, when his son Paul asked for two small Corot paintings, he replied by offering to sell them for $50,000. He was, needless to say, not the ideal father. 
 Nor, apparently, was he the ideal husband. Like Carnegie, he waited until his 40's before marrying a woman half his age. Carnegie's was by all accounts a happy union, but Mellon's wife soon felt so neglected that she commenced a scandalous affair, then abruptly left him. Her husband's passions, according to his biographer's account, were far more animated by the bitter divorce proceedings than they ever had been by the marriage.
 Cannadine, a historian at the University of London who wrote this book at the request of Mellon's son, consequently faces greater difficulty than Nasaw in holding our interest, a problem he occasionally compounds. As Mellon builds his art collection, for example, we're never taken past the prices paid (and some tawdry backroom dealings) to savor the beauty of what he'd bought. But Cannadine does try to raise Mellon in our estimation by emphasizing how, late in life, he chose public service as Treasury secretary -- a post he held under Harding, Coolidge and Hoover -- and then, shortly before death, gave us the National Gallery of Art, an authentic treasure. One senses Cannadine would like us to feel these acts somehow balance -- on an admittedly complicated measure -- Mellon's far less attractive behaviors.
 Yet do they? Cannadine exaggerates the economic impact of Mellon's tax-cutting at a time when few earned enough to pay income tax at all, and is too uncritical of his support for the gold standard, tight money and balanced budgets even as the Depression closed in, policies modern economists agree exacerbated the economy's collapse. And we soon learn that Mellon compromised the integrity of his ''public service'' at Treasury by continuing to oversee his business empire, covertly intervening with other government officials for his own interests, and even using the department's tax specialists to prepare -- and artfully minimize -- his own taxes. (The ''brazen lies'' Mellon told in defending himself, Cannadine writes, reflect the fact that ''he simply never understood or accepted the notion of conflict of interest.'') And Mellon's art collecting leaves its own troubling questions: ignoring a strict trade embargo on the Soviet Union, Mellon secretly paid millions for old masters that Stalinist agents had taken from the Hermitage on the dictator's orders, money that indirectly helped finance the starvation of millions of Russian peasants who resisted collectivization.
 After leaving office when the New Deal arrived, Mellon soon found himself facing both congressional and Internal Revenue Service investigations. Cannadine argues (rather lopsidedly) against the merits of these inquiries, conducted, as he sees it, in a ''stridently hostile'' soak-the-rich atmosphere fostered by Franklin Roosevelt's ''infuriating raillery'' and demagogic desire for revenge against men like Mellon. Under such circumstances, we are meant to see nobility in Mellon's donation of the National Gallery -- but not all will, after noticing that he focused on it only after hostile tax audits began and waited until the jury in his prolonged tax trial adjourned before proposing his gift to the government. 
 Do these long-gone men offer us lessons for today -- and for our own titans, the Gateses and the Buffetts (not to mention the Lays, the Ebberses and the Kozlowskis)? Earlier in our own Gilded Age, the financier Ivan Boesky, now disgraced, declared to surprisingly wide acclaim that ''greed is healthy.'' Is it -- or is it merely greed? America's first founders left us with one set of answers, while the second gave us another. It's fair to say we haven't decided yet which is right.

HEADLINE: The Intuitionis

BYLINE: By Michael Kimmelman. 
Michael Kimmelman is the chief art critic for The New York Times. His latest book is ''The Accidental Masterpiece.''

 BODY:
Late one sunny morning last month, I stopped by to visit Kiki Smith. I recognized the house in the East Village by the wind chimes on the fire escape. Climbing a staircase, from which the banister had strangely been removed, I found Smith, ethereal and laughing as usual, in her studio on the second floor, which doubles as her living room. It's blue and white, airy and peaceful, with tall glass doors at one end (opening onto a scary, straight drop, as if down the rabbit hole) to an overgrown garden. 
After the usual pleasantries, Smith told me that her French dealer, Jean Fremon, would be arriving shortly to see a few outdoor sculptures she had installed in a pair of gardens up the street. Then she was expected on Canal Street at Harlan & Weaver, the print maker (''It's my second home,'' she said, and she wasn't kidding, as she had been going several times a day, day and night, for months, I learned). She was working on a series of etchings of flowers, a theme inspired by her mother's death last year. The prints had to be finished in time for an art fair, she explained, and she had only a couple of days left in town before she flew to London for a different show, for which she was in Philadelphia a day earlier, to cast various sculptures of tree limbs and moths.
 I was losing track but smiling, pretending to keep up. After Harlan & Weaver, she went on, she had to rush uptown to Pace Editions, on the edge of Chelsea, to design, using Photoshop, a series of silk banners for yet another show, which would be timed to coincide with her retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art. 
 Oh, and that evening, she said, she had a seat at a benefit -- she couldn't recall for what, offhand. 
 At 52, Smith has a thick halo of gray hair and porcelain skin liberally tattooed with turquoise rings and stars. They make rows on her fingers, arms and legs. She also wears strings of necklaces and bracelets stacked atop one another. You can hear when she's coming because her jewelry jingles. She looks a little like the woman who runs the local candle shop. Her hands constantly fiddle: she's always drawing or making things out of clay or whatever. Partly, it's a way to distract her gaze. Mostly, for her, making art is like breathing. 
 Since she emerged during the late 70's, she has become an art-world fixture, pushing contemporary art past 70's feminism, reinventing some of feminism's themes and processes and its activist spirit. Early on, she was involved with the collectively run center for art, ABC No Rio, on the Lower East Side. Her first solo show in New York, in 1988, included sculptures of a terra-cotta rib cage and a cast-iron version of the digestive system that resembled a radiator. A show at the Museum of Modern Art two years later had 12 silvered glass water bottles, labeled with bodily fluids in gothic letters, a separate piece made up of crystal sperm and a work called ''Dowry Cloth,'' an irregular Modernist grid made of sewn felted wool and human hair. 
 She belongs to a dynasty. Her father, Tony Smith, was one of the preeminent postwar American sculptors. Her mother, Jane Lawrence Smith, a onetime Broadway actress and opera singer before she married and raised three daughters, returned to her stage career later in life, working in experimental-theater productions and independent films until not long before she died. (Her mother's great friend Tennessee Williams was best man at the Smiths' wedding.) 
 Artists like Barnett Newman and Richard Tuttle came by the Smiths' big Victorian house in South Orange, N.J., and Kiki remembers how contemporary art was ''like air, completely ordinary, although I couldn't have told you what Minimalism meant, and I hardly saw representational art until college, which I guess was partly what attracted me to it. It seemed like a way for me to have a life of my own.'' 
 She likes to repeat the anecdote about herself and her two younger twin sisters, after school, making paper models of octahedrons and tetrahedrons for their father to use for his sculptures. ''We were the local weirdos, until it became cool and exotic, when I was a teenager, to be from the family of an artist.'' Beatrice, one of the twin sisters, died of AIDS during the 80's, and some of Kiki's art about the human body as an object under duress, and sometimes dead, was no doubt a response to AIDS, which also afflicted many other people Smith was close to then, like the artist David Wojnarowicz. Her other sister, Seton, has become a prominent artist, too -- she makes large, fuzzy Cibachrome photographs mostly of architecture and landscapes -- a path she settled on as a teenager, while Kiki was still struggling to figure out what she wanted to do with her life. She was a lousy student. She studied baking for a while; she trained as an emergency medical technician. 
 Finally, she found her way to a career that, in retrospect, has come to seem inevitable. During the last 20 years or so, her work has been in innumerable exhibitions around the world. The latest, the traveling retrospective that opens this month at the Whitney, was organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. 
 Because Smith's father, an architect by training, made famously huge, metal, geometric abstractions that came to be crudely associated with a kind of macho Minimalism during the 60's, Kiki's work is often casually regarded as a reaction against his. But this assessment is deceptive. Her prime subject has been the body -- or, in the feminist vein, the body as social and political object. She makes work both about what the body looks like on the outside, in all its sagging flesh and fragility, and about what it produces on the inside: pus, urine, sperm, breast milk, excrement, spit. Gray's Anatomy was, for a while, a big source. She has made prints of internal organs like the liver and sculptures of arterial systems made of colored glass beads. She has made sculptures of severed limbs and fingers, like reliquary objects, and one of the Virgin Mary, flayed. Much of the work is delicate and lovely, but more than a few people have found figures like the one she devised with beeswax and papier-mache, called ''Tale,'' of a woman on her hands and knees trailing excrement, revolting. 
 Her longtime friend Tom Otterness, also a sculptor, remembers how, some years back, he was sitting with his future wife, Coleen Fitzgibbon, ''when we lived downstairs from Kiki on Ludlow Street. Suddenly, Coleen looked out the window in horror,'' he says. ''There was this flayed body being lowered outside the building. It was one of Kiki's creations, all bloodied with a rope around its neck, heading down to the street, off to the shippers. This sort of thing went on all the time.
 ''The image I have,'' he continues, ''is of her plunging her hand into her chest and pulling out her heart and her guts and saying: 'You think you make personal work? Well, try this.' Her art goes further than everyone else's, I think. She's willing to go anywhere with it, and sometimes I'm just left dumbfounded. She's fearless. Totally fearless.''
 Smith also produces dreamy, gossamer works of animals and mythical and religious figures -- motifs and themes she recycles in tissue-y paper and fabric (often traditional, craft-oriented, ''women's'' materials, she likes to point out), along with bronze, wax, plaster and just about anything that catches her fancy. ''My mom always said to trust one's inner voice,'' Smith said. ''I think a lot of making art is listening to yourself. I got that from both parents. What always attracted me about my father's work was that it was also intuitive.'' 
 That October morning I visited her, everything in Smith's house (she lives alone) was in artful, slightly exquisite disarray. Plaster and bronze sculptures of figurines were laid here and there; fading roses filled crystal vases. An oval mirror hung above a weathered blue chest, bouncing light across a kitchen table crowded with coffee cups, half-finished drawings, books, scraps of silk for that banner project at Pace, rubber stamps and tiny metal birds made for yet another project, and a Steuben vase she is designing, delicately etched with fingerprints. One of Rachel Whiteread's sculptures of a bookshelf hung on the wall nearby, in lieu of a bookshelf. A painting by Tony Smith (green-and-red abstract wormy shapes) topped the mantelpiece. 
 So much of Kiki's art, I thought, has come to look like her house, and vice versa. In Venice recently, she devised an entire suite of rooms, which blurred, as she does in her studio and living room, the line between art and life. 
 An assistant, Beka Goedde, calmly manned a computer and the phone, which rang off the hook. ''My father made his work with us around,'' Smith said. ''I like Betsy Ross as a model, too, the quilting bee, sitting around with your friends making art, asking what they think, so that you get the benefit of everyone's opinions and so it's not just about you in your you-dom.''
 This brought to mind what Otterness said about Kiki's parents' house: ''It was really a woman's house. Breakfast was with all of the gals in the kitchen while Tony would be somewhere upstairs, having some sort of liquid breakfast. He had a formal dining table that had these small sculptures on it, which he moved around. Kiki's mom was a sort of grande dame, and she would demonstrate how to have a salon or a cultured life. I think a powerful part of what Kiki is now is modeled on her childhood home. 
 ''She may be cooking and making stuff on the table and then clear it off or not,'' he added. ''I've seen curators come into Kiki's house and just die, seeing the way she kept the space, with the cats rolling on her drawings and peeing on these precious works. I think it is a way for her to knock an edge off the work, not to feel intimidated by it.''
 As if to underscore her lack of pretense, Smith speaks in the disconcerting voice of a little girl who loves ballerinas and wants to be a veterinarian, although she can be very much all business when it comes to her work (and to any description of herself -- she never had any interest in ballerinas or veterinarians, she insists). Elizabeth Murray, the painter, once described another artist whose air of otherworldliness belied what was actually a firm grasp on the world as ''somebody who's always there when the cookies are being counted.'' This suits Smith too.
 Beka interrupted to remind Kiki that, before leaving the house, she needed to finish a promised anniversary present for friends -- a table made out of a liquor crate (akin, I supposed, to the cardboard boxes and crates with which her father sparsely furnished the South Orange house), painted black and stenciled with gold decorations. Kiki and Beka, armed with screws and a power drill, settled onto the living room couch facing the television. 
 Isn't it odd, Smith idly remarked, how the television won't turn off? I turned to look at the black screen, which flickered with light, like static. I turned the power switch on, then off. The lights kept flickering.
 Yes, I said. Odd. 
 Some years back, when Smith and I were visiting the Metropolitan Museum, she pointed out some ancient South American earrings and pendants, which she thought were trembling slightly in their glass cases -- maybe from subway vibrations, nearly half a mile away, she ventured. (Again, I smiled.) The thought prompted her to say: ''I'm fascinated by those Survival Research Laboratories that take dead animals, like cats, and reanimate them by motorizing their limbs. It's like Frankenstein or Jesus or Osiris.'' Then she likened a metal incense burner in the Islamic galleries, with its lacy perforations for releasing the smoke, to ''a human body with skin. After all,'' she said, ''skin is really a lacy surface, it's porous.'' 
 And she also loved how, looking at some Assyrian reliefs, the figures in them ''morphed between humans and animals, birds and humans.''
 ''I dream about birds,'' she added. ''Birds are stand-ins for souls.'' Over the years she has made many sculptures and drawings of birds, dead and alive, of nests, of humans and birds, of half-human-half-animal creatures, of animals giving birth to humans -- all sorts of mythic, fairy-tale transmutations, including a version of the classic ''Daphne,'' who turns into a tree, made of plaster with glass twigs. 
 ''First I made anatomical drawings, drawings of particles and cells,'' Smith recounted, ''then works about systems in the body, like the lymph and the digestive system, then works about skin, then whole figures and sculptures based on different cosmologies. And then, through the cosmologies, animals.'' 
 ''I see animals as a natural progression in my work,'' she said.
 In all cases, art is clearly an animated creation for Smith -- it has its own aura or soul, beyond just expressing what is in hers. The writer Marina Warner observed that Smith's works look ''unblinkingly at the life in dead things.'' When she was a child, Smith had little shrines and mummies for dead animals and put necklaces on them. Her mother described her making ''a shrine to Mother Mary.'' 
 ''I was raised Catholic,'' Smith told me. With pencil in hand, she had buried her nose in a book of tattoo drawings called ''Historic Flash,'' from which she copied roses, doves, eagles and hearts to add to the Steuben design. ''Catholicism is a body-fetishized religion,'' she went on. ''It's always taking inanimate things and giving meaning to them. Also my father was ill for the last 20 years of his life. So I thought about the body a lot. 
 ''I always say I'm Catholic -- but a cultural Catholic,'' she added. ''I wouldn't say I'm a spiritual person, although I pray every day.''
 To what? I asked.
 She glanced up. ''That shifts around.'' She laughed. ''I try to cover all my bases.''
 Which perhaps partly accounts for the mixed allusions not just to Catholic rituals but also to Greek myths and to popular fairy tales. She has made drawings of birds breathed out of a woman's mouth (''anima,'' Warner pointed out, also means breath). Ancient Egyptians believed that statues could breathe in the souls of pharaohs. Smith even compares the repetitive process of making cardboard models for her father -- and how he kept using these same geometric forms over and over, in subtle variations -- to ''saying rosaries.'' 
 ''My father's work was actually expressionistic and superemotional,'' she has said. ''People think his works are cool because they are geometric, but the idea that a curve is more expressionistic than a straight line is just ridiculous.'' ''Source,'' one of her father's abstract sculptures shaped like a figure in a fetal position, from which extends an appendage, an L, like a limb, Smith described as a body with ''a limp penis -- not that I literally read his work as anthropomorphic. I don't. I see it as a bundle of energy attached to an object with no energy. But formally, the work translates into my work as a body. I've been influenced a lot by it, and by the idea of the appendage, of how our arms and hair hang off the body,'' she added. ''That's what I was thinking about when I made 'Tale,' '' the sculpture of the woman trailing excrement, which is, then, not just a sculpture about abject corporeality but also her psychological riff on his high Modernist abstraction. 
 She noticed my curious expression. ''Yes, you could also make something out of my seeing my father's work as a limp penis.'' As she once told The Los Angeles Times: ''Prior to my father's death I was having a hard time committing to a career as an artist, but that's not because of who he was -- it was because of who I am. It's true, though, that I felt I shouldn't compete with him, and that those feelings went away after he died. But I don't see my work as diametrically opposed to my father's -- some people say it is -- and I've never felt the need to metaphorically 'kill' my father or deny his existence. I love my father's work and learned a lot from him -- the most important thing being that art is a practice of necessity. He absolutely had to do his work and it always came first in his life, and though I probably didn't like that as a child, I'm very sympathetic to it now.'' 
 Her ability to connect works like his and hers, to make wild imaginative leaps, has had a liberating effect on younger artists. Some people find her work precious or melodramatic. But good artists give other artists permission. And Smith has done that.
 Fremon, Smith's Paris dealer, a cheerful, elegant, white-haired man all in black, arrived to see the outdoor sculptures, and they set off down the street talking business. The first sculpture, of a woman lifting a large doe, was just up the block, beside a tiny, winding pebble path behind a locked gate in a narrow garden. Fremon nodded a couple of times to register approval when Smith's phone rang. Taking the call, she hurried the dealer toward another, scruffier park, also behind a locked gate, with bins for recycled garbage. There, a fountain she devised, in the unlikely shape of an upper denture, flipped upside-down to create a shallow basin for water, prompted Fremon to nod again. Smith got another call. While she was distracted, I asked Fremon if he had found her this scattered on other occasions. He couldn't recall a conversation, he said, in which she was not preoccupied. It was a form of shyness, he thought.
 She hailed a taxi for Harlan & Weaver and waved goodbye to Fremon. Felix Harlan and Carol Weaver, the print publishers, have a workshop in several large, unfussy white rooms filled with tables, files, vats and sinks for acids (to etch copper plates). The latest versions of Smith's flower prints, along with lunch, were laid out around a table when she arrived. 
 Smith had been designing these etchings -- of peonies, hydrangeas, hyacinths, freesia, a yellow rose, lilies and gladiolas -- for about a year. She had long admired the sepia photographs of flowers by Adolphe Braun, which became templates for French wallpaper during the 19th century, a transformation that dovetails with Smith's own penchant for recycling images and for domestic handicrafts like wall stenciling. She started these prints when her house was full of condolence flowers after her mother died. She photographed the bouquets, and the photographs became models for the prints. They are made by combining four copper plates: yellow, red, blue and black. 
 Over lunch she burnished, or lightened, the black plate for the hyacinths, which sat on the table in front of her, next to a sandwich and apple pie. Later, I asked Maggie Wright about Smith. Wright, an engaging, bookish young printer, has been at Harlan & Weaver for a decade, and, assisting Felix and Carol, started working with Smith shortly after that. ''She's insatiable,'' Wright said. ''Work is so much a part of Kiki's life, of who she is, that she doesn't put it down. It is like her arm, this thing that travels with her. She lives in her art, in the way she lives in her studio. Some artists who come here leave their work when they go home. She doesn't. And she likes having people around -- she wants input, collaboration. 
 ''She has her moods,'' Wright added after a pause. ''She doesn't always know where she's going. It's not easy. But you feel like you've gone through the process with her by the time you come out the other end.''
 Smith gave her version: ''I have no real ability to do things, no inherent aptitude. So I have to use my weakness to my advantage. Etching is great because it lets you work on the same thing again and again. It's generous.
 ''Also, the hardest thing is to get past your taste -- past your own formulaic way of doing things. Otherwise you're stopped by what you know, which is limited. Chance is what a lot of artists use. In my case, I'll arrange ways for things to be unpredictable. That's what's nice about working on prints. You're working with other people so you have to let go of some of your own ideas. Almost everything I do involves collaboration.'' 
 During the late 70's and early 80's, Smith was part of a collective named CoLab, which organized hit-and-run events around New York -- a precursor to all the chic collaboratives doing ad-hoc exhibitions with young artists nowadays. CoLab and Smith epitomized an emerging spirit in the art community, which soon would spread from SoHo to the East Village, where she finally settled: socially engaged, embracing all sorts of humdrum and eccentric materials, along with street life and various new, personal brands of narrative. ''We had about 40 people in the group,'' Smith recalled. ''Anyone could be a member if you just went to a few meetings. The idea was to think up different forms for the presentation of art -- exhibitions, radio transmissions, television shows, suitcase shows, murals. We made paintings together. We did drawings and copied them as banners. We even had a pretend band. For me it stopped being interesting when people started repeating ideas and CoLab started to be institutionalized. I had no interest in institutions. Besides, by then, everybody had had affairs with as many of the others in the group as possible. So it fell apart organically. But for a while it was a model of a community, outside the usual gallery situation, without anybody having to sanction us. These things can't sustain themselves for long.''
 From Harlan & Weaver, Smith grabbed another cab, hustling uptown to the slicker workshop of Pace Editions, where Andre Ribuoli, a computer whiz, was waiting for her. He manages Pace's digital studio. It was late afternoon by then. Ribuoli was going to help her design banners or flags for the Pace show. These had to be done swiftly, before she left for London. Smith brought small sample swatches of silk printed at a fabric printer's, with three images (recycled drawings) of a wolf surrounded by stars, a bird and a moth, and of two tattooed women: one reclining like a mermaid on what looked like part of a giant snake. The silk was soft; the images were muddy. Ribuoli had printed a thinner, rougher fabric swatch with better resolution but duller color. Smith fingered it, disapprovingly. 
 ''I want the fabric machine-washable,'' she said. 
 Ribuoli suppressed a smile. ''Do you think anybody would want to throw your art in a washing machine?'' he asked. 
 ''I want something real,'' she said, curtly. ''Who cares what people want?''
 They settled behind his computer to Photoshop the images. 
 She told him what colors and effects she wanted. He invented them digitally. She wanted the look of old, hand-colored prints. Uncomfortable without something physical to do herself, she grabbed the mouse occasionally and voiced some frustration when the process bogged down or when she and Ribuoli talked at cross-purposes. 
 ''Everybody young can do this stuff,'' she said. ''I loved what I was doing at Harlan & Weaver because etching is hands-on and has specific limitations. You've got the copper plates. You're working on a particular scale. You've got just a few colors. Here you have infinite colors and an infinite scale. It's seductive but you can waste a lot of time and never finish.''
 ''I've seen it seduce many artists,'' Ribuoli chimed in, ''And they'll forget about what they first wanted to do.'' He called up the wolf image with the stars and bird. Smith said: ''The wolf I drew in the 90's, the stars and bird last year. I really love reconfiguring things. There's an economy to it. Images become like an alphabet. They can get married but still fool around.'' 
 ''I used some of these same images for a carpet design and for a bag I did for Coach,'' she added. ''I like the idea that you can walk on them and carry them around. It's my way of playing house -- being in the real world.'' 
 Ribuoli turned the background yellow, then blue, then purple. ''Every color is beautiful,'' Smith said. ''I'm going insane.'' After much toing and froing, Ribuoli proposed a purplish blue that offset the soft yellow they had devised for the wolf's eyes and for the stars, which turned the image into a night scene. ''You see,'' Smith said. ''I never would have thought of that exact color but I love it. That's what I mean about being open.''
 Later I asked Ribuoli whether I had correctly perceived some initial tension. ''What you sensed is right,'' he said. ''We jumped right into this, without preparation. We've worked enough over the years so I hope she knows we'll get it done. But she had a tough schedule, so there was an urgency.
 ''I think Kiki loves the technology as much as there are things about it she can't stand,'' he said. ''Either the computer can't do something fast enough for her or the techniques are convoluted. It's a challenge. Always. But I've got to tell you, no B.S., she's one of my favorite artists to work with. You see the excitement and happiness -- and there are times she says she wants to kill me. But she frees me up. She makes me laugh.'' 
 Two days later, after Smith and I bought a takeout lunch from City Bakery, we headed back to Pace. She had skipped the benefit, it turned out (she still didn't recall what it was for) and returned instead to Harlan & Weaver, working into the night on the etchings. Now she needed to finish the banners. As we walked down the street, she talked more about her upbringing:
 ''Sometimes I'm angry that my sisters and I weren't better educated,'' she said. ''Neither of our parents graduated from college, so they didn't see it as something we needed to have. It hadn't hindered them. They didn't have any ambition for us except to find ourselves.'' Seton and she found themselves in art. ''It makes life so easy when you have a passion for something,'' she continued. ''It's hard when you don't.''
 Smith said she takes occasional classes on weekends. 
 ''It's hard to imagine you have the spare time,'' I said.
 ''I'm not always this hectic,'' she said. ''I took one about optical weather phenomena, another about Asian architecture, and about ceramics. Art is about being curious. About knowing how things hold meaning -- trying to make sense of oneself, one's environment.'' 
 She spent the rest of the afternoon redoing everything she and Ribuoli had done before. The process seemed smoother now. Over chocolate-chip cookies, the two of them arrived at new colors for the backgrounds. As a little joke, they Photoshopped in droppings for the small bird in the wolf banner. Smith left it for Ribuoli to refine the details. She had to pack for London.
 ''I like having limits,'' she said. ''That was the nature of my father's work. He had the octahedrons and tetrahedrons. I have the animals and people.''
 Bill Hall, who oversees the Pace print shop next door, caught Smith on the way out. She had begun several soft-ground etchings -- portraits of friends -- and he wanted to remind her about them, to see what she planned to do. They were spread out for her. She looked through them, and frowned. Another time, she said.
 Smith then thanked Ribuoli and turned to the door. 
 ''Another great day,'' she said. The sound of her jewelry echoed down the hall.

HEADLINE: Shopping for a Stafford

BYLINE: By Jonathan D. Glater

 BODY:
STUDENTS looking to take out federal Stafford loans, one of the most popular ways to finance higher education, can be forgiven for thinking it doesn't matter which lender they use. After all, the interest rate no longer floats. Nearly all banks and loan companies charge the same rate, 6.8 percent, as set by Congress last summer (that rate, incidentally, is a ceiling, not a requirement).
 But picking a lender is no simple task, even for a Stafford. Banks and loan companies dangle an array of seemingly enticing ''benefits,'' from waivers on fees to rewards for automatic payment withdrawals from a bank account. Some are meaningful, some less so. Trouble is, they are hard to compare. 
''Unless you're a finance major or a C.F.O. or someone who's actually going to put it into a spreadsheet, it's not something a regular consumer is going to grasp,'' says Roy Chernikoff, vice president and northeast regional sales manager for Wachovia Education Finance. So how to identify the best deal? Lenders and financial-aid officers offer some guidelines:

IMMEDIATE CASH BACK -- First and foremost, they say, choose a lender that waives the origination fee, the 2 percent due when the loan is taken out, because that money is pocketed immediately and is contingent upon nothing. ''That brings out one of the best principles you can put out there -- make sure that if you're getting an offer, it's cash in hand,'' says Tom Joyce, a spokesman at Sallie Mae, the largest student lender. Sallie Mae does waive the origination fee, and in some cases the 1 percent fee charged by the guarantor (the company that guarantees the loan on behalf of the government).

LOWERING THE INTEREST RATE -- Lenders might offer either to cut the interest rate or reduce the principal balance, in both cases usually after a series of consecutive on-time monthly payments (12, 24, 36, 48 or some combination). Given a choice, an interest-rate reduction is likely a better deal. ''A 2 percent interest reduction over X number of years, versus a 2 percent principal reduction, is actually worth a lot more money,'' says Michael H. Shaut, chief executive of Student Loan Xpress. Trimming your principal, he says, is, in effect, a prepayment, ''so that's beneficial, but then you're at the regular interest rate going forward.''
 Do the math. You owe $20,000 at 6.8 percent interest. If the principal is reduced 2 percent, you owe $19,600 with annual interest of $1,333 in the first year. If the interest rate on the full $20,000 is cut just one percentage point, annual interest is $1,160.

IS THE BENEFIT WITHIN REACH? Students move around a lot and are likely to miss a reminder to make a payment. Or they just come up short at some point. Loan executives estimate that only 10 to 15 percent ever receive the discounts that depend on making on-time payments.
 That's why Nancy Coolidge, coordinator of student financial support for the University of California system, says immediate benefits that are certain trump iffy ones in the future every time. ''If it's not given upfront or given automatically to every single borrower, we give it almost no weight in deciding is this a good deal for our kids,'' she says. And a mere promise to provide a benefit, she warns, ''is not something that the student can enforce in court.''
 Most benefits are not part of the legally binding promissory note signed when taking out a loan, and unscrupulous lenders may not honor them. For that reason, a college's preferred lender list has value: the companies are established and have a stake in staying in the good graces of financial aid officers. But just because a lender advertises a benefit doesn't mean it will automatically show up in two, four or six years. The lenders are probably hoping you'll forget about it.
 And of course, benefits vanish when a loan is consolidated -- when multiple loans are refinanced with a single lender, ideally at a lower interest rate.

GETTING GUIDANCE -- Financial-aid administrators just don't have the time to walk each student through every possible loan, and they may not have even evaluated what their students are being offered. In the end, due diligence is up to the borrower.
 The Project on Student Debt, which is financed primarily by the Pew Charitable Trusts, helps families weigh benefits, at www.projectonstudentdebt.org/loandiscounts.vp.html. Another site, www.simpletuition.com, features a calculator for assessing the value of loan benefits in various situations. One for Staffords should be up and running in a few weeks, according to Kevin Walker, its chief executive.
 ''It's not easy to calculate,'' he says. ''We actually had a mathematician from Berkeley set up our base calculations.''

 BODY:
Geography Awareness Week, which starts next Sunday, may be too brief: despite Hurricane Katrina, 33 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds can't find Louisiana on the map, according to a 2006 survey by National Geographic-Roper; despite the war, 63 percent can't find Iraq. But take heart. November is also the beginning of bee season, a time to celebrate students who know where everything is. Now to January, about 15,000 schools will hold contests sponsored by the National Geographic Bee in hopes of sending a winner to state and, at right, national competitions. By then, hardly a domestic question is in sight. Below, questions from those levels.

HEADLINE: Study Finds That Europeans Prefer Smoke-Free Hotels

BYLINE: By JENNIFER CONLIN

 BODY:
Gone are the days of joking that the two seating sections in French public spaces are ''smoking'' and ''chain smoking.'' A recent survey of more than 12,000 hotel guests in Europe found that nearly 72 percent of French hotel guests now prefer a smoke-free environment, even beyond their room, suggesting that the French may embrace their planned 2008 smoking ban. 
 This year's J. D. Power & Associates European Hotel Guest Satisfaction Index Study also revealed that 69 percent of hotel guests across Europe prefer a nonsmoking environment, not far off from the 79 percent of hotel guests in North America wanting smoke-free hotels. The lowest group to support smoke-free hotels was 57 percent of the guests who live in Spain, and the highest group to endorse no-smoking hotels was 76 percent of British and Swedish travelers.
According to Linda Hirneise, executive director of J. D. Power's global travel practice, Power decided to add the question to the survey, wondering if a preference for smoke-free hotels might be emerging in Europe, given that both the Marriott and Westin Hotels and Resorts have adopted smoke-free environments in the United States and in Canada.
 ''We expected the number to be much lower than 69 percent,'' Ms. Hirneise said, adding that she suspected that an American brand, such as Starwood, might now feel comfortable leading the way toward European smoke-free hotels. ''The problem is that conference planners in Europe are still feeling cautious about not letting people smoke,'' Ms. Hirneise said. ''Maybe this survey will help change their minds.''

HEADLINE: All Housing Markets Are Local, Except When They're Not

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
THE macroeconomic data on housing has been grim in recent weeks. On Oct. 25, the National Association of Realtors reported that the price of existing homes fell in September by 2.2 percent from the year before. The next day, the Commerce Department reported that the median price of new homes sold in September fell a whopping 9.7 percent from September 2005.
 These are national figures. But real estate, like politics, is said to be a local business. Any broker worth her salt can easily come up with reasons that the malaise currently gripping the national housing scene doesn't affect her particular local market -- because of its excellent public schools or the lack of supply or the easy commute it affords. 
Are the brokers right? Is housing a single national market or a collection of hundreds of small markets?
 The answer, as one might expect economists to say, is both.
 ''Housing is becoming more of a national market and an international market than in the past,'' said Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale and author of ''Irrational Exuberance.'' While huge price increases have been confined to particular areas, like Las Vegas, Professor Shiller, a careful student of speculative activity, has noticed Vegas-like attitudes popping up among homeowners in places like Milwaukee. In this boom, he said, ''national attention has been drawn to the real estate market.'' 
 An evolving credit culture has also helped forge a national housing market. ''Instead of getting mortgages from local banks, as they did 20 years ago, people all over the country get mortgages from capital markets,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. That means that access to credit and interest rates don't vary much across the country. 
 Yet in many ways the market remains intensely local. Last month, Economy.com issued a report that examined the prospects for housing in 379 metropolitan markets. Over all, the consulting firm expects home prices to fall by a small increment in 2007. But there's wide variation. 
 ''About 100 of the 379 metro areas will experience some kind of measurable price decline, and they together make up about half the nation's housing stock,'' Mr. Zandi said. 
 On a map, areas most at risk for short-term pain look like a Democratic fund-raiser's view of the country: Northern and Southern California, the Northeast and most of Florida. Meanwhile, in the remaining 279 metropolitan areas constituting most of the rest of the housing stock, prices should remain flat or rise. It's a tale of two groups of cities.
 Looking further into the future, Economy.com also projects that a small minority of the nation's metro areas -- about 20 -- will experience a crash over the next several years. (Economy.com defines a crash as a double-digit percentage decline, from peak to trough.) Reno, Nev., is expected to fall 17.2 percent by the fourth quarter of 2008 from the fourth-quarter peak in 2005. But some markets are expected to hold up fairly well. Home prices in Portland, Ore., are expected to fall just 0.8 percent by 2009.
 What accounts for the differences? Not all housing markets are created equal. Homes in some cities have appreciated much more than average during the last several decades, and might be expected to fare better in coming years. 
 Consider the places that a group of economists has dubbed ''Superstar Cities.'' These are coastal urban areas where a scarcity of land, local regulations that prevent rapid development, and a plethora of well-paying jobs in thriving industries (rich people) have combined to create fertile housing microclimates. 
 ''If they were stocks, they'd be high-priced growth stocks,'' said Todd Sinai, professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Professor Sinai co-authored a paper on Superstar Cities with two other professors, Joseph Gyourko of Wharton and Christopher Mayer of Columbia.
 Looking back to the period from 1950 to 2000, the economists found that in San Francisco, a Superstar City, housing prices grew at a real annual rate of 3.5 percent a year --more than twice the national average. 
 In less-glamorous burgs, where land is comparatively plentiful and high-income jobs have been scarcer, price advances have been muted. From 1950 to 2000, housing prices in Buffalo grew at 0.54 percent a year, for example.
 To the degree that New York, Boston and San Francisco maintain their appeal to high-earning workers and companies, they might be insulated from long-term declines in prices. Of course, past performance is no guide to future performance, and not all Superstar Cities are created equal. 
 MACROMARKETS, a company founded by Professor Shiller, has introduced futures contracts on housing prices in 10 markets. The contracts, traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, allow investors and builders to hedge bets or make investments based on how they think housing will do in 10 cities, among them superstars like New York, Boston, San Francisco and San Diego. 
 Professor Shiller cautions that the contracts aren't very liquid. But on Friday, the futures market predicted that by August 2007, housing prices in the Chicago area would fall by 5.4 percent. On the same day, investors were betting that housing prices in Las Vegas would fall by a larger margin -- 7.1 percent -- in the same time frame. 
 The predictions by Economy.com and the futures markets provide a more nuanced view of the national housing market than the monthly data released by the National Association of Realtors and the Commerce Department. But lately, the data has all been trending in the same negative direction, even for the Superstar Cities. Professor Shiller said, ''They're all sending roughly the same signal.''

HEADLINE: Living in China's World 

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KOTKIN

 BODY:
AMERICA remains a colossus in Asia, for now. But between 1999 and 2004 trade among Asian countries jumped more than 80 percent, to $1.2 trillion, according to the World Trade Organization. Trade within Asia has come to exceed trade between Asia and the United States.
 China has become the largest trade partner of almost every country in Asia. Even the exchange between the longtime rivals China and India ballooned over the last decade from about $1 billion a year to more than that each month. Of the $600 billion in foreign direct investment into China since 1978, most has come from within Asia. 
Asia is a giant, competitive, interdependent regional economy that affects the world. Long-standing cross-cultural ties are strengthening, too, because of booming intra-Asian tourism and student exchange. ''Korean wave'' dramas and pop music can now be found in much of Asia, alongside Japanese and Hong Kong fare. And it's now often hard to distinguish national origins of dubbed television and movies.
 ''China Shakes the World'' by James Kynge (Houghton Mifflin, $25) is not about this interconnected Asia. But Mr. Kynge -- who spent more than a decade in China as a journalist, becoming the Beijing bureau chief of The Financial Times -- offers a nuanced and superbly reported read about China rattling the West.
 How to convey China's ascent? In a clever gambit, Mr. Kynge travels to a huge gouge in the earth near Dortmund, Germany. The hole was made by Shen Wenrong, the founder of Shagang Steel. The company began in the 1970s as an illegal smelter of iron bars whose unlicensed production enabled a Chinese textile mill to expand without the approval of government planners. Transgression, Mr. Kynge rightly argues, is the secret of China's takeoff. Over three decades, Mr. Shen took some colossal risks, and eventually had one of Europe's huge steel mills crated and shipped to the Yangtze valley. He paid just $24 million, the plant's value in scrap, but it can make high-grade steel for autos, one of China's strategic frontiers.
 Prato, Italy, is another of Mr. Kynge's destinations. There he finds that the Tuscan textile industry enjoyed a boon from Chinese laborers who paid ''snakeheads,'' or smugglers, extortionist fees for perilous passage to Europe. But some of those laborers used their acquired know-how and connections to reproduce the garment-making operation in China at a fraction of the cost, putting their former bosses out of work.
 When European intellectuals rant about ''predator neoliberal capitalism,'' they are talking about the United States, but in Rockford, Ill., Mr. Kynge finds that a Chinese company, the Dalian Machine Tool Group, has devoured Ingersoll Production Systems, scattering the latter's skilled American employees to $7-an-hour jobs at Lowe's. Then Dalian stalks the big prey, the Ingersoll Milling Machine Company. It is thwarted only when someone tips off the Pentagon, which helps to quash the deal.
 Skim Mr. Kynge's fuzzy forecasting about the coming protectionist tide, but soak up his telling vignettes. Liu Chuanzhi extracted excrement from public toilets to make fertilizer as a student, was sent to the rice paddies during Mao's Cultural Revolution, survived and founded Lenovo, which within 20 years gobbled up the personal computer division of I.B.M. 
 Thus does the author illustrate how China's rise is not cliche but momentous -- even larger and quicker than that of the United States in the late 19th century.
 Mr. Kynge devotes almost half of his book to China's vulnerabilities. It has 16 of the world's 20 most-polluted cities, while its water resources are not only dwindling but highly contaminated. China is already an ecological catastrophe. Worse is to come.
 And pollution is not even the foremost problem. Corruption has murdered social trust. Mr. Kynge describes how officials in Henan province set up a blood bank that became contaminated with H.I.V. -- as many as a million peasants were infected -- but instead of shutting it down, the officials arrested activists and bullied journalists. 
 Stolen exam results, impostor police officers: scam after scam highlight profound governance problems beyond the lack of freedom. Mr. Kynge hints that while the Communist Party is still in full control, officials' transgressions of laws and regulations have devolved into an institutional crisis for a capitalist economy. 
 Potent new consumer tastes are absent from the book, but Mr. Kynge deftly uses the familiar theme of piracy to illuminate the underappreciated complexities of China's economy. He tells the story of Yin Mingshan and his Lifan Motorcycle, which is made with technology lifted from Honda -- but is itself copied and undercut by other Chinese pirates. By 1998, more than 1,000 Chinese companies were making 15 million motorcycles, 5 million more than were sold. No wonder it's hard to make money in China.
 Profitless producers retain access to nearly free capital from what passes for banks in China and to new technology from foreigners desperate for a joint-venture that could connect to those elusive 1.3 billion customers. Mr. Kynge estimates that 90 percent of the manufactured products in China are in chronic oversupply, because when copycats squeeze profits in core products, Chinese pirates branch out to other knockoffs. They read pirated translations of John F. Welch Jr., and go straight for their competitor's gut.
 Then they go overseas. Lifan went to Vietnam, to undercut Honda there, starting anew a pirates' rush to the bottom. But Honda fought back, setting up a factory on a Chinese island across from Vietnam to secure Chinese knockoffs of Japanese parts. Here -- with Japanese and Chinese companies slugging it out over Vietnamese market share -- we glimpse Asia's unparalleled mutual opportunities and strains.
 Intensifying prosperity and integration in Asia represent a return to historic patterns. But never before have both China and Japan been so strong simultaneously. 
 For international studies at American universities, today's principal unmet challenge is understanding the vast global connections not centered on America and how the success of China or Vietnam may contravene social science models. 
 For American-based international businesses, the imperative is to capitalize not only on growth within individual Asian countries, hard enough for outsiders, but simultaneously in the countries they do business with, regionally. China-Japan-Vietnam, Japan-China, Korea-Japan, India-China, not to mention India-Persian Gulf and China-Africa -- that's globalization, too.

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Electoral Tea Leaves

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WALL STREET has been debating how the stock market will respond to this week's election results. One strategist, however, thinks a more useful exercise is to try to determine which sectors of the market will win or lose depending on who wins or loses in Washington. 
 Some industries are likely to be affected more than others because the two main parties differ in how strictly they think the government should control business activities, said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research. He focused on certain sectors, including several involved in health care, that Americans love to hate. Their shares are especially vulnerable to a decline, he said, if there is ''a better showing by the Democrats,'' a deliberately vague expression that could include the party's taking control of one or both houses of Congress.
Providers of managed care, like health maintenance organizations, are ''everyone's favorite enemy,'' he said, followed closely by drug distribution companies. If Democrats succeed in placing tighter restrictions on them, then ''they can't make as big a profit,'' he said.
 The same could apply to big pharmaceutical businesses. ''Drug companies are easy to attack because they have high profit margins,'' Mr. Levkovich said. Those margins, a benefit of patent protection, are the payoff for the risk that companies take when they spend great sums to develop drugs that often turn out to be duds, he said.
 Other sectors that may take a post-election hit include military contracting, which could suffer if the Pentagon receives smaller allocations under a House controlled by the Democrats, and service industries that employ low-paid workers; their margins could face pressure if Congress approves a stout increase in the minimum wage.
 Mr. Levkovich is playing down the prospects of a big decline in the broad market. His greatest macroeconomic concern related to politics is over the prospect of legislation that would slow or reverse the globalization trend of the last decade. He said, though, that support for such initiatives could come from either side of the aisle.
 ''My single biggest fear is economic nationalism or protectionism,'' he said, ''not party politics.''

DATA WATCH -- One noteworthy item on a thin calendar of economic reports is the snapshot Thursday of the nation's trade balance in September. A Bloomberg News poll of economists estimates a decline in the deficit to $66 billion from $69.9 billion in August.

HEADLINE: High on Grass

BYLINE: By Rob Walker

 BODY:
While new-and-improved products are a constant feature of the consumer landscape, it's still unusual to encounter novelty in the form of raw material. This may help explain the vogue for bamboo. Obviously this fast-growing plant (it's actually a grass) is not new, either as a living thing or as the basic stuff of fabricated goods. Think, for example, of 1950's-era tiki decor or, alternatively, centuries of Asian culture. Even so, bamboo has in the past five years or so gradually acquired a whole new level of popularity in the United States and maybe even a mystique. 
One reason for this is its peculiar flexibility as a material. That it can serve as the key ingredient of a hard floor or a soft bed sheet makes it sound like some industrial wonder stuff concocted in a conglomerate's skunk-works program; that it simply grows out of the ground seems even more wondrous -- and wondrous in a way that's a little more resonant with the present consumer zeitgeist. Bamboo has long been popular with the ecoconscious set (because, unlike a clear-cut forest, a well-managed bamboo crop replaces itself in a few years). Recently it has also acquired a chic factor that something like, say, hemp, never quite attained. As Susanne Lucas, chairwoman of the board of the World Bamboo Organization (a nonprofit group that promotes bamboo as a material and as an economic development tool), puts it, the grass has become ''fashionable.''
 That being the case, the other key to bamboo's popularity might seem surprising: instead of highlighting the stalks or other visual bambooness cues, recent manufacturing technologies make it possible to minimize them. David Bergman, a New York architect and the founder of Fire and Water Lighting, which specializes in projects that are both ecofriendly and stylish, figures that bamboo's popularity has been partly helped by this disguising effect. Bergman has a particular interest in what he calls transparent green, meaning design that's ecologically sound but doesn't show off that fact -- avoiding the ''granola look,'' as he has put it. So while you can tell that bamboo floors aren't teak, you might not know at a glance that there's anything ''green'' about them. ''It doesn't have to scream that it's an ecomaterial,'' he says.
 This same curious mix of chicness and invisibility applies to the more recent bamboo fabrics. Dan Keesey, a partner in Bamboo Textiles, one of several companies selling such items, says the breakthrough in textiles was the development of a process that turned bamboo into a rayonlike fiber. Big chains like Target and Bed, Bath and Beyond now sell bamboo sheets and pillows -- and emphasize their softness. 
 All of this has happened at a time when eco-awareness has evolved into the sort of trend reducible to a Vanity Fair-friendly formulation like ''green is the new black.'' And of course, becoming an ''it'' material is a double-edged business. For starters, there isn't just one kind of bamboo; there are about 1,400 species, according to Lynn Clark, a professor at Iowa State University who has studied bamboo for decades (and is still discovering new species). Bamboo flooring and other woodlike uses can have a range of qualities depending on whether the stalks were harvested at the appropriate age: too young or too old and the results can be too soft or too brittle and easily damaged. Moreover, much of the bamboo that makes its way to the American consumer comes from China, which means that it's being shipped around the world -- generally a greenie no-no. Finally, overseas bamboo harvesting is often opaque, with little information available about working conditions or whether crops are really being managed in sustainable ways. TreeHugger, an environmental-lifestyle Web site, has even argued that sometimes a maple floor made from locally harvested wood under a forest-management certification program can be a more environmentally sound choice.
 But that's the flip side of an ecomaterial transcending its eco-ness: bamboo has the vague aura of being green-friendly but not too crunchy -- trendy, in other words. Bamboo has become so well known, in fact, that Bergman, the architect, sometimes steers clients away from it. ''I've had one or two instances,'' he says, ''where we've said, 'It's too done now.' You don't want to do something so of-the-moment that it dates the design.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Lose Ground as Hopes for Rate Cut Fade

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market gave up ground last week as oil prices rose and government reports suggested that the economy remained relatively strong. 
 Those reports -- one on Friday, for example, that said that unemployment in October had fallen to a five-year low of 4.4 percent -- set off speculation that the Federal Reserve would delay cutting short-term interest rates for months to come.
Wal-Mart, which posted disappointing sales in October, lost 6.3 percent for the week while Verizon, which said it was losing local phone business to cable competitors, dropped 5.5 percent. Those were the two worst weekly performances in the Dow Jones industrial average. Microsoft climbed 1.3 percent and Exxon Mobil rose 1 percent, putting them at the top of the weekly list for the Dow.
 For the week, the Dow fell 104.22 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 11,986.04. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 13.04 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 1,364.30. The Nasdaq composite index lost 19.83 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 2.330.79. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.72 percent from 4.67 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Below are the more racially and ethnically diverse of the nation's larger four-year institutions (at least 2,000 degree-seeking undergraduates in fall 2005). Since 67 percent of the American population is white, the list includes nonprofit colleges and universities reporting an equal or lower proportion of white students and no other race in the majority. (Some students decline to identify race; at the colleges below, the percentage of non-white students would exceed 33 percent even if all the unknowns were white.) But race is just one indicator of a heterogeneous experience. The new mantra in the multicultural movement is economic diversity. The list also includes the percentage of students receiving federal Pell grants, which are given to low-income students.

HEADLINE: Dance Hall Daze 

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
IT was 11:30 p.m. on a Friday, and Lisa Welsh, a mother of three from Ramsey, N.J., wanted to dance.
 There was only one problem.
''Apparently, there's this magic list that I'm not aware of,'' Ms. Welsh, 42, said as her girlfriends -- slim and sleekly dressed if perhaps (by their own admission) past prime club-going age -- waited to enter Marquee in West Chelsea. Ms. Welsh was not hopeful; they had already been turned away from the Pink Elephant, a hot spot on 27th Street. ''I don't understand the list,'' she said. 
 She had discovered what many New Yorkers know: that going out dancing these days is akin to directing a strategic assault in the name of fun. 
 It wasn't always so. Bottle service came to clubland in the early 90s, allowing club owners to bestow preferential treatment on anyone willing to pay $300 and up for a bottle of liquor. And now there is also paperwork (the list), strategic dressing (the bigger the name on your handbag, the better) and, most important, wrestling with the doormen, PR girls and other attitude-heavy types who control the velvet ropes that separate the fabulous (automatic entry) from the not-so (wait-listed).
 What's an impulsive party girl to do?
 Well, to avoid the aforementioned hassles, forget Chelsea and the meatpacking district of Manhattan. I spent a recent Friday and Saturday attempting a nonexhaustive -- though sometimes exhausting -- survey of the Lower East Side and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, two other neighborhoods known for their night life.
 I visited five places in Manhattan (Maia, Baraza, Babel, Dark Room, and an underground party in a restaurant) and four in Brooklyn (Galapagos, Supreme Trading, Black Betty, and Savalas). And some of these I found by simply following the music. Night life in the city is serious business, generating an estimated $9.7 billion in economic activity annually, according to the New York Nightlife Association. That weekend, I made some ground rules for the adventure: no bottle service, no cover charges over $20 or long waits. I wanted to get swept up by a bassline and a roomful of strangers; I was looking for something accessible but also cool (I still wanted to be able to brag about my weekend on Monday). Was I asking too much? I meant to really find out. I even wore flats.
 On my first night out, after a cruise through club row, the area around West 27th Street that is home to cavernous venues like Crobar and dens of exclusivity like Bungalow 8, I hit the Lower East Side. Between Houston and 14th Street on Avenue B -- where, until just a few years ago, even cabs were in short supply -- there are now at least a dozen bars, lounges, restaurants and clubs whose entrances are behind velvet ropes. Below 14th street, the velvet ropes have more to do with crowd control than selectivity. 
 Still, the presence of these barriers represents one of the biggest changes in the city's night life. Even classic dives like Don Hill's in SoHo, the current home to the name-brand hipster dance party MisShapes, have a velvet rope. ''It gives you an opportunity to turn away undesirables -- not people that don't look right, but people you think might be problematic,'' said Nicki Camp, a longtime promoter and an owner of Don Hill's. 
 On Avenue B, I sneaked past an unattended velvet rope in front of a new Turkish restaurant, Maia Meyhane. Inside, as a handful of patrons smoked from a hookah and looked on, a dozen people danced in the narrow area between the tables and the D.J. But like many small downtown lounges, Maia does not have a cabaret license, a legal requirement for an establishment that has dancing. (An owner said they were working on it.) 
 As of August, the last month for which data was available, there were 238 licensed cabarets in New York City, meaning that most of the city's thousands of bars and lounges don't have them. Though the licenses are inexpensive -- at most, $1,000 for a club that can hold 600 or more people -- outfitting a club to comply with fire and safety codes can be costly and the application process byzantine. 
 Of course, not having the proper paperwork is about as effective at curbing dancing as a ''Restroom for Customers Only'' sign is at curtailing bathroom use, and parties at illegal cabarets are plentiful and advertise heavily online and in magazines. 
 But bar owners are fearful of attracting the attention of the police -- which most often happens when someone files a noise complaint by dialing 311 -- because they can summon other city agencies that have the power to close any bar that operates a dance space without a cabaret license. (To remedy this, one bar owner installed an override switch in his basement dance room. If the police arrive, he flips it and the D.J.'s tunes are replaced by Sinatra.)
 More rules may be coming to the night life business -- a host of city and state regulations and initiatives, drafted in the wake of several night-life related deaths and governing everything from security to underage drinking and also bottle service, are being considered. 
 But back to the beat. If Avenue B is full of roving college kids and out-of-towners, Avenue C still feels a bit more renegade. The higher rents that inspired club owners to institute bottle service and $15 cocktails have not quite reached Avenue C yet. 
 There are far fewer velvet ropes and more welcoming small spots like Nublu, Babel and Baraza, where there is a more eclectic mix of music -- Middle Eastern, Brazilian -- and a suitably international crowd.
 At 1 a.m., Baraza, a narrow mojito bar, was packed so tightly with people dancing the samba that there was barely room for another body. Soon, the dancing turned to stroking; this place was almost too sexy -- a whole different kind of sweaty fun. Onward and southward I went.
 Among certain people -- acolytes of the Web site Last Night's Party; Gawker readers; undergraduates -- the Ludlow Street bar, Dark Room, earned its reputation as a sort of breeding ground for the hipster-musician. But it's also a low-key and reliable place for retro tunes.
 The basement bar, with its low ceiling, has the feel of a suburban rec room. It's easygoing fun, if not exactly something to brag about. ''The weird thing is, they play 80s music, and everyone's, like, 20,'' said Andre, a grad-school-age Frenchman who lives upstairs. He gave me a look. I am not, like, 20. (Nor did he mean 20, like, literally -- the doorman scrupulously checks IDs) 
 Just before 3 a.m., I set out for the financial district and a party in the China Room, which is a restaurant in the basement of an office tower. Given the extra restrictions created by the city's smoking ban, the nervous club owners, and parochial security -- Guy Furrow, better known as Miss Guy, the veteran D.J. and club fixture, said a bouncer once forced him to throw out his gum -- many former club-hoppers have retreated to the relative liberty of underground events.
 ''I like the secret agent vibe of the smaller things,'' said Travis Antolik, 34, a film editor who spent the 90s going to clubs like Twilo but who now prefers one-offs. ''It is a breath of fresh air if you're used to something that's more commercial.'' 
 This party, thrown about once a month by a couple of downtown promoters, is substantially braggable. It's clandestine (not even a sign outside pointing to the restaurant); thanks to a rented light box and fog machine, the lithe, artsy crowd, bathed in rainbow light and wisps of smoke, looked extra hot. But it was so late, er, early, that only a guy in a goalie mask was in the mood to dance. So, at 4 a.m., I scrambled into a cab home. On Saturday night, I begin my tour at Galapagos in Williamsburg. It is mostly known as a performance space, but sometimes the D.J.'s are so good that people can't help but boogie in the scant inches between tables. On this night, the only dancing was in the private wedding party in the back room.
 A few blocks over, Supreme Trading, a large bar with a gallery space and an all-night smoking garden, was dead. At 1:15 a.m., in search of dependability, I stopped in at Black Betty, a Moroccan lounge and restaurant that features live music on most nights and groove-inspiring D.J.'s the rest. It didn't disappoint. 
 Dozens of people strutted to reggae and soul. The dancing was languorous and lazy; this crowd is too cool to hurry. 
 Ebony Brown, 25, a model and singer, and her boyfriend James Spooner, 30, a filmmaker, were taking a break on a couch. Though they are the kind of couple that could easily get past any velvet rope in town -- they go dancing once or twice a week -- they prefer more laid-back clubs. ''We feel like we're in a music video'' at bigger clubs, Ms. Brown said. ''The last time we went to Lotus, it was for a Farnsworth Bentley shoot. Every now and then it's fun to take part, but it's such a facade.'' 
 JUST as I am starting to mellow, I get a text message (the club-hopper's bat signal) from a friend. She was at Bembe, a two-story club in a former shoe factory beneath the Williamsburg Bridge. It is known for its raucous Saturday salsa parties. ''It's packed,'' she wrote. ''Music good, remixed Fela Kuti. No velvet rope but maybe could use one.''
 I'm either lost or halfway there when I see a clutch of people on a concrete patio bathed in red light. Inside, the space is narrow, with a brick wall across from a long bar and with a few booths in front. The dance floor, which is in the back, is hopping. I never make it to Bembe.
 This place, Savalas, is essentially what I was looking for: easy to get into and unpretentious. ''The getting loose and dancing doesn't really exist anymore,'' Mr. Camp, of Don Hill's, had told me.
 But that's not true. It's there, but you just have to go farther afield -- Avenue C instead of Avenue B, a Wall Street restaurant instead of the meatpacking district, Brooklyn instead of Manhattan. And anyone who makes the effort will be rewarded with the sense of discovery that's so crucial to a good night out. 
 At Savalas, there will be a conversation with a drunken stranger about philosophy and cats, and a moment or two with the bar's resident flirt who's bathed in cologne. But for now there is just movement and spilled drinks. Two girls in shorts and cowboy boots are grinding against each other. Under a single multicolored light, the D.J. is bopping. At 3:30 a.m., people are jumping, hands in the air, hips jiggling. There is no posing.
 At 3:50 a.m., the bartender announces last call. The crowd boos, and then we all quickly get back to dancing. Thank goodness for the flats.

HEADLINE: Reclaiming a River, and a Downtown 

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
IN the first phase of a stunningly ambitious $3.6 billion plan intended to transform swaths of this dated industrial city into a sleek metropolis, developers plan to undertake four million square feet of new construction in the next three years. After razing sections of the downtown, they plan to build stores, condominiums, a minor league baseball park, parking garages and a movie theater.
 Details of the first phase, which is to cost $1.6 billion, were formally presented to the City Council on Oct. 24 by the developers, Struever Fidelco Cappelli -- a partnership of three major East Coast firms. 
 As part of this phase, the developers plan to uncover a total of 1,900 feet of the Saw Mill River, a tributary of the Hudson that was paved over during the early 20th century to make room for factories.
 That section, which now runs beneath Getty Square and Larkin Plaza downtown, will be exposed again, and the riverbed will be cleaned of years of accumulated debris. Along the newly exposed riverfront, stores and restaurants will be built along new walkways. 
 The Yonkers project represents a rare New York State use of a procedure known as tax- incremental financing -- an urban-redevelopment tool popular throughout the country. Such financing enables local governments to borrow against tax revenues anticipated from a major redevelopment to raise the money for infrastructure needed for the development -- roads and sewers, for example. 
 For tax-incremental financing to work, the school district and the city must be the same taxing entity, which is the case in Yonkers. Elsewhere in New York, other than in New York City, most school districts are independent taxing authorities.
 For Yonkers, the first phase of the redevelopment is expected to generate $14.8 million annually in tax revenues; $150 million in bonds will be issued and used to build new garages, repair sewers, install new water mains and improve roadways and bridges. Without those improvements, according to Peter Klein, a project manager for Fidelco, the project could not move forward. 
 If the approval process proceeds on schedule, construction of the first phase will begin in the spring and will take about two years. So far, the reaction from the City Council, which is the lead agency, has been positive. 
 ''It's an extraordinary opportunity for Yonkers to redevelop its downtown and open up the Saw Mill River,'' said Chuck Lesnick, the City Council president. ''It will bring workers and residents downtown and create an environment in which businesses can thrive.'' 
 The Planning Board also has to approve a handful of zoning changes.
 Plans for the initial phase call for a mix of functions in a downtown area to be called River Park Center, bordered by Nepperhan Avenue to the south, New Main Street to the west, Palisade Avenue to the north and Elm Street to the east. It includes 465,000 square feet of street-level retail space -- intended for big-box discounters as well as smaller stores -- and 475,000 square feet of office space in three buildings; dozens of restaurants; and a 16-screen movie theater.
 Framing the area, there will be two residential towers with 950 condo apartments and public and private parking. A 6,500-seat ballpark will be surrounded by the stores and the theater. 
 In another 4.3-acre downtown area, near the Cacace Justice Center, redevelopment plans call for a 150,000-square-foot office building, about six stories tall, and a 75,000 square-foot, 17-story hotel with 150 rooms. More than half of the space in the new office building will be occupied by city agencies currently in a 100,000-square-foot building that would be demolished. 
 In a section that the developers are calling Palisades Point, on two Hudson River waterfront sites south of the Yonkers train station in Getty Square, the proposal calls for two more residential buildings, with 436 condominiums, 8,000 square feet of ground-level retail and restaurant space and two parking garages.
 The condos will be built of brick and glass, with floor-to-ceiling windows offering views of the New York City skyline to the south and the Tappan Zee Bridge to the north. They will look down on the rooftop garden of a shorter building housing restaurants and a parking lot. 
 While the gritty cityscape around it is transformed into modern glass and steel structures and riverfront paths, City Hall itself, a 99-year-old Beaux-Arts brick structure where the City Council meets beneath a stained-glass rotunda, will remain physically unchanged.
 Mr. Lesnick, the City Council president, said he and his fellow council members welcomed most of the changes, but were concerned that downtown gentrification could force out some of the city's poorer residents. ''It's not that anyone will be directly displaced by the new construction,'' he said, ''but the halo effect of the redevelopment could cause property values to rise throughout the city. And that's something we have to pay attention to.'' 
 The first phase of the project would be completed in 2009. Plans for the second and third phases, which include areas throughout the downtown and industrial sections on the west side of Yonkers, are to be presented to the City Council at mid-month. 
 The Yonkers project is the largest for each of the partners in the development company, said Mr. Klein of Fidelco. All are major players in the realm of mixed-used development.
 Cappelli Enterprises, in Valhalla, is building $2 billion in residential and commercial projects in White Plains and New Rochelle. Struever Brothers Eccles & Rouse of Baltimore is active on that city's waterfront and was selected this fall to develop Washington's southwest waterfront. Fidelco Realty Group in Millburn, N.J., is redeveloping the former Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, N.J., and has several projects under way in Newark.
 The project in Yonkers is almost as large as the development proposed for the Atlantic Yards in downtown Brooklyn, which has been described as the biggest project in that borough's history and is one of the biggest ever in New York City.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 2006

 CORRECTION:
The ''In the Region'' article in Westchester, Connecticut and Manhattan copies last Sunday, about the first phase of a $3.6 billion plan to redevelop sections of Yonkers, referred incorrectly to a major project being proposed for Brooklyn. The Atlantic Yards project is near downtown Brooklyn, not in it.

HEADLINE: Intersection Showcases a Quartet Emblematic of New York 

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
EVEN in the current stampede of building renovations, it is unusual that all four 1920s Park Avenue co-ops at the intersection of 89th Street have put up ''sidewalk shed'' scaffolding for masonry repairs. Although all were built within the same decade and are superficially similar, each of the structures presents a different architectural statement. As a group, they illuminate the variations of a building type peculiar to New York. 
 Park Avenue achieved its brand-name status beginning in the 1910s, as developers put up comfortable, even luxurious, multiple-family dwellings, usually 13 to 15 stories high. 
It was in 1923 that Michael Paterno completed the first at this intersection, 1105 Park, one of the first designs of the legendary Rosario Candela. But relative to Candela's later superluxury work, it was a modest achievement, with lightly variegated brick and abbreviated trim, except for the three-story carved limestone decoration around the main entrance, Paterno's ''P'' in the shield at the top. The window openings have a deadening regularity. 
 The lobby, though, is of some note, an elegantly reserved space: polished marble and plain plaster walls, much more tasteful than average at the time. More often, lobbies were encumbered by the meretricious ornamentation that developers, both past and present, seem to think will attract buyers. 
 Diagonally opposite, at the southwest corner, the developer Keitt P. Walker put up the austere neo-Classical 1088 Park in 1925. This facade is somewhat more refined than that of No. 1105, and was designed by Mott B. Schmidt, widely known for his genteel town and country houses. He included a majestic double-height entry portal, a gateway to the barely visible back garden -- an unusual feature in a building type where the rear area is typically a throwaway space of concrete and razor wire. Schmidt also made an effort to group the windows in bays, to give more life to the facade.
 Next came the southeast corner, 1095 Park, designed in 1929 for the Tishman family by Schwartz & Gross, their longtime architects, and completed in 1930. By then, the building law for apartment houses had been revised, allowing greater heights.
 No. 1095 has 18 floors, setting back from the facade in terraces to a penthouse level. The architects here accommodated a growing taste for modernism by giving a few twists to the usual historical forms. At the fifth floor, the classical triglyphs -- in Greek architecture, small flat panels with two vertical grooves -- are instead rendered with four streamlined indentations. And instead of the distribution of the ornament all over the facade, most of it is concentrated in a few areas, like the luscious panel of terra cotta above the 12th floor. 
 In the same year, De Pace & Juster's 1100 Park, on the northwest corner, arrived, its medieval styling rather romantic for this generally sober thoroughfare. 
 Working with cast stone of a sandy-orange color, the architects created on the first three floors an irregular cityscape of up-and-down sections, like the staging for some Shakespeare play set in Italy.
 Most of the facade is just regular reddish brick, but brick ends flank the windows, protruding like those on an ancient castle or keep. At the top, the cast stone bursts out again in a romantic flurry of cornices, towers and terraces, like some distant hill town. 
 Among Park Avenue intersections, this one rates pretty high on the architecture scale, with only No. 1105 (this reporter's home for the last 18 years) verging on the quotidian. Even so, its Candela branding can interest real estate brokers as much as No. 1088's garden or No. 1100's picturesque rooftop.
 Several years ago, the co-op of No. 1105 cleaned its facade, returning the brick and limestone to the way it must have looked in the 1920s. But the building's intricate copper cornice was not cleaned, and thus still bears years of a rather lovely oxidation. Should it, too, have been rendered ''like new''?
 In the recent past, the co-op at No. 1088 also decided to clean. But, apparently as an economy measure, only the three bottom floors were done. In the process, black stains caused by drips at the joints of a band of terra cotta were only partly cleaned off. Now, against the fresh surface, the stains are more noticeable than they used to be.
 The same co-op has set a standard for window replacement: Shareholders must match the appearance of the original multipaned design. Although it is possible to spot the newer windows, their homogeneous look lends a certain propriety to this well-mannered building. 
 Windows were obviously overlooked at No. 1095 and No. 1100, both of which depend greatly on the interplay of variegated brick and the small panes of the intricately textured steel casement windows. No. 1100, especially, has a pronounced medieval character, and an emphasis on small bricks as decoration.
 Today, each building has successive waves of differing replacements ranging from innocuous to awful. Huge panels of plate glass can corrupt the strongest, most sophisticated architectural character.
 It is a brave co-op board that requires the retention of such high-maintenance items as steel casement windows, so only an idealist could hope that they could survive. And Earl Kramer, president of No. 1100's board, said that the building at one time had no particular standard for replacements, and that both full pane windows and plain double-hung sash were the norm. 
 Later, for the sake of consistency, the board set a standard of single panes. And now, he added, advances have made possible replacement windows made of modern materials but with the general appearance of casements. The board is considering changing the standard again, to make the windows more congruent with the rest of the facade.

HEADLINE: Maids, Spas and Sweeping Views

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
WHILE virtually all signs point to a housing market gone limp, sales at two opulent projects in Hoboken and Jersey City indicate that there is still vibrancy at the very high end.
 At the 55-story Trump Plaza condominium tower rising in Jersey City, more than 100 of 445 units priced from $425,000 to more than $2 million were sold in the first 10 days. At the W Hotel under construction beside the Hudson River in Hoboken, 22 of 36 condos offered at prices from $775,000 to $4.5 million were sold in three weeks.
The Trump building, the first of two planned towers that will be the tallest residential structures in New Jersey, has only dirt, foundation, scaffolding and cranes right now at its site at Washington and Bay Streets, a block from the Exchange Place PATH station. The W, which will be the first of its brand in New Jersey, currently has a similar look at its site on River Street in Hoboken. 
 Nevertheless, both projects have sales offices near their construction sites, with scale models, streaming video, detailed floor plans and mockups of finished rooms. 
 At Trump's lavish sales office on the 13th floor of an office building on Montgomery Street in Jersey City, condo shoppers can get a bird's-eye view of the construction site and the panoramic view across the river that many tower occupants will enjoy.
 The sales office has the same back-lighted onyx walls, Macassar ebony portals and French limestone floors that are planned for the two-story lobby of Trump Plaza, as well as kitchen, bath and room models in the two interior styles that will be offered -- one more ''glamorous,'' the other more ''contemporary,'' according to the sales agents.
 The amenity package includes maid service, valets, porters and the use of Zipcars -- Mercedes Benzes available for hourly rent. In addition, 41,000 square feet of ''lifestyle attractions'' have been built into the project, including a Roman-style spa, a golf-game simulator, a children's playroom, an outdoor pool, a rooftop green-space and a landscaped plaza.
 One-, two- and three-bedroom units at Trump Plaza will range from 750 to 2,050 square feet.
 A majority of the condos -- about 300 -- will be one-bedroom units, according to Dean S. Geibel, managing partner of Metro Homes, a partner in the project. All of the one-bedroom units at the W in Hoboken were quickly sold, leaving the larger units, priced at $1.85 million and up.
 Mr. Geibel's company, based in Hoboken, originally proposed the two-tower project in Jersey City and sometime later joined with Trump to build it.
 ''We determined there is a strong market for young professionals, especially those working in Jersey City's 'Wall Street West' and the Wall Street across the river, who want the Trump lifestyle of on-the-go urbanity,'' Mr. Geibel said. Many of the amenities are pitched directly to such a buyer, he noted -- the ultra-modern stainless-steel washer-dryer unit tucked under the kitchen sink, for example.
 Mr. Geibel acknowledged that the common charge was higher than at other waterfront properties -- $560 to $611 for one-bedroom units, $811 to $1,050 for two-bedrooms, and more for three-bedroom top-floor units -- but added that this was because the amenity package was ''unprecedented'' in New Jersey.
 He said the strong pace of initial sales justified the decision to build so many units at a time when inventory had swollen and prices had begun to drop across the state and nation. ''The Wall Street economy is bullish,'' with the Dow Jones industrial average recently setting record highs, Mr. Geibel said.
 ''Plus, when you are offering a world-class building with outstanding views, the highest-quality service and unbelievable amenities -- all with the Trump name on it -- buyers are going to show up,'' he said. ''We didn't really have any doubt.''
 At the Hoboken W, the one-, two- and three-bedroom condos on the top nine floors of the 225-room hotel and the two 26th-floor penthouse units with four bedrooms are all higher than neighboring buildings in the Waterfront Corporate Center, giving them unobstructed views from floor-to-ceiling windows and from balconies.
 The glass-and-zinc-faced tower was designed inside and out by Gwathmey Siegel and Associates, an architecture firm in Manhattan known for innovative modernist style that will stand out amid Hoboken's traditional squat brick structures, according to the builders, the Applied Development Company of Hoboken. 
 ''This is going to be so different and special for Hoboken that some people have been waiting anxiously to buy homes ever since word got out a couple of years ago that we were going to build it,'' said Michael Barry, a principal at Applied Development. 
 Home buyers at the W will have access to the hotel's planned high-end restaurant, the Living Room lounge and bar area with a view of the Manhattan skyline, the Bliss Spa, 24-hour room service and the chain's concierge service, which is dedicated to fulfilling whims. 
 ''You can call downstairs and say you'd like to arrange a four-course dinner for a party of 12 in three hours, and have it done,'' Mr. Barry said. ''You can be seized with the desire for Beluga caviar and Champagne at midnight, and the staff will scurry around and find just what you want.''
 Condo residents can also pay extra for daily housekeeping and laundry service, pet walking and grooming, houseplant maintenance, in-home spa service and so on, Mr. Barry said.
 The condo units feature 10-foot ceilings -- as do those in the Trump building -- and bamboo floors, granite floors and counters in the kitchens, built-in wine coolers, and soaker tubs and glass-tile walls in the baths.
 The W condos will be ready for occupancy in the summer of 2008, according to Mr. Barry, and the Trump Plaza building is slated to open in late 2007, Mr. Geibel said. Construction of the second Trump tower, which will be 50 stories, will begin once a large percentage of units in the first tower have been sold, Mr. Geibel added.

HEADLINE: A Growing Burden of Home Debt

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
CREDIT counselors are finding that mortgage debt is playing a bigger role in the deteriorating financial health of consumers contemplating bankruptcy. 
 In a survey released last month by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, a nonprofit group representing 115 counseling organizations, the average person receiving financial advice before filing for bankruptcy in the last year earned $27,000 annually and had $38,500 of unsecured debt spread over eight credit cards.
Over the first six months of that 12-month survey period, consumers receiving counseling had, on average, $2,000 more in unsecured debts but nearly $4,500 more in annual income. 
 ''Consumers are upside down financially,'' said Susan C. Keating, chief executive of the foundation, which is based in Silver Spring, Md. ''Those who are considering bankruptcy have unsecured debt well in excess of their annual income.''
 Ms. Keating said the survey did not track the specific dollar amounts of mortgages and other debts that are secured by assets like property, but she said many counselors reported that their clients were delinquent on their mortgages, with some reporting that 100 percent of their clients were delinquent.
 The organization's counselors, who can be found through the Web site DebtAdvice.org, had reported a brisk increase in the number of clients who are concerned about the rising costs of their adjustable-rate mortgages in particular, she said. 
 These mortgages, also called ARMs, feature an initial interest rate typically locked in for three to five years, after which the rate changes in accordance with prevailing short-term interest rates. Those rates have climbed in recent years, leaving borrowers with ARM loans vulnerable to sharply higher monthly mortgage payments.
 ''Mortgage debt is coming out as much more significant than we expected,'' Ms. Keating said. ''Pull this all together with the other unsecured debt people have, and this is really problematic.'' The foundation, she added, will intensify its attention to mortgage counseling over the next year, partly in anticipation of more demand from consumers whose home loans are growing more burdensome.
 The foundation has been surveying its members to gauge the effects of a federal bankruptcy law signed last year, which, among other things, eliminated some benefits of personal bankruptcy filing.
 Ms. Keating noted that 98 percent of the clients who receive foreclosure-prevention education from a foundation counselor ultimately avoid foreclosure. Counselors have succeeded in large part, she said, by helping consumers understand their loans and create budgets.
 But according to Craig Focardi, an analyst with TowerGroup, a financial industry consulting firm, federal bankruptcy laws passed last year could also help make it less likely that banks will push for foreclosures when consumers become delinquent with mortgages. 
 Mr. Focardi said that under the new bankruptcy law, secured creditors like mortgage lenders ''have to share more of a debtor's income with credit card, automobile and other consumer lenders that hope to increase collection recoveries'' in a bankruptcy proceeding.
 As a result, Mr. Focardi said, mortgage lenders are more likely to help consumers stave off bankruptcy by setting up payment recovery plans, because they may stand even less of a chance of getting repaid if the consumer declares bankruptcy now than they did under the previous laws.
 ''Under the new law it's harder for borrowers to file Chapter 7, which enables them to extinguish their debt,'' Mr. Focardi said. ''Instead, they have to set up repayment plans even for credit cards. So it lengthens the amount of time borrowers are delinquent on their mortgages and could increase the lender's total loss on that defaulted loan.''

HEADLINE: Which Building Improvements Really Pay Off?

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
PEOPLE who bought their New York City apartments before the real estate boom have spent the last few years reveling as their investments ballooned. Lately, though, the euphoria has dimmed for some as civil wars have erupted over how -- or whether -- to spend money to improve their buildings. 
 On one side of the deepening schism are boom-era buyers seeking to spruce up their buildings to protect resale values and surround themselves with a level of grandeur commensurate with the size of their investment.
But some of their more tenured neighbors (a portion of whom continue to be branded themselves as ''yuppie scum'' or worse by the renters they displaced) resist fixing what doesn't seem broken. Some also shrink from anteing up for what they consider frivolous plastic surgery on top of maintenance charges already swollen by the spiking costs of fuel, taxes and insurance. 
 ''There's always tension between those groups,'' said Harriet Kaufman, a senior managing director at Warburg Realty. ''People who've spent a lot of money really want a lot of amenities, and they have more money than the other owners. They want nicer hallways and lobbies, better uniforms, better services. But if you've been there for a while, you think, 'This looks O.K. Why do I have to go spend money and get assessed every month for this? I'm happy.' ''
 As the two factions forge uneasy compromises, both must ponder the same questions: Once the broken boilers, leaky roofs and crumbling facades are repaired or replaced, which improvements will provide the biggest bang for the buck? And which will enhance owners' quality of life while instilling an acquisitive gleam in a buyer's eye? 
 Advice from real estate experts yields ammunition for both the have-enoughs and have-not-enoughs, while identifying some overlooked cheap thrills that cost little or nothing but reap big rewards.
 Casting an eye toward resale values, brokers recommended attending to the urban version of curb appeal first. 
 ''First impression is everything,'' said Toni D. Haber, an executive vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman. 
 In other words, ''the lobby, the lobby, the lobby,'' said Anthony vanEyck Miller, a vice president at Bellmarc Realty. ''Even though the average buyer is not a designer and has not been trained in design or construction, they sense a good lobby in the same way you sense whether an apartment is nice or not. A lobby that hasn't been renovated in 20 years and obviously has scuff marks is not fresh.'' 
 A dingy lobby can deliver a death blow to a deal: ''I've had people say to me, 'This is a really nice apartment, but I can't live in a building like this,' '' said Margaret Furniss, a vice president at Stribling & Associates.
 Still, an appealing lobby isn't necessarily elaborate or quadruple-mint. If there is a doorman, he should have a proper desk; the lobby should be brightly lighted and recently painted; any awning leading into the lobby should look crisp and untattered and should clearly display the building's address. 
 If the lobby lacks a doorman, the debate over hiring one can be both economic and status driven. A study to be published next summer in the University of Chicago Journal of Legal Studies found that even factoring in the higher monthly carrying charges, apartments in full- or part-time-doorman buildings sell for about 12 percent more than comparable dwellings in nondoorman buildings. One of the study's authors, Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said he examined 100,000 transactions in more than 6,000 Manhattan buildings over two decades. 
 In smaller buildings, the cost of a doorman can significantly raise maintenance charges. ''If you only have 50 apartments, how do you afford a doorman?'' asked Rochelle Bass, an executive vice president at Bellmarc. ''Is it worth having to spend $1,500 more a month?''
 Gloria Sokolin, senior vice president of the Fox Residential Group, thinks so. She owns a seven-room apartment in a 30-unit building near Central Park in the West 70s with a part-time doorman and favors full-time doorman service because she believes it would increase her resale value, despite the additional $1,000 a month maintenance fee. ''I could sell for an extra $700,000 to $1 million,'' she said, using sales at comparable buildings on her street as a benchmark. 
 After tending to the lobby and hiring (or not) of a doorman, many buildings add the sorts of amenities found in newer developments. The most popular are gyms, followed by roof decks and/or playrooms, depending on available space and the particular demographics of a building's residents. With more people choosing to raise families in the city, retrofitted basement playrooms are in vogue among buildings populated by young families and grandparents.
 ''A playroom is not terribly expensive if you find room for it,'' Ms. Kaufman said. ''It's a very attractive thing, to have a place to go with parents and nannies.''
 Done well, it can also serve as an entertaining or meeting space. When the Extell Development Corporation bought the Belnord, a prewar building on West 86th Street, where sprawling apartments with three to six bedrooms rent for $10,000 to $40,000 a month and surround a vast courtyard, the company converted a large chunk of ground-floor space into a daytime playroom in which the toys can be stowed behind cabinetry and the room transformed into an area for adult use.
 But as developers have already discovered, the most popular amenity -- measured in use by residents and demand by buyers -- is a gym. In a city crammed with strivers who work out at 5 a.m. or midnight, such exercisers appreciate not having to don a coat, raise an umbrella or waste time treading to a treadmill (or to their squash or basketball courts).
 ''People want the convenience even if they belong to a gym,'' said Gary Barnett, president of Extell, a condominium developer whose long resume of gym-laden buildings includes the Orion near Times Square as well as the Avery and the Rushmore, now under construction on Riverside Boulevard in the West 60s.
 Still, Ms. Kaufman said: ''There are gyms and there are gyms. I think you have to stay with the feeling of the building. If you're in an average nice building, you're not going to put in a $500,000 gym, but people are happy to have a little fitness room with a TV.''
 On the other hand, warned Jonathan Phillips, a vice president at Halstead Property, those little fitness rooms can become outdated fast. ''You're looking at equipment models from five years ago, and it's such a snobbery-driven thing,'' he said.
 When it comes to roof decks, it appears that Manhattanites would rather work out than chill out. 
 ''We show apartments in buildings that have lovely roof gardens that are very charming and seductive, but there's never anybody there, while there's always people in the gym,'' observed Roberta L. Golubock, a senior vice president at Sotheby's International Realty.
 This phenomenon can be most acute in buildings where many residents own weekend homes. Yet while it won't necessarily close a deal, brokers said, a rooftop terrace exerts an almost gravitational pull for buyers who can't afford private terraces or who never had the opportunity to underutilize a roof deck. ''It's wonderful to have and people use it at the beginning, but they don't get the use you would think,'' said Phyllis J. Pezenik, the director of residential sales a DJK Residential.
 In one prewar co-op building on West 81st Street, a block from Central Park, discussions about a roof deck began five years ago atthe behest of the board president, who persuaded others that property values in the building would rise by 15 percent if the building's black tar roof -- with open south-facing views of the Museum of Natural History, Central Park and Midtown Manhattan -- could be converted into outdoor space.
 This campaign ''built a groundswell of support,'' recalled Larry J. Wente, a principal of GWK Architects in Manhattan and the board member who led the roof deck committee. But the project was delayed for several years by more essential and costly work, including repointing the exterior. 
 The planning for the lushly planted and expensively furnished roof deck finally started a year ago. The $259,000 project (budgeted at $288,000) took two months to complete, with funds coming from the building's reserves.
 Yet despite positive feedback from shareholders since the deck opened in July, only a few use it. ''Usually, there were two or three people up there on a summer night in perfect weather,'' said Mr. Wente, who noted that the building is now considering adding a gym on the ground floor or in the basement. So far, none of the 120 apartments have been sold, leaving the value-added theory untested.
 Mr. Miller, whose appraisal firm has been hired by boards to help prioritize projects, voiced skepticism about the value of a roof deck or any standalone luxury upgrade. One or two ''a la carte'' amenities ''seldom have an impact'' on values, he said. 
 ''It's the package of amenities that a building offers that is inherent in the value of the building,'' he said.
 As they consider the Big Three amenities (gyms, roof decks and playrooms), buildings also address the ever-present desire for more storage.
 ''When it comes to what New Yorkers really need and complain about not having, it's always space, and they can never have enough of it,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''Most of all, they need space for all the things they don't really need.''
 Some buildings continue to perfect themselves through additions like wine cellars, centrally filtered water, central air-conditioning and soundproofed windows. After the blackout three years ago, some buildings even considered installing generators. 
 ''A lot of buildings looked at that, but I wouldn't say a lot of buildings did it,'' said Paul J. Herman, the executive vice president and director of management at Brown Harris Stevens Residential Management. ''It's noisy and dirty and an expensive proposition. It might cost $250,000 for a 100-unit building just to power the water and elevators.'' 
 There are far cheaper frills to be had, like a clean and cozy laundry room with potted plants, chairs and a bookshelf ''library'' where residents can exchange books.
 There are also some measures a building can take to increase resale values without spending a dime, including liberalizing house rules to allow washer/dryers in apartments, permitting pets, allowing strollers to be parked outside front doors and easing down-payment restrictions from 50 or even 100 percent to a more standard 20 or 25 percent.
 But the most overlooked cheap fix of all may be teaching staff members to be nice to others.
 ''It is amazing that more boards, supers and managing agents are not aware of this issue,'' said Mr. Miller of Bellmarc. At an open house on the Upper East Side a few months ago, ''one of the doormen had a temper tantrum when my buyers didn't realize they had to sign in at the desk. He reduced the wife to tears, and her husband and I were consoling her in the elevator.''
 While that is an extreme example, Mr. Miller said: ''It costs the board absolutely nothing to train staff not to shout into walkie-talkies as they march across the lobbies, or keep staff from yelling at each other and having loud conversations. I have even heard them use vulgarity. If a client arrives first and hears this, especially when you're asking them to part with over a million bucks, this is not a good image.'' 
 Of course, in established condos and co-ops, any improvement requires the board to come to a decision and then implement it. The typically glacial pace of progress may protect conservative pre-boomers for a while, but even one strong personality can tip the balance.
 ''Many board members act like little lambs going to the slaughter,'' Ms. Bass said. ''They follow whoever takes the lead.'' 
 When residents clash, ''sometimes there's a real problem that sort of creates some bad feeling in the building,'' said Suzel Stampleman, a senior associate broker at Bellmarc. Usually, boards ''end up doing not as much as the new people would like and more than the older people would like.''
 In the end, as Ms. Kaufman of Warburg observed: ''It's just a question of numbers. The new people will prevail as they outnumber the old people.''

Common Costs for Upgrades
 DECIDING how to raise money for improvements can be as contentious as agreeing on how much to spend.
 Boards typically choose from four options, said Paul J. Herman, executive vice president and director of management for Brown Harris Stevens Residential Management, which oversees around 140 midsize Manhattan buildings.
 The buildings can draw funds for the projects through reserves, assessments, refinancing the mortgage or taking out a line of credit. Shareholders, Mr. Herman said, are less likely to revolt over assessments for aesthetic or lifestyle upgrades like a renovated lobby or new gym than for ''back of the house'' improvements they can't see or enjoy.
 Mr. Herman listed ballpark costs for some common improvements; the ranges are approximate, depending on a building's size and the desired bells and whistles.
 Renovated lobby: $40,000 to $400,000 for a lobby 30 feet by 40 feet; $250,000 to $1,000,000 for a larger Park Avenue-style building. The low end might include new lighting, painting, carpets, artwork and some furniture. More money buys frills like ceiling treatments, moldings, windows and elegant furniture. 
 Playroom: Around $50,000 for a nice room if space configuration is necessary, or less for an existing room.
 Gym: $100,000 to $200,000-plus (equipment could cost $30,000 alone)
 Roof deck: $100,000-plus; need to replace a deteriorating roof first.
 Roof replacement: $25,000 to $250,000, depending on size. 
 Boilers and burners: $100,000.
 Elevators: $15,000 for refurbishing the interior; $100,000-plus for replacement.
 Full-time doorman: $62,000 annually per unionized doorman; to cover all shifts, a building needs at least four. Security guards cost less and are expected to do less. TERI KARUSH ROGERS

HEADLINE: Shirts to Cry By 

BYLINE: By JOSHUA YAFFA

 BODY:
THE faces staring out from the T-shirts printed in Ken Gordon's shop on Nostrand Avenue are uniformly young, black and smiling. But they also share something tragic. These are the faces of the dead, victims of the violence that, despite lowered crime rates citywide, remains stubbornly endemic in parts of central Brooklyn. 
 ''It's a personal, physical touch that fills a void,'' Mr. Gordon, a slight, 63-year-old Jamaican, said of the shirts he prints for the grieving at his Crown Heights storefront. 
In a neighborhood where drugs, guns and unemployment prove as incendiary as ever, Mr. Gordon averages a couple of orders a month. And he has competition; his printing shop is but one of a handful in the span of several blocks that supply the grim market for this particular form of posthumous tribute. 
 Shirts are $6 or $7 apiece if a customer orders 100. Most do, often more if the victim was an especially well-liked figure, an innocent caught in the spastic cross-fire of the ghetto. 
 Demand was high -- several hundred and counting -- for a shirt Mr. Gordon made in honor of Damon Allen, a 33-year-old sanitation worker and father of two who was killed on Sept. 4. Mr. Allen was struck in the head by a stray bullet in the street after he left a birthday party. 
 ''The same smile he had in life, that's the smile he has on his shirt,'' said Darlene Price, a friend of Mr. Allen's mother who arranged for the T-shirts to be made.
 Between simple lines of text -- ''In Loving Memory of Damon Allen: 1973-2006'' -- is a photograph of the victim grinning proudly and wearing the gold medal he had received from the city last year for rescuing a young girl and her father from a burning building. 
 The photographs that families and friends choose to memorialize their loved ones vary from professional portraits to candid street-shots. But they all convey the same haunting image of a person blithely unaware of how this forgotten snapshot will ultimately resurface. 
 ''No one is planning to die tomorrow, so you're not going to take a picture today,'' said a clerk at Island Tees, a store a few blocks from Mr. Gordon's print shop that produces a handful of these shirts every month. 
 It is a no-questions-asked, often same-day service. ''It's business,'' said Kenneth D'Abreau, Island Tees' owner, suggesting that making T-shirts commemorating a murder victim was not much different from making ones to mark a birth or a wedding anniversary. 
 Mr. Gordon, however, said he felt ''a very emotional connection'' with Mr. Allen -- a man he had never met or even seen -- while scanning his photo into a computer. ''Why did such a young life have to be destroyed?'' he asked.
 It is a question asked with maddening frequency in vast stretches of central Brooklyn, where murder rates have remained resistant to the much-heralded decreases in violent crime in other, more gentrified sections of the borough. Nearly twice as many murders were reported in Crown Heights in 2005 as were reported there a decade earlier, a sharp contrast to even neighboring Bedford-Stuyvesant, where the number of reported murders decreased by nearly half in the same period. 
 ''It's crazy out here,'' said Billy Behary, the owner of Billy's T-Shirt Center on Fulton Street, the main commercial strip that separates Bedford-Stuyvesant from Crown Heights. 
 In September, a family brought Mr. Behary a picture of a man whom he recognized as a frequent customer. ''He used to come around to buy T-shirts,'' Mr. Behary said of the victim. 
 T-shirts are not the only way young victims of crime are remembered in the neighborhood; most stores also offer hats, buttons and coffee mugs that can be transformed into commemorative items. Graffiti murals have long served as an avenue for emotions otherwise left unexpressed. 
 ''It's the same thing as lighting a candle or putting out some flowers,'' said a man who identified himself only as Buckwild and who had ordered a batch of shirts at Copy King on Rockaway Avenue after Darrell Holmes, a friend of more than 20 years, was fatally shot one night in July. Buckwild had also commissioned a mural to honor his friend.
 ''If you care about your people, you're going to remember them for a long time,'' he said as he stood in front of the mural on the corner of Park Place and Nostrand Avenue where Mr. Holmes is but one of dozens who are memorialized on the brick wall. 
 Memorial T-shirts are generally worn only at the wake and funeral, then tucked away to return on birthdays or anniversaries of the victim's death. But some people, like Mr. Allen's friend Ms. Price, wear the shirts as a regular demonstration of solidarity and sympathy. 
 ''If his mother sees you walking down the street wearing the shirt, she'll come up to you and kiss the shirt,'' Ms. Price said. ''It makes her feel proud to know that people love her son the way she loves her son.''

HEADLINE: The Constant Gardeners

BYLINE: By Heidi Julavits

 BODY:
Gardening on the coast of Maine, given the brusque climate and blink-of-an-eye growing season, is a challenge best met with imagination and with that staple of the region, Yankee self-deception. Katharine White, the wife of E.B., wore Ferragamo shoes and tweed suits to tramp through her beds and satisfied her penchant for gardening most of the year by reading bulb catalogs. Her book, ''Onward and Upward in the Garden'' (Beacon Press), describes Maine's dormant period (from Oct. 15 to April 15) as ''the season of lists and callow hopefulness.'' 
Since the Whites' day, this same strip of coastline has become a mecca for a far less callow and Ferragamo-friendly set of year-round gardeners. Twenty miles from the Whites' former house reside Eliot Coleman and Barbara Damrosch, whose marriage in the organic-gardening world exists a few dimensions of awe beyond the Jolie-Pitt union. They first achieved renown as authors; ''The New Organic Grower,'' by Coleman, and ''The Garden Primer,'' by Damrosch, are the bibles of the vegetable and flower worlds, respectively. It was through the competition between their books that they heard of each other. ''If you can't beat them,'' Coleman jokes, ''marry them.''
 This attitude -- embrace the competition's strengths -- describes the Coleman-Damrosch approach to growing edible food during winters on the 44th parallel. We are, after all, talking about producing greens and vegetables on less than 10 hours of daylight from Nov. 10 to Feb. 5, in a place where the high temperature can be under 20 degrees for days and sometimes weeks on end. In Manhattan, fine diners have already benefited from the Coleman-Damrosch farm-to-restaurant movement: the pair have been visited by chefs like Jonathan Benno of Per Se and Peter Hoffman of Savoy. Recently, they developed the greenhouse operation and gardens at Stone Barns Center in Westchester, N.Y., which was anointed by Sam Hayward, the chef at Fore Street Restaurant in Portland, Me., as ''the most impressive project in the food world of the Northeast.'' 
 What their friend Alice Waters has done on the West Coast -- facilitating sustainable and seasonal eating -- Coleman and Damrosch are pioneering on the East Coast, even during months when ''fresh local produce'' is interchangeable with the phrase ''grandmother's turnip.''
 On a March day of freezing rain, I drive the unpaved road down Cape Rosier to see how anyone grows anything in this place during the winter except dangerously bored. Four Season Farm is located on a property with a long history of guru-gardening. Coleman was first drawn to Harborside, Me., by Scott and Helen Nearing, the authors of the pre-eminent off-the-grid handbook ''Living the Good Life.'' Scott was an economics professor, Helen a musician, but this politically active couple left New York to homestead in Vermont in 1932, thereby rejecting ''a society gripped by depression and unemployment, falling a prey to fascism, and on the verge of another world-wide military free-for-all.'' (No! America?) The Nearings moved to Maine in 1952 to convert another derelict New England farm into a self-sufficient rural community. 
 In 1968, Coleman, a self-described ''semipro adventurer'' with a graduate degree in Spanish literature, went to Cape Rosier, as many did, seeking the Nearings. ''They made small farming sound like an adventure,'' he says. He and Damrosch now live and farm on part of their property.
 At first glance, the farm appears inactive. The rectangular dug beds are covered in seaweed and crab shells, lending the earth a pungent eau-de-low-tide odor. To the left of the drive stretches a series of greenhouses: metal frames covered with translucent sheets of plastic, what Coleman calls ''some of the ugliest structures ever designed,'' and he's exaggerating only a little. The Coleman-Damrosch compound refuses to reward fussiness over function. Which isn't to say that they are averse to pretty. When Damrosch, a whippetlike former New Yorker who is also a human search engine when it comes to questions about gardening and cooking, gives me a tour of the greenhouses and outbuildings, I'm struck by the kempt loveliness of their compost heap, girded by hay bales. Coleman recently developed a movable glass (i.e., attractive) greenhouse inspired by structures he saw in the Netherlands. 
 The innovative thrust behind Coleman's greenhouse isn't just aesthetics; it's part of his push to reinstall the vegetable garden as a daily reality of every American family with a lawn. In less affluent parts of the country, Coleman says, life can be harder today than it was in the Depression, ''because everyone back then had a garden.'' Coleman shows me the carrots he's growing in the ground. I don't think I had quite understood that inside this attractive greenhouse, as well as inside the less attractive ones, lettuces and vegetables grow all winter in the actual ground -- not in pots or raised beds, and not hydroponically. The glass greenhouses slide manually back and forth on runners so that the soil can be exposed directly to sun and rain (crucial if the soil is to remain healthy); the plastic ones are dragged like big sleds using tractors. Compost is the only fertilizer; the solar-friendly greenhouses require no heat other than the sun to keep the hardy plants alive. While some plants respond well to being grown in greenhouses -- greenhouse spinach tastes better than outdoor spinach because ''outside spinach is fighting the dry, cold wind and gets tough,'' Coleman says -- crops like strawberries are protected under straw mulch until the spring. ''The system is beautiful and simple,'' Coleman adds. ''We extend the season enormously by choosing cold-hardy crops. It's a very passive approach.'' Among the winter crops they grow are tatsoi, bok choy, arugula, mache, kale, claytonia and spinach.
 Coleman and Damrosch sell only to restaurants and stores within a 25-mile radius of their farm, thus reducing fossil-fuel expenditure both in the growing and in the transport, an important factor in the ''beyond organic'' ethos that Coleman developed in response to the organic takeover by industry giants like Cascadian Farm and Horizon Organic (which Coleman dubs ''chicken organics''). Sam Hayward, who has been working with local farmers since 1982, explains it with bumper-sticker precision: ''Local trumps organic.'' Currently, Four Season Farm produce is used in the kitchens of a number of restaurants near Cape Rosier, among them the Brooklin Inn, the Castine Inn and Cleonice in Ellsworth.
 We break for a delightful lunch prepared by Damrosch from their ingredients. She doesn't wear Ferragamos in her garden, nor is she a crunchy adherent to the Enchanted (and Inedible) Broccoli Forest manner of food preparation. She traces her love of food to her obsession, as a 7-year-old, with finding out the secret to the hamburger at Brearley, the Upper East Side girls' school she attended. We eat a butternut-squash soup (made with stock from local chickens) and an arugula salad fresh from the greenhouse. Coleman and I each enjoy a beer. It's stopped raining, but the fog's come in, and while the mache may grow year-round on Four Season Farm, I'm feeling pretty dormant at the moment. They send me home with a full stomach to take, like the majority of people and plants on a gray Maine day, a late-winter nap.

HEADLINE: Asterisks for the Political Rulebook

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
IF Democrats really do shake up Republicans on Tuesday, voters will have pulled off more than an upset. They will have turned that convenient tool of politics -- Conventional Wisdom -- right on its head. 
 We won't know what the voters do until they do it, and this is a good time to recall that the accuracy of polls and prognostications depends on who votes. But so far, the electorate seems poised to reject a number of political tenets so entrenched that they are paraded as fact. And now -- maybe not.
Remember the popular principle that all politics is local? That truism, often wrongly attributed to House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., is so old it originated with Finley Peter Dunne (1867 to 1936). But the polls reveal that the public's anger over the administration's policies in Iraq, and concern about illegal immigration and health care, has nationalized the election -- a phenomenon that has political scientists borrowing from meteorologists. 
 ''We're seeing the tsunami of political waves hitting,'' said Michael McDonald, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''The Republicans built up really strong walls, and if this wave had not been as strong as it was it would've crashed up against the levee and that would have been that. But this one looks like it can top the levee.''
 Those walls refer to another article of faith -- the safe Congressional district, gerrymandered by both parties to protect incumbents, most recently and very effectively by Republicans. Their majority was supposed to be all but inviolate. As recently as last spring, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report and other analysts rated only 12 out of 435 House districts as ''tossups'' and 20 others as in play to some degree. Now, many of the same analysts rate 35 districts as tossups and consider 27 more to be in play. 
 Even the higher numbers are not startling as percentages of the entire House. Republicans did indeed build a strong protective structure, and much of it is expected to hold. But the chances of Democrats' gaining the 15 additional seats they need to take the House -- at the least -- have grown sharply, and some optimistic Democrats are daring to dream of taking the Senate, too.
 There is the matter of money, and the Republican Party's customary advantage in fund-raising. The latest figures show they have once again bested Democrats. But Democrats have narrowed the gap compared with recent Congressional elections, largely because their Senate committee raised more than its Republican counterpart.
 Another curiosity this year: Republicans haven't been able to take full advantage of their fund-raising wealth because, victims of their own past success, they have so many seats to protect. Democrats have many fewer seats to defend, which lets them target their spending in opposition territory. 
 And to add a few more articles of faith now in doubt: voters were thought not to trust Democrats to defend the country; Democrats were considered chronically allergic to nominating centrist candidates; and the White House's political wizard, Karl Rove, could commit no strategic wrong.
 Some of them may hold up, as might another tenet -- that the party in the White House loses Congressional seats in off-years. But what about all those conventional wisdoms? Were they wrong? Misunderstood? Were those who bought into them naive, biased?
 Political analysts say that some of the popular theories were oversimplified, some exaggerated, some tenuous, but that the predominant ones were accurate -- once. Political theories hold as long as the circumstances underlying them hold. When circumstances change and the theories do not -- welcome, it would seem, to campaign 2006.
 ''All politics is local, except when it isn't,'' said John Samples, an analyst with the Cato Institute. ''National waves are unusual, but they do exist.''
 They come about once every decade or two, the last time in 1994 when Republicans took Congress handily, capitalizing on public disaffection over the economy, the Clinton administration's health care proposal and a controversy over gays in the military. Democrats had their turn in 1974, when the Watergate scandal forced Richard M. Nixon to resign.
 This time it is the war in Iraq. ''Iraq cost Bush 5, 6 percent of the vote in '04,'' Mr. Samples said. ''It wasn't noticed closely because he won anyway. But it has been a festering problem and now it is nationalizing the race.''
 The seeds of today's public discontent may well have taken root two years ago even as another piece of conventional wisdom -- that the election was all about values -- took hold. According to an Edison/Mitofsky survey of voters exiting the polls two years ago, 22 percent of those interviewed cited values as the issue that mattered most. But as The Economist noted recently, 15 percent cited Iraq, 19 percent cited terrorism -- 34 percent combined. 
 Now Democrats are running against the war and the White House. The battle for United States Senate in New Jersey, between Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat, and Thomas H. Kean Jr., Republican, is a study in warring strategies. Mr. Menendez portrays his opponent as a Bush acolyte, while Mr. Kean characterizes Mr. Menendez as an active player in classically corrupt New Jersey politics.
 In a Democratic ad against Representative Christopher Shays, a moderate Republican from Connecticut, disapproving men and women shake their heads as they invoke the president and the war over and over again. 
 There are other factors that could lead to change. Some weak candidates emerged from primaries, and some incumbents got into political trouble -- among them Representative Bob Ney of Ohio and Tom DeLay of Texas, the former House leader, both Republicans shadowed by their links to Jack Abramoff, the convicted lobbyist. Democrats will most likely succeed them. Some candidates were hurt by their connections to the Congressional page mess or personal scandals, and in the Florida Senate race, the Republican candidate, Representative Katherine Harris, has been running a problem-plagued campaign from its inception.
 ''Some of it is just bad luck,'' said Amy Walter, who analyzes Congressional races for the Cook report. She also cited the flipside of long-term success in strong Republican districts represented by loyal elected officials. ''As the party's fortunes started to fall,'' she said, ''there was no way for these candidates to distance themselves from their party.'' 
 Gerrymandering has a flip side, too. To carve out the largest number of partisan districts, officials run the risk of spreading their loyal voters too thin. G. Terry Madonna, who runs the Keystone Poll at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, said that Pennsylvania Republicans who controlled the last round of redistricting ''got greedy'' -- creating some districts with favorable balances too small to survive a wave of discontent. 
 Gerrymandering is not always effective anyway, says Bruce Cain, an expert on redistricting who heads the University of California's Washington Center. ''There were people exaggerating the effects of redistricting, largely because they wanted redistricting reform,'' he said. And no redistricting plan can accurately anticipate demographic shifts that change a district's makeup, or whether voters will change their minds.
 ''It's never exactly static,'' said Mr. Cain. ''People shift from being independent to moderate or back to independent. Redistricting is good only as long as preferences are stable.''
 Maybe that's why both parties are already talking about 2008. Republicans are saying any Democrats who might sweep into office Tuesday will, as freshmen, be vulnerable to defeat in just two years. And Democrats are saying hold on -- if they run a strong presidential candidate in two years the party could be just fine. It could be in power for a decade. Maybe two. 
 Ah, politics. How better to start the next election cycle than with two more pieces of conventional wisdom?

HEADLINE: Aura, a New Age of Saturn 

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

DATELINE: OJAI, Calif. 

 BODY:
FOR most of its brief existence as a carmaker, Saturn has been best known as a producer of underpowered compacts whose short list of appealing features barely went beyond their ding-resistant plastic body panels and a haggle-free buying experience. But now, in its hour of greatest need, the bosses at General Motors have given Saturn a midsize sedan with the looks, brawn and sticker price to compete with the latest entries from Asia. The division that got by so long on its customer-hugging New Age spirit now has the Aura, and it's no apparition. Indeed, the Aura is a tangible sign that G.M. has not given up on a nameplate that in its early days inspired astonishing loyalty. 
 Possessing far more character than the sober sedans that preceded it, the Aura arrives in a wave of new vehicles intended to revitalize a brand once heralded as plucky and innovative but then forced to suffer an extended product drought.
There are actually two Auras: the base XE, flaunting a six-cylinder engine, and the upscale XR, with a more modern twin-cam engine, a slick six-speed automatic transmission and plenty of luxury features at a bargain price. 
 As one might expect from an American automaker, the Aura XE is roomy for its class, with wide, supportive bucket seats in front and adequate leg and shoulder room for three adults in back. But the XE veers from the expected in several ways. The fit and finish are excellent, if not quite as good as the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry. So is the quality of the materials inside. 
 The list of standard features on the base Aura, at $20,595 including shipping, is remarkable: antilock disc brakes; traction control; front-seat side air bags; side-curtain air bags front and rear; tilt-and-telescope steering wheel; cruise control; power windows and mirrors; remote locking; and G.M.'s new 5-year, 100,000-mile warranty coverage for the powertrain (including roadside assistance). 
 Options include a better stereo with a CD changer, leather upholstery, alloy wheels, power adjustable pedals and a four-panel panoramic sunroof. But even with a big helping of trimmings, an XE is unlikely to top $25,000.
 The XE's 3.5-liter 224-horsepower V-6 is a version of the long-of-tooth pushrod engine in the Chevrolet Malibu, which also lends its four-speed automatic transmission to the Saturn effort. (No manual is available.)
 But the hoary combination isn't half-bad: the transmission downshifts smoothly, the fairly large engine has enough torque to push the XE from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 8.1 seconds (by Saturn's estimate), and the car runs nicely on regular gas. 
 What's more, the federal fuel economy ratings -- 20 m.p.g. in the city, 30 on the highway -- are pretty good for a V-6 dragging around 3,528 pounds of car. The real shock is in the handling. At low speed, the relatively soft, built-for-comfort suspension is prone to body roll and is too easily unsettled by rough pavement. But the Aura XE becomes a much better car at higher speeds, taking turns like the Mazda 6 or Acura TSX, both of which are overachievers in the class. I don't remember a car this big in this price range that was so much fun to drive on the twisty mountain roads here, east of Santa Barbara.
 While the XE's low price point, eye-catching design and high-value packaging seem aimed at cementing the loyalty of young families in the heartland where Saturn already does well, Jill Lajdziak, general manager of Saturn, acknowledged that more is at stake with the upscale XR. 
 Indeed, when Saturn's bosses talk about breaking into trend-setting coastal cities, taking a chunk of the market now occupied by the Volkswagen Passat, Nissan Altima and high-end Accords, they're counting on the XR. And if the intended consumers can get past the image of Saturns as cars for budget-minded high school teachers who don't really like to drive, the car may have a shot.
 On the outside, the $24,595 XR doesn't look much different from the XE. It does wear 18-inch aluminum wheels (instead of steel 17-inchers) and a bit more chrome, and it comes with stability control. Some features that are optional on the XE come standard on the XR: eight-way power driver's seat, heated front seats, audio controls on the steering wheel and a six-disc CD changer. Leather seats, sunroof, power passenger seat and adjustable pedals cost extra. 
 One option that is exceptionally attractive is the two-tone morocco brown leather upholstery. Again, though, Saturn has stayed true to its straight-shooting image by not using options to fatten margins shamelessly: if you load on everything except the $1,500 four-panel panoramic sunroof, the sticker price remains just about $27,000.
 The big difference between the Auras is in the drivetrain. G.M. has endowed the XR (as well as the high-end Pontiac G6 GTP) with a 3.6-liter aluminum V-6 coupled to a six-speed automatic. This engine's 252 horsepower may not sound like a lot more than the XE's 224, but it feels much stronger because it reaches its peak torque -- 251 pound-feet -- at a useful 3,200 r.p.m. 
 That low-end pulling power gives the Aura XR crisp acceleration for passing, and you can reach 60 m.p.h. in a snappy 6.2 seconds, according to Car and Driver magazine. The 3.6-liter engine also takes regular gas. The XR gets 20 m.p.g. in the city, 28 on the highway. The XR's transmission can be shifted manually using paddles behind the steering wheel -- hardware borrowed from the Corvette. But, unlike many such manumatics, the quick, intuitive paddle shifters on the XR seem quite functional. I found myself drawn to using them for extra control on challenging roads, much as I would use the gears of a manual transmission. 
 The extra oomph of the XR's engine, along with a slightly stiffer suspension and better resistance to body roll, transforms this Aura into a plausible (if somewhat bulky) sport sedan, and one that I'd be happy to drive daily. The transformation is all the more surprising because the XR (like the XE) is luxuriously quiet, thanks to the use of extra-thick glass and a sound-deadening sandwich of steel and dense composites in crucial body areas. 
 Both Auras offer style, amenities and a driving experience comparable to the market-defining Accord and Camry, and touches of European sophistication found in the Passat. 
 Saturn did trim a few corners -- the backseat does not have a center armrest, and a factory navigation system is not available at any price. But Saturn insists that the newest feature of the OnStar subscription service, called Turn-by-Turn Navigation, is a capable and less expensive substitute. After a call to the OnStar operator, spoken directions are uploaded to the car and played back at the appropriate locations along the way. 
 Those who worry that G.M.'s reliability still isn't up to global standards may find some reassurance in the company's newly extended warranty. But more critical to Aura's success is whether Saturn can shed its image as a corn-fed car company providing friendly service and modest transportation to drivers who never felt that the 55 m.p.h. speed limit was much of an imposition. 
 Indeed, the Saturn division seems to be getting more than its share of arresting designs from the company's creative gurus, and its line is filling out with entries like the Relay minivan and Outlook crossover wagon. The Aura's muscular good looks will help, as will sticker prices a few thousand dollars below those of comparably equipped competitors. But the most reliable way to change hearts and minds will be a few minutes' drive on an empty road with plenty of curves.

INSIDE TRACK: A Saturn that's fun outside the showroom, too.

HEADLINE: An Armory, Long on Furlough, Soon to Get Its Orders

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BLEYER

 BODY:
AS the elevated No. 4 train approaches Kingsbridge Road in the Bronx, the new rider cannot help being dazzled by the sight of the colossal Kingsbridge Armory. Its soaring, muddy-red towers and majestic turrets accented with crenellations loom up quickly, right beside the tracks.
 For more years than people can count, that grand armory has been losing its shine. But now a decade-long effort has culminated with a call for proposals to develop the landmark into a multiuse site. 
Built from 1913 to 1917, the cavernous structure, originally called the Eighth Coastal Artillery Armory, occupies the superblock bounded by Kingsbridge Road, 195th Street, and Jerome and Reservoir Avenues. It is thought to be the world's largest armory, with a 180,000-square-foot drill hall and a steel truss roof more than 100 feet high. 
 In 1942, former Gov. Herbert H. Lehman visited the armory to ceremonially review 10,000 troops gathered there, and during World War II the armory served as one of the few registration sites in the city for immigrants from enemy nations. As its military role diminished by midcentury, the armory became the setting for many other activities, including dog shows, boxing matches and film shoots. In the 1980s, part of the building became a homeless shelter. 
 But much of the armory -- a vast 575,000 square feet including two adjacent annexes -- sat idle for years. 
 ''It was like the world's largest abandoned pigeon coop,'' said Ronn Jordan, who lives three blocks away and who, as president of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, has long worked for its revival. ''It was a symbol of how the city felt about the Bronx. Nobody cared.'' 
 Over the last decade, however, many people concerned with the fading fortress worked out an agreement envisioning a multiuse future for the armory. Though the request for proposals, issued in September by the city's Economic Development Corporation, does not require any particular use, it encourages proposals for shopping, recreation, entertainment and nonprofit ventures. Some residents hope for a multiplex theater, and the solicitation welcomes a bank -- but rules out a check-cashing place. The proposal also discourages suburban-style big-box stores. 
 ''We envision this as a destination place,'' said Desiree Pilgrim-Hunter, who serves on a community task force formed to advise the city on the redevelopment of the armory. Ms. Pilgrim-Hunter, a resident of nearby Fordham Hill, spoke the other day as she walked the structure's perimeter. 
 At the time, workers inside the armory were building a copy of Washington Square Park for the filming of ''I Am Legend,'' a science fiction movie starring Will Smith. Much of it will be shot inside the armory over the next several months. 
 The city's call for proposals requires developers to submit a hiring plan for both construction and permanent jobs, and community leaders who worked on the plan were particularly proud that developers who give preference to local residents, and will pay workers at least $10 an hour as well as benefits, will themselves get preference. 
 The proposals are due next month, and a developer is expected to be chosen in June, with groundbreaking planned for 2009. 
 Many residents are almost counting the days. As Mr. Jordan summed it up: ''It's been a long time coming.'' JENNIFER BLEYER

Boxing and the Beach Boys

1917 -- The Eighth Coastal Artillery Armory is finished, complete with $200,000 worth of artillery guns and range-finding equipment.

1922 -- The Metropolitan Opera performs ''Aida'' in the armory, and as many as 600,000 radios tune in to the broadcast, which is celebrated for its ''great beauty and clearness,'' according to The New York Times.

1944 -- President Franklin D. Roosevelt visits. When his car is driven onto the drill floor, he is greeted by 4,000 members of the Women's Reserve Naval Training School and 2,000 cheering citizens.

1971 -- The Beach Boys perform in concert.

1974 -- The city designates the armory a landmark, calling it ''an outstanding example of military architecture.''

1980 -- Bob Arum, a boxing promoter, presents the first major boxing matches in the Bronx in four years.

2000 -- Mayor Giuliani earmarks $30 million in city money for repairs at the armory as interest in redeveloping the building grows.

HEADLINE: Is the Answer Blowing In the Wind?

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
FOR almost a year, five turbines on New Jersey's first coastal wind farm have been generating electricity in Atlantic City, their slowly revolving 118-foot-long blades making the turbines resemble gigantic upright roulette wheels.
 They are the first full-size turbines along the coast in New York and New Jersey and the region's first working examples of a clean-energy technology that supporters say will one day ease dependence on oil and gas and begin to address concerns about global warming.
 They may also be a forerunner to more ambitious, far larger projects now under discussion for the coast of New Jersey, Long Island and, depending on oil prices and the future of wind power technology, even Connecticut, where a lack of strong winds has so far deterred investment.
 Wind farms are no longer just demonstration projects elsewhere, though. In upstate New York, 181 turbines at four wind farms in Lewis, Madison and Wyoming Counties can produce about 280 megawatts in optimum winds. Hundreds more turbines are proposed. 
 Nationally, Texas and California are the leaders in wind energy production, which crossed the 10,000-megawatt threshold earlier this year (10,000 megawatts is enough to power 2.5 million homes). The American Wind Energy Association, a trade group in Washington, said that more than 19,000 wind turbines were in operation. The association predicts that about 3,000 megawatts will be added nationally each year for the next several years.
 Europe, led by Germany and Spain, is in the forefront of wind energy, producing two-thirds of the 59,000 megawatts generated worldwide, the Global Wind Energy Council said. 
 Yet, despite the operation of New Jersey's small wind project since January, there is uncertainty about whether wind farms, particularly gigantic turbines positioned off the region's coastline, will be embraced here. 
 On Long Island, a 40-turbine project being considered off the South Shore is facing stiff resistance from opponents who argue that the turbines will damage pristine ocean views, fail to deliver cost-effective electricity and create environmental problems.
 In New Jersey, powerful local politicians have lined up behind wind power, where up to 80 turbines -- rising 380 feet or more above the water along the South Jersey coastline -- have been proposed to take advantage of the near-constant breezes. 
 That pilot project, which was recommended by a statewide blue-ribbon panel charged with evaluating offshore wind systems, would test the technology and, if successful, set the stage for other offshore projects. Gov. Jon S. Corzine supports proceeding with the project, but no site has been chosen. 
 The five turbines in Atlantic City, with a track record of nearly a year, can generate a combined 8 megawatts when winds are blowing at 13 to 40 miles an hour. 
 For a state whose energy consumption tops 17,000 megawatts at the summer peak, the output is minuscule -- and with winds being inconsistent, the turbines usually produce far less than 8 megawatts. Richard Dovey, the president of the Atlantic County Utilities Authority, the operator of the turbines, said that while the turbines' megawatt production varied because of fluctuations in wind, there were few bad wind days.
 Mr. Dovey said that there had been few complaints about the emission-free coastal turbines. But public acceptance of 80 turbines clearly visible from ocean beaches -- including, perhaps, just off Cape May or the casino-lined Atlantic City Boardwalk beach -- has yet to be tested. The demonstration project is not visible from the beaches. It is located near a wastewater treatment plant on an island tucked away from the Boardwalk and beaches. 
 About 100 miles away, off Long Island's South Shore, the Long Island Power Authority is seeking to become a national leader in wind power with plans for 40 offshore turbines in an eight-square-mile area in federal waters as close as 3.6 miles to Jones Beach State Park. But unlike the Atlantic City project, the LIPA proposal is meeting strong opposition.
 The project, which could produce up to 140 megawatts of power in optimum wind, has emphatic support from environmental groups, which regard it as a crucial step toward clean energy that will reduce dependence on imported oil and gas and combat, in however small a way, global warming. Polls, including one taken on Sept. 20 by Hofstra University for the cable channel News 12 Long Island, have shown strong public support for the project. But it also has a growing list of detractors. 
 The Save Jones Beach Ad Hoc Committee, a grass-roots group made up mostly of South Shore residents that is the leading opponent, contends that the turbines would be a waste of customers' money; a poor alternative to repowering existing fossil-fuel plants to boost capacity while greatly reducing emissions; a killer of birds and fish; and an eyesore. 
 ''In Atlantic City, they had a sewer plant and they put five turbines next to it,'' said Walter Arnold, a committee director from West Gilgo Beach, N.Y. ''Here, you're talking about 40 turbines off a state and national historic park, and 28 miles of electric cables.''
 The group is not alone in its opposition. Local officials including Steven Bellone, the town supervisor in Babylon, N.Y., complain that the project is being inappropriately fast-tracked by federal agencies and will run roughshod over environmental reviews. 
 As the region faces the possibility of large-scale commercial wind farms with turbines as tall as 425 feet -- more than 100 feet higher than the Statue of Liberty -- the debate over projects on the horizon in South Jersey, on Long Island and elsewhere is intensifying. 
 Wind farm economics, better turbine technology, government emphasis on renewable energy and a key federal tax break -- the production tax credit -- make wind farms more attractive for major companies like FPL Energy, a global wind power giant in Juno Beach, Fla., which would build and own the LIPA project. Much of the action in the region will be offshore, in contrast to the rest of the country, including upstate New York, where most wind turbines are being built on land. 
 The local wind fields that come closest to providing average 18-mile-an-hour breezes, the optimum to turn turbine blades and maximize electricity output, are along the Jersey Shore and Long Island's South Shore, according to wind-energy experts. 
 Connecticut is unlikely to join the movement onshore or off, at least for the foreseeable future. Experts say that given current technology, winds off Long Island Sound are too weak for commercial wind farms; a prevalence of buildings and trees take Connecticut, New Jersey and downstate New York, including Long Island and Westchester County, out of the running for large land-based wind projects. 
 Upstate New York, on the other hand, has wind fields that make it one of the best sites in the nation for wind power, says the American Wind Energy Association. Without tax breaks and other incentives, however, large-scale wind farming, particularly offshore, is not likely to attract developers and investors. That would be a setback for states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have set goals for increased renewable energy. 
 In New Jersey, for example, wind power is central to a goal of meeting 20 percent of energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki, who supports the LIPA project, has set a similar goal. 
 Nobody expects offshore wind farms to be cheap. At $12 million, the five onshore turbines in Atlantic City cost just a fraction of the expected costs for the far larger New Jersey and LIPA projects. 
 While the Long Island Power Authority and FPL have declined to estimate the cost of building the 40 South Shore turbines, estimates generally run from $300 million to $400 million. The 80 New Jersey turbines could cost twice as much, depending on water depth and other factors.
 LIPA would also pay an estimated $40 million to run a transmission line to an onshore power substation near Massapequa from a floating substation connected to the turbines. Transmission costs in New Jersey would depend on the turbines' distance from shore and their proximity to a near-shore substation, a key consideration. The five Atlantic City turbines are next to a substation.
 A report done for the New Jersey blue-ribbon panel noted that the cost of generating electricity from onshore wind turbines dropped from 30 cents a kilowatt-hour in the early 1980s to about 5 cents now. But it estimated that offshore turbine generation cost close to 9 cents a kilowatt-hour because of higher construction, operating and transmission costs. 
 By contrast, power generated by oil-, gas- and coal-powered plants feeding into the PJM Interconnection -- the grid operator covering most of the country from the Hudson River to the Chicago area and as far south as North Carolina -- costs 2 to 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, the report said. PJM supplies power to 51 million customers.
 The 140-megawatt maximum the LIPA project would produce amounts to slightly more than 2 percent of its peak use of 5,792 megawatts and equals only about half the output of a small utility generator powered by natural gas. 
 Often, LIPA said, its turbines would provide less than half the 140-megawatt maximum. Production would flatten most in the summer, when winds are lightest and Long Island's electric demand is greatest. 
 In Europe, power providers are having trouble coping with the variable output of wind turbines, according to a study by ABS Energy Research in London. When winds slacken, providers must scramble to draw supplies from conventional plants, the report said. It also suggested that wind power was having only limited impact on overall greenhouse gas emissions.
 For large-scale wind farm developers, subsidies and public policies that assure that every kilowatt of wind power will have a buyer help bridge the cost-per-kilowatt gap. The largest tax offset, the production tax credit, allows developers and investors to recoup capital costs more quickly once turbines are producing. But the credit expires at the end of 2007. 
 While the wind industry expects Congress to extend it, slowness could hamstring projects. Congress has let the credit lapse three times in the past, each time causing a virtual cessation of projects until it was reinstated.
 LIPA and FPL want to complete construction of the South Shore turbines in 2009; various federal approvals are needed.
 Project supporters say the tax credit would be passed along to customers, but critics see a bonanza for FPL, the world's largest wind farm owner and operator. ''They are going to have federal tax credits all over the place,'' said Philip Healey, a Save Jones Beach member from Massapequa. ''They're not doing this because it's a noble cause. They want their money back.'' 
 Richard M. Kessel, LIPA's chairman, says that turbine opponents are reaching for any monkey wrench available. ''The bottom line is you are either for the environment or you are against it,'' he said. 
 Still, turbines are not always environmentally benign. A turbine complex in Altamont Pass in the San Francisco Bay Area begun in the 1980s has killed thousands of raptors, including golden eagles. (FPL is among its owners.) In the Southeast, turbines, including ones owned by FPL, have killed large numbers of bats. 
 Audubon societies in New York and New Jersey support wind technology but say wind farms must be properly located. Audubon officials said that required three years of close on-site and radar observation. 
 But turbine supporters see no insurmountable obstacles. In New Jersey, State Senator William L. Gormley wrote to Governor Corzine in September asking that the offshore project be located in state waters within three miles of the Atlantic County coast. Mr. Corzine will consider the request, a spokesman, Anthony Coley, said. 
 ''This senator from New Jersey lives on the coast and doesn't have a problem,'' said Mr. Gormley, a Republican from Margate. ''People in my district have found windmills are environmentally friendly and aesthetically pleasing.''
 OFFICIALS in Cape May County, hard by the best offshore wind fields in the state, are less enthusiastic. Diane Wieland, the director of the Cape May County Department of Tourism and a member of the blue-ribbon panel, said she worried that turbines off Cape May would give tourists a reason to go elsewhere. Tourism is a $30 billion-a-year industry in New Jersey, the state estimates. 
 ''What would it take to flip them?'' she said. ''The Atlantic City turbines look great, but they're on land.''
 Whether offshore turbines would be audible from land is also an issue. Some people fear a distant whup-whup-whup from the turbine blades. In Atlantic City, Mr. Dovey said there had been no noise complaints from a residential area just across busy Route 30 from the turbines. 
 From underneath, the turning blades made a powerful whooshing and paper-tearing sound on a breezy fall afternoon. 
 A new opponent on Long Island, Donald Trump, raises an additional issue. He said that the turbines would spoil the view from the recently proposed three-story Trump on the Ocean catering hall that he is financing at Jones Beach. 
 ''Wind turbines opposite Jones Beach will be an environmental disaster, both in terms of visual and noise,'' Mr. Trump said. ''They are not a pretty thing to look at.'' 
 Mr. Kessel, the LIPA chairman, was equally critical of Mr. Trump. ''For someone who wants to spoil Jones Beach by building a three-story monster catering hall right on the beach, and that's O.K., but windmills aren't, enough said,'' he said.

Another Kind of Farm
 While Long Island and New Jersey are considering offshore wind farms, the region's wind turbine projects that are furthest along are in upstate New York.
 The largest complex east of the Mississippi, Maple Ridge, on the Tug Hill Plateau in Lewis County, N.Y., generates up to 322 megawatts from 195 turbines. With the blades in the upward position, the turbines stand 390 feet tall. 
 Much smaller wind farms in New York are operating in Fenner (30 megawatts), Madison (11.5 megawatts) and Wethersfield (6.6 megawatts). More than 50 projects, many expected to generate more than 100 megawatts, are seeking approvals. 
 The upstate projects do have critics. Some residents in communities where they have been proposed, including Cohocton and Prattsburgh in the Finger Lakes region, are recoiling from the prospect of vistas lined with the turbines and asking whether private developers are leaving residents with turbine blight.

HEADLINE: Is the Answer Blowing In the Wind?

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
FOR almost a year, five turbines on New Jersey's first coastal wind farm have been generating electricity in Atlantic City, their slowly revolving 118-foot-long blades making the turbines resemble gigantic upright roulette wheels.
 They are the first full-size turbines along the coast in New York and New Jersey and the region's first working examples of a clean-energy technology that supporters say will one day ease dependence on oil and gas and begin to address concerns about global warming.
 They may also be a forerunner to more ambitious, far larger projects now under discussion for the coast of New Jersey, Long Island and, depending on oil prices and the future of wind power technology, even Connecticut, where a lack of strong winds has so far deterred investment.
 Wind farms are no longer just demonstration projects elsewhere, though. In upstate New York, 181 turbines at four wind farms in Lewis, Madison and Wyoming Counties can produce about 280 megawatts in optimum winds. Hundreds more turbines are proposed. 
 Nationally, Texas and California are the leaders in wind energy production, which crossed the 10,000-megawatt threshold earlier this year (10,000 megawatts is enough to power 2.5 million homes). The American Wind Energy Association, a trade group in Washington, said that more than 19,000 wind turbines were in operation. The association predicts that about 3,000 megawatts will be added nationally each year for the next several years.
 Europe, led by Germany and Spain, is in the forefront of wind energy, producing two-thirds of the 59,000 megawatts generated worldwide, the Global Wind Energy Council said. 
 Yet, despite the operation of New Jersey's small wind project since January, there is uncertainty about whether wind farms, particularly gigantic turbines positioned off the region's coastline, will be embraced here. 
 On Long Island, a 40-turbine project being considered off the South Shore is facing stiff resistance from opponents who argue that the turbines will damage pristine ocean views, fail to deliver cost-effective electricity and create environmental problems.
 In New Jersey, powerful local politicians have lined up behind wind power, where up to 80 turbines -- rising 380 feet or more above the water along the South Jersey coastline -- have been proposed to take advantage of the near-constant breezes. 
 That pilot project, which was recommended by a statewide blue-ribbon panel charged with evaluating offshore wind systems, would test the technology and, if successful, set the stage for other offshore projects. Gov. Jon S. Corzine supports proceeding with the project, but no site has been chosen. 
 The five turbines in Atlantic City, with a track record of nearly a year, can generate a combined 8 megawatts when winds are blowing at 13 to 40 miles an hour. 
 For a state whose energy consumption tops 17,000 megawatts at the summer peak, the output is minuscule -- and with winds being inconsistent, the turbines usually produce far less than 8 megawatts. Richard Dovey, the president of the Atlantic County Utilities Authority, the operator of the turbines, said that while the turbines' megawatt production varied because of fluctuations in wind, there were few bad wind days.
 Mr. Dovey said that there had been few complaints about the emission-free coastal turbines. But public acceptance of 80 turbines clearly visible from ocean beaches -- including, perhaps, just off Cape May or the casino-lined Atlantic City Boardwalk beach -- has yet to be tested. The demonstration project is not visible from the beaches. It is located near a wastewater treatment plant on an island tucked away from the Boardwalk and beaches. 
 About 100 miles away, off Long Island's South Shore, the Long Island Power Authority is seeking to become a national leader in wind power with plans for 40 offshore turbines in an eight-square-mile area in federal waters as close as 3.6 miles to Jones Beach State Park. But unlike the Atlantic City project, the LIPA proposal is meeting strong opposition.
 The project, which could produce up to 140 megawatts of power in optimum wind, has emphatic support from environmental groups, which regard it as a crucial step toward clean energy that will reduce dependence on imported oil and gas and combat, in however small a way, global warming. Polls, including one taken on Sept. 20 by Hofstra University for the cable channel News 12 Long Island, have shown strong public support for the project. But it also has a growing list of detractors. 
 The Save Jones Beach Ad Hoc Committee, a grass-roots group made up mostly of South Shore residents that is the leading opponent, contends that the turbines would be a waste of customers' money; a poor alternative to repowering existing fossil-fuel plants to boost capacity while greatly reducing emissions; a killer of birds and fish; and an eyesore. 
 ''In Atlantic City, they had a sewer plant and they put five turbines next to it,'' said Walter Arnold, a committee director from West Gilgo Beach, N.Y. ''Here, you're talking about 40 turbines off a state and national historic park, and 28 miles of electric cables.''
 The group is not alone in its opposition. Local officials including Steven Bellone, the town supervisor in Babylon, N.Y., complain that the project is being inappropriately fast-tracked by federal agencies and will run roughshod over environmental reviews. 
 As the region faces the possibility of large-scale commercial wind farms with turbines as tall as 425 feet -- more than 100 feet higher than the Statue of Liberty -- the debate over projects on the horizon in South Jersey, on Long Island and elsewhere is intensifying. 
 Wind farm economics, better turbine technology, government emphasis on renewable energy and a key federal tax break -- the production tax credit -- make wind farms more attractive for major companies like FPL Energy, a global wind power giant in Juno Beach, Fla., which would build and own the LIPA project. Much of the action in the region will be offshore, in contrast to the rest of the country, including upstate New York, where most wind turbines are being built on land. 
 The local wind fields that come closest to providing average 18-mile-an-hour breezes, the optimum to turn turbine blades and maximize electricity output, are along the Jersey Shore and Long Island's South Shore, according to wind-energy experts. 
 Connecticut is unlikely to join the movement onshore or off, at least for the foreseeable future. Experts say that given current technology, winds off Long Island Sound are too weak for commercial wind farms; a prevalence of buildings and trees take Connecticut, New Jersey and downstate New York, including Long Island and Westchester County, out of the running for large land-based wind projects. 
 Upstate New York, on the other hand, has wind fields that make it one of the best sites in the nation for wind power, says the American Wind Energy Association. Without tax breaks and other incentives, however, large-scale wind farming, particularly offshore, is not likely to attract developers and investors. That would be a setback for states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have set goals for increased renewable energy. 
 In New Jersey, for example, wind power is central to a goal of meeting 20 percent of energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki, who supports the LIPA project, has set a similar goal. 
 Nobody expects offshore wind farms to be cheap. At $12 million, the five onshore turbines in Atlantic City cost just a fraction of the expected costs for the far larger New Jersey and LIPA projects. 
 While the Long Island Power Authority and FPL have declined to estimate the cost of building the 40 South Shore turbines, estimates generally run from $300 million to $400 million. The 80 New Jersey turbines could cost twice as much, depending on water depth and other factors.
 LIPA would also pay an estimated $40 million to run a transmission line to an onshore power substation near Massapequa from a floating substation connected to the turbines. Transmission costs in New Jersey would depend on the turbines' distance from shore and their proximity to a near-shore substation, a key consideration. The five Atlantic City turbines are next to a substation.
 A report done for the New Jersey blue-ribbon panel noted that the cost of generating electricity from onshore wind turbines dropped from 30 cents a kilowatt-hour in the early 1980s to about 5 cents now. But it estimated that offshore turbine generation cost close to 9 cents a kilowatt-hour because of higher construction, operating and transmission costs. 
 By contrast, power generated by oil-, gas- and coal-powered plants feeding into the PJM Interconnection -- the grid operator covering most of the country from the Hudson River to the Chicago area and as far south as North Carolina -- costs 2 to 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, the report said. PJM supplies power to 51 million customers.
 The 140-megawatt maximum the LIPA project would produce amounts to slightly more than 2 percent of its peak use of 5,792 megawatts and equals only about half the output of a small utility generator powered by natural gas. 
 Often, LIPA said, its turbines would provide less than half the 140-megawatt maximum. Production would flatten most in the summer, when winds are lightest and Long Island's electric demand is greatest. 
 In Europe, power providers are having trouble coping with the variable output of wind turbines, according to a study by ABS Energy Research in London. When winds slacken, providers must scramble to draw supplies from conventional plants, the report said. It also suggested that wind power was having only limited impact on overall greenhouse gas emissions.
 For large-scale wind farm developers, subsidies and public policies that assure that every kilowatt of wind power will have a buyer help bridge the cost-per-kilowatt gap. The largest tax offset, the production tax credit, allows developers and investors to recoup capital costs more quickly once turbines are producing. But the credit expires at the end of 2007. 
 While the wind industry expects Congress to extend it, slowness could hamstring projects. Congress has let the credit lapse three times in the past, each time causing a virtual cessation of projects until it was reinstated.
 LIPA and FPL want to complete construction of the South Shore turbines in 2009; various federal approvals are needed.
 Project supporters say the tax credit would be passed along to customers, but critics see a bonanza for FPL, the world's largest wind farm owner and operator. ''They are going to have federal tax credits all over the place,'' said Philip Healey, a Save Jones Beach member from Massapequa. ''They're not doing this because it's a noble cause. They want their money back.'' 
 Richard M. Kessel, LIPA's chairman, says that turbine opponents are reaching for any monkey wrench available. ''The bottom line is you are either for the environment or you are against it,'' he said. 
 Still, turbines are not always environmentally benign. A turbine complex in Altamont Pass in the San Francisco Bay Area begun in the 1980s has killed thousands of raptors, including golden eagles. (FPL is among its owners.) In the Southeast, turbines, including ones owned by FPL, have killed large numbers of bats. 
 Audubon societies in New York and New Jersey support wind technology but say wind farms must be properly located. Audubon officials said that required three years of close on-site and radar observation. 
 But turbine supporters see no insurmountable obstacles. In New Jersey, State Senator William L. Gormley wrote to Governor Corzine in September asking that the offshore project be located in state waters within three miles of the Atlantic County coast. Mr. Corzine will consider the request, a spokesman, Anthony Coley, said. 
 ''This senator from New Jersey lives on the coast and doesn't have a problem,'' said Mr. Gormley, a Republican from Margate. ''People in my district have found windmills are environmentally friendly and aesthetically pleasing.''
 OFFICIALS in Cape May County, hard by the best offshore wind fields in the state, are less enthusiastic. Diane Wieland, the director of the Cape May County Department of Tourism and a member of the blue-ribbon panel, said she worried that turbines off Cape May would give tourists a reason to go elsewhere. Tourism is a $30 billion-a-year industry in New Jersey, the state estimates. 
 ''What would it take to flip them?'' she said. ''The Atlantic City turbines look great, but they're on land.''
 Whether offshore turbines would be audible from land is also an issue. Some people fear a distant whup-whup-whup from the turbine blades. In Atlantic City, Mr. Dovey said there had been no noise complaints from a residential area just across busy Route 30 from the turbines. 
 From underneath, the turning blades made a powerful whooshing and paper-tearing sound on a breezy fall afternoon. 
 A new opponent on Long Island, Donald Trump, raises an additional issue. He said that the turbines would spoil the view from the recently proposed three-story Trump on the Ocean catering hall that he is financing at Jones Beach. 
 ''Wind turbines opposite Jones Beach will be an environmental disaster, both in terms of visual and noise,'' Mr. Trump said. ''They are not a pretty thing to look at.'' 
 Mr. Kessel, the LIPA chairman, was equally critical of Mr. Trump. ''For someone who wants to spoil Jones Beach by building a three-story monster catering hall right on the beach, and that's O.K., but windmills aren't, enough said,'' he said.

Upstate, Another Kind of Farm
 While Long Island and New Jersey are considering offshore wind farms, the region's wind turbine projects that are furthest along are in upstate New York.
 The largest complex east of the Mississippi, Maple Ridge, on the Tug Hill Plateau in Lewis County, N.Y., generates up to 322 megawatts from 195 turbines. With the blades in the upward position, the turbines stand 390 feet tall.
 Much smaller wind farms in New York are operating in Fenner (30 megawatts), Madison (11.5 megawatts) and Wethersfield (6.6 megawatts). More than 50 projects, many expected to generate more than 100 megawatts, are seeking approvals. 
 The upstate projects do have critics. Some residents in communities where they have been proposed, including Cohocton and Prattsburgh in the Finger Lakes region, are recoiling from the prospect of vistas lined with the turbines and asking whether private developers are leaving residents with turbine blight.

HEADLINE: Fuming Over the Cost of Classics on Cable

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
joeberg@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LORETTA TIERNEY of Milford is fierce about old movies. At 86 years old, long retired from a manager's job at Schick razors, she likes nothing better than to settle into her brown armchair and turn on Turner Classic Movies, where she can watch Cary Grant or Loretta Young fill the screen with matchless style. 
 ''I wouldn't give you two cents for today's programs,'' she says . ''They don't even make sense. Years ago they knew how to tell an interesting story.'' 
Talk about interesting stories. The other evening she and her daughter, Regina, caught ''Tomorrow Is Forever,'' about a soldier's wife who is mistakenly informed that her husband died in action. Mrs. Tierney's first husband, Francis Carey, was killed in World War II, and his body was never found. Sure enough, as she gazed at Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles, she was in tears.
 ''It always reminds me of Fran,'' she told Regina.
 Several weeks ago a message flashed across Mrs. Tierney's screen telling her that to continue receiving the Turner Classic channel, she would have to rent a digital box and remote for about $6 per month, or $12 for her two televisions. Of all the channels, in all the cable systems in all the world, they were taking away her favorite. So essential to her pursuit of happiness is getting the old movies that she felt she had no choice but to get the boxes. 
 ''It's a shame, they're putting a price on Turner Classic Movies, whereas before you turned on the television, there it was,'' she said. ''The people that are involved are the elderly. They're the ones who want to have old movies.''
 Talk to many other of Cablevision's 3.1 million subscribers in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey and perhaps a more appropriate phrase for capturing reaction would come from another old movie, ''Network'': ''I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!'' They see Cablevision's surgical move as an oblique way of raising rates for people not interested in digital offerings like HBO.
 Catherine Nihart, a member of Milford's Board of Education and a Humphrey Bogart fan, decided not to get the digital box because she is more a news than a movie viewer and taking away TCM was not ''a deal breaker.'' Still, she is miffed.
 ''They're always messing with it,'' she said. ''They're shuffling the product mix and end up getting more money.'' 
 There's not much Ms. Nihart can do. Federal law forbids local governments from regulating rates for services beyond basic cable, which provides only major networks, two public access channels and a few other channels for about $15 a month. That was Congress' decision in 1996 as it foresaw a brave new world of competitive cable. The fact is that in almost every municipality in the New York region, the resident cable company has a monopoly.
 Cablevision, in a letter to its customers, explained the decision this way: ''To meet our ongoing commitment to provide you with the best home entertainment experience, we are continuously making significant technological improvements in your area.'' In other words, to provide Mrs. Tierney and Ms. Nihart with the best home entertainment experience, the company will no longer offer them the channel they like at the same price. 
 In a statement, Jim Maiella, a Cablevision spokesman, explained that the company was converting ''older analog signals to digital technology that is far superior and offers real benefits to consumers.'' Three quarters of Cablevision's customers already have digital cable, he said, and by switching TCM to Cablevision's digital systems, 1 million more customers will be receiving it. The statement did not say why the company picked TCM and not a less popular channel, nor why people who don't want this benefit should have to pay for it. 
 Cablevision, it should be noted, has been down this road before, angering subscribers when it removed the Yankees' YES Network from its lineup because YES was asking for more money to distribute its programming.
 Jeannine Kenney, a policy analyst for Consumers Union, the watchdog group, says cable providers across the country have been switching channels to digital ''and forcing consumers to pay the premium for digital television whether they want it or not.'' It's all the result, she said, of the wonderful world of deregulation, which has lowered airfares and phone bills, but since 1996 seems to have raised cable costs more than twice the rate of inflation. 
 The growth of satellite TV has not brought down rates either, she said, because consumers don't like to change providers or don't live in homes with ideal satellite reception. 
 It was an old actor, Ronald Reagan, who set off the wave of deregulation, and to watch him, Mrs. Tierney and Ms. Nihart will now have to pay an extra $6 a month per television.

HEADLINE: Fuming Over the Cost of Classics on Cable

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ARMAND D'AMOUR of Elmsford, a retired automobile body-shop owner with a name that might have lured Hedy Lamarr to the Casbah, loves the old movies. Bette Davis, Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne are the stars that twinkle for him on his favorite channel, Turner Classic Movies.
 So Mr. D'Amour was more than a little disturbed to learn recently that Cablevision, which had always provided the channel as part of its so-called expanded basic package, was requiring that he rent a digital box and remote for $5.80 a month per television to continue to receive TCM. Of all the channels in all the cable systems in all the world, Cablevision is taking away his favorite. Because Mr. D'Amour, like many people, has multiple TVs -- three, in his case -- he would pay an extra $18 a month. 
''I feel this is an underhanded way of raising the rates,'' said Mr. D'Amour, 81, who knows a thing or two about cable because he was once on Elmsford's cable commission. ''I don't want to pay $18 more a month just to get a box in my house.''
 Talk to other county residents and perhaps a more appropriate phrase for capturing reaction would come from another old movie, ''Network'': ''I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!'' 
 Alvin Galland, 66, who has five televisions in his Hastings-on-Hudson home, decided years ago that he didn't need a digital box; he didn't want HBO or movies on demand, and $50 per month was enough. Mr. Galland calls Cablevision's move ''greedy.'' He said he believed that Cablevision expected the older, more affluent TCM audience to sheepishly absorb the added expense.
 ''In free enterprise, a business is allowed to make whatever decision they want, but when they're granted a franchise, which gives them a monopoly, they can't change the rules of the game,'' he said. ''When you take a mortgage, you have an agreement with the bank. Halfway through, they can't change the rates.''
 Mr. Galland, who runs a temporary employment agency, wrote a letter on Oct. 13 complaining to Cablevision and has yet to get a response, but there's not much he can do. Federal law forbids local governments from regulating rates for services beyond basic cable, which provides major networks, two public access channels and a few other channels for a modest $12 or so a month. That was Congress' decision in 1996 as it optimistically foresaw a brave new world of competitive cable. The fact is that almost everywhere in Westchester, the resident cable company has a monopoly, although Verizon is about to arrive in a couple of towns.
 Cablevision, in a letter to many of its 3.1 million customers in Westchester, Long Island, southern Connecticut, northern New Jersey and parts of New York City, explained the decision this way: ''To meet our ongoing commitment to provide you with the best home entertainment experience, we are continuously making significant technological improvements in your area.'' In other words, to provide Mr. D'Amour and Mr. Galland with the best home entertainment experience, the company will no longer offer them the channel they like best at the same price.
 In a statement, Jim Maiella, a spokesman for Cablevision, said the company was converting ''older analog signals to digital technology that is far superior and offers real benefits to consumers.'' More than 75 percent of Cablevision's customers already have digital cable, he said, and by switching TCM from its analog to its digital systems, 1 million more customers will be receiving it. The statement did not say why the company picked TCM and not a less popular channel, nor why people who don't want this benefit should have to pay for it.
 Cablevision, it should be noted, has been down this road before, angering subscribers when it removed the Yankees' YES Network from its lineup because YES was asking for too much money to distribute its programming.
 Jeannine Kenney, a policy analyst for Consumers Union, the watchdog group, says cable providers across the country have been switching channels to digital ''and forcing consumers to pay the premium for digital television, whether they want it or not.'' It's all the result, she said, of the wonderful world of deregulation, which has lowered airfares and phone bills, but since 1996 seems to have raised cable costs more than twice the rate of inflation.
 The growth of satellite TV has not brought down rates either, she said, because consumers don't like to change providers or don't live in homes with ideal satellite reception. Verizon is making inroads; it recently received fiber-optic cable franchises in Greenburgh and Irvington. Though its version of expanded basic, which includes TCM, is $39.95 a month, prices are hard to compare because packages differ. 
 It was an old actor, Ronald Reagan, who set off the wave of deregulation, but he won't be appearing as often on Mr. D'Amour's or Mr. Galland's TV sets.

HEADLINE: Is the Answer Blowing In the Wind?

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
FOR almost a year, five turbines on New Jersey's first coastal wind farm have been generating electricity in Atlantic City, their slowly revolving 118-foot-long blades making the turbines resemble gigantic upright roulette wheels.
 They are the first full-size turbines along the coast in New York and New Jersey and the region's first working examples of a clean-energy technology that supporters say will one day ease dependence on oil and gas and begin to address concerns about global warming.
 They may also be a forerunner to more ambitious, far larger projects now under discussion for the coast of New Jersey, Long Island and, depending on oil prices and the future of wind power technology, even Connecticut, where a lack of strong winds has so far deterred investment.
 Wind farms are no longer just demonstration projects elsewhere, though. In upstate New York, 181 turbines at four wind farms in Lewis, Madison and Wyoming Counties can produce about 280 megawatts in optimum winds. Hundreds more turbines are proposed. 
 Nationally, Texas and California are the leaders in wind energy production, which crossed the 10,000-megawatt threshold earlier this year (10,000 megawatts is enough to power 2.5 million homes). The American Wind Energy Association, a trade group in Washington, said that more than 19,000 wind turbines were in operation. The association predicts that about 3,000 megawatts will be added nationally each year for the next several years.
 Europe, led by Germany and Spain, is in the forefront of wind energy, producing two-thirds of the 59,000 megawatts generated worldwide, the Global Wind Energy Council said. 
 Yet, despite the operation of New Jersey's small wind project since January, there is uncertainty about whether wind farms, particularly gigantic turbines positioned off the region's coastline, will be embraced here. 
 On Long Island, a 40-turbine project being considered off the South Shore is facing stiff resistance from opponents who argue that the turbines will damage pristine ocean views, fail to deliver cost-effective electricity and create environmental problems.
 In New Jersey, powerful local politicians have lined up behind wind power, where up to 80 turbines -- rising 380 feet or more above the water along the South Jersey coastline -- have been proposed to take advantage of the near-constant breezes. 
 That pilot project, which was recommended by a statewide blue-ribbon panel charged with evaluating offshore wind systems, would test the technology and, if successful, set the stage for other offshore projects. Gov. Jon S. Corzine supports proceeding with the project, but no site has been chosen. 
 The five turbines in Atlantic City, with a track record of nearly a year, can generate a combined 8 megawatts when winds are blowing at 13 to 40 miles an hour. 
 For a state whose energy consumption tops 17,000 megawatts at the summer peak, the output is minuscule -- and with winds being inconsistent, the turbines usually produce far less than 8 megawatts. Richard Dovey, the president of the Atlantic County Utilities Authority, the host of the turbines, said that while the turbines' megawatt production varied because of fluctuations in wind, there were few bad wind days.
 Mr. Dovey said that there had been few complaints about the emission-free coastal turbines. But public acceptance of 80 turbines clearly visible from ocean beaches -- including, perhaps, just off Cape May or the casino-lined Atlantic City Boardwalk beach -- has yet to be tested. The demonstration project is not visible from the beaches. It is located near a wastewater treatment plant on an island tucked away from the Boardwalk and beaches. 
 About 100 miles away, off Long Island's South Shore, the Long Island Power Authority is seeking to become a national leader in wind power with plans for 40 offshore turbines in an eight-square-mile area in federal waters as close as 3.6 miles to Jones Beach State Park. But unlike the Atlantic City project, the LIPA proposal is meeting strong opposition.
 The project, which could produce up to 140 megawatts of power in optimum wind, has emphatic support from environmental groups, which regard it as a crucial step toward clean energy that will reduce dependence on imported oil and gas and combat, in however small a way, global warming. Polls, including one taken on Sept. 20 by Hofstra University for the cable channel News 12 Long Island, have shown strong public support for the project. But it also has a growing list of detractors. 
 The Save Jones Beach Ad Hoc Committee, a grass-roots group made up mostly of South Shore residents that is the leading opponent, contends that the turbines would be a waste of customers' money; a poor alternative to repowering existing fossil-fuel plants to boost capacity while greatly reducing emissions; a killer of birds and fish; and an eyesore. 
 ''In Atlantic City, they had a sewer plant and they put five turbines next to it,'' said Walter Arnold, a committee director from West Gilgo Beach, N.Y. ''Here, you're talking about 40 turbines off a state and national historic park, and 28 miles of electric cables.''
 The group is not alone in its opposition. Local officials including Steven Bellone, the town supervisor in Babylon, N.Y., complain that the project is being inappropriately fast-tracked by federal agencies and will run roughshod over environmental reviews. 
 As the region faces the possibility of large-scale commercial wind farms with turbines as tall as 425 feet -- more than 100 feet higher than the Statue of Liberty -- the debate over projects on the horizon in South Jersey, on Long Island and elsewhere is intensifying. 
 Wind farm economics, better turbine technology, government emphasis on renewable energy and a key federal tax break -- the production tax credit -- make wind farms more attractive for major companies like FPL Energy, a global wind power giant in Juno Beach, Fla., which would build and own the LIPA project. Much of the action in the region will be offshore, in contrast to the rest of the country, including upstate New York, where most wind turbines are being built on land. 
 The local wind fields that come closest to providing average 18-mile-an-hour breezes, the optimum to turn turbine blades and maximize electricity output, are along the Jersey Shore and Long Island's South Shore, according to wind-energy experts. 
 Connecticut is unlikely to join the movement onshore or off, at least for the foreseeable future. Experts say that given current technology, winds off Long Island Sound are too weak for commercial wind farms; a prevalence of buildings and trees take Connecticut, New Jersey and downstate New York, including Long Island and Westchester County, out of the running for large land-based wind projects. 
 Upstate New York, on the other hand, has wind fields that make it one of the best sites in the nation for wind power, says the American Wind Energy Association. Without tax breaks and other incentives, however, large-scale wind farming, particularly offshore, is not likely to attract developers and investors. That would be a setback for states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have set goals for increased renewable energy. 
 In New Jersey, for example, wind power is central to a goal of meeting 20 percent of energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki, who supports the LIPA project, has set a similar goal. 
 Nobody expects offshore wind farms to be cheap. At $12 million, the five onshore turbines in Atlantic City cost just a fraction of the expected costs for the far larger New Jersey and LIPA projects. 
 While the Long Island Power Authority and FPL have declined to estimate the cost of building the 40 South Shore turbines, estimates generally run from $300 million to $400 million. The 80 New Jersey turbines could cost twice as much, depending on water depth and other factors.
 LIPA would also pay an estimated $40 million to run a transmission line to an onshore power substation near Massapequa from a floating substation connected to the turbines. Transmission costs in New Jersey would depend on the turbines' distance from shore and their proximity to a near-shore substation, a key consideration. The five Atlantic City turbines are next to a substation.
 A report done for the New Jersey blue-ribbon panel noted that the cost of generating electricity from onshore wind turbines dropped from 30 cents a kilowatt-hour in the early 1980s to about 5 cents now. But it estimated that offshore turbine generation cost close to 9 cents a kilowatt-hour because of higher construction, operating and transmission costs. 
 By contrast, power generated by oil-, gas- and coal-powered plants feeding into the PJM Interconnection -- the grid operator covering most of the country from the Hudson River to the Chicago area and as far south as North Carolina -- costs 2 to 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, the report said. PJM supplies power to 51 million customers.
 The 140-megawatt maximum the LIPA project would produce amounts to slightly more than 2 percent of its peak use of 5,792 megawatts and equals only about half the output of a small utility generator powered by natural gas. 
 Often, LIPA said, its turbines would provide less than half the 140-megawatt maximum. Production would flatten most in the summer, when winds are lightest and Long Island's electric demand is greatest. 
 In Europe, power providers are having trouble coping with the variable output of wind turbines, according to a study by ABS Energy Research in London. When winds slacken, providers must scramble to draw supplies from conventional plants, the report said. It also suggested that wind power was having only limited impact on overall greenhouse gas emissions.
 For large-scale wind farm developers, subsidies and public policies that assure that every kilowatt of wind power will have a buyer help bridge the cost-per-kilowatt gap. The largest tax offset, the production tax credit, allows developers and investors to recoup capital costs more quickly once turbines are producing. But the credit expires at the end of 2007. 
 While the wind industry expects Congress to extend it, slowness could hamstring projects. Congress has let the credit lapse three times in the past, each time causing a virtual cessation of projects until it was reinstated.
 LIPA and FPL want to complete construction of the South Shore turbines in 2009; various federal approvals are needed.
 Project supporters say the tax credit would be passed along to customers, but critics see a bonanza for FPL, the world's largest wind farm owner and operator. ''They are going to have federal tax credits all over the place,'' said Philip Healey, a Save Jones Beach member from Massapequa. ''They're not doing this because it's a noble cause. They want their money back.'' 
 Richard M. Kessel, LIPA's chairman, says that turbine opponents are reaching for any monkey wrench available. ''The bottom line is you are either for the environment or you are against it,'' he said. 
 Still, turbines are not always environmentally benign. A turbine complex in Altamont Pass in the San Francisco Bay Area begun in the 1980s has killed thousands of raptors, including golden eagles. (FPL is among its owners.) In the Southeast, turbines, including ones owned by FPL, have killed large numbers of bats. 
 Audubon societies in New York and New Jersey support wind technology but say wind farms must be properly located. Audubon officials said that required three years of close on-site and radar observation. 
 But turbine supporters see no insurmountable obstacles. In New Jersey, State Senator William L. Gormley wrote to Governor Corzine in September asking that the offshore project be located in state waters within three miles of the Atlantic County coast. Mr. Corzine will consider the request, a spokesman, Anthony Coley, said. 
 ''This senator from New Jersey lives on the coast and doesn't have a problem,'' said Mr. Gormley, a Republican from Margate. ''People in my district have found windmills are environmentally friendly and aesthetically pleasing.''
 OFFICIALS in Cape May County, hard by the best offshore wind fields in the state, are less enthusiastic. Diane Wieland, the director of the Cape May County Department of Tourism and a member of the blue-ribbon panel, said she worried that turbines off Cape May would give tourists a reason to go elsewhere. Tourism is a $30 billion-a-year industry in New Jersey, the state estimates. 
 ''What would it take to flip them?'' she said. ''The Atlantic City turbines look great, but they're on land.''
 Whether offshore turbines would be audible from land is also an issue. Some people fear a distant whup-whup-whup from the turbine blades. In Atlantic City, Mr. Dovey said there had been no noise complaints from a residential area just across busy Route 30 from the turbines. 
 From underneath, the turning blades made a powerful whooshing and paper-tearing sound on a breezy fall afternoon. 
 A new opponent on Long Island, Donald Trump, raises an additional issue. He said that the turbines would spoil the view from the recently proposed three-story Trump on the Ocean catering hall that he is financing at Jones Beach. 
 ''Wind turbines opposite Jones Beach will be an environmental disaster, both in terms of visual and noise,'' Mr. Trump said. ''They are not a pretty thing to look at.'' 
 Mr. Kessel, the LIPA chairman, was equally critical of Mr. Trump. ''For someone who wants to spoil Jones Beach by building a three-story monster catering hall right on the beach, and that's O.K., but windmills aren't, enough said,'' he said.

Upstate, Another Kind of Farm
 While Long Island and New Jersey are considering offshore wind farms, the region's wind turbine projects that are furthest along are in upstate New York.
 The largest complex east of the Mississippi, Maple Ridge, on the Tug Hill Plateau in Lewis County, N.Y., generates up to 322 megawatts from 195 turbines. With the blades in the upward position, the turbines stand 390 feet tall.
 Much smaller wind farms in New York are operating in Fenner (30 megawatts), Madison (11.5 megawatts) and Wethersfield (6.6 megawatts). More than 50 projects, many expected to generate more than 100 megawatts, are seeking approvals. 
 The upstate projects do have critics. Some residents in communities where they have been proposed, including Cohocton and Prattsburgh in the Finger Lakes region, are recoiling from the prospect of vistas lined with the turbines and asking whether private developers are leaving residents with turbine blight.

HEADLINE: Turf Battle Looms in the Diamond District

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The billboard above the blue construction fence on 47th Street west of Fifth Avenue announces the ''Future Home of the Global Diamond and Jewelry Trade,'' including modern office space, underground parking, a maximum-security vault and a museum. 
 The project, and the city Economic Development Corporation's decision to provide a $37.5 million subsidy package over 10 years, has touched off an angry debate in the secretive Diamond District. And the outcome may very well determine the future of the dowdy 60-year-old Midtown enclave, which continues to draw tourists and New Yorkers looking for a good deal on a ring or a necklace.
The developer of the $433.5 million project, Gary Barnett, a former Belgian diamond trader, promises that his tower, like similar complexes in Antwerp, Shanghai, Dubai and Ramat Gan, Israel, housing diamond cutters, traders, brokers and jewelry retailers in a modern upscale setting, will restore the district as a world center for the trade. 
 But some longtime landlords and tenants on 47th Street have mobilized against the proposed tax incentives, hiring lobbyists and publicists to go against those employed by the developer at a city Industrial Development Agency hearing on Thursday. 
 They say that the city's subsidies will not draw new business, but will only enable the developer to poach existing tenants and destroy the block's delicate symbiosis between small dealers in the booths and the big shots at the Diamond Dealers Club. The 47th Street Business Improvement District opposed the deal at first, but is now neutral.
 ''He's going to build the building no matter what,'' said Jeffrey Levin, the district's chairman. ''It's not going to be all jewelers. He's going to pay a lot of money to the BID. I think that's good.''
 But Bettina Damiani, director of Good Jobs New York, questioned the rationale for favoring one landlord over another. ''The industry might need some upgrading, but there's not a desperate need for taxpayer assistance,'' she said.
 Mr. Barnett dismissed the criticism, saying the aging buildings on the block between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas are outdated. About 90 percent of the diamonds coming into the United States flow through New York, he said, but the district must improve or lose ground to other cities. The competition is getting closer: In October, a 50-story ''World Jewelry Center'' with modern amenities was proposed for Las Vegas.
 New York's district has been in decline for 20 years, said Mr. Barnett, chairman of the Extell Development Company. He added, ''There is no modern facility like they have in all the other diamond and jewelry centers in the world.''
 The opposition is led by Kenneth Kahn and Arthur Margolin, who own two prominent buildings in the diamond district, and Philip A. Mactaggart, the owner of three others. Mr. Barnett has been wooing many of Mr. Kahn's and Mr. Margolin's tenants, including the Diamond Dealers Club, one of 20 diamond bourses in the world, and the Gemological Institute of America, which grades and certifies precious stones.
 According to club members, Mr. Barnett has offered state-of-the-art space for little or no rent, at least in the early years. The club would lure distributors, retailers and manufacturers. The Gemological Institute has long been unhappy at its location and is said to be considering moving some operations to New Jersey.
 Mr. Margolin said he was not afraid of competition, but resented the city's providing tax breaks for one owner. He and his partner complained that the tower would lure the leading retailers that draw customers into the exchanges, while leaving behind the smaller stores and some distributors to fend for themselves.
 ''Barnett will have a diamond building and the rest of the block will become something else,'' Mr. Margolin said. ''It's almost as if the city is helping him steal tenants.''
 But Seth Pinsky, executive vice president of the city's development corporation, said, ''The city feels it's important to preserve 47th Street as a center of one of the few soup-to-nuts industries still in Midtown.'' 
 Mr. Barnett was at an impasse with the city this year over his request for a hefty subsidy package, but several weeks ago the development corporation agreed to a new proposal -- backed by some City Hall officials -- that tied the exemptions to new jobs in the industry.
 The more new jobs, the larger the exemptions on property, sales and mortgage recording taxes, according to officials and executives briefed on the talks. Mr. Barnett would lose the benefits altogether if less than two-thirds of the building was occupied by tenants from outside the industry, or if less than a fifth of the occupants were new or expanding businesses.
 The New York industry has been buffeted in recent years by competition from India and, more recently, from China, as well as by dealers on the Internet and in suburban exchanges. Thousands of cutters and polishers have been put out of work or forced to retire. But the city remains a hub, specializing in the larger and most expensive stones -- five or more carats -- which are cut and polished behind a set of triple-locked doors at high-end manufacturers like the William Goldberg Diamond Corporation nearby on 48th Street.
 Industry experts say that manufacturing will not return to New York -- not when it costs about $110 to cut a one-carat diamond in New York and $10 to do so in India. 
 Mr. Barnett said his building would attract high-end retailers, distributors and manufacturers polishing diamonds ''worth many thousands of dollars a carat,'' because it would have well-designed space, high-speed elevators and underground parking for secure deliveries. He said that some tenants might come from Mr. Kahn's building for the modern space, but that most would come from outside the city.
 Two possible tenants are Isaac E. Musighi, president of Pacific M International, a Los Angeles diamond wholesaler and manufacturer, and Jacob Kristal, chief executive of Royal Diamond Cutters in Antwerp, a major manufacturer that employs 3,000 diamond cutters in Belgium, India and Russia.
 Mr. Musighi and Mr. Kristal each said he might buy a 6,000-square-foot condominium in the 750,000-square-foot tower and employ a half-dozen people. They also said they might sublease some of their space.
 ''Forty-Seventh Street is a mess,'' Mr. Kristal said. ''I'm not J. C. Penney or 7-Eleven. People who are coming to me are looking for an image. This building will be the center of the industry and the other buildings will be like satellites.''
 Critics say it may be hard to fill the tower with many small tenants who require just 600 square feet or less, and even more difficult to create the 520 to 1,320 new jobs promised by the developer. 
 ''The idea that he's going to fill the building with fresh blood sounds great,'' said Saul Goldberg, chairman of William Goldberg. ''It's a frighteningly large amount of square footage for our industry. Most of the important players are already here.''

HEADLINE: In Crumbling Camden, New Challenges for a Recovery Plan 

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J. 

 BODY:
Maria Navarro's home here is standing firm against the creeping decay, the last building on a block consumed by wild shrubs and settled by stray cats. There was another building nearby, but it burned down a year ago. Now squatters live in its roofless remains.
 ''It looks trashy out here,'' Ms. Navarro said. ''You see rocks everywhere and no trees. You know, like in the suburbs.''
It is the kind of a picture that defines Camden, a once-bustling industrial riverfront town that has for decades been a fixture on lists of the nation's poorest and most dangerous cities. 
 Four years ago, the State Legislature agreed to send $175 million to help resuscitate this crumbling city, and Ms. Navarro and her neighbors had new hope: there were to be job training programs to lower the bulging unemployment rate; incentives to lure middle-class residents to the banks of the Delaware River and dislodge the ever-growing clusters of crime and poverty. 
 But a series of recent departures by the stewards of the institutions that the residents look to for stability have again bogged down Camden's future. The state-appointed chief operating officer, Melvin Primas, announced his resignation last month, saying that Trenton was trying to exert too much control over the decision-making.
 The school superintendent resigned over the summer under state investigation for bonuses she received. The police department, which was taken over by the county prosecutors office during the Whitman administration, has its fourth leader in three years. The acting county prosecutor recently announced his resignation. 
 All this has taken place as Wayne R. Bryant, an influential state senator who represents Camden County and is both an architect and a patron of the recovery package, resigned his position as chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee in September after it was disclosed that he was the subject of criminal investigations.
 So, at best, Camden is at yet another crossroads when it was supposed to be moving forward; at worst, the city is rudderless as many here have begun to question the soundness of the recovery plan after more than $121 million has been spent. 
 ''It's certainly challenging,'' said Nyeema Watson, a native of the city who runs a research center at Rutgers University and who sits on Camden's Board of Education. ''I don't know what other word to use when all of your city administrators are in transition.'' 
 Gov. Jon S. Corzine appointed two members of his staff to help the transition until a successor to Mr. Primas, a popular former mayor of Camden known as Randy, is chosen. 
 Under Mr. Primas's reign, much of the money from the state package went to projects for the city's hospitals and colleges and to the waterfront.
 The New Jersey State Aquarium was expanded, improved and handed over to a private company, costing $25 million in recovery funds. A few blocks away a Philadelphia developer, Carl Dranoff, turned the former RCA Victor building into a luxury apartment building. And Rutgers University used $11 million in recovery money to begin construction of a new law school building.
 But some of the rehabilitation plans have been stymied. A proposed $1.2 billion cleanup of the Cramer Hill neighborhood by a North Carolina company, Cherokee Investment Partners, was fought in court by a group of tenants fearing displacement.
 A plan for Ms. Navarro's neighborhood, Bergen Square, is also being challenged in court because it proposes to demolish hundreds of homes to make way for a village of colorful town houses and condominiums, along with a tree-lined avenue and a new town square with jazz cafes.
 Ms. Watson, the school member, said that most of the time she is optimistic that the city will attract talented people challenged by its problems. ''The other 10 percent of the time,'' she said, ''I think, 'Who would want to come and help us out?' ''
 The sharpest critics of the recovery plan are found in neighborhoods like Ms. Navarro's, which continue to suffer as money is focused elsewhere. 
 ''I would just like to see things moving faster,'' said Ms. Navarro, who works promoting the downtown business district. ''I really don't want to move.''
 Camden's population has decreased by some 40,000 since the end of the second world war. Most of what was left of the middle class fled after the race riots in 1971, others left with Camden's biggest employers, like Campbell Soup, the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and RCA Victor.
 Today, 44 percent of the city's residents live in poverty, the highest rate in the nation, according to census figures released in August. The city's median income is $18,007, compared with $61,672 for the state. 
 A few short blocks from Ms. Navarro's house, on once-bustling Broadway, Richard Avedissian, 61, has held on to his family's dry-cleaning business, which opened in 1945. The business makes half the money it used to, and his family long ago moved to Cherry Hill. Every day at 4 p.m., an off-duty police officer comes by as Mr. Avedissian, who has been robbed three times, begins closing his shop.
 ''You have to clean up neighborhoods,'' he said. ''You have to bring jobs here. You can't take money and throw it at a problem.'' 
 The recovery act set out to accomplish those things, provide residents with jobs and then build affordable housing said Howard Gillette Jr., a professor at Rutgers University who wrote ''Camden After the Fall: Decline and Renewal in a Post-Industrial City'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005). 
 ''You'd have to look very far to find support for those statements in actions,'' Mr. Gillette said. ''How many jobs have been created? How many Camden residents have been trained? How many new housing opportunities have been created? It's very small.
 ''The real question is when you have a city that goes bankrupt like Camden has, do you try to manage your way out, or do you try to create an environment in which you get investment to reverse the market economy that has left the city behind? And can you do that in a way that is also fair and complementary to the needs of people who are here?'' 
 There has been near-unanimous agreement that the city needs to attract middle-class residents, but there are also differences about how to go about it. Some say Camden should become a college town, leveraging the presence of several universities here, including a campus of Rutgers with more than 5,000 students. Others look to the waterfront, with attractions like the aquarium, a minor league ballpark in the shadow of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and luxury condominiums. 
 But critics say these dreams have often failed to consider the wishes of residents. ''There's been a talk-down, heavy-handed approach to doing things,'' said Tom Knoche, a local activist who favors reviving Camden's ports to create jobs. 
 Elliot Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University, who worked on an economic plan for Camden over a decade ago, said the city needed the kinds of community empowerment movements he had seen take root in countries like India and Kenya.
 ''The hope is that if you drop money, rich people will come and eat quiche there.'' Mr. Sclar said of the current plan. ''No one has been working on building the basis for good local government.'' 
 For his part, Mr. Primas, who was mayor of Camden from 1981 to 1990, said the city had gone through ''a remarkable amount of change,'' citing housing starts in poor neighborhoods, improvements in the tax-collection rate and construction of new buildings on the waterfront and elsewhere.
 More than 1,600 housing units were built during his four-year tenure, he said. And the police department, now led by Arturo Venegas Jr., a former police chief from Sacramento, is undergoing reorganization.
 ''There are those who argue that more should have been done,'' Mr. Primas said. ''I would argue that four years in the life cycle of the city is a blink of an eye.''

HEADLINE: Help Meeting the Challenges of Parenthood and Poverty 

BYLINE: By KARI HASKELL

 BODY:
Joy Rolle, 30, of Brooklyn remembers when her contractions were coming stronger and closer together, before her water broke six years ago. It seemed like an eternity before she was wheeled into the delivery room. Her full-term pregnancy ended in an emergency Caesarean section because her son was in distress inside her womb. After recovery, she learned he had been born with a seizure disorder. 
 Elsa Taveras, 26, of the Bronx was living in a Brooklyn shelter two years ago, when her doctor told her she was pregnant with triplets. Abandoned by her steady boyfriend and already caring for two girls -- one with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- she was under stress. Little did she know her triplets would have the same disorder as their sister and be developmentally delayed.
And Darlene Rice, 39, of Brooklyn has faced having all three of her children born physically weak. Her first boy in 1991 was premature. He weighed a little more than five pounds, which was considered a healthy weight, but there were other complications. He had a hole in his small intestine. The list of ailments later included a heart murmur, hearing loss and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
 With each diagnosis, these women's lives irrevocably changed. Constrained by low incomes, they have struggled to provide their families and ailing children proper, and often lifesaving, health care. They have sacrificed jobs, and have lost or nearly lost their homes. 
 They are among 49 percent of families headed by single mothers in New York living below the poverty line, defined as $16,000 a year for a family of three. Mothers who are poor are 50 percent more likely to have a disabled child than those with higher incomes, according to census data.
 A single mother trying to carve time to tend to a sick child may start off expecting to lose only a few hours of pay. But missing one day too many can lead to losing a job. Unemployment usually means turning to public assistance. 
 Getting off government rolls or earning above a menial wage requires training, but the conundrum is how a mother already financially strapped and with few options for child care can attend classes.
 ''Particularly single mothers are falling further behind despite an improving economy,'' said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society. In a study, the Unheard Third 2006, C.S.S. found that mothers with low incomes will already have cut back on school supplies and clothing before health care and housing. 
 When lives are about compromise and tight budgets, poor New Yorkers have found assistance through The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. An emergency infusion of money from the fund can stave off a pending eviction, provide medication and medical equipment, send children to school in well-fitting clothes, or provide furniture for an empty home. It can also buy a moment's reprieve -- just a little time for a family to get back on solid ground.
 Today the Neediest Cases begins its 95th annual fund-raising campaign. Over the next three months, a series of articles will reveal how fraught lives were improved through assistance from the Neediest Cases. 

A Fateful Encounter
 The drive continues in much the same tradition in which it began on a brisk Christmas evening in 1911, when a down-on-his luck man approached Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times. The encounter impressed upon Mr. Ochs that New Yorkers were suffering despite their efforts. The following Christmas season, The Times printed 100 brief profiles. These were tiny windows into disparate situations that evoked readers' compassion, and provided them a way to improve people's lives in their community.
 Contributions from individuals, corporations and trusts typically vary from a few dollars to $1 million and are pooled and divided among seven charities. (Contributions from trusts and estates of more than $50,000 are put into an endowment and the income, recently more than $1 million a year, goes into the following year's campaign.)
 All donations go directly to those in need because The New York Times Company Foundation underwrites all administrative costs. Since 1912, nearly $160 million has been dispensed. In addition, $62.3 million was raised for the families affected by the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11. 
 This year's drive begins with a balance of $2,057,647.78. The amount was donated to the Neediest Cases since the 94th appeal closed in February and includes interest gained from trusts and estates. Contributions have been declining over the past five years and last year, they dropped 8 percent, fund officials said. 
 ''The decline was disappointing but understandable considering how generously the public responded to victims of two exceptional disasters, the tsunami in Asia and Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast,'' said Jack Rosenthal, the president of The New York Times Company Foundation. ''We fervently hope that this year, readers will recognize the enduring distress suffered by many poor families in New York. As Mayor Bloomberg's Commission on Economic Opportunity recently reported, one in five New Yorkers -- and one in three New York children -- lives in poverty, much higher than is true nationally.'' 
 ''This fund cannot answer the needs of them all,'' he said, ''but it can, true to its historic name, relieve the suffering of the neediest.''

The Search for Strength
 Joy Rolle first saw her 6-year-old son, Marquis, suffer a seizure when he was 11 months old. The next three days he spent in the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn were the beginning of four years' worth of visits to doctors. 
 While struggling to keep pace with his medical needs, Ms. Rolle was on the verge of homelessness. Three months' rent was overdue on an apartment that she had taken over from her mother. While trying to find a compromise in housing court and contending with her son's medical needs, she could not work enough hours as an operator at a car service. 
 In six months she was out of a job and owed $7,000 in back rent. 
 ''I didn't want a handout,'' she said. ''I just needed a little help.'' She turned to public assistance, receiving $218 from welfare and $170 a month in food stamps. 
 She also applied for a rent subsidy program, but was denied aid because she missed a mandatory welfare work training course, although she said she had received an exemption because of Marquis's illness. 
 The sanction was her breaking point. Marquis's father was not in the picture at the time, she said, and her mother, her only family, was battling a drug addiction. Ms. Rolle said she started hearing voices that replayed the worst-case situations in her head. 
 Through counseling at a Brooklyn psychotherapy center, she said she gained peace of mind, and by becoming a born-again Christian, she gained strength. 
 During this time, she also sought advice from South Brooklyn Legal Services about how she could have the sanction lifted on the welfare rent subsidy. She was referred to Leslie Boutin from the Community Service Society. Ms. Boutin and her department, Public Benefits Resource Center, succeeded in removing the barrier and helped Ms. Rolle qualify for the rent subsidy program. The welfare program also covered the past due rent. 
 ''If I hadn't met Leslie, I would be homeless and hungry,'' Ms. Rolle said. 
 Throughout the ordeal, she strove to develop Marquis's potential. She learned from his therapists provided by Medicaid how to reinforce his skills in mathematics and the alphabet. On the weekends, she and Marquis escaped their poor, drug-infested neighborhood to attend free events -- book readings, carnivals, street fairs and ''Mommy and Me'' classes -- in Park Slope and Manhattan. 
 In 2004, the subsidized housing she had applied for in 2000 opened in Crown Heights. Entering the apartment felt like home, but she had no money for furniture. 
 So Ms. Boutin used $454 from the Neediest Cases to buy a bed and dresser. As Marquis's health stabilized, Ms. Rolle returned to work and to school part time. She earns $10 an hour without benefits as an assistant to a director at Bridge Back to Life, a transitional recovery center Ms. Rolle pays $53 a month for rent that has been calculated on a sliding scale adjusted to her income. 
 ''Looking back, I can't believe I went through all that,'' she said.
 She added that Marquis has forced everyone in her life to be more responsible. Ms. Rolle has developed a stronger relationship with her mother, who is recovering from her addiction and has become a math teacher at Bridge Back to Life. On June 19, 2004, Ms. Rolle married her son's father, Derek Bobian. Last year Marquis graduated from kindergarten with honors. With the help of the Neediest Cases, she said her home was ''peaceful, full of love and strength.''

Stress, and Relief
 Elsa Taveras's home is full of love, but on most days she gets little peace. 
 On a recent afternoon, the subway rattling past her second-floor subsidized apartment was barely audible over the shrieks of her 4-year-old triplets: Jeremy, Justin and Joshua, who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
 ''It's like this every day,'' said Ms. Taveras with exasperation. ''If I was never referred to Children's Aid, I would be in a psychiatric clinic,'' she said, referring to the Children's Aid Society's Preventive Services in the Bronx and the help she received from Isa Andrejcisk, a worker there. ''Isa finds me solutions to my problems,'' she added.
 Just before their meeting two years ago, Ms. Taveras was scared and uncertain about the future. 
 She was living in a shelter with her boys, then toddlers, and her two girls, Alondra Sanchez, now 9, and Aranza Diaz, now 8. 
 One snowy evening, it was with trepidation that she violated a 9 p.m. curfew when she left her children sleeping to go buy milk. When she returned, an Administration for Children's Services officer was waiting for her. 
 The agency ruled out neglect, but required Ms. Taveras to go to the Children's Aid Society, an A.C.S. partner agency and another of the seven charities supported by the Neediest Cases. 
 Shortly after, with assistance from the shelter, she moved into an emergency Section 8 apartment. With $358 from public assistance, $675 a month in food stamps and $542 in Supplemental Security Income, she could cover her share of the $278 for housing and her bills.
 Ms. Taveras's first mandatory meeting with Ms. Andrejcisk at the Children's Aid Society was in June 2004. 
 From the worn look on Ms. Taveras's face, ''I could see that she was overwhelmed,'' Ms. Andrejcisk said in a phone interview. At the time, Aranza's teachers had been complaining that she was distracted, terrorizing other children and destroying property. Her boys communicated with tantrums instead of words, making child care impossible. Without support, taking care of her children meant sacrificing her job as a manicurist at a beauty salon. 
 ''I really wanted to work, but it was too much for one person,'' Ms. Taveras said. 
 To address Ms. Taveras's emotional strain, Ms. Andrejcisk found her counseling and put her children in the center's day care. They also received medical checkups and were evaluated for mental disabilities. 
 Alondra, who does not have learning problems, has excelled in school. But Aranza and the boys were diagnosed as having severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and were developmentally delayed. Aranza has since enrolled in Fordham-Tremont Community Mental Health Center and the boys are in early intervention at the Kennedy Center, receiving speech and occupational therapy in the morning before their afternoon instruction at Children's Aid's childhood center. 
 Aranza's medication, Methylin, is working. ''It's amazing the difference; she can focus,'' said Ms. Taveras. When the boys are older, they will be evaluated to determine whether they can be prescribed similar medication. 
 During a home visit, Ms. Andrejcisk saw that the children were sleeping in broken beds and eating on the floor. Ms. Andrejcisk drew from the Neediest Cases, $600 for clothing and $1,789 for bedroom furniture and a kitchen table set. 
 Today, Ms. Taveras's home is still far from calm, but sleeping on a proper bed keeps her blood pressure down and energy up, she said. 
 ''There are always difficulties, but now it's getting a little better,'' she said. The next step: going back to work.

Steps, Forward and Back
 Darlene Rice also knows what it is to care for several children with disabilities.
 Her first son, Dashawn Mobley, had multiple medical complications when he was born in 1991, but did not show signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder until he was fitted for his first hearing aid when he was nearly 2. 
 As soon as the device slid into his ear, he darted to the pediatric playroom and banged on a drum, then weaved in and out of hospital rooms. The sight brought tears to her eyes. ''I was watching him discover sound for the first time,'' Ms. Rice said. 
 The moment of joy dimmed when his frantic behavior played out over and over at their home in Crown Heights. Simple outings became chaotic. 
 Searching for answers, she changed his diet -- no sugar -- and tightened discipline. But the stricter the rules, the more defiant he became. At 5, he was diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and later put on Ritalin and then Concerta. He also went into psychiatric counseling. 
 The medication helped him focus. He learned sign language and he also progressed in speech therapy. After her daughter, Dominique, was born in 1998, she also exhibited signs of slow development.
 Ms. Rice was again juggling doctor and psychiatric visits. She was also interviewing for jobs to get off welfare and she was hired as a clerk at the home care agency, Americare Certified Services. She lasted three years making $9 an hour.
 ''Anytime my children were sick, my boss understood,'' she said of her supervisor. When the company changed owners, however, her schedule became less flexible and harder to keep.
 The days she missed work, she also missed pay, and she was fired in June 2003. She had also been falling behind paying her $500 portion of the $858 rent for a subsidized apartment in Flatbush.
 ''I was literally killing myself,'' she said. ''It just became too much for me. If I paid the rent, where's the food money coming from?''
 By the end of 2003, she owed $3,000 in back rent. 
 She reapplied for public assistance, which she had received when Dashawn was born.
 ''People really judge you,'' she said. ''But I do what I can for my children, and if I have to put my business on Front Street I will do it for them.'' 
 Back on welfare, she received $250, close to $200 in food stamps, and a little over $500 in supplemental Social Security Income a month. With the help of Legal Aid, she contested the back rent with papers documenting every doctor visit that kept her from working, and met requirements for public assistance to pay her arrears. But just as she thought she was one step ahead, she took one step back. She was again pregnant with complications despite having protected sex.
 Her second son, Jared, was born in December 2005 with jaundice and a swollen kidney caused by an enzyme disorder. With her tight schedule, she looked for ways to do more for her children. A month before Jared was born, she went to Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens to enroll Dashawn and Dominique in the Big Brothers and Big Sisters program. ''He was a young man, he needed to get away to do boy things and guy things,'' she said. 
 Stacey Stringer, the director of the program, told Ms. Rice about a mentor for her two older children. Later they discussed the Model Secondary School for the Deaf in Washington for Dashawn. 
 Through his hard work, Dashawn was enrolled in September. Within the first few weeks, he called her from school, upset. Students were teasing him about his ill-fitting clothes, and calling him poor. 
 Caring for a sickly newborn, she did not have money for a high chair, much less her growing boy's pants or shoes. And at 15, he is 6-foot-2 and 179 pounds. 
 Ms. Rice confided in Ms. Stringer. ''With all her responsibilities, I knew it was something she couldn't do,'' said Ms. Stringer, who was able to purchase a $500 gift certificate through the Neediest Cases. 
 The assistance was an emotional boost at the right time. Dashawn had another medical setback -- several fainting spells at school that might be related to seizures. With all her children's ailments, her dreams of working again seem farther away.
 ''I want to go to work, but my children are the first priority,'' Ms. Rice said. ''They need me to get them to doctors, get them their medication. When you have needs and you're a single parent, you have to make choices, and if your child is sick, you don't have much choice at all. If I don't care for them, who will?''

HEADLINE: Talks to Start On Climate Amid Split On Warming 

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Climate negotiators are gathering in Nairobi, Kenya, for their 12th conference since 1992, with the world divided into three seemingly inflexible blocs on what to do about global warming.
 The conference will begin tomorrow and continue through Nov. 17. A host of specialists, including economists, environmentalists and United Nations officials, say the challenge this year is more daunting than ever.
''Right now it seems that the glaciers in Greenland are moving faster than the negotiators,'' John Coequyt, an energy policy analyst for Greenpeace, said in an interview during his trip to the meeting. 
 The discussions will focus on two international agreements that call for reductions in heat-trapping greenhouse gases, led by carbon dioxide, which is a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and forests. 
 The first agreement, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, was adopted in 1992, but its voluntary goals were soon missed. An addendum to the treaty was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 and took effect in February 2005. That pact, the Kyoto Protocol, requires most industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2012. 
 The United States and Australia, which accepted the 1992 treaty but not the Kyoto accord, will continue to promote voluntary programs to slow growth in emissions. 
 Europe and Japan lead a group of industrial nations that have pledged to meet the limits. At the Nairobi conference, those nations will try to set a timetable for determining new emissions targets for the five years that begin in 2012. 
 In the meantime, developing countries, focused on economic advancement, have rejected binding limits while demanding aid from industrial nations to limit damage from warming that is already inevitable.
 All the while, emissions have climbed.
 ''Worrying'' was the word Yvo de Boer, the executive secretary of the United Nations organization administering the treaty, used to describe greenhouse gas emissions trends.
 The United Nations reported last Monday that emissions grew from 2000 to 2004 even in the European Union, which has led the diplomatic campaign for reductions. The figures are on the Web at ghg.unfccc.int.
 Some industries and lobbying groups opposed to mandatory limits point out that emissions in the United States grew just 1.3 percent during that period, far less than the 2.4 percent measured in Europe. 
 But environmentalists said economic growth in the United States was slow in those years, and they noted that Europe's binding restrictions took effect only this year. 
 Over all, the United States has maintained its position as by far the dominant source of such gases, although recent projections show China pulling ahead in a decade or two.
 Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish statistician who recently led the Copenhagen Consensus, an economic analysis of global environment and development issues , said that while global warming was a serious problem, Kyoto-style limits would have little impact and would divert resources better spent on alleviating poverty. 
 He said one element missing from most climate discussions was the need for a more vigorous effort to improve climate-friendly energy technologies like solar power and carbon capture, in which greenhouse emissions are trapped and pumped underground before they can escape into the atmosphere.
 While many advocates have proposed an emissions tax, Dr. Lomborg said a much smaller investment in research and development on such technologies would be more likely to help in the long run. 
 In an interview, Paula J. Dobriansky, the under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, said the best chance of increasing energy supplies without climate damage lay in partnerships between industrialized countries and developing ones to spread the best technologies.
 ''There are many types of zero-cost or low-cost ways of reducing emissions,'' she said.

Environmental Rally in London
 LONDON, Nov. 4 (Reuters) -- More than 20,000 demonstrators rallied Saturday in London before environmental talks in Kenya, demanding that world leaders act to curb global warming.
 The event included a march from the American Embassy to protest President Bush's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol emissions limits.

HEADLINE: Nevada's Family Ranches Go the Way of the Old West 

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: GARDNERVILLE, Nev. 

 BODY:
In Nevada, the fastest-growing state in the country, family ranches -- veritable symbols of the Old West -- are disappearing.
 ''We are losing our culture,'' said Devere Dressler, 55, a fifth-generation rancher whose family has sold off all but 150 acres here in the Carson Valley in northern Nevada, home to some of the state's oldest ranches and some of the newest mansions.
Once, the Dresslers owned 20,000 acres, but economic realities clashed with romantic ideals, and family members have sold most of the land, including large chunks for a housing development called, with a bit of paradox, Gardnerville Ranchos.
 Steve White, hanging on to a nearly 100-year-old 150-acre dairy farm in sight of trophy homes sprouting in the surrounding fields, scoffs at the changing valley. They are nice people, Mr. White concludes of the newcomers, many of them retirees, commuters from Carson City and Reno, and casino workers and ski enthusiasts from Lake Tahoe, just over the other side of the Sierra Nevada that loom above the landscape. 
 These ''ranchettes,'' he said as if describing a new weed, ''are all around us now.''
 All over the West, city and suburb have seeped into farmland and desert, answering a demand for housing, jobs and business in settings befitting a Bierstadt painting while also raising qualms about taming the roughness that makes the region so attractive.
 Those same dynamics are playing out here in the Carson Valley, only more so. Aside from losing a way of life, the loss of ranching has raised questions statewide, particularly in the northern reaches where the working ranches predominate, over the pace of development and whether there will be enough water and other resources to sustain it.
 The United States Geological Survey is expected to complete a study this year on Carson Valley water, much of it in aquifers beneath ranchland, and how much can be tapped for growth.
 Nevada's agricultural land, with cattle ranching taking up the largest share, declined to 6.3 million acres in 2005 from just under 10 million 20 years ago. Farm and ranchland in Douglas County, which includes most of Carson Valley, has declined steadily, dropping 7 percent in the last 10 years to 76,666 from 82,122, according to the county assessor's office. With the county's beauty and its accessibility to Reno and Lake Tahoe, the population has soared by 70 percent in the last 15 years, to 47,017.
 Real estate values have skyrocketed, and many ranchers -- formerly land rich but cash poor -- have sold outright or subdivided large parcels. 
 A county ballot initiative in 2002 limited the number of new houses to 280 per year, but county officials and developers challenged it in court. The Supreme Court of Nevada this year ruled in favor of the initiative, which was sponsored by a citizen's group whose members included many former Californians with memories of runaway growth. Both sides are negotiating how to put it in place without further challenges.
 The county in the past few years has also adopted a master plan that sets a goal of limiting growth to no more than 3.5 percent annually and encourages developers to build close to areas already built up.
 ''If you don't grow, your community dies over time,'' said Mimi Moss, the county planner. ''If you have no residential, commercial or industrial development, it becomes stagnant and it is very difficult to come out of that.''
 Private groups like the Nature Conservancy have made efforts to conserve the land by buying development rights and trying to persuade ranchers not to sell, but it can be a hard case to make. Laura Crane, a Nature Conservancy representative in Carson City, said a developer had offered one family in the nearby Dayton Valley nearly $30 million for 530 choice acres. ''These families are not so well off that they can walk away from that money just because they want to see the ranch protected,'' Ms. Crane said.
 Ranchers flocked here in the late 1800s, drawn to the Carson River and the area's easily accessible well water. They found fertile soil, a pleasant climate, striking vistas and a demand for food -- first from gold prospectors heading over the mountains to California and later from boom towns that popped up after the discovery of the Comstock Lode, the largest silver find in history.
 But ranching has never been easy, said David Hussman, neither for his German immigrant ancestors who helped establish the town here nor for him and his wife, Kathi, who run the 134-year-old family ranch with one employee.
 Hay bales weighing 90 pounds apiece must be hauled daily to the 100 or so head of cattle, and their stables have to be cleaned out regularly. Delivering a breech calf is a hands-on experience not for the faint of heart. Mr. Hussman said environmental and government regulations drove him crazy. But, he concluded, ''this is something special here and we ought to try to hang on to it. Once you sell it, it's gone, and you never get it back.''
 That led Mr. Hussman to seek a conservation easement, a mechanism that allows him to earn a percentage of the market value of the land while maintaining ownership. In exchange, development rights are forfeited in perpetuity.
 Dirk Kempthorne, the interior secretary, came here in October to hail the creation of Mr. Hussman's easement, which protects 300 acres. Mr. Kempthorne, at a ceremony at the ranch, called the easement ''a milestone agreement and model of cooperative conservation in Nevada and the nation,'' the first issued under the federal Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, passed in 1998. Through the sale of federal land around Las Vegas, the law has raised $2.9 billion to acquire environmentally sensitive land, although only 5 percent of the money, $131 million, has been spent on such acquisitions in northern Nevada.
 The Dressler family has sold off thousands of acres in the past decade to pay off taxes after the family patriarch died; much of the land that was sold went for development in Gardnerville Ranchos. Now, the family is debating its fate. 
 Devere Dressler wants a conservation easement. His father, however, who holds title to the land, is wary of such an arrangement and has not ruled out selling off the remainder.
 ''I don't make any money, but it is a way of life,'' Mr. Dressler said. ''I worry for the future, specifically, I guess not only for the culture we are losing but the habitat too. Deer, these fields were covered with them and we don't see them.''
 Mr. Dressler said he would ultimately like to hand the ranch over to his son, Garrett, who is only 11 but already drives the feed truck and handles other farm equipment.
 In kindergarten, Garrett drew of picture of himself and wrote in his best writing that he wanted to be a rancher when he grew up. Mr. Dressler said he planned to hold him to it.
 ''I made a plastic poster out of it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Biofuel Plant Raises Hope Where a Rocker Brooded

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: ABERDEEN, Wash. 

 BODY:
Downtown, the theater is long-shuttered and the streets are empty at midday. A few businesses -- a thrift shop, a tattoo parlor, a place to take out payday loans -- fill some space. 
 What seems to give Aberdeen a pulse are the shrines to the best-known product of this coastal town: the poet of despair, Kurt Cobain. As the lead singer and songwriter for Nirvana, Cobain shook up the popular music world in a few years of chaotic creativity and then shot himself to death at his house in Seattle.
Dead for 12 years, Cobain has perhaps never been a greater cultural and economic force. In October, Forbes magazine reported that his estate had generated more money in the previous year than that of any other dead celebrity, about $50 million. He is bigger than Elvis Presley, in that sense. 
 But at the same time, Aberdeen -- which has a population of about 16,000 -- would like to be known for something else. A day after the Forbes report appeared, people gathered at the muddy port at the edge of town for the groundbreaking of what they said would be the nation's largest biodiesel fuel plant. 
 Down for so long as the fortunes of its timber economy have fallen, this area 110 miles south of Seattle hopes to become a beachhead for a new energy future. Creating fuel from farm crops, the plant is expected to turn out 100 million gallons a year -- more than the entire biodiesel output of the United States last year, officials said. 
 ''This is not just the foundation of a physical plant, but the foundation of an entire movement,'' said John Plaza, founder and president of the company behind the plant, Imperium Renewables. 
 By the middle of next year, Mr. Plaza said, the company hopes to begin selling throughout the country. There is a ready market for as much biodiesel as can be created here, he said. 
 But no matter how much of the clean-burning fuel is produced in Aberdeen, the ghost of Cobain is likely to remain front and center. One is a cultural export tied to a dreary past, as connected to Aberdeen as John Lennon is to Liverpool. The other is a promise and a gamble on the future. 
 It has taken time for Aberdeen to come to terms with its best-known son. Cobain was arrested for petty crimes. He told interviewers that he had lived under a bridge for a time and spray-painted ''God is gay'' around town as an act of youthful provocation. He was also haunted by heroin -- not exactly chamber of commerce material. 
 On the Web site of a committee working for a Cobain memorial here, one of the most frequently asked questions is, ''Is it true Aberdeen hated/hates Kurt?''
 Still, people come from all over the world to stare into the inky expanse of the Wishkah River, to walk up the doorsteps of the ramshackle rental house where Cobain lived after high school. They want to feel what he felt.
 ''Barely a day goes by when there isn't someone outside with a camera, taking pictures of this sidewalk,'' said Les Blue, who has worked for 19 years at Rosevear's Music Center, where Cobain is said to have bought his first guitar. 
 The Cobain estate, controlled by his widow, Courtney Love, generated money through sales of Nirvana albums, rights for television and movie deals, and an interest in the band's song catalogue. 
 Aberdeen does not see much of the Cobain income, town officials said. But they did finally acknowledge him, though indirectly. Last year, a big roadside sign went up at the edge of town: ''Welcome to Aberdeen, Come as You Are.'' The second line is a reference to a Nirvana song. 
 As the Puget Sound area northeast of here has grown wealthy on technology, research and philanthropic organizations, the coastal towns to the west have had a more difficult time finding a place in the new-century economy. 
 The area around Aberdeen has long had a defeated look, its hillsides denuded of timber. It was old economy and old energy. Big trees were cut from the wet slopes and the raw material sent overseas. People here did the heavy work.
 Now, raw materials like vegetable products and grain will come here, and go out as refined fuel that emits far less of the kind of gases that contribute to global warming, company officials say. 
 The biodiesel company founder, Mr. Plaza, said the company would produce a fuel that could be used in nearly any kind of engine that takes traditional diesel fuel and would not need government subsidies to be profitable. 
 The plant will employ nearly 300 people during construction and about 65 people full time once it is generating fuel by the middle of 2007, according to Imperium Renewables. 
 ''We are coming out of a depression, and we're on the cusp of doing something really great,'' said Jack Durney, the mayor of neighboring Hoquiam, which is Aberdeen's twin city.
 Mr. Durney said he was still unsure about the Cobain draw.
 ''People come here looking for something that those of us over 50 don't really understand,'' he said. ''And now they say he is bigger than Elvis? How can that be?''
 Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said the fuel plant would put the area on the map as an energy-revolution pioneer. 
 A Nirvana fan, Ms. Cantwell added that the plant and Cobain could co-exist as trademarks of this part of the coast. 
 ''I think this area is big enough to have two heroes,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Price of Climate Change

BYLINE: By Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt

 BODY:
The famous old quip about the weather -- everyone talks about it but nobody does anything about it -- is not as true as it once was. Alarmed by the threat of global warming, lots of people are actively trying to change human behaviors in order to change the weather.
Even economists are getting into the weather business. Olivier Deschenes of the University of California at Santa Barbara and Michael Greenstone of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have written a pair of papers that assess some effects of climate change. In the first, they use long-run climatological models -- year-by-year temperature and precipitation predictions from 2070 to 2099 -- to examine the future of agriculture in the United States. Their findings? The expected rises in temperature and precipitation would actually increase annual agricultural production, and therefore agricultural profits, by about 4 percent, or $1.3 billion. This hardly fulfills the doomsday fears conjured by most conversations about global warming.
 For other economists, meanwhile, the weather itself has proved useful in measuring wholly unrelated human behaviors. From an economist's perspective, the great thing about the weather is that there is nothing humans can do to affect it (at least until recently). 
 Contrast this with social changes that people enact: a new set of laws, for instance. Very often, new laws come about when there is a perception that a big social problem -- think violent crime or corporate fraud -- is growing worse. After a while, and after the laws have been enacted, the problem diminishes. So did the new laws fix the problem, or would it have improved on its own? Politicians will surely claim that it was their laws that fixed the problem, but it's hard to know for sure. 
 The weather, however, is different; the beauty of weather is that it does its own thing, and whether the weather is good or bad, you can be pretty sure that it didn't come about in response to some human desire to fix a problem. Weather is a pure shock to the system, which means that it is a valuable tool to help economists make sense of the world.
 Consider 19th-century Bavaria. The problem there was rain -- too much of it. As Halvor Mehlum, Edward Miguel and Ragnar Torvik explained in a recent paper, excessive rain damaged the rye crop by interfering with the planting and the harvest. Using a historical rainfall database from the United Nations, they found that the price of rye was significantly higher in rainy years, and since rye was a major staple of the Bavarian diet, food prices across the board were considerably higher in those years, too. This was a big problem, since a poor family at the time would have been likely to spend as much as 80 percent of its money on food. The economists went looking for other effects of this weather shock. It turns out that Bavaria kept remarkably comprehensive crime statistics -- the most meticulous in all of Germany -- and when laid out one atop the other, there was a startlingly robust correlation between the amount of rain, the price of rye and the rate of property crime: they rose and fell together in lockstep. Rain raised food prices, and those prices, in turn, led hungry families to steal in order to feed themselves. 
 But violent crime fell during the rainy years, at the same time property crimes were on the rise. Why should that be? Because, the economists contend, rye was also used to make beer. ''Ten percent of Bavarian household income went to beer purchases alone,'' they write. So as a price spike in rye led to a price spike in beer, there was less beer consumed -- which in turn led to fewer assaults and murders. 
 It turns out that rainfall often has a surprisingly strong effect on violence. In a paper on the economic aftermath of the hundreds of riots in American cities during the 1960's, William Collins and Robert Margo used rainfall as a variable to compare the cities where riots took place with cities where riots probably would have taken place had it not rained. Few things can dampen a rioter's spirit more than a soaking rain, they learned. After two days of rioting in Miami in the summer of 1968 were finally quelled by rain, they write, the Dade County sheriff joked to The New York Times that he had ordered his off-duty officers to pray for more rain. 
 The economists Edward Miguel, Shanker Satyanath and Ernest Sergenti have written a paper that uses rainfall to explore the issue of civil war in Africa. Twenty-nine of 43 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, they note, experienced some kind of civil war during the 1980's or 1990's. The causes of any war are of course incredibly complex -- or are they? The economists discovered that one of the most reliable predictors of civil war is lack of rain. Using monthly rainfall data from many different African countries (most of which, significantly, are largely agricultural), they found that a shortage of rain in a given growing season led inevitably to a short-term economic decline and that short-term economic declines led all too easily to civil war. The causal effect of a drought, they argue, was frighteningly strong: ''a 5-percentage-point negative growth shock'' -- a drop in the economy, that is -- ''increases the likelihood of civil war the following year by nearly one-half.'' 
 Since the weather yields such interesting findings about the past, it makes sense that economists are also tempted to use it to anticipate the future. In their second paper on the potential effects of global warming, Deschenes and Greenstone try to predict mortality rates in the U.S. in the last quarter of the current century.
 Unlike in their paper on agriculture, the news in this one isn't good. They estimate, using one of the latest (and most dire) climatological models, that the predicted rise in temperature will increase the death rate for American men by 1.7 percent (about 21,000 extra fatalities per year) and for American women by 0.4 percent (about 8,000 deaths a year). Most of these excess deaths, they write, will be caused by hot weather that worsens cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. These deaths will translate into an economic loss of roughly $31 billion per year. Deschenes and Greenstone caution that their paper is in a preliminary stage and hasn't yet been peer-reviewed and that the increased mortality rate may well be offset by such simple (if costly) measures as migration to the Northern states -- a repopulation that, even a decade ago, might have seemed unimaginable.
 Their paper on agriculture also has some wrinkles. While arguing that global warming would produce a net agricultural gain in the United States, they specify which states would be the big winners and which ones would be the big losers. What's most intriguing is that winners' and losers' lists are a true blend of red states and blue states: New York, along with Georgia and South Dakota, are among the winners; Nebraska and North Carolina would lose out, but the biggest loser of all would be California. Which suggests that in this most toxic of election seasons, when there seems not a single issue that can unite blue and red staters (or at least the politicians thereof), global warming could turn out to be just the thing to bring us all together.

HEADLINE: Election Day

BYLINE: By Michael Kinsley. 
Michael Kinsley is American editor of Guardian Unlimited (guardian.co.uk), the Web site of The Guardian of London. His column appears in The Washington Post and Slate.

 BODY:
Democracy is about more than just counting votes. It is about democratic institutions -- legislatures, courts -- and a culture of respect for them. It is about political egalitarianism: we may not be equal in any other way, but we are all supposed to be equal as citizens. In the American tradition, democracy is also about individual rights, even though protecting these rights can mean thwarting the will of a democratic majority.
A shelf of books this fall raises various alarms about the condition of American democracy. Some of the authors simply don't care for the policies our democracy produces. They advance no theories about why democracy is letting them down so badly. From the left, for example, there is Senator Byron L. Dorgan (Democrat of North Dakota) with ''Take This Job and Ship It: How Corporate Greed and Brain-Dead Politics Are Selling Out America,'' an exercise in assertion rather than persuasion that takes for granted the obvious truth of what it purports to argue, which is boilerplate protectionism. 
 And from the right there is Patrick J. Buchanan at his usual fever pitch, this time about immigration, in ''State of Emergency: The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America.'' (Earlier Buchanan titles, on other issues, have included ''The Death of the West'' and ''The Great Betrayal.'') 
 Buchanan quotes an Oxford historian who noted that in 376 A.D., ''in a complete break with established Roman policy,'' the emperor admitted ''a large band of Gothic refugees.'' In the space of two years, they revolted and killed him. The emperor, Buchanan observes, ''had done ... the Christian thing,'' but not ''the Roman thing.'' So there you are. He recommends the Roman thing.
 Speaking of ''from the left'' and ''from the right,'' and of Pat Buchanan, another category of complaints about American democracy concerns the quality of the discussion, widely regarded asoverly disputatious, on television programs like the CNN show ''Crossfire,'' where Buchanan used to work (me too). Complaints about the corrupting effect of money belong here as well. And negative advertising and opposition research and all the other stuff that makes political campaigns so cheesy. The old joke about academia is that the quarrels there are so vicious because the stakes are so small. In politics the stakes are not small, except in the sense that the arguments exceed by far any differences in what the two established parties actually do when they have the opportunity to govern. Republicans, as Evelyn Waugh is said to have complained about the British Tories, don't seem to turn back the clock by a single minute. But Democrats don't seem to push it forward either.
 Recent elections have seen the rise of self-styled militant moderates, following the flag of white-horse candidates starting with the businessman Ross Perot and continuing, so far, through Gen. Wesley K. Clark. Business and the military are two fertile breeders of excessive self-confidence, but the only essential qualification for a white-horse candidate is a total lack of experience in running for or holding elective office. And the only essential requirement for white-horse voters is to be, like Howard Beale in Paddy Chayefsky's movie ''Network,'' ''mad as hell'' and ''not going to take this anymore.'' It is not essential to know why you are so mad, or what exactly you're not going to take.
 The militant moderates drove ''Crossfire'' off the air after the comedian Jon Stewart appeared on the show and declared it was ''hurting America.'' A Tocqueville-type outsider examining the condition of American democracy at this moment might well raise an eyebrow over the growing power of unelected television comedians to set the political agenda. But this complaint is on no one's list. Just don't get your militant moderate started on TV evangelists, though.
 Of this season's books deploring the quality of our political discourse, the classiest is Ronald Dworkin's ''Is Democracy Possible Here? Principles for a New Political Debate.'' Dworkin, a law professor at New York University and University College London and a distinguished liberal thinker, says with patent insincerity that he does not blame one side more than the other for the trashy state of our politics. But with as much intellectual honesty and energy as he can muster (which is a lot), he starts at Square 1 in search of general principles that everyone in a democracy ought to share and then moves on to specific policies we can argue about. Everyone must ''take personal responsibility for his ethical convictions.'' Dworkin thinks that is, or should be, universally accepted. Special TV channels to cover election-year politics: that, we can argue about. In ''Does American Democracy Still Work?'' another distinguished liberal philosopher, Alan Wolfe, faces manfully up to ''the new politics of democracy'' in which sentimental populism seems to be owned by the right. Although Wolfe clearly regards this as terribly unfair (as do I) and a result of voters' failure to know their own self-interest, he manages to make his argument for more ''quality control'' in American democracy in ideologically neutral terms. 
 Norman J. Ornstein, a token liberal at the American Enterprise Institute, and Thomas E. Mann, of the Brookings Institution, are well known in Washington as astute observers of Congress. And Ornstein is legendary among journalists as the man to call for a quick quote about almost anything. But ''The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track'' reveals their relationship with the national legislatureto be much more profound than mere observation. Frankly, it's love. And they are deeply distressed by Congress's current low esteem. Urging reform at every opportunity, they seem like the loyal spouse of an alcoholic or drug addict, desperately pushing their beloved into rehab. You may not share the authors' heartbreak over the decline of the ''15-minute rule'' -- a not-so-old tradition (it began in the 1970's with electronic voting) that House votes should not last longer than 15 minutes, to prevent endless arm-twisting. But their reminders about some of the phony issues and false panaceas that litter the recent history of Congress -- Remember the House bank scandal? The Contract With America? Term limits? -- do make you despair of American politics. Issues and arguments come and go, depending entirely on whose ox is gored. And since our shared short-term memory seems to be completely shot, the authors' poli-sci-deadpan recounting of the rise and fall of Newt Gingrich is badly needed if we are to have any hope of stopping this bizarre and nefarious figure's current campaign for rehabilitation.
 For a charmingly recherche complaint, check out ''Activism, Inc.: How the Outsourcing of Grassroots Campaigns Is Strangling Progressive Politics in America,'' by Dana R. Fisher. Fisher, who teaches sociology at Columbia, is upset about the professionalization of grass-roots campaigning, which he believes has sliced the bottom rung off the political ladder and keeps inspired young people from entering politics and pointing it in a more salubrious direction. In fact, many aspects of politics that used to be volunteer work -- not just dialing telephones or licking envelopes, but making strategy -- are now businesses. That makes politics more expensive, and it gives almost all political campaigns access to the latest forms of legerdemain. If you want every current beef about American democracy -- or at least every current left-wing beef -- in one handy volume, what you need is Mark Green's latest collection of complaints, ''Losing Our Democracy: How Bush, the Far Right and Big Business Are Betraying Americans for Power and Profit.'' Green, the former Naderite and long-term New York politician, has been producing volumes like this with unflagging enthusiasm since 1970. If he is discouraged by the general rightward drift of politics and his own series of electoral defeats, both extending over much of his adult life, he doesn't let it show.
 We have to be careful about sour grapes. The current result of American democracy (though this may change on Tuesday) is Republican control of the presidency, both houses of Congress and (undeniably by now) the federal courts. And that, in turn, has produced policies that, unless I badly misjudge the demographics, most readers of The New York Times Book Review don't care for: unjustified tax breaks for the rich, a miserable war in Iraq, unbelievable indifference to civil liberties (Secret prison camps? Torture?? America???), among other treats. But this doesn't prove any flaws in democracy itself. Maybe it's what people want.
 The argument starts to go around in circles: How can people want what is so obviously wrong? Democracy must be flawed to produce an electorate so badly mistaken. No one forces me to believe what I believe. I believe it because reason has told me that it is right. Reason is equally available to every citizen. If self-interest cut the other way, that would be one thing. But the self-interest of most citizens coincides with what I believe, or so it seems to me. So in a fair fight, my side should win. If my side doesn't win, that proves the fight is not fair. The other side is cheating.
 Thoughts like this must have gone through the minds of most liberals over the past four decades. After all, apart from cheating, there are only two possibilities: either you are wrong (and need to undergo intensive self-flagellation followed by extensive reinvention), or the voters are wrong (and even to think this is a severe violation of democratic etiquette). It is unattractive to say or think the voters are wrong. But if reason has led you to a certain set of political beliefs, the fact that others disagree perhaps should give you pause, but it should not automatically change your mind, no matter how many others there are. 
 The notion of cheating by the other side is a way out of this dilemma. The voters are not at fault and neither are you. But what is cheating? In my view, the worst form of cheating in American democracy today is intellectual dishonesty. The conversation in our democracy is dominated by disingenuousness. Candidates and partisan commentators strike poses of outrage that they don't really feel, take positions that they would not take if the shoe was on the other foot (e.g., criticizing Bush when you gave Clinton a pass, or vice versa), feel no obligation toward logical consistency. Our democracy occasionally punishes outright lies but not brazen insincerity. When we vote after a modern political campaign run by expensive professionals, we have almost no idea what the victor really believes or what he or she might do in office. It seems to me there is more than enough of this to explain all distressing election results without condemning either yourself or democracy. 
 But it is a complicated case to make. And there is a simpler case available: Not content to steal elections with dishonest arguments, the other side is literally tampering with the democratic machinery to steal votes. Democracy is about counting votes after all. We used to give little thought to the mechanics of voting, confident in even our lowest moments that we at least had that bit right. Stolen elections were the stuff of ancient lore about Chicago (''vote early and often''). Then came Florida 2000.
 It is considered tiresome to complain that the White House was stolen in 2000. In fact, the ultimate triumph of the George W. Bush forces in the 2000 dispute has been to stamp any discussion of that episode as bad sportsmanship and therefore, in a way, undemocratic itself. You lost fair and square: ''Get over it,'' as Justice Scalia advised.
 Call me bitter: I am not over it and don't want to be over it. I still find it shocking that democracy was so openly subverted, and even more shocking that so few others seem to share my shock. ''Stolen''? That depends, as the man said, on what you mean by that word. Here is what I mean. First, a clear majority of those who voted in Florida intended to vote for Gore and walked out of the voting booth (or away from the mailbox) sincerely believing that they had done so. Vindicating the assumptions of those who did vote about whom they voted for (a standard first suggested, as far as I know, by Jacob Weisberg of Slate) seems about the least you can demand of a voting system, and Florida failed this test.
 Second, at every stage, Republican government officials thwarted all attempts to let democracy work in the minimal sense of the previous paragraph. Repeatedly, they interpreted the ''discretion'' that any public official must have as a license to produce the result they wanted, rather than as creating any obligation to do what is right. The Florida recount debate was a festival of intellectual dishonesty. On a whole series of technical issues (those butterfly ballots mispunched by the confused old ladies of Palm Beach, or military absentee ballots mailed after the deadline) there were plausible arguments on both sides. And these arguments had no obvious ideological cast. There is no natural conservative or liberal position on the dilemma of the dangling chad. So it is remarkable -- amusing, depressing, not surprising I guess -- how quickly and passionately Democrats and Republicans staked out their respective cui bono positions. But Republicans controlled the state and federal governments, so they got their way.
 The Supreme Court's ruling in Bush v. Gore was surprising. Shocking, in fact. Probably the most fatuous -- i.e., knowingly stupid -- Supreme Court decision in history. The justices of Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), who upheld racial segregation, could at least plead historical blinders. The majority justices of Bush v. Gore have no such excuse. Both as a raw assertion of judicial power and as a more specific interpretation of the 14th Amendment, it was not merely wrong, but spectacularly wrong in precisely the ways that conservative justices like Scalia, Rehnquist and Thomas had been objecting to for years. The justices invented a nonsensical equal-protection ''right'' -- essentially, the right to an equal risk of having your vote miscounted -- and held that any attempt to correct mistakes through a recount was unfair to those who didn't get recounted. And then they declared this alleged right to be a one-time-only offer, like a grocery-store coupon. As Adam Cohen pointed out recently on the New York Times editorial page, the coupon has indeed expired. Bush v. Gore is rarely cited or applied in other situations.
 It might be no bad thing if the Constitution's guarantee of ''equal protection of the laws'' was interpreted to outlaw the vagaries of voting, and not just Democratic victories. What we have learned, or been reminded, since 2000 is how inexact the art of vote counting is, and how far we are from what we presumed was the first axiom of democracy: majority rule.
 Let us count the ways. First, at least regarding the presidency, our Constitution doesn't provide for majority rule. It dictates an arcane process involving the Electoral College and gives disproportionate weight to low-population states. We accept this with surprising equanimity. No one doubts that Al Gore got the most votes in 2000, but almost no one feels that this alone means that the presidency was stolen from him. One who does apparently feel that way is Sanford Levinson, a professor at the University of Texas Law School, who has written ''Our Undemocratic Constitution: Where the Constitution Goes Wrong (and How We the People Can Correct It),'' calling for wholesale revision of our nation's founding document. This is admirably gutsy and unfashionable. Others may feel, though, that the Constitution is a Pandora's box better left unopened for fear of what else may get mucked around with. Even Al Gore may think that the Electoral College is a small price to pay for the First Amendment.
 Second, there is no way to count more than 100 million votes and get the same count every time. If the vote is close -- and that is the only situation where a single vote matters -- it is essentially a coin flip. This truth, driven home by the 2000 election, has reconciled me to the Electoral College, which I used to find an infuriating anachronism. Essentially it is a coin flip with a bit of protective historical coloration. And we need a coin flip of some sort.
 Third, for no reason but incompetence, our vote-counting mechanisms turn out to be remarkably screwed up. Voting machines aren't reliable and don't generate a paper record. Or, worse, there are not enough voting machines, leading to impossible lines and voters giving up. Incomprehensible ballots. Stupid laws that needlessly require registration long in advance or excessive documentation when you show up to vote. You name it.
 Fourth -- and here it starts to get darker -- there is the purposeful use of tools like registration laws and the distribution of assets like voting machines to discourage certain voters and potentially change the result. These abuses are the subject of ''Stealing Democracy: The New Politics of Voter Suppression,'' by Spencer Overton, a professor at George Washington University Law School. Fifth -- and darkest -- is outright voting fraud, by ''fixing'' (that is, by breaking) the voting machines, as well as more traditional methods a la Chicago in the old days.
 Like generals, reformers and conspiratorialists are always fighting the last war. The idea that a presidential election can be stolen was the stuff of airport fiction until someone did it. Now and here on out, every election will come with a theory of how the winner stole it (just as, since Vietnam, every war now comes with a medical ''syndrome'' for soldiers to sue over). Although resentment over the actually stolen election of 2000 is remarkably muted, there is a noisy contingent of citizens, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who are convinced that the Republicans stole the election of 2004. ''Was the 2004 Presidential Election Stolen?'' by Steven F. Freeman and Joel Bleifuss, answers its own question with a resounding ''yes.'' The evidence concerns the state of Ohio, which would have changed the result if it had gone for John Kerry instead of Bush. The argument is that Ohio did go for Kerry, based on exit polls, then mysteriously went for Bush in the final result. ''Exit polls are a vital tool to ensure election integrity,'' the authors say. But that has never been their purpose, and the authors offer no particular reason to believe the random exit polls and disbelieve the actual vote.
 The authors deny that their case rests on exit polls alone. ''Far from relying only on the exit-poll data, we read widely and had countless soul-searching conversations with each other and with our colleagues,'' they write. Actually, the whole stolen-election-2004 indictment has that echo-chamber sound of people having soul-searching conversations with each other. Richard Hofstadter's ''paranoid style,'' exhibited mainly on the right when he coined the term in the 1960's, seems to have been adopted by the left, as Nicholas Lemann recently pointed out in The New Yorker. It is remarkable that the chairman and chief executive of Diebold, the company that makes the voting machines used in Ohio, sent out a fund-raising letter for Bush in 2003 in which he said he was ''committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president.'' This doesn't prove anything except that the C.E.O. is an idiot. He's an idiot if his company is not fixing the voting machines, and an even bigger idiot if it is. I hate to be reasonable at this historic moment, but the principle of Occam's razor favors the lesser idiot theory.And so the quotation and the fund-raiser don't really feed the case for conspiracy. Most of the other evidence offered by conspiratorialists is not about Category 5 -- outright theft -- but Category 4: strategic, purposeful, deplorable, but not illegal voter discouragement. 
 We might ask ourselves at this point: What is so magical about a majority anyway? As a standard for producing a result that is as pleasing as possible to as many people as possible, 50 percent is just one possible stopping point on the way from zero to unanimity. Anyway, in presidential elections we don't have majority rule. We have plurality rule. In the past four elections, only George W. Bush in 2004 got more than 50 percent of the vote. In losing, John Kerry received a higher fraction of the vote than Bush got in 2000. In raw numbers, more people voted for Kerry in 2004 than had ever voted for any candidate in American history except, of course, for George W. Bush in the same election.
 A famous mathematical proof called Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, for which the Stanford economist Kenneth Arrow won the Nobel Prize in 1972, demonstrated that whenever there are more than two choices (as there always are in presidential elections, if you include the primaries), no voting system can accurately translate individual preferences into a consensus winner even in theory. And that is true in spades of our election system in practice, which is only a snapshot of voter preferences at a particular moment. In the 2000 recount controversy, there was general agreement that you can't let people vote again, because you can't recreate the conditions of Election Day -- e.g., was it raining? But what does rain have to do with democracy?
 George W. Bush's re-election in 2004 was considered to be a solid triumph, if not a landslide. It gave about 62 million voters what they wanted -- or what they thought, at that moment, that they wanted -- and frustrated the desires of about 59 million. If Kerry somehow could have stolen this election, 59 million voters would be satisfied and 62 million would be frustrated: a swing of over 1 percent among 122 million voters -- and even less than that if you include the millions who, for whatever reason, don't vote.
 In even the most tepid political campaign, a presidential candidate's numbers often swing by more than the ultimate margin of victory. And after he takes office, a president's poll numbers swing more day-to-day as a result of policy decisions (or for more trivial reasons) than the margins that got him elected. When you put all this together, the chain of assumptions between voting and any notion of maximizing the satisfaction of the maximum number of people seems pretty strained. And for this reason, among others, refining and perfecting the mechanics of voting seems like an inefficient way to improve democracy.
 According to the Federal Election Commission, in 2000, Al Gore got 543,895 more votes than George Bush, out of a total of more than 105 million. He deserved to be president. But the size of the injustice is minuscule (even if the practical difference in recent history is enormous). The great flaw in American democracy is not electoral irregularities, purposeful or accidental. It's not money (which, even under current law, cannot in the end actually buy votes). It's not even the inexplicable failure of all other Americans to vote my way or of politicians to enact my own agenda. It's not the broken promises and the outright lying, although we're getting close. The biggest flaw in our democracy is, as I say, the enormous tolerance for intellectual dishonesty. Politicians are held to account for outright lies, but there seems to be no sanction against saying things you obviously don't believe. There is no reward for logical consistency, and no punishment for changing your story depending on the circumstances. Yet one minor exercise in disingenuousness can easily have a greater impact on an election than any number of crooked voting machines. And it seems to me, though I can't prove it, that this problem is getting worse and worse.
 A few days before the 2000 election, the Bush team started assembling people to deal with a possible problem: what if Bush won the popular vote but Gore carried the Electoral College. They decided on, and were prepared to begin, a big campaign to convince the citizenry that it would be wrong for Gore to take office under those circumstances. And they intended to create a tidal wave of pressure on Gore's electors to vote for Bush, which arguably the electors as free agents have the authority to do. In the event, of course, the result was precisely the opposite, and immediately the Bushies launched into precisely the opposite argument: the Electoral College is a vital part of our Constitution, electors are not free agents, threatening the Electoral College result would be thumbing your nose at the founding fathers, and so on. Gore, by the way, never did challenge the Electoral College, although some advisers urged him to do so.
 Of all the things Bush did and said during the 2000 election crisis, this having-it-both-ways is the most corrupt. It was reported before the election and is uncontested, but no one seems to care, because so much of our politics is like that. And no electoral reform can fix this problem. Intellectual dishonesty can't be banned or regulated or ''capped'' like money. The only way it can be brought under control is if people start voting against it. If they did, the problem would go away. That's democracy.

HEADLINE: Oil, Cash and Corruption

BYLINE: By RON STODGHILL

 BODY:
ON a warm afternoon in late September, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev strode across the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base to board his private 767. Surrounded by an entourage of security guards and political advisers, Mr. Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, was heading home after an eventful visit that included a meeting with President Bush in the White House and a boating jaunt in Maine with the president's father, George H. W. Bush. He also attended a swank fete at the Capital Hilton Hotel where his hosts, the business mogul Ted Turner and former Senator Sam Nunn, praised him for closing a major nuclear test site. 
 Warm welcomes aside, human rights groups frequently characterize Mr. Nazarbayev as a dictator who, during 15 years of rule, established a hammerlock on his country's oil riches and amassed a fortune at the expense of an impoverished citizenry. Supporters say he has wedded a draconian political order to clear-eyed economic policies, making his country hospitable to foreign investment. But his White House visit came at a tender moment. About a month earlier, the Bush administration introduced its National Strategy to Internationalize Efforts Against Kleptocracy, an initiative aimed at preventing public graft worldwide by, among other things, denying corrupt leaders access to the United States financial system. 
''Kleptocracy is an obstacle to democratic progress, undermines faith in government institutions and steals prosperity from the people,'' President Bush said. ''Promoting transparent, accountable governance is a critical component of our freedom agenda.'' 
 Mr. Nazarbayev's visit, coming on the heels of those sentiments, sparked renewed criticism of his leadership and questions about the White House's dedication to battling corruption overseas -- possibly explaining why the administration decided against holding a state dinner in the Kazakh leader's honor. But behind the scenes, a legal drama has been playing out that analysts say may more fully explain why Mr. Nazarbayev and the White House are engaged in such an elaborate form of political kabuki. 
 In February, the United States attorney's office in Manhattan is scheduled to go to trial in the largest foreign bribery case brought against an American citizen. It involves a labyrinthine trail of international financial transfers, suspected money laundering and a dizzying array of domestic and overseas shell corporations. The criminal case names Mr. Nazarbayev as an unindicted co-conspirator. The defendant, James H. Giffen, a wealthy American merchant banker and a consultant to the Kazakh government, is accused of channeling more than $78 million in bribes to Mr. Nazarbayev and the head of the country's oil ministry. The money, doled out by American companies seeking access to Kazakhstan's vast oil reserves, went toward the Kazakh leadership's personal use, including the purchase of expensive jewelry, speedboats, snowmobiles and fur coats, federal prosecutors say.
 Beyond the large amounts of cash involved and the top-flight access such sums often secure, the case against Mr. Giffen has opened a window onto the high-stakes, transcontinental maneuvering that occurs when Big Oil and political access overlap -- a juncture marked by intense and expensive lobbying, overseas deal-making and the intersection of money, business and geopolitics. It is a shadow world of nebulous boundaries that people like Mr. Giffen establish and define, often on the fly. The case also illustrates the government's struggle to reconcile its short-term energy interests with its longer-term political goal of encouraging democracy in countries the international community has deemed corrupt. 
 To be sure, many an American president has entertained a foreign leader under a cloud of suspicion, but Mr. Nazarbayev's role in a federal criminal investigation makes him an unusual entry into that company. Bush administration officials have acknowledged that the Kazakh government falls short in its democracy-building efforts. But some foreign policy specialists see Kazakhstan as an important ally in the administration's campaign against terrorism and a bountiful alternative to oil reserves in the volatile Persian Gulf -- all of which promise to make the opening of the Giffen trial more than just hit-and-run bribery fare. 
 ''The administration is naturally reticent about Giffen's case,'' said Raymond W. Baker, an energy policy analyst on loan to the Brookings Institution, a liberal research group. ''It would probably be a lot easier on everyone if he had gotten away with it.''
 IN a world long accustomed to outsize public corruption, some analysts say Mr. Nazarbayev is in a class by himself. ''I can't think of a leader in the free world as notoriously corrupt as Nazarbayev,'' said Jonathan Winer, a former deputy assistant secretary of state during the Clinton administration. ''We've known about his corruption for at least 15 years because our own intelligence agencies have told us.'' 
 Mr. Nazarbayev is certainly a mixed bag of goods, others said, but that is the way the world works. As Jerry Taylor, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group, put it, ''Kazakhstan's human rights record may be checkered, but if the United States were to disengage from those countries with checkered human rights and other bad actors, we'd be history.'' 
 The Clinton administration itself embraced Kazakhstan in the 1990s and praised Mr. Nazarbayev for leading his country toward economic and democratic reform. Administration officials, including the former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, also met with Mr. Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan. 
 ''The Clinton administration certainly had enough information about Nazarbayev's corruption,'' Mr. Winer said. ''The information on him was open, notorious and present.'' 
 The work of defending the curious financial and diplomatic portfolio of Mr. Giffen is the job of William J. Schwartz and Steven M. Cohen, of Cooley Godward Kronish in Manhattan. The firm's 48th-floor conference room offers some of the standard accoutrements of the white-collar defense bar -- handsome wood paneling, a flat-screen television, a skyline view facing south toward Wall Street and a long oval table surrounded by leather chairs and punctuated at its center by a bouquet of sharpened white pencils.
 In the spring of 2003, federal agents arrested Mr. Giffen as he and Mr. Schwartz prepared to board a flight from New York to Paris. Prosecutors accused him of overseeing a tangled bribery network in the 1990s designed to buy access and influence in Kazakhstan for oil giants like Exxon Mobil, BP Amoco (now BP) and Phillips Petroleum (now ConocoPhillips). The payments, prosecutors said, violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids American citizens or corporations from paying bribes to foreign officials to obtain business. None of the oil companies have been accused of any wrongdoing.
 While Mr. Giffen's lawyers have conceded that their client shuffled money from one secret bank account to another, they have maintained that he did not act alone. ''Mr. Giffen was working with the knowledge of our government,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''Jim's access in Kazakhstan was a function of a bizarre historical time.''
 At the heart of Mr. Giffen's defense is a motion filed by his lawyers in June 2004 to Judge William H. Pauley III of Federal District Court in Manhattan, seeking access to classified government documents for his defense. 
 For now, each of the names, titles, and government affiliations of individuals mentioned in the document are blacked out on virtually every page. Mr. Giffen's lawyers have argued that much of the evidence necessary to prove his innocence rests with various officials and agencies that helped him conduct business in Kazakhstan. Without such witnesses, the lawyers say, it will be difficult for them to prove their client was performing his duties as an American. Court filings by Mr. Giffen's lawyers suggest that senior officials at the Central Intelligence Agency, State Department and White House encouraged him to use his close ties with Kazakh leaders to ferry valuable intelligence back to the United States. Judge Pauley has written an opinion supporting the motion, but the United States attorney's office has appealed it.
 ''Before this is over, Giffen's lawyers will file a variety of motions to get at the classified stuff, but the history of that isn't terribly terrific,'' said Jack Blum, a former investigator for the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee. ''Senior officials can very conveniently avoid governmental embarrassment by keeping everything classified.'' Mr. Blum added, ''When you have a kind of blink-and-nod, clandestine waiver of the law with the government, once the problem blows up, you're going to get hung out to dry.''
 Spokeswomen from the C.I.A. and the White House declined to comment.
 Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977 after concluding that bribery abroad had become an important foreign policy issue that ''embarrasses friendly governments, causes a decline in foreign esteem for the United States and casts suspicion on the activities of our enterprises, giving credence to our foreign opponents.''
 Mr. Giffen's lawyers say he cannot be found guilty of bribing a foreign government because his activities were part of his official duties as an adviser to the Kazakh government and they received the blessing of senior American officials who regularly debriefed him on his activities. 
 That contention has prompted a blizzard of motions, memorandums and filings between the federal government and Mr. Giffen's lawyers. Federal prosecutors have sought to block Mr. Giffen's access to documents on the grounds that disclosing them could breach national security interests.
 It was not only individuals in Kazakhstan who received some of their client's bounteous fees, former associates of Mr. Giffen said. In 1998, two years before federal investigators began looking into Mr. Giffen's activities in Kazakhstan, he invited Mark Siegel, a Washington political consultant, to join a group of policy experts to develop a blueprint for reforming Kazakhstan's economy and government. It was an ambitious task, Mr. Giffen conceded, but its participants would be well compensated. Mr. Siegel, a former executive director of the Democratic National Committee, agreed to a monthly retainer of $30,000 for his firm and soon found himself on a flight to Almaty, Kazakhstan's former capital. 
 As it turned out, Mr. Siegel was in high-powered company. Mr. Giffen had harnessed prominent businessmen, policy experts, lobbyists and former government officials to serve on the committee. Among those included in the group were Robert Blackwill, a former ambassador during the first Bush presidency, and Philip D. Zelikow, now a counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Siegel recalled in an interview. Neither Mr. Blackwill nor Mr. Zelikow responded to interview requests.
 ''We were a kind of a Great White Hope,'' Mr. Siegel said. The committee was divided into a ''P Group'' and an ''E Group'' to distinguish political and economic experts in the group. Mr. Nazarbayev ''came across as a reformer open to free markets and fair elections.''
 According to his lawyers, Mr. Giffen, at Mr. Nazarbayev's direction, paid several million dollars in fees from Swiss accounts -- many of the same accounts named in Mr. Giffen's indictment -- to committee members for their expertise on a range of policy issues involving Kazakhstan.
 The group's recommendations can be found in two spiral-bound documents that came to be known simply as the Red Books. Mr. Giffen's lawyers, as well as Mr. Siegel, said the creation of the committee reflected Mr. Giffen's interest in helping Mr. Nazarbayev move his country away from an authoritarian government to a more democratic model. While the Red Books lists an impressive array of financiers and policy makers in its membership ranks, some of those named in the document said they never worked with Mr. Giffen. One of those people, John C. Whitehead, the former chairman of the investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, acknowledged being an acquaintance of Mr. Giffen but said he was never part of the group. ''I've never been to Kazakhstan,'' Mr. Whitehead said, ''and I've certainly not had that kind of formal relationship with Jim Giffen.''
 Mr. Giffen's lawyers declined to discuss any other aspects of his work with the committee, but said that the committee's existence proved that the scope of his influence with policy makers far transcended energy matters. 
 SUPPORTED or not by the federal government, Mr. Giffen reportedly managed to orchestrate what the government describes in its indictment as an elaborate money laundering and tax fraud scheme carried out in six separate oil transactions from 1995 to 1999, all of which involved defrauding the government of Kazakhstan. Mr. Giffen is accused of hiding some of the proceeds in each of the deals through a series of wire transfers that ultimately landed in Swiss bank accounts. One deal Mr. Giffen's indictment details involved Mobil Oil's 1996 purchase of a 25 percent interest in Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field. Located in the mineral-rich Caspian region, Tengiz is the sixth-largest oil field in the world, producing 285,000 barrels a day, or about a third of the country's daily production. 
 The indictment states that after Mobil paid Mr. Giffen a $51 million fee for negotiating the deal, he transferred half of the money to a Swiss account and then sent the money on a circuitous path through a number of other accounts, including one registered to a British Virgin Islands company. Exxon and Mobil merged in late 1999 to form Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company. Russ Roberts, an Exxon spokesman, said Mobil was not the source of any payments to Mr. Giffen.
 ''Exxon Mobil has no knowledge of any illegal payments made to Kazakh officials by any current or former Mobil employees,'' Mr. Roberts wrote in an e-mail response to an interview request. ''We also have no knowledge of any illegal payments received by any current or former Mobil employees.'' Mr. Roberts said neither Mr. Giffen nor his company, Mercator, had represented Mobil or Exxon Mobil. 
 In 2003, a former Mobil manager pleaded guilty to evading taxes on $7 million he received from Mr. Giffen starting in 1993. Mr. Roberts noted that Mr. Giffen's payments to the manager had begun several years before any Mobil acquisition in Kazakhstan and that Mobil had not been the source of the payments. Although prosecutors described the payments to the manager as ''kickbacks'' for work done on Mobil's behalf, the manager, Mr. Roberts said, repudiated that accusation. Mr. Roberts declined to further discuss the matter.
 But according to the indictment, Mr. Giffen wired another chunk of what court papers describe as a Mobil fee, about $20 million, into another pair of Swiss accounts. Nurlan Balgimbaev, the former prime minister and oil minister of Kazakhstan, controlled one of the accounts, according to the indictment. A Liechtenstein trust, of which Mr. Nazarbayev and his family were beneficiaries, controlled the other account, the indictment asserts. 
 In the process, the government asserts, Mr. Giffen paid $36,000 of Mr. Balgimbaev's personal bills for the upkeep of a house in Newtown, Mass., spent $30,000 to buy fur coats for Mr. Nazarbayev's wife and daughter and bought a Donzi speedboat as a gift from Mr. Nazarbayev to Mr. Balgimbaev.
 ConocoPhillips and BP, two of the other oil companies which the indictment says paid Mr. Giffen, declined to comment. A lawyer and former federal prosecutor who represents the Republic of Kazakhstan, Reid H. Weingarten, declined to discuss the case. But few involved on either side of Mr. Giffen's case have denied that his ties to Mr. Nazarbayev were substantial, longstanding and gilded.
 ''Everyone agrees on one thing, which is that Nazarbayev took bribes,'' said Rinat Akhmetshin, director of the International Eurasian Institute, a Washington research group that supports Mr. Nazarbayev's political opponents. Mr. Akhmetshin said the case was being closely followed in Kazakhstan and that Mr. Nazarbayev's political future could turn on the trial's outcome. ''The moment Giffen goes to jail, Nazarbayev is finished as a politician,'' he said.
 JAMES GIFFEN'S financial ascent -- from a young banker on the make into a well-heeled political insider with a bodyguard, a chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz and a Kazakh diplomatic passport -- was a serendipitous blend of lucrative financial opportunities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and old-fashioned elbow grease. 
 The son of a clothier in Stockton, Calif., Mr. Giffen, who is now 65, had ties to the Soviet Union dating back to the early 1970s. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley and the School of Law at U.C.L.A., he started his career at a minerals trading firm before joining a subsidiary of the Armco Steel Corporation (later acquired by AK Steel). Armco was led by C. William Verity Jr., a champion of increased trade with the Soviet Union who would later serve as commerce secretary in the Reagan administration. Mr. Giffen became a vice president at the Armco subsidiary, which sold drilling equipment to the Soviet Union. 
 Although Mr. Giffen did not speak Russian, and the Soviets showed little interest at the time in trading with the West, he persistently courted Russia's leaders. Nattily dressed and with a cigarette constantly in hand, Mr. Giffen exuded an affecting bluster and self-assurance -- many who know him call it bravado -- that eventually gained him the ears of high-ranking Soviet leaders. By the mid-1980s, Mr. Giffen had left Armco and founded his own company, Mercator, a boutique merchant bank headquartered in New York. He began the company with a five-year contract from Armco and a board of directors that included Mr. Verity and two former government officials. 
 Over the next decade, his lawyers have said, Mr. Giffen came to count Mikhail Gorbachev in his network of powerful friends within the Soviet government, the Communist Party and the K.G.B. In the late 1980s, Mr. Giffen convinced Chevron, Eastman Kodak, Ford Motor and RJR Nabisco to form a coalition aimed at penetrating the Soviet market through joint ventures -- deals that Mercator would handle. 
 Although that initiative collapsed with the Soviet Union in 1991, Mr. Giffen had apparently become a conduit for information involving United States-Soviet affairs. On one occasion, the White House asked him to describe a meeting he had had with Mr. Gorbachev and to suggest trade issues that the first President Bush should raise with Mr. Gorbachev, according to filings in the federal court case. A memo, which an American official apparently prepared for the first President Bush, recounts Mr. Giffen as stating the president had ''hit paydirt'' with Mr. Gorbachev and that ''whatever President Bush wants to do, Gorbachev will try to do.''
 When 15 independent states emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Nazarbayev contacted Mr. Giffen, his lawyers say. Mr. Nazarbayev, head of Kazakhstan's Communist Party, and Mr. Giffen, who was president of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council, had become close friends by that time, said Mr. Schwartz, the lawyer. 
 DURING Chevron's discussions to acquire an interest in the Tengiz oil field, the company became one of Mr. Giffen's clients. The company says the relationship was short-lived. ''In the early 1990s, Chevron obtained the services of Mr. Giffen with respect to business opportunities with Russia and the individual republics,'' the company said in an e-mail response to an interview request. ''Chevron terminated that relationship in 1992.'' 
 Mr. Nazarbayev asked Mr. Giffen to play an advisory role within the newly sovereign nation of Kazakhstan, according to Mr. Giffen's lawyers. 
 As the country's first president, Mr. Nazarbayev was determined to attract the involvement of multinational oil companies in developing his country's bountiful oil fields, according to political and economic analysts. To that end, Mr. Nazarbayev hired Mr. Giffen to serve dual roles. As a special adviser to Kazakhstan, Mr. Giffen oversaw the country's efforts to attract investment from the United States, while his company, Mercator, advised the Kazakh government on oil and gas transactions. 
 ''Giffen was able to cast himself as a bigger-than-life figure who really knew how to work the West,'' said Martha Brill Olcott, a specialist on Central Asian and Caspian affairs with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''Nazarbayev liked that and they created a relationship of great personal trust.''
 Mr. Giffen's and Mr. Nazarbayev's close relationship sparked resentment among some senior Kazakh officials. ''The biggest problem with Giffen was that he was trying to create an instrument of government that would keep himself and the president in power,'' said the former prime minister of Kazakhstan, Akezhan Kazhegeldin. ''He never dreamed he'd be so close to power.'' 
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Kazhegeldin declined to discuss Mr. Giffen's indictment but said that he and Mr. Giffen had clashed on several occasions. Within Kazakhstan's senior ranks, Mr. Kazhegeldin had gained a reputation as a champion of free enterprise economics and someone favored among Western leaders, Ms. Olcott said. Mr. Kazhegeldin himself asserted that his penchant for economic reform and his calls to reform his country's autocratic government ultimately alienated both Mr. Giffen and Mr. Nazarbayev.
 Now living in Italy and London, Mr. Kazhegeldin said he had spent millions of dollars on lobbyists and public affairs specialists in the hope of defeating Mr. Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan's next election, scheduled for 2011. ''There is a small group of people getting rich -- and I mean really rich -- in Kazakhstan while the rest of society remains really poor,'' Mr. Kazhegeldin said. ''The leadership is not interested in pushing a market economy. They keep two sets of books, one for themselves and another for everyone else.''
 Mr. Kazhegeldin, however, is a veteran of the pell-mell economic scramble of the post-Soviet years. He amassed his wealth as a rogue salesman in the waning years before the Soviet Union's dissolution, selling scrap metal on the black market while studying international business at Moscow's K.G.B. Academy, according to a resume furnished by a close associate who asked not to be identified because of the nature of the work he does for Mr. Kazhegeldin. After the spy school kicked him out in 1989 for his moonlighting activities, Mr. Kazhegeldin went on to make his millions exporting chemical fertilizer, the associate said.
 Mr. Nazarbayev began his own investigation of Mr. Kazhegeldin's finances in the fall of 1998 -- to score political points, Mr. Kazhegeldin's supporters said -- which snowballed into an international scandal when it led the United States government to examine Mr. Giffen's activities more closely. 
 In fall 1999, the Kazakh government accused Mr. Kazhegeldin of embezzling several million dollars into an offshore account that he controlled. Mr. Kazhegeldin denied any wrongdoing and said neither he nor any family members had access to the account.
 Mr. Kazhegeldin accused Mr. Nazarbayev of arranging the deposit and leaking information about it to the news media to secure victory in a 1999 presidential election. A 1999 State Department examination of the Kazakh investigation into the accounts reportedly linked to Mr. Kazhegeldin concluded that the investigation, ''while possibly grounded in facts, appeared motivated politically.''
 After Kazakh officials contacted Belgian and Swiss authorities to examine Mr. Kazhegeldin's possible role in the looting of government funds, the Swiss contacted the Justice Department to discuss what appeared to be a pattern of questionable transactions between Kazakhstan and American and European oil companies.
 As federal investigators reviewed the transactions in 2000, they noticed that Mr. Giffen was party to many of them, according to his lawyers. Over the next two years, investigators focused more closely on Mr. Giffen and subpoenaed records from Mercator. A treaty between the United States and Switzerland permitted investigators to obtain detailed records of Mr. Giffen's financial activities in New York and Switzerland, according to his lawyers. In February 2003, the United States attorney's office in Manhattan won a grand jury indictment against Mr. Giffen on fraud charge. A month later, as Mr. Giffen boarded a flight from New York to Paris with his lawyers, federal authorities arrested him.
 As the Giffen trial moves forward, with the possibility that more information about Mr. Giffen's interactions with the Kazakh government, Washington policy makers and multinational corporations may emerge, it promises to shine a spotlight on the terms of engagement when the United States courts resource-rich countries riddled with corruption.
 ''Corruption is at the heart of what causes poverty in third world countries,'' said Mr. Blum, the former Congressional investigator. ''We tell ourselves that in the short term, we can buy these guys who will serve the national interest, but in the long run it always turns into a disaster.'' 
 The World Bank, the Washington economic development organization that focuses its efforts on needy countries, has brought much of the current debate about overseas financial corruption to the fore. In the early 1990s, the bank started measuring corruption within the governments of its member countries. The initiative was controversial because until then, economists had largely considered corruption to be an ethical or cultural issue. The bank began interviewing hundreds of private citizens, as well as employees in government and business, trying to pin down the pattern and prevalence of corruption in areas like banking, real estate, health care, media and education.
 ''What we realized was that corruption is not just a moral or ethical issue but an economic development issue,'' said Daniel Kaufmann, an economist who began the World Bank's corruption studies. ''We estimated that with good governance, there is a threefold increase in per capita income as funds that should be allocated toward the gross domestic product are not siphoned off.'' 
 BY 1995, Mr. Kaufmann's team developed a rating system that measured factors like corruption control, absence of violence, government accountability and regulatory quality in various countries. The ideas became a cornerstone of the bank's agenda. Since the mid-1990s, it has started more than 600 anticorruption programs in nearly 100 countries. Under Paul D. Wolfowitz, who became head of the World Bank last year, it has continued its anticorruption efforts. In what Mr. Wolfowitz described as efforts to stem corruption, he recently threatened to cut loans and development contracts in India and Kenya. Mr. Wolfowitz, a former deputy defense secretary in the Bush administration and an architect of its policies in the Middle East, has received the White House's backing in prioritizing anticorruption campaigns. But some research groups, and some of the bank's own administrators, have criticized Mr. Wolfowitz for using the World Bank to advance the White House's foreign policy goals in countries like Iraq, where the bank recently increased its lending support.
 A World Bank spokesman denied that Mr. Wolfowitz was serving the White House's interests. ''He doesn't hesitate to serve as an independent voice for the poorest people -- including when it goes against the grain on issues like trade, debt relief and support for official development assistance,'' the spokesman wrote in an e-mail message.
 Kazakhstan, and Mr. Nazarbayev's stewardship of the country, have been fodder for World Bank scrutiny. According to the bank's 2005 Worldwide Governance Indicators, Kazakhstan ranks with Angola, Bolivia, Kenya, Libya and Pakistan among the world's corruption hotspots.
 Other anticorruption watchdogs, like Transparency International, also rate Kazakhstan poorly for its governance practices. The State Department's 2005 Kazakhstan Country Report on Human Rights Practices noted that the Kazakhstan government's ''human rights record remained poor'' and that ''corruption remained a serious problem.''
 Despite such low scores and scathing critiques, the World Bank has lent Kazakhstan more than $2 billion for 28 projects since 1992. In fiscal 2006, commitments to Kazakhstan totaled $130 million, with overall commitments for active projects at $648 million. 
 Juan Jose Daboub, who oversees the World Bank's governance program, declined to comment specifically on corruption issues in Kazakhstan or on Mr. Nazarbayev's leadership. 
 ''We respect what countries pick in terms of leadership,'' said Mr. Daboub. ''We are not judges, prosecutors or investigators.'' 
 But Mr. Baker, the energy analyst at the Brookings Institution, saw things differently: ''If you're a country with a lot of oil, you get a lot of free passes.''
 Human rights groups have spent years blasting Mr. Nazarbayev for shutting newspapers critical of his regime; passing laws that threatened to prosecute individuals whose actions were considered threats to the country's economic development efforts; tolerating and participating in vast graft; and the like. But rarely have American policy makers openly opposed Mr. Nazarbayev's leadership and actions, analysts said.
 ''He has done a pretty sophisticated job of reaching out to many sectors,'' said Thomas O. Melia, deputy director of Freedom House, a liberal research group in Washington. ''He is not like a lot of leaders, who put all of their eggs in the White House basket.''
 Even so, the White House, through successive administrations, has been a reliable and enormously influential ally of Mr. Nazarbayev, and its continued embrace of Kazakhstan's leader rankles some members of Congress. 
 ''It's just hypocritical for President Bush to issue statements on combating foreign corruption and then to embrace a dictator,'' said Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. ''It sends a real negative message to countries that you're trying to win support from.''
 Senator Levin characterized Mr. Nazarbayev as ''an iron-fisted dictator who imprisons his opponents, bans opposition parties and controls the press.''
 But some say the White House should be worldly wise when it comes to supporting certain countries in volatile but resource-rich regions. Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said the Bush administration had effectively balanced its long-term foreign policy goals involving energy issues with its human rights standards in Central Asia. Because of turmoil in other Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan has emerged as a possible military foothold for the United States there.
 ''When it comes to Kazakhstan, it's all about three things; energy, democracy and security,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''I would argue that relative to his competition in Central Asia, Nazarbayev is the most successful in pursuing each of them. Sure, there is still corruption and insufficient rule of law, but this is a country that 15 years ago had no statehood. They have started from scratch.''
 If Mr. Giffen's trial gets under way in February, it may enrich and shed light on the debate about the United States' engagement with Kazakhstan and other countries that have poor anticorruption records.
 FOR their part, Kazakh officials worry that Mr. Giffen's trial may set their nation on a backward course. Mr. Weingarten, the lawyer representing the Kazakh government, wrote a letter in 2002 to the Justice Department on behalf of his client. The letter was straightforward: ''Even if it were possible for the prosecutors to indict President Nazarbayev, we cannot envision a scenario where the United States would deem it in its interest to indict the leader of an important strategic ally.'' 
 Even more important, said some of Mr. Giffen's allies, is that the whole messy affair of moving bribes and laundered money around the world has caused Mr. Giffen's work to become unfairly mischaracterized.
 ''If this whole thing was just about oil, it was one of the biggest snow jobs in U.S. history,'' said Mr. Siegel, the Washington lobbyist who aided Mr. Giffen's efforts in Kazakhstan. ''I believed that we were doing God's work.''

HEADLINE: Ban Ki-moon vs. The Bad Guys

BYLINE: By James Traub. 
James Traub, a contributing writer, is the author of a new book, ''The Best Intentions: Kofi Annan and the U.N. in the Era of American World Power.''

 BODY:
As he prepares to take office as Secretary General of the United Nations on New Year's Day, Ban Ki-moon, South Korea's foreign minister, has vowed to improve the institution's beleaguered reputation. Some of the changes he has in mind, like improving coordination among the U.N.'s many agencies, are essentially bureaucratic -- but others concern issues of great moral and geopolitical moment.
Ban appears to share the incumbent Kofi Annan's conviction that the United Nations must promote human rights around the world. To that end, he has sworn to make the new Human Rights Council, established to replace a notoriously toothless predecessor, live up to ''the heightened expectations of the international community.'' Is he promising more than he can deliver? 
 The old Human Rights Commission routinely fell victim to gross human rights violators who gained a position on the body and devoted themselves to quashing resolutions criticizing anyone among their number. In the ambitious reform package Annan formulated last year, he proposed a new organization with better financing, wider powers and more stringent requirements for membership: aspirants would have to win the support of two-thirds of the U.N.'s members to secure a spot. But thanks to a combination of resistance from states that preferred the status quo and maladroit American diplomacy, the two-thirds requirement was reduced to a mere majority.
 The Bush administration refused to endorse this compromised institution or to seek a place on it. Cuba, China, Russia, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, sought and won seats. And the outcome was numbingly familiar: efforts by Western countries and human rights organizations to criticize gross abusers like Uzbekistan failed, while a campaign orchestrated by the Organization of Islamic Countries produced two separate resolutions condemning Israel. The final tally of censure was Israel 2, everyone else 0.
 But halfhearted reform was not really the problem. Even if council contenders had been required to win the support of two-thirds of U.N. members, the most egregious human rights violators would still have won their seats without breaking a sweat. (Saudi Arabia would have fallen one vote short but presumably could have found a vote if it had needed one.) The council's failure was, if anything, a democratic one. Twenty-six of the 47 members come from either Africa or Asia, and in retrospect it seems naive to imagine that a body broadly representative of the U.N.'s membership would enforce standards of state responsibility observed chiefly in the West. After all, even the Security Council, where the West has a larger voice, has barely been able to muster a response to the atrocities in Darfur and has been altogether silent in the face of lesser horrors in places like Zimbabwe.
 The problem lies with the United Nations itself. The United Nations necessarily reflects not only its own ideals but also the interests and internal conditions of its member states, and it turns out that the universal principles enshrined in documents like the U.N.'s 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not, in fact, universally accepted. What's more, the fact that the United States, the world's most voluble exponent of the virtues of freedom, has itself been accused of trifling with civil liberties in the name of fighting terrorism has further undermined the enterprise. Or perhaps American behavior simply offers a useful pretext for stonewalling: so long as most of the U.N.'s members -- including many of the official democracies -- are fundamentally undemocratic, bodies like the Human Rights Council are almost bound to fail.
 Should we, then, accept that the United Nations lacks the moral authority to defend the principles enumerated in its own landmark declarations? That would be tantamount to accepting the institution's disposability. Instead, we should look elsewhere. In a sense, the moral core of the U.N. lies in the office of the secretary general, who stands above the interests of states and thus speaks for all men and women. For all that we may regard him today as a reduced figure, Kofi Annan won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001 essentially for having embraced the rhetorical and moral responsibility of his office.
 Annan's two finest moments may have been a 1997 speech rebuking African heads of state for behaving as if human rights were a Western preoccupation that did not apply to their own citizens and his address to the General Assembly two years later in which he argued passionately that the United Nations must protect people from atrocities committed by their own governments, even if that entails ''humanitarian intervention.'' Many of the third-world countries that denounced the idea as a violation of state sovereignty embraced it six years later when the General Assembly formally adopted ''the responsibility to protect.'' Words, of course, are cheap, and few of those states are prepared to help save the beleaguered people of Darfur. But Annan had at least forced the U.N. to focus on the rights of people rather than of states.
 The iron grip of regimes all over the world is threatened by growing demands for both economic and political liberty. It's true, in this sense, that the international community has heightened expectations of the United Nations. And this brings us back to Ban Ki-moon. Both Washington and Beijing, which together played the decisive role in the selection process, sought a candidate who would be more ''secretary'' than ''general.'' And in Ban, a bland and placatory public speaker, they seem to have found their man. Ban has spoken chiefly of managerial issues and from all appearances is a very recent convert to the cause of human rights. Yet if no amount of reform can change the underlying dynamics of the Human Rights Council, then it is the secretary general himself who must meet those expectations. Ban Ki-moon will have to find his voice.

 Of the 47 states currently serving on the U.N. Human Rights Council, the following were judged ''not free'' (as opposed to ''free'' or ''partly free'') by Freedom House in 2006. (Source: Freedom House, ''Freedom in the World 2006'' Chart by L. Eckstein)

HEADLINE: Elections Elsewhere Oct. 29-Nov. 4

 BODY:

BRAZIL

The News -- President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil promised to increase economic development and ease poverty after winning a landslide re-election, despite corruption and political scandals that engulfed his administration.

Behind the News -- Mr. da Silva, a former labor leader, benefited from an improved economy and a welfare program that delivers monthly stipends to nearly 12 million poor families. In his second term, his biggest challenge may be to energize growth. Though improved, Brazil's economy has expanded at less than half the rate of other emerging economies. Another challenge is controlling the rampant crime afflicting the fourth-largest democracy. 


CONGO

The News -- Election monitors say Congo's runoff presidential election was a success, though ballots were still being tallied. It was the first free vote in more than 40 years in one of the planet's poorest nations.

Behind the News -- The United Nations has spent $500 million on the election, saying that Congo is crucial for establishing peace in central Africa. Voters chose between Joseph Kabila, the incumbent, and Jean-Pierre Bemba, a businessman and militia leader. In the past 10 years, millions have died in civil wars, and there is concern the outcome may drive a wedge in the middle of the country. But despite some violence and reports of fraud, observers say the election was fair. Results could come this week.

SERBIA

The News -- Voters overwhelmingly approved a new Constitution asserting that the mostly Albanian southern province of Kosovo is an ''integral part of Serbia.''

Behind the News -- Serbs regard Kosovo as central to their national identity, but the province has demanded independence. The United Nations has administered it since June 1999, when NATO-led troops seized control of Kosovo from Yugoslav security forces accused of committing atrocities against Albanians. The constitutional provision on Kosovo was considered to be symbolic because the fate of the province is now in the hands of the United Nations Security Council, which is expected to vote soon on whether to grant it independence.

NICARAGUA

The News -- Daniel Ortega, a cold war nemesis of the United States, campaigned for a return to power in Nicaragua's presidential election today, 16 years after voters ousted him from the job following a long and destructive civil war.

Behind the News -- Mr. Ortega is the front-runner in a race splintered among five candidates. A one-time Marxist, he rose to power after the leftist Sandinistas overthrew the military dictatorship. These days, Mr. Ortega has left behind some of his radical past. He now says, for instance, that he would respect private property, not confiscate it. But Washington fears he would align himself with the leftist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez.

IVORY COAST

The News -- The United Nations Security Council voted to extend the Ivory Coast's transitional government for another year after the war-torn country failed for a second time to hold free elections under an international plan to reunify the country.

Behind the News -- This West African nation has been divided between the government-held south and rebel-held north since fighting began in 2002. About 10,000 United Nations peacekeepers and French troops police a fragile cease-fire line and are supervising efforts intended to lead to elections. But with the country again failing to meet a deadline, the Security Council shifted powers from the president to an unelected prime minister to organize elections.

HEADLINE: Testing North Korea

 BODY:
Nobody knows why the North Koreans decided to come back to the negotiating table or whether any pressure or promise could persuade them to give up their nuclear weapons. But after a year of nothing happening -- except for Pyongyang churning out more plutonium -- it is far past time to find out. 
 Administration hawks are claiming that sanctions and the threat of a naval blockade -- after last month's nuclear test -- wrestled the North back to the table. The more diplomatically minded suggest that Washington's offer to also discuss American financial sanctions may have helped tip the balance.
So what do we do now? The best approach is to try more of both -- pressure and promises -- and see if it works. That is pretty unremarkable advice. Except, of course, for the Bush administration, which can't decide if it wants to negotiate with Kim Jong-il or try to overthrow him. 
 Last year President Bush agreed to offer economic and security incentives to North Korea. And Pyongyang may -- or may not -- have agreed to give up its weapons. But we never got to find out because Washington quickly undercut its own offer, imposing tough new financial sanctions, ostensibly to punish the North for selling counterfeit dollars. The North walked away from the table.
 North Korea more than deserves to be punished for testing a nuclear weapon. And the sight of a unified United Nations Security Council meting out even limited sanctions has caught its attention. We suspect that China's undeclared suspension of oil deliveries during the month of September (after the North's missile tests) also helped. That is a clear argument for the Security Council to keep up the pressure. More nudges from Beijing would help, too.
 But this is certainly not the time for backtracking. It is also not the time for more unilateral American sanctions, intemperate rhetoric or anything else administration hawks might cook up to scuttle the talks. If President Bush is serious about trying to negotiate his way out of the nightmare of a nuclear-armed North Korea, he needs to end debate within his administration and empower Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to cut the best deal she can. She should start with a clear pledge that the United States will not try to overthrow the North Korean government if it gives up its weapons program.
 It's impossible to know whether North Korea's Dear Leader will trade away his weapons at any price. But this White House has yet to test him.

HEADLINE: The Campaign That Never Happened

BYLINE: By Dan Chaon. 
Dan Chaon is the author of the novel ''You Remind Me of Me.''

DATELINE: Cleveland 

 BODY:
AUTUMN arrived: the leaves began to fall and the political signs sprouted up in people's yards. For a week or so there was excitement about the ''tight'' Senate race -- a virtual tie according to some polls taken in September -- but then abruptly Sherrod Brown, the Democratic challenger, seemed to leap into the lead, ahead by double digits in late October. 
 I have to admit, I was a bit puzzled. Um, what happened? Was it Ohio's economy and the war in Iraq? Did revulsion with the scandal-ridden Ohio Republican Party finally reach critical mass, what with Gov. Bob Taft's approval rating hovering around 11 percent and Representative Bob Ney headed to prison? Was it national scandals like the Mark Foley affair? Was the Republican incumbent, Mike DeWine, too tied to the policies of President Bush? Was Representative Brown simply irresistibly charismatic? 
Frankly, it was hard to get a clear picture, because it seemed as if the window of the ''actual'' race was so brief. You could call it a case of drive-by democracy. Voters finally appeared to take a glance at the candidates, poll numbers shifted, and suddenly pundits were saying that the race was basically over. Senator DeWine's campaign had ''fizzled,'' they said -- ''Waning DeWine Is Getting Waxed,'' The Plain Dealer reported last Sunday. 
 ''It's very frustrating,'' my wife said while we were watching a recent episode of ''The Daily Show,'' which was gleefully broadcasting from Ohio. ''I don't know how you can feel good about voting. It's more like voting for an advertising campaign than for a candidate.'' 
 Meanwhile, a lot of attention began to fall upon the machinery of the campaigns. Much was made of the Republican National Committee's decision to pull financing from Mr. DeWine. This was seen as a sign that the party was basically conceding defeat, turning its attention to tighter races. So you would think that Democrats would be jubilant. But the ones that I talked to seemed wary of optimistic polls, and nervous in the face of Ohio's enormous problems with voting machines and election laws. ''Pshhh,'' said my friend Gillian, and waved her hand dismissively. ''This election is going to be a complete disaster.'' 
 It certainly has begun to seem that our election system is in trouble. A 230-page report commissioned by Cuyahoga County on its May 2 primary fiasco was made public in late October, and revealed widespread concerns about the reliability of the AccuVote electronic voting machines. ''Oh, boy,'' said one of my students, a computer science major. ''We talked about these machines in class, and I don't think anybody realizes how screwed up they are.'' 
 Similarly, Vicki Lovegren, a mathematics lecturer at Case Western Reserve University who has become a local advocate for election integrity, said, ''If you're a computer scientist, you're nervous,'' adding: ''When you have electronic voting machines, it doesn't take a conspiracy of many people. One person can affect the outcome without anyone knowing.'' 
 Meanwhile, voters who hoped to avoid the AccuVote machines by submitting absentee ballots are running into problems of their own. A new law mandating voter identification for absentee ballots was halted in federal district court in late October, then reinstated a few days later by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth District, then repealed again, less than a week before the election, in an agreement between the Ohio attorney general's office and lawyers for two groups who had challenged the law. Still, even days before the election, it's unclear whether the rules and standards have been settled for good. 
 And so, even as the polls seem to widen in favor of Democrats, things in my liberal neighborhood seem hesitant, clouded with doubt. Organizations like Video the Vote are planning to videotape problems that occur at polling places across Ohio, and the Vote Count Protection Project plans to conduct its own Election Day exit polls. 
 My wife and I discuss all this and then we lie there in bed for a while, staring up at the ceiling. ''It all seems very paranoid,'' she says. ''But you get these doubts in your head, it's hard to make them quiet again.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Glum as It Struggles to Hold Congress

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and ROBIN TONER; Carl Hulse and Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
The battle for Congress rolled into a climactic final weekend with Republican Party leaders saying the best outcome they could foresee was losing 12 seats in the House. But they were increasingly steeling themselves for the loss of at least 15 seats and therefore control of the House for the first time in 12 years.
 Democrats and Republicans said the battle over the Senate had grown fluid going into the final hours before the elections on Tuesday. Democrats said they thought they were almost certain to gain four or five seats and still had a shot at the six they need to take control.
Republicans were pouring money into Senate races in Michigan and Maryland this weekend to take advantage of what they described as last-minute opportunities, however slight, in states currently held by Democrats. And a new poll Saturday showed that Senator Conrad Burns, the Montana Republican, was tied with his challenger after a visit there by President Bush. 
 Party strategists on both sides, speaking in interviews after they had finished conducting their last polls and making their final purchases of television time, said they were running advertisements in more than 50 Congressional districts this weekend, far more than anyone thought would be in play at this stage.
 Nearly all of those seats are held by Republicans, underscoring the degree to which President Bush and his party have been forced onto the defensive two years after he claimed that his re-election had given him the political capital to carry out an ambitious domestic and foreign agenda.
 ''It's the worst political environment for Republican candidates since Watergate,'' said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster working in many of the top races this year.
 As the final weekend began, the parties made final tactical moves as candidates sparred over the war, the economy, corruption and competence and as elaborate get-out-the-vote campaigns were rolled out. At stake was not just control of the House and the Senate, but also potentially the course of the Bush presidency in its last two years and the debate over how to proceed in Iraq.
 Democrats bought advertising time in yet another House race that had long been considered safe for Republicans, that of Representative Marilyn Musgrave of Colorado. Mr. Bush appeared at a rally in Ms. Musgrave's district on Saturday morning, part of a late flurry of campaigning by the president aimed at shoring up struggling Republicans in some of the reddest states in the country, including Nebraska and Kansas.
 In another bit of news that sent a chill through many Republicans, a University of New Hampshire poll showed Representative Charles Bass, a popular moderate Republican from New Hampshire who had not been seen as vulnerable this year, trailing his opponent after Democrats spent $1 million in his district. 
 In upstate New York, Representative John E. Sweeney, a Republican who had seemed to be weathering a tough challenge, was described by party strategists as in new danger after his local newspaper, the Glens Falls Post Star, withdrew its endorsement of him, citing reports of a domestic violence episode involving Mr. Sweeney and his wife.
 Joe Gaylord, who was the political lieutenant to Newt Gingrich when he led the Republican takeover of the House in 1994, said that based on polling he had seen in recent weeks, he expected his party to lose 25 seats to 30 seats on Tuesday. That general assessment was repeatedly echoed in interviews with Republicans close to the White House.
 ''It's very grim,'' Mr. Gaylord said. ''Things are dreadful out there.''
 Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican and veteran party strategist, said: ''There's no question we're going to take a hit. The only question is how hard it would be.''
 Still, some Republicans and Democrats said that Republicans could be bolstered by structural advantages that could, at the very least, minimize the party's losses. Aides to both parties said that at least 20 races were close enough that struggling Republican incumbents could be pulled to victory by the party's sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation. 
 Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, has assured nervous associates that the Republican turnout operation would help save the party from electoral disaster.
 Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, the New York Republican heading his party's effort to hold onto the House, said: ''Turnout will be key to us in these three dozen races that are close across the country.'' In a sign of how unexpectedly challenging the climate is for Republicans, Mr. Reynolds has had to devote much of his time to his own tough re-election battle.
 For all the deep unhappiness that polls show with Congress, Mr. Bush, his party and the Iraq war, only about 10 percent of House races could be considered even remotely competitive. That figure stands as a reminder of the enduring power of incumbency, and of how a dominant party can protect itself by drawing Congressional districts that serve as bulwarks during stormy seasons. There are 34 incumbent House members and one senator running for re-election unopposed.
 ''If the Democrats end up with 53 percent of the national vote and still don't get a majority in the House, which is conceivable, it's a clear sign that this Republican structural advantage has really kicked in,'' said Gary C. Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego.
 Ken Mehlman, the Republican national chairman, said in an interview that the ''race for the House remains very close, and I believe we will keep our majority.
 ''And I think the Senate, in the last week,'' he said, ''has been very good for Republicans and very difficult for Democrats.'' 
 His Democratic counterpart, Howard Dean, offered a different reading of the electoral environment. ''The president is spending the last Sunday of the campaign in Nebraska!'' he exclaimed, alluding to that state's largely Republican status. ''Who would have ever thought that?''
 Appropriately enough for a campaign that has been marked by searing negative advertisements, the campaign-closing round of advertising -- which in more typical years has consisted largely of gauzy 30-second spots in which the candidate makes an earnest plea for support -- was this weekend led by another round of dark charges on topics including coddling terrorists and raising taxes.
 ''Drunk Driving. Arrests. Federal investigations,'' an announcer says in a new advertisement aimed at Mr. Sweeney by his opponent, Kirsten Gillibrand. 
 Across the country, but particularly in Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Montana, the massive voter turnout operations began rolling into their final 72-hour plans, with one more round of telephone calls and personal visits to voters who had long ago been identified. Volunteers bused in from around the country -- the roll call of states ranged from to New Jersey to Mississippi-- assembled at the Ohio Democratic Party in downtown Columbus Saturday morning, to gather literature, lists and their marching orders for the day.
 The tautness of this midterm election was in evidence across the country. Representative Deborah Pryce, an Ohio Republican, could barely hide her frustration Saturday as she feverishly went table to table in a restaurant looking for support.
 ''It's been a tough, awful race,'' Ms. Pryce said to a table of voters.
 ''Well, we are concerned for you,'' responded Donna Beachy, 76, of Plain City. ''The Democrats are really out working hard. We'regetting three calls a night, all with recordings, and most of them are from Democrats.''
 In the Senate, Republicans girded themselves for what strategists from both parties described as the almost certain defeat of Senators Mike DeWine of Ohio and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. They said that Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island was also probably headed for a loss. Democratic hopes of winning a seat in Tennessee seem to have faded in recent days, while their chances of unseating Senator George Allen of Virginia appear to be on the rise, leaders in both parties said. 
 But Mr. Burns, a Republican who has been struggling all year in the face of a tough challenge by Jon Tester, was said by aides in both parties to have grown stronger in recent days. A poll conducted by Mason-Dixon for Lee Newspapers and published on Saturday found that Mr. Burns and Mr. Tester each had the support of 47 percent of the voters. 
 Republicans said they were still hopeful of unseating Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, after pouring $5 million into his state over the past 10 days. But some analysts said the onslaught might prove to have been too late to make a difference; a WNBC/Marist Poll released Saturday evening showed Mr. Menendez with an eight-point lead over his Republican opponent, Tom Kean Jr. 
 In what some senior Republican strategists said was something between a long-shot and a Hail Mary pass, Republicans were spending money in Michigan to defeat Debbie Stabenow, the Democratic incumbent, as well as in Maryland, hoping that black voters in the state would desert the Democratic Party and vote for Michael Steele, a black Republican running for an open seat.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat leading the party's effort to win the Senate, said : ''I would say it's going to be very close one way or the other. The odds of it being four, five or six seats are higher than it being three or seven.''
 In the House, Democrats seem all but assured of picking up open Republican seats in Arizona, Iowa and Colorado, along with the Ohio seat of Bob Ney, who pleaded guilty to corruption charges and stepped down on Friday. 
 Party leaders said the Republicans who seemed headed for defeat on Tuesday included Representatives Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, and Chris Chocola and John Hostettler of Indiana. Other likely Democratic pickups include the Florida seat being vacated by Katherine Harris, who is running for Senate, and the upstate New York seat being vacated by Sherwood L. Boehlert.
 Officials in both parties said more than 20 House contests remained very tight, which is why Democrats could end up capturing at least 30 seats or falling short of the 15-seat gain they need to take control, depending on turnout and last-minute shifts. A number of respected independent analysts, including Stuart Rothenberg and Charles Cook, have predicted that Democrats could gain 35 seats or more.
 It is possible that no Democratic incumbent will be knocked out of office, though Republicans have made a concerted effort to unseat two Democrats in Georgia.
 Faced with diminishing opportunities, Republicans have continued through this weekend to spend money to hold on to two other seats vacated by Republicans who left under clouds: Mark Foley of Florida and Tom DeLay of Texas. The fact that the party had to pour resources into those two races, along with others in which incumbents had been hurt by their own scandal or tainted by the fallout from the Foley Congressional page scandal, was said by Republican strategists to be one of the biggest problems they faced.
 ''The scandal seats have clearly hurt us and put us at a disadvantage,'' said Carl Forti, a senior strategist with the National Republican Congressional Committee.


Tenn. -- Harold E. Ford Jr., a Democrat, is trying to become the first black senator in the South since Reconstruction, but his opponent, Bob Corker, appears to have gained ground.

Va. -- Senator George Allen has been trying to recover from a series of missteps, and Democrats have spent heavily on behalf of Jim Webb, who has focused on the war in Iraq.

Mo. -- Senator Jim Talent, a Republican, and Claire C. McCaskill have been in a dead heat for months. A ballot measure on stem cell research may bring out more voters on an issue that has divided the candidates.

Pa. -- Bob Casey, a Democrat, has been in the lead for months against Senator Rick Santorum, a staunch conservative.

R.I. -- Senator Lincoln Chafee, a moderate Republican, is facing a tough challenge from Sheldon Whitehouse in a Democratic state.

Oregon -- NO RACE

*Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, running as an independent, has said he will vote with the Democrats.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 7, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about Republican Party leaders steeling themselves for possible election losses misstated the percentage of House races considered even remotely competitive. According to an analysis by The New York Times, slightly more than 13 percent of the races, or 57 seats, are considered somewhat competitive -- not about 10 percent, or 43 contests. (An accompanying map carried the correct numbers.)

HEADLINE: The Difference Two Years Made

 BODY:
On Tuesday, when this page runs the list of people it has endorsed for election, we will include no Republican Congressional candidates for the first time in our memory. Although Times editorials tend to agree with Democrats on national policy, we have proudly and consistently endorsed a long line of moderate Republicans, particularly for the House. Our only political loyalty is to making the two-party system as vital and responsible as possible.
 That is why things are different this year. 
To begin with, the Republican majority that has run the House -- and for the most part, the Senate -- during President Bush's tenure has done a terrible job on the basics. Its tax-cutting-above-all-else has wrecked the budget, hobbled the middle class and endangered the long-term economy. It has refused to face up to global warming and done pathetically little about the country's dependence on foreign oil. 
 Republican leaders, particularly in the House, have developed toxic symptoms of an overconfident majority that has been too long in power. They methodically shut the opposition -- and even the more moderate members of their own party -- out of any role in the legislative process. Their only mission seems to be self-perpetuation.
 The current Republican majority managed to achieve that burned-out, brain-dead status in record time, and with a shocking disregard for the most minimal ethical standards. It was bad enough that a party that used to believe in fiscal austerity blew billions on pork-barrel projects. It is worse that many of the most expensive boondoggles were not even directed at their constituents, but at lobbyists who financed their campaigns and high-end lifestyles. 
 That was already the situation in 2004, and even then this page endorsed Republicans who had shown a high commitment to ethics reform and a willingness to buck their party on important issues like the environment, civil liberties and women's rights.
 For us, the breaking point came over the Republicans' attempt to undermine the fundamental checks and balances that have safeguarded American democracy since its inception. The fact that the White House, House and Senate are all controlled by one party is not a threat to the balance of powers, as long as everyone understands the roles assigned to each by the Constitution. But over the past two years, the White House has made it clear that it claims sweeping powers that go well beyond any acceptable limits. Rather than doing their duty to curb these excesses, the Congressional Republicans have dedicated themselves to removing restraints on the president's ability to do whatever he wants. To paraphrase Tom DeLay, the Republicans feel you don't need to have oversight hearings if your party is in control of everything.
 An administration convinced of its own perpetual rightness and a partisan Congress determined to deflect all criticism of the chief executive has been the recipe for what we live with today.
 Congress, in particular the House, has failed to ask probing questions about the war in Iraq or hold the president accountable for his catastrophic bungling of the occupation. It also has allowed Mr. Bush to avoid answering any questions about whether his administration cooked the intelligence on weapons of mass destruction. Then, it quietly agreed to close down the one agency that has been riding herd on crooked and inept American contractors who have botched everything from construction work to the security of weapons.
 After the revelations about the abuse, torture and illegal detentions in Abu Ghraib, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Congress shielded the Pentagon from any responsibility for the atrocities its policies allowed to happen. On the eve of the election, and without even a pretense at debate in the House, Congress granted the White House permission to hold hundreds of noncitizens in jail forever, without due process, even though many of them were clearly sent there in error. 
 In the Senate, the path for this bill was cleared by a handful of Republicans who used their personal prestige and reputation for moderation to paper over the fact that the bill violates the Constitution in fundamental ways. Having acquiesced in the president's campaign to dilute their own authority, lawmakers used this bill to further Mr. Bush's goal of stripping the powers of the only remaining independent branch, the judiciary.
 This election is indeed about George W. Bush -- and the Congressional majority's insistence on protecting him from the consequences of his mistakes and misdeeds. Mr. Bush lost the popular vote in 2000 and proceeded to govern as if he had an enormous mandate. After he actually beat his opponent in 2004, he announced he now had real political capital and intended to spend it. We have seen the results. It is frightening to contemplate the new excesses he could concoct if he woke up next Wednesday and found that his party had maintained its hold on the House and Senate.

HEADLINE: Abortion, Condoms And Bush 

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
It seemed the perfect way to shame President Bush for disregarding the poor: I suggested that he had presided over a surge in abortions.
 In that column two years ago, I cited a study indicating that the abortion rate had risen sharply after Mr. Bush took office. Conservatives protested furiously, saying that the figures weren't reliable.
 Now we do have better statistics, and my conservative critics seem to have been right. 
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do show a tiny increase in abortions in 2002 (the most recent year available). But more comprehensive figures from the Guttmacher Institute, which does research on reproductive health, indicate that abortions fell -- albeit by tiny amounts -- in the first three years of Mr. Bush's presidency.
 In 2003, the institute estimates, there were 1.29 million abortions in the U.S., 26,000 fewer than in President Bill Clinton's last year in office. 
 Yet abortions fell much faster under Mr. Clinton, and the evidence shows that condoms do more to bring down abortion rates than pious moralizing. That's why staunch ''pro-life'' presidents like Mr. Bush or Ronald Reagan have accomplished far less in reducing abortions than a ''pro-choice'' president like Mr. Clinton.
 Here's the quick overview. After abortion was legalized in 1973, abortions surged under Democrats and Republicans alike and reached a peak of 1.6 million in 1990. President Reagan favored a constitutional amendment banning abortions, but in practice the number of abortions rose modestly on his watch.
 The numbers began to fall late in George H. W. Bush's presidency and plummeted during the Clinton years. There were 180,000 fewer abortions in Mr. Clinton's last year as president than in his first year. But that trend line flattened out so that the declines in Mr. Bush's first term were tiny.
 ''The new numbers strongly suggest that a decades-long decline in U.S. abortion rates is stalling out,'' the Guttmacher Institute's president, Sharon Camp, wrote in a recent analysis. She told me that the institute was gathering data for 2004 and 2005 and feared that they might even show an uptick in abortions.
 One reason is that in half the states, family planning spending hasn't kept pace with inflation. Thus, at last count, 11 percent of sexually active women and girls were not using contraception even though they did not want babies, up from 7 percent in 1995. Half of unwanted pregnancies come from that group.
 Then there's the rise in the poverty rate under Mr. Bush and the increase in the number of uninsured Americans. The number of women who say they need help paying for prescription contraceptives rose by one million between 2000 and 2004.
 So let's require all health insurers to cover the cost of prescription contraceptives, as many already do. And let's increase our investment in family planning, since every tax dollar spent on contraceptives reduces Medicaid spending on pregnant women and newborn babies by $3.
 The evidence is solid about how to reduce abortions: promote contraception and comprehensive sex education (rather than ''abstinence only'' programs). California has led the country in these areas, and as a result it cut teenage pregnancy rates by 39 percent over eight years.
 Western Europe and Canada both emphasize sex education and family planning programs. The result is that American women are almost three times as likely to get abortions as women in Belgium or Germany. Or take Canada. Among women and girls aged 15 to 19, Americans are 38 percent more likely to get abortions than Canadians. And American teenagers, both boys and girls, are nearly 10 times as likely to catch gonorrhea.
 Bush family members were pioneers in supporting the family planning services that can reduce abortion rates. President Bush's grandfather, Prescott Bush, lost an election for U.S. senator in Connecticut in 1950 partly because he was denounced for his ties to Planned Parenthood.
 Later, George H. W. Bush was, as a young congressman, a prime sponsor of the 1970 public health program that provides family planning services in the U.S. He was so enthusiastic that his nickname then was Rubbers.
 If Mr. Bush revived that legacy, he could lead a bipartisan campaign to promote sex education and increase access to contraceptives. Some experts estimate that this could cut the number of abortions in the U.S. by half a million annually. So Mr. Bush, step down from the pulpit, roll up your sleeves -- and go back to your family roots!

HEADLINE: Many Former Pataki Donors Gave to Spitzer This Time

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE and GRIFF PALMER

 BODY:
As a wealthy Republican businessman and lifelong supporter of his party's causes -- he once gave $5,000 to an anti-Hillary Rodham Clinton group called Stop Her Now -- David B. Cornstein would seem unlikely to embrace any Democratic candidate.
 But this year, Mr. Cornstein, 68, broke from tradition and gave $25,000 to Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's campaign for governor. It was the first time he had contributed to a Democrat, he said. 
''I certainly am a Republican,'' said Mr. Cornstein, who is chairman of the city's Off-Track Betting Corporation and once sought the Republican nomination for state comptroller.
 ''But working with state government is about as frustrating an experience as you can have,'' he said. ''You see something that needs to be done that is right for the people of the state, and it just doesn't get done. I'm really hopeful that this man, if you follow his record, will get something accomplished.''
 Mr. Cornstein is far from alone in crossing the partisan divide and embracing Mr. Spitzer in his race against the Republican gubernatorial candidate, John Faso.
 An analysis of campaign finance data by The New York Times shows that many of the biggest contributors to Republican Gov. George E. Pataki in recent years are now favoring Mr. Spitzer over Mr. Faso, which helps explain why Mr. Faso has had great difficulty tapping the formidable Republican fund-raising network to compete against the attorney general. Mr. Spitzer has raised $40.7 million, Mr. Faso just $3.7 million.
 Among the 190 donors in the current governor's race who gave at least $20,000 to Mr. Pataki in past elections, 152 contributed $3.7 million to Mr. Spitzer, and 53 gave about $460,000 to Mr. Faso, according to the analysis, which covered contributors whose identities could be matched in the records. The numbers include 15 who gave to both candidates. The data was current as of early October. 
 Many of those lining up behind Mr. Spitzer are wealthy individuals or institutional givers with interests in Albany -- political action committees, lobbying firms, labor unions and the like -- who tend to gravitate to a perceived winner, regardless of political affiliation. Some normally contribute to Democrats, but for political reasons supported the Republican incumbent in the past.
 Harvey Weinstein, the film producer and a major donor to Democrats, contributed $65,500 to Mr. Pataki, while pushing for tax credits for television and movie productions in New York. He has given $50,000 to Mr. Spitzer and nothing to Republicans this year.
 Still others say they are fed up with business-as-usual and see in the energetic attorney general a chance to shake up the status quo.
 Whatever their motivation, donors who once saw fit to help underwrite Mr. Pataki's campaigns for governor are now betting heavily that his preferred candidate, Mr. Faso, has little chance of winning. Even when donors decide to stick with the Faso campaign, it often seems to be a token show of support.
 Eric Eichler, who heads LCOR, a real estate development firm, and gave $61,400 to Mr. Pataki, has given $2,000 to Mr. Faso. The city Correction Officers Benevolent Association, which gave $47,500 to Mr. Pataki, has given $500 to Mr. Faso. Jerold R. Ruderman, a lawyer in White Plains, gave $30,000 to Mr. Pataki and $1,000 to Mr. Faso.
 Meanwhile, another generous Pataki contributor, Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker, the highest-compensated lobbying firm in Albany last year, has donated $56,000 to Mr. Spitzer and nothing to Mr. Faso. Patricia Lynch, the lobbyist who came in second on the compensation list, sent $48,000 to Mr. Spitzer and nothing to his opponent. 
 For Mr. Faso, this fund-raising dynamic has proven deeply frustrating.
 ''It's a bit of a Catch-22,'' said Susan Del Percio, a Faso campaign spokeswoman. ''You need money to close the gap, but it's the gap that keeps you from raising money.''
 She took a jab at the Spitzer campaign, saying that by raising so much money from special interests it risked displaying a ''pay-to-play mentality'' that seems at odds with the reformer's image it seeks.
 Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer, dismissed such talk, saying he ''has built a record as someone who is clearly independent and makes decisions irrespective of campaign donations.''
 As attorney general, Mr. Spitzer eschewed money from contributors who were subjects of actions by his office. His high-profile assault on Wall Street misconduct led some donors to support Mr. Faso, and previously Mr. Spitzer's opponent in the primary, Thomas R. Suozzi.
 In explaining their decision to support the Democrat, most Pataki contributors interviewed had nothing negative to say about Mr. Faso. Rather, some expressed the belief that as a practical matter, Mr. Spitzer, who leads by wide margins in the polls, is likely to win and they wanted to be seen as supportive.
 Others voiced disillusionment with the Pataki administration's efforts to rejuvenate the upstate economy. Carl J. Montante, president of Uniland Development Company in Amherst, N.Y., who had contributed $25,000 to Mr. Pataki, said he had decided to give $22,000 to Mr. Spitzer as the candidate who seemed best able to get things done.
 ''I had hoped Pataki would deliver for our part of the state, but certainly for the last year and a half he's not been able to do so, largely, I think, because of the stalemate in Albany,'' Mr. Montante said. ''I'm hopeful that Spitzer, the strong personality that he is, will be able to cut through some of that.''
 Robert G. Wilmers, chairman of M&T Bank in Buffalo, gave $25,000 to Mr. Pataki and $40,000 to Mr. Spitzer. ''We're still not making the progress we need to make to fix the upstate economy,'' he said.
 ''For me, it's not so much a question of political philosophy,'' Mr. Wilmers said. ''It's a practical question: Who will be in the best position to get the most accomplished and do the most good?''

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Review Highlights Afghan Leader's Woes

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE and JAMES RISEN; David Rohde reported from Afghanistan and Washington, and James Risen from Washington.

DATELINE: HERAT, Afghanistan, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
A recent Central Intelligence Agency assessment found that the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, had been significantly weakened by rising popular frustration with his American-backed government, American officials say. 
 The assessment found that Mr. Karzai's government and security forces continued to struggle to exert authority beyond Kabul, said a senior American official who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. The assessment also found that increasing numbers of Afghans viewed Mr. Karzai's government as corrupt, failing to deliver promised reconstruction and too weak to protect the country from rising Taliban attacks.
''The ability to project out into the countryside, perceptions of corruption in the government,'' said the official, listing Afghan complaints. ''The failure to deliver the services.''
 The assessment, which was conducted before Mr. Karzai's visit to Washington in late September, echoes the frustration that has gathered force in Afghanistan since the spring, and American officials in Washington and Kabul are expressing increasingly dire warnings regarding the situation here. Ronald E. Neumann, the American ambassador in Kabul, said in a recent interview that the United States faced ''stark choices'' in Afghanistan. Averting failure, he said, would take ''multiple years'' and ''multiple billions.'' 
 ''We're going to have to stay at it,'' he said. ''Or we're going to fail and the country will fall apart again.''
 Officials from the United States Agency for International Development, the government's main development arm, said they were rushing $14 million in assistance to southern Afghanistan, where a recent NATO offensive routed the Taliban, but suicide bombings continue to damage public confidence. 
 ''We've spent about $800,000 on displaced people,'' said Leon S. Waskin, the agency's mission director in Afghanistan. ''We're planning to start a program to repair agricultural infrastructure and damaged houses.''
 The C.I.A. declined to comment on its assessment. In addition to that report, the National Security Council began a classified, interagency review of American training and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan this summer after violence increased. 
 While that review has not been completed, officials said it was expected to include a request for additional financing. Over the past year, the Bush administration reduced financing for Afghanistan by 30 percent and proposed the withdrawal of up to 3,000 American troops. At least 143 American and NATO troops have been killed in the Taliban resurgence this year, 55 more than died in all of 2005, and the planned withdrawal was canceled.
 Gordon D. Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the interagency review covered anti-Taliban and counternarcotics activities as well as efforts to counter extremism and to integrate the central government with local and provincial governments.
 ''We are proud of the progress that has been made in the last five years, but know there is more to do,'' he said. ''The United States is committed to the people of Afghanistan for the long term.''
 Mr. Neumann, who has been the ambassador here for just over a year, laid out a full menu of tasks that he said the American-led effort needed to accomplish in Afghanistan, including reviving the country's economy, building roads and power plants and improving security. He said plans drafted in 2002 to train the army and police force needed to be revamped and expanded.
 Mr. Neumann, a decorated Vietnam veteran whose father served as the American ambassador to Afghanistan from 1966 to 1973, said country's security forces had to be better supplied. ''We have a war, not in all parts of the country, but we have a war,'' he said. ''So we have to build a much better equipped army and a much better-equipped police.''
 Training the police represents an even larger challenge than strengthening the army, Mr. Neumann said. ''The police need a whole huge, major effort,'' he said. ''That wasn't what the program was designed to do when we were at peace.''
 The senior American official said Afghans widely saw the force as corrupt and failing to provide security.
 A sharp increase in suicide attacks and roadside bombings over the past two years has persuaded many Afghans that security has sharply deteriorated under Mr. Karzai. The tactics appear to have migrated from Iraq, according to the official, probably via the Internet and people traveling between the countries. 
 ''There's not been a tradition of the suicide bombers,'' the official said. ''Psychologically, this has had a major impact.''
 Taliban commanders continue to use parts of Pakistan as a haven to plan attacks in Afghanistan, American officials said. But popular support for the Taliban now exists inside Afghanistan as well. 
 The Taliban fighters appear to be attracting support from disaffected Afghans, and they are also coercing Afghans to join them.
 ''How much of this is support for the Taliban?'' the senior American official asked. ''How much is coerced? How much of it is gun for hire? How much of it is a young man who has nothing else to do and this sounds pretty exciting? Our analysis is that there's some degree of all of those.''
 Taliban fighters and drug traffickers appear to be using the same criminal networks, the official said. 
 ''What we think is happening is that there are links at the local level,'' the official said. ''There is certainly the use of the networks -- networks of informants, networks of smuggling routes, communications, finances.''
 Some Taliban fighters are currying support among farmers by promising to protect the opium crops from government eradication efforts, the official said. 
 One reason the central government has trouble exerting control beyond Kabul, the official said, is that it has little means of connecting to the country's strong village councils. 
 To extend its authority, Mr. Karzai's central government is dependent on Afghanistan's provincial and district governments -- the equivalent of state and county governments in the United States -- that remain weak or dominated by corrupt local officials. 
 ''There's no transmission belt that goes between Kabul and the local government,'' the official said. ''You lost a whole generation of education and bureaucrats and people that can take a government plan and make it real on a local level.''
 Mr. Neumann said creating such a link was an enormous challenge, but one the United States must face. A representative government and stronger army, he said, are the only means to prevent the country from disintegrating into rival factions as it did during the 1990s.
 ''Ultimately you're going to succeed with a policy of building an army in a country with a participatory government,'' he said. ''Or the country is going to fragment again.''

HEADLINE: Photographs of an Episode That Lives in Infamy

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH

 BODY:
During the winter of 1942, in the first heated months of America's war with Japan, the United States government ordered tens of thousands of people of Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of them American citizens, to report to assembly centers throughout the West for transfer to internment camps. The infamous episode has been widely chronicled in books and memoirs, as well as in famous photos by Ansel Adams.
 But now close to 800 new images from the period by the photographer Dorothea Lange have been unearthed in the National Archives, where they had lain neglected for a half-century after having been impounded by the government. 
Adams portrayed the internees in the now-infamous camp at Manzanar, Calif., in heroic poses, lighted against the backdrop of the majestic Sierras mountains. Lange's images -- nearly a hundred of which are being published for the first time -- tell a starkly different story.
 The pictures in ''Impounded'' (W. W. Norton) bear the hallmarks of Lange's distinctive documentary style. (She is best known from her photographs of migrant farmers in the Depression for the Farm Security Administration.) Seemingly unstaged and unlighted, the pictures of the internees compress intense human emotion into carefully composed frames. 
 ''They tell us that conditions in the camps were much worse than most people think,'' said Linda Gordon, a historian at New York University who edited the book with Gary Y. Okihiro, a historian at Columbia University. Both also contributed essays.
 Lange's work unflinchingly illustrates the reality of life during this extraordinary moment in American history when about 110,000 people were moved with their families, sometimes at gunpoint, into horse stalls and tar-paper shacks where they endured brutal heat and bitter cold, filth, dust and open sewers. 
 In his essay Mr. Okihiro describes the atmosphere in which the deportations took place. He quotes from an editorial in The Los Angeles Times from the period: ''A viper is nonetheless a viper wherever the egg is hatched -- so a Japanese-American, born of Japanese parents -- grows up to be Japanese, not an American.'' Yet, Ms. Gordon said, ''The U.S. government had deliberately suppressed reports from F.B.I. and military intelligence that concluded that Japanese-Americans posed no security risk.'' The War Relocation Authority hired Lange to document the internments, possibly to demonstrate that the detainees were not being mistreated and international law was not being violated. 
 But at nearly all of the 21 locations Lange visited, the government tried to restrict her. At the assembly centers and at Manzanar she was not allowed to photograph the wire fences, the watchtowers with searchlights, the armed guards or any sign of resistance. She was discouraged from talking to detainees. At one point she was almost fired when one of her photographs appeared on a Quaker pamphlet denouncing the internment. 
 Lange, who died in 1965, showed families who had abandoned their homes and property. Because they couldn't bring their belongings with them, they were often forced to sell them to speculators at reduced prices. In harrowing images that uncomfortably echo the Nazi round-ups of Jews in Europe, Lange's photographs document long, weaving lines of well-dressed people, numbered tags around their necks, patiently waiting to be processed and sent to unknown destinations. 
 ''There is no way to really know how much they lost,'' Mr. Okihiro said in an interview, but he cited a 1983 study commissioned by a Congressional committee estimating that, adjusted for inflation and interest, internees had lost $2.5 billion to $6.2 billion in property and entitlements. Mr. Okihiro writes that one man, Ichiro Shimoda, was so distraught he tried to commit suicide by biting off his own tongue. When that failed, he tried to asphyxiate himself. Finally he climbed a camp fence, and a guard shot him to death. 
 Another man, Kokubo Takara, died after being forced to stand in line in the rain as a disciplinary measure at Sand Island in Hawaii. At assembly points in Hawaii, Mr. Okihiro writes, some detainees were forced to strip naked and had their body cavities searched.
 Upon arrival at the assembly centers -- including the Tanforan Assembly Center in San Bruno, Calif., a former racetrack -- the internees passed through two lines of soldiers with bayonets trained on them. Lange was not allowed to photograph the soldiers, but she did manage some stark images of the horse stalls where the families lived, pictures that are included in the book.
 Lange photographed hospital patients in outdoor beds beside latrines, exposed to the elements; children neatly dressed for school, kneeling on the hard floor as they wrote in exercise books, because there were no benches or chairs. 
 In many of her pictures the subjects look away from the camera, accentuating their sadness and anxiety. Yet Lange also emphasizes the detainees' essential Americanness: a United States Army volunteer helping his mother and family prepare for their internment, a smiling boy with a baseball bat, another boy reading a comic book. 
 Somehow these photographs disappeared. Ms. Gordon said historians did not know exactly what happened to them beyond that the Army deposited them in the National Archives. Ms. Gordon said she could only guess at how bitter Lange must have been to witness the disappearance of so much hard work. Both Ms. Gordon and Mr. Okihiro said they were struck by some disturbing parallels between the treatment of Japanese Americans in 1942 and that of Muslims and other American citizens since the attacks of 9/11. 
 ''The Patriot Acts 1 and 2 allow for the suspension of civil liberties not only of undocumented immigrants, but of U.S. citizens,'' Mr. Okihiro said. Despite the internments, Mr. Okihiro pointed out, 26,000 Japanese-American men and women served in the United States armed forces. But it was not until the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 that the government formally apologized to the internees. 
 In shooting the photos of the internees, Lange was determined to produce an accurate record of what she had seen, Ms. Gordon said.
 ''She deliberately submerged some of her aesthetic principals because she was committed to making a documentary record,'' Ms. Gordon said. ''She was above all a portrait photographer, interested in the individual. In these photographs she is sometimes ignoring the individual to capture the whole experience. But they always show her beautiful, very classical compositions.''

HEADLINE: As Drug Prices Climb, Democrats Find Fault With Medicare Plan

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
For big drug companies, the new Medicare prescription benefit is proving to be a financial windfall larger than even the most optimistic Wall Street analysts had predicted.
 But those gains may come back to haunt drug makers if Democrats take control of Congress this week.
Democrats, who have long charged that the drug industry is profiteering at taxpayers' expense, say they want to introduce legislation to revoke the law that bars Medicare from negotiating prices directly with drug makers like Pfizer for the medicines it buys. 
 Medicare now pays for drugs indirectly, through the private insurers that administer the prescription program -- and those insurers typically pay higher prices than government agencies, like the Veterans Administration, that buy medicines directly from drug makers.
 The government is expected to spend at least $31 billion this year on the drug benefit, which provides partial drug coverage for people over age 65, according to the federal agency that runs Medicare. Next year, the program is expected to cost almost $50 billion -- almost 20 percent of overall American drug spending. 
 Democrats say that directly negotiating with drug makers could save taxpayers tens of billions of dollars annually, though some independent analysts say those projections are probably exaggerated.
 Republicans, and the pharmaceutical industry, say that the benefit program is working and has cost less than initially projected. More than 38 million Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the program, and most say they are satisfied with their coverage, said Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services.
 ''It's very clearly working,'' Mr. Leavitt said. ''We now have 90 percent of seniors in this country who have prescription drug coverage.'' 
 But Wall Street analysts say they have little doubt that the benefit program, called Part D, has helped several big drug makers report record profits and exceed earnings forecasts made earlier in the year.
 Companies have raised prices on many top-selling medicines by 6 percent or more this year, double the overall inflation rate. In some cases, drug makers have received price increases of as much as 20 percent for medicines that the government was already buying for people covered under the Medicaid program for the indigent. Medicare also pays more than the Veterans Administration, which runs its own benefit program.
 ''Part D was a good thing for almost everybody,'' said Les Funtleyder, an industry analyst at Miller Tabak, a research firm in New York.
 Drug makers have tried to play down their gains from the program because they do not want to be seen as profiteering in an election year, Mr. Funtleyder said. ''You don't want to draw too much attention to how good it's been.''
 Democrats claim the government could save as much as $190 billion over the next 10 years if it negotiated directly. Those savings could help shrink the ''doughnut hole,'' the gap in Part D coverage that forces many beneficiaries to pay about $3,000 a year for drugs, said Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House.
 ''What we're planning to do is give Medicare a chance to negotiate prices, and we'd use some of the savings to close the doughnut hole,'' Mr. Daly said. 
 Republicans say the savings estimates offered by the Democrats are vastly inflated. They note that Medicare has already cut its 10-year projection of the program's cost by $117 billion, though the program is still expected to cost taxpayers $516 billion over the next decade. Republicans also note that, in independent surveys, most seniors say they are happy with the benefit.
 ''The competitive marketplace has saved much more money than anyone has ever anticipated,'' said Leslie Norwalk, the deputy commissioner of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
 Ken Johnson, senior vice president at Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main lobbying group for drug makers, said that allowing Medicare to negotiate directly would be unfair because the government had too much market power.
 ''The government doesn't negotiate prices -- it dictates prices,'' Mr. Johnson said. 
 Also, the Veterans Administration and Medicare plans are not directly comparable, he said, because the average Medicare drug plan covers 4,300 medicines, while the V.A. covers only 1,300.
 The structure of Part D is complex. Medicare does not directly provide coverage. Instead it subsidizes plans offered by private insurers. Insurers negotiate prices with drug makers and create menus of different plans, some with high premiums and broad drug coverage and others that offer basic coverage at low premiums. All plans have to follow certain basic rules, like offering at least two medicines in every drug category.
 Medicare then calculates the cost of the average plan and pays every insurer a subsidy of about 75 percent of that cost. Beneficiaries cover the rest, with the amount they pay depending on what plan they choose.
 For example, if the average plan costs $100 a month, Medicare will pay all plans a $75 subsidy for everyone who enrolls, and a person who enrolls in the average plan will pay $25. In most states, beneficiaries can choose from among 40 to 60 plans, Ms. Norwalk said.
 Part D has raised profits for drug makers both by increasing the prices they receive and by encouraging beneficiaries to fill prescriptions they might otherwise have been unable to afford, analysts say. 
 The biggest gains have gone to companies that make drugs widely used by the Medicaid program, which covers the indigent. Poor people over 65, known as ''dual eligibles,'' previously received drugs through Medicaid.
 Drug makers were legally required to give Medicaid a discount of at least 15 percent, and sometimes significantly more, from their list prices. Now Medicaid recipients over 65 are covered through the Part D program, which does not require the same discounts. As a result, drug makers are being paid as much as 20 percent more for the same drugs that they had already been providing to recipients under the Medicaid program.
 The biggest gainer, analysts say, is Eli Lilly, which makes Zyprexa. Zyprexa, used to treat schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses, is widely prescribed to Medicaid patients.
 Lilly, the sixth-largest American drug maker, reported two weeks ago that its third-quarter sales had risen 7 percent, to $3.9 billion, and its profits were up 10 percent, to $874 million, compared with 2005. According to Lilly's published review of the quarter, the sales gains resulted almost entirely from Lilly's prices rising 11 percent in the United States, while actually falling in Europe and Japan.
 ''We are experiencing a one-time sales benefit resulting from a shift of certain low-income patients from Medicaid to Medicare,'' a company spokeswoman, Terra Fox, wrote in an e-mail response to questions about Part D. Ms. Fox declined to quantify how much Lilly had gained from the shift.
 But Lilly is hardly alone in benefiting. Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker, said its sales soared 14 percent in the United States in the third quarter, while rising only 3 percent internationally. Over all, Pfizer said its profits more than doubled, to $3.4 billion from $1.6 billion, though part of the difference came from high one-time charges last year.
 Pfizer did not disclose how much of the sales growth came from price increases and how much from new prescriptions, but earlier this year Pfizer raised the list prices of some of its biggest drugs by 5.5 percent or more, well above the inflation rate. 
 Tony Butler, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said both volume growth and price increases had driven the industry's rising profits. But he said he did not expect major changes in the Part D plan even if the Democrats took over Congress, since President Bush would probably not sign any legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate prices directly.
 ''It's our belief that the White House will veto it,'' he said.

PERSON: Bulent Ecevit

HEADLINE: Bulent Ecevit, a Political Survivor Who Turned Turkey Toward the West, Is Dead at 81

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER; Craig S. Smith and Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Bulent Ecevit, a resilient leader who served four terms as Turkey's prime minister in a turbulent era, died yesterday in a hospital in Ankara, the Turkish capital. He was 81. 
 Mr. Ecevit, who suffered a stroke in May from which he never completely recovered, died of circulatory and respiratory failure, the Gulhane military hospital said.
 For much of his political career -- almost half a century -- Mr. Ecevit was a leftist and a nationalist. An opponent of religious fundamentalism, he helped maintain Turkey's position as the world's most secular Muslim country.
 During his final years in power, Mr. Ecevit turned away from the leftism that had shaped his career. He abandoned much of his hostility to private enterprise, and, after helping to keep Turkey out of the European Union in the 1970s, he came to believe that integration with the West was a good idea. 
 In his last term, beginning in 1999, Mr. Ecevit governed in a coalition with a right-wing party. He pursued pro-business policies and maintained Turkey's status as a faithful NATO member and ally of the United States despite his lifelong skepticism about the sincerity of American commitments to democracy and human rights.
 The hardships encountered when he finally embraced market economics to win the European Union's confidence helped end his political career. With his health failing, his Democratic Left Party lost badly in the country's 2002 elections, forcing him from office. 
 Mr. Ecevit was unusual among Turkish politicians in the simplicity of his lifestyle. He was never accused of participating in the corruption that plagues his country's political and economic life. He was popularly known by the nickname Karaoglan, or Dark Boy, a reference to his black hair and mustache, which he continued to dye despite his advancing age. 
 After leaving office, he devoted himself to writing. 
 Bulent Ecevit (pronounced buh-LEHNT EH-jeh-vicht) was born in Istanbul on May 28, 1925. His father was a professor of medicine and his mother one of the first women in Turkey to become a professional painter. He was their only child. He graduated from Robert College in Istanbul, where much of the country's English-speaking elite has been trained. He later took courses at foreign universities, including Harvard.
 Interested in journalism, Mr. Ecevit worked as a press attache at the Turkish Embassy in London. In the mid-1950s, on a State Department fellowship, he worked at The Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel in North Carolina. The racism he saw in the South deeply disturbed him.
 In a front-page article on Jan. 9, 1955, his last day with the newspaper, he wrote that he had found it strange that the United States should fight oppression in the world while white Americans were ''guilty of refusing to drink from the same fountain as the man who has fought on the same front for the same cause; guilty of refusing to travel on the same coach or seat as the man who has been working with equal ardor for a common community; guilty of refusing to pray to God side by side with the man who believes in the same prophet's teaching.''
 After returning to Turkey, he joined the Republican People's Party, founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic. He was elected to Parliament in 1957.
 While establishing a reputation as a rising star on the non-Marxist left, he also worked as an art critic, columnist and newspaper editor. He published several volumes of poetry and translated the works of T. S. Eliot and Rabindranath Tagore.
 Mr. Ecevit always considered himself a champion of the underdog, a view that linked his support for American blacks, Palestinians, Turkish workers and the Turkish minority on Cyprus.
 His government maintained close ties with Israel, but he denounced Israel's attacks on refugee camps in 2002 as ''genocide.'' Criticized for the remark, he said he had meant to accuse both sides.
 He allowed American planes to use Turkish bases for their patrols over northern Iraq, but he sympathized with Iraqi civilians, who he said were suffering because of economic sanctions imposed by the United States.
 Mr. Ecevit had no such sympathy for Kurds in Turkey, however. He insisted that they were not a minority and for most of his career opposed proposals to legalize education or television broadcasting in the Kurdish language, arguing that such steps would lead to separatism and strife. But in his final term, pressed by the European Union, he became less categorical.
 From 1961 to 1965, Mr. Ecevit served as minister of labor, and in 1972 he deposed his mentor, Ismet Inonu, who had been Ataturk's closest comrade, to take over leadership of the party. The next year he was elected prime minister. 
 In 1974, Mr. Ecevit ordered Turkish troops to land on Cyprus after the government there was overthrown by militants aligned with the Greek military dictatorship. The island has been divided between ethnically Greek and Turkish sectors ever since.
 With the support of labor unions and some leftist groups, Mr. Ecevit served as prime minister twice more during the 1970s. He favored generous social programs, a large government role in the economy and protective tariffs to keep low-priced foreign goods out of Turkey.
 Mr. Ecevit's insular policies and those of his longtime rival, the more conservative Suleyman Demirel, had the effect of sealing Turkey off from many of the intellectual, political and economic trends surging elsewhere. Turkey remained stagnant while underdeveloped countries from Spain to South Korea became more democratic and prospered. 
 During Mr. Ecevit's term as prime minister that began in 1978, hardly a day passed without political assassinations and bombings. After he and other political leaders proved unable to control the violence, military officers staged a coup on Sept. 12, 1980, and remained in power for nearly three years.
 Mr. Ecevit and other political leaders were jailed after the coup. They were released after a few weeks but banned from politics. In 1981, he was imprisoned again for three months after publishing an article criticizing military rule.
 During this period Mr. Ecevit's wife, the former Rahsan Aral, his political partner and fierce defender over many decades, formed the Democratic Left Party on behalf of her husband. She survives him. They had no children.
 After Mr. Ecevit was allowed to return to political life in 1987, he and his wife exercised total control over the party. No one could run for office on its ticket or even join it without their approval. 
 In 1995, he asked his supporters to ''make me prime minister once more before I die,'' but few believed he would realize that ambition. Scandals tarnished many of the country's political leaders, however, and Mr. Ecevit emerged unexpectedly as prime minister in 1998.
 He had the good fortune to be in office when Abdullah Ocalan, leader of a Kurdish rebellion that devastated southeastern provinces, was captured in February 1999, just before Mr. Ecevit's interim government was to face the voters.
 The prestige he gained from that arrest led him to victory in the April 1999 election. In his final term, he embraced many ideas he had once abhorred, like the value of free enterprise and close ties to the West. Many of his former supporters were alienated. 
 He also acknowledged that his earlier opposition to Turkey's joining the European Union had been a historic error. ''It is now understood,'' he said, ''that there can be no Europe without Turkey and no Turkey without Europe.''

HEADLINE: Tribes Fear Cigarette Tax Law Could Destroy Their Prosperity

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
It was late October, and the sun was nearly setting behind the Shinnecock Hills, illuminating the Indian-owned smoke shops along Montauk Highway like museum exhibits.
 Inside one of the shops, the Shinnecock Indian Outpost, customers lined up to buy packs and cartons of tax-free cigarettes, at less than half the price they might pay at the nearby 7-Eleven.
Outsiders feeding their nicotine addiction: this is what keeps the Shinnecocks alive, said the owner, Lance Gumbs. He sat in the store explaining the history of the Shinnecock cigarette trade and how it is now being threatened by a federal lawsuit and by an expected push by a neighboring government, New York State, to end the longstanding practice of selling tax-free cigarettes to non-Indians on Indian reservations.
 The owner of the Gristedes supermarket chain has sued to stop those sales. And the state, which estimates it loses as much as $576 million a year in the sale of untaxed cigarettes, is expected to begin enforcing a law that would compel reservation retailers to begin collecting a tax of $1.50 per pack. 
 Mr. Gumbs, the Shinnecocks' tribal chairman, fears disaster if that happens.
 ''You cut off the cigarette revenue, and you cut off the livelihood of the tribe,'' said Mr. Gumbs. ''This would annihilate us. Everyone would be out of business and back on the welfare rolls. It would be a nightmare scenario.''
 Historically, New York State has not collected cigarette taxes from tribes within its borders because they are considered sovereign nations, so Indian-owned smoke shops have long sold cigarettes at far lower prices than non-Indian competitors.
 Over the past 20 years, cigarette tax increases have drastically driven up retail prices, while reservation prices have remained relatively low. As a result, cigarette sales have become a booming business on the reservations, including those of the Shinnecocks on Eastern Long Island, and their neighbors, the Unkechaug nation.
 Shinnecock and Unkechaug tribal leaders, who credit cigarette revenue with pulling their people out of a quicksand of unemployment, substance abuse and other ills, now fear losing their profitable niche as discount cigarette purveyors.
 But John A. Catsimatidis, who owns the Gristedes and other supermarket and convenience store chains, says those sales illegally undercut his cigarette business. His lawsuit, filed in March in United States District Court in Brooklyn, seeks to force Indian retailers to buy cigarettes from wholesalers at the taxed price, and asks for $20 million from the two tribes' cigarette retailers, the amount he claims he has lost.
 ''The illegal discount pricing by Indian tribes has cost legitimate retailers'' more than $1 billion a year in sales revenue, according to his lawsuit.
 ''I've lost a lot of money to the Indian sales, but that's not the issue,'' Mr. Catsimatidis said in an interview. ''I'm suing on principle. Why are these smoke shops allowed to work outside the law and damage everyone else's business?''
 Both of the Long Island Indian nations filed motions in October to dismiss Mr. Catsimatidis's suit. Tribal members appeared in court in traditional ceremonial outfits, as lawyers for both sides presented arguments to Judge Carol Amon, who has yet to issue a ruling.
 The two Indian nations, like the other tribes in New York State, are also bracing for the state to begin enforcing a law that took effect March 1 requiring New York to collect taxes from wholesalers who sell to reservations. The Long Island tribes are about an hour's drive from Queens.
 Gov. George E. Pataki has refrained from enforcing the law, but Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the candidate for governor who is leading in the polls, supports it. As attorney general, he has pressured wholesalers to stop selling tax-free cigarettes to tribes, and fought cigarette sales over the Internet and through the mail.
 ''The smoke shops are the heart and soul of the economy on this reservation,'' said Harry Wallace, the chief of the Unkechaug Tribal Nation. ''This is nothing more than an attempt to challenge our Indianness and gain control.''
 There are some 250 Unkechaugs living on the 50-acre Poospatuck reservation, which is some 20 miles to the west of the Shinnecocks, in what is now the town of Mastic. Chief Wallace, who is a lawyer, owns a smoke shop on the reservation, which is nestled deep in the corner of a suburban neighborhood on the banks of the Mastic River.
 Chief Wallace admits that the sale of untaxed cigarettes gives his tribe an advantage, but he offered this context: Since settlers first came to the Long Island's East End in 1640, Indian tribes have steadily been deprived of their land, livelihoods and traditions, and have become boxed into small reservations. About the only thing the tribes have retained is their sovereignty and the right to conduct tax-free business.
 By restoring earning power to the community, untaxed cigarettes have breathed fresh life into a threatened Indian culture. Chief Wallace called the lawsuit and the state's tax policy ''an attempt to eliminate us as entities and intimidate us and threaten our people with extinction.''
 ''They want economic control so we revert back to the status of subservient dependents and go back on welfare,'' he said, his voice shaking with anger as he sat in his office surrounded by mounds of legal files for use in his legal defense of untaxed cigarette sales. 
 The state sets minimum price levels for retailers and imposes a sales tax of $1.50 per pack. New York City imposes an extra $1.50 per pack.
 A recent study by the State Health Department found that 37 percent of New York's smokers say they buy cigarettes ''from low-price (mainly untaxed) sources.'' The number was higher for people who live near Indian reservations. 
 The study estimates that the state loses $436 million to $576 million in revenue from untaxed sales. Convenience stores near the reservations typically sell major-brand cigarettes for roughly $5.50 a pack, a price the reservation smoke shops can beat by $2. At the Poospatuck reservation, for example, a 10-pack carton of Parliament cigarettes costs about $33, but it costs $55 in nearby stores. 
 Barbara Cahill, 45, of Mastic Beach, is a regular customer. Once a week, she buys her Parliaments on the Poospatuck reservation, which she said saves her more than $90 a month.
 ''That's enough to pay my cable bill,'' she said on Friday after buying her cigarettes at the reservation. ''Why wouldn't I go where it's cheaper? I already pay $6,000 a year in property taxes, plus gas taxes, sales tax. This business is all the reservation has to keep it going.'' 
 The customers range from local landscapers in dusty pickup trucks to golfers in luxury cars. There were Harley riders, surfers, students and mothers with children waiting in the back seat. Whether buying by the pack or by the carton, they said it was more than worth it to go out of their way to get discounted cigarettes.
 New York requires wholesalers to buy a $1.50 per pack tax stamp for all cigarettes sold to non-Indian retailers. The new law, once enforced, would also require wholesalers to buy tax stamps for the cigarettes they sell to Indian retailers. But those retailers would be allowed to buy a certain number of unstamped cigarettes to sell tax-free to customers they knew to be members of their tribe.
 For now, business is brisk on the reservations. In late October, five cashiers were busy making sales at the Peace Pipe Smoke Shop, which has a walk-up express window. But business is not always smooth. Several months earlier, Suffolk County police officers stood at the entrances to the Poospatuck reservation and began issuing summonses to smoke shop customers, but desisted after Chief Wallace threatened legal action.
 As on the Poospatuck reservation, a handful of bustling smoke shops are the hub of activity on Shinnecock territory and serve as the face of the tribe to the outside world. Billboards warn outsiders that they are ''Entering Shinnecock Territory'' and risking arrest if they trespass.
 The half-dozen smoke shops on the fringe of the Hamptons include a threadbare drive-up stand, a camper and a large metal shipping container with a cutout doorway. They line a stretch of Montauk Highway that leads east into Southampton's village, with its upscale shops and well-heeled shoppers.
 The shops employ 70 heads of households on the 800-acre Shinnecock reservation, which has roughly 550 residents, Mr. Gumbs said. The Shinnecocks, who are also seeking to open a casino on their land, are members of one of the oldest self-governing Native American tribes, he said, and have lived on the East End for thousands of years, long before New York State and its tax laws.
 ''We're not a part of New York State,'' he said. ''This is like New York taxing New Jersey.''

HEADLINE: Turk Hints at Shift to Freer Speech

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY and SEBNEM ARSU

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Recep Erdogan signaled Sunday that he was prepared to amend a law limiting free speech, a surprise move that was apparently an 11th-hour attempt to prevent a crisis with the European Union over Turkey's troubled membership talks. 
 The European Commission is expected to publish a damning report this week criticizing Turkey for sluggishness on the changes it needs to make if it wants to join the 25-member European Union.
Turkey's law on freedom of expression, which makes ''denigration of the Turkish state and identity'' a crime, has generated widespread international criticism. It has been used to prosecute Turkish intellectuals, including Orhan Pamuk, the recipient of this year's Nobel Prize in literature, and Elif Safak, an acclaimed novelist. 
 The seeming shift in Mr. Erdogan's thinking about the law was disclosed in a news conference before a meeting of Turkey's leading nongovernmental organizations, which were discussing shortcomings that could impair its longstanding effort to become a full member of the European Union. Mr. Erdogan acknowledged that the language of the law, known as Article 301, was vague. 
 ''If there are problems that stem from the abstract nature of Article 301 of the Turkish penal code, we are open to suggestions to make it more specific,'' he said.
 Mr. Erdogan all but ruled out changes to the law last week. Nationalists strongly oppose weakening the law.
 Some Turkish political analysts said they thought Mr. Erdogan was trying Sunday to assuage the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, which has been particularly concerned by the Article 301 law.
 ''The move looks desperate,'' said Ilker Domac, a Turkish economist. ''It shows how badly things are going with Turkey's E.U. membership prospects.''
 Fears are growing here that talks with the European Union have reached an impasse that could result in the suspension of Turkey's bid for membership. Such a move could alienate Turkey, an important European and American ally in an unstable region.

HEADLINE: Ortega Dominates Campaign in Nicaragua 

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY; Jill Replogle contributed reporting from Managua, Nicaragua.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Monday, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Nicaraguans went to the polls on Sunday to choose a new president in a five-way contest that primarily focused on one contender: Daniel Ortega, the former Marxist president who fought the American-backed contras in a bloody war in the 1980s.
 At of 12:30 a.m. Monday, with 7 percent of the voting stations reporting, election officials announced that Mr. Ortega was leading with 40.85 percent of the vote to 32.68 percent for his closest challenger, Mr. Montealegre. If that trend were to continue, Mr. Ortego would win the election in the first round. 
Mr. Ortega, 60, has failed in three previous attempts to regain power. Each time, he was unable to convince enough of the population that he had changed from the revolutionary firebrand he was when he led the country from 1985 to 1990.
 But this time, he has been ahead in polls throughout the campaign and stands to benefit from a change in election rules pushed through by his party, the Sandinista National Liberation Front, that lowered the threshold for victory. To win this time, a candidate needs 35 percent of the vote and a five-percentage-point lead over the nearest opponent.
 Previously, candidates needed 40 percent of the vote to gain the presidency. Mr. Ortega fell short of that in 1990, 1996 and 2001.
 If Mr. Ortega does not squeeze out a first-round victory and is forced into a runoff next month, analysts expect him to lose, because the country's strong anti-Ortega opposition would no longer be divided.
 Washington has keenly followed the race, with Bush administration officials making no secret of their distaste for a return of Mr. Ortega and suggesting that economic aid would suffer if he won. Paul A. Trivelli, the American ambassador to Nicaragua, has called him ''a tiger who has not changed his stripes.''
 Mr. Ortega does have the backing of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who has sent subsidized oil to Nicaragua as a sign of support for an Ortega administration. Washington is wary of several left-wing Latin American leaders whom Mr. Chavez has embraced. 
 On Sunday, the Venezuelan vice president, Jose Vicente Rangel, accused Washington of ''blackmail and pressure'' in trying to sway the results, according to The Associated Press. ''My little heart is with these elections,'' he said. ''And as you all know, the heart is located on the left side of the human body.''
 Mr. Ortega was the target of fierce attacks by his rivals, who came from across the political spectrum but agreed that his return would lead Nicaragua down the wrong path.
 In an attempt to stave off an Ortega win, rivals broadcast ominous television advertisements showing images from the war years, with women crying and guns blasting. Memories of the war and the economic collapse brought about by it remain fresh.
 Mr. Ortega's rivals have also traded blame for dividing the opposition. Eduardo Montealegre, of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance, a Harvard-trained banker backed by the United States, and Jose Rizo, of the Constitutional Liberal Party, a former coffee grower who served as vice president from 2001 to 2006, urged each other to step down for the good of the country. Neither did.
 One Montealegre advertisement warned citizens not to ''waste your vote for a candidate who can't beat Ortega.'' The other two candidates in the race are Edmundo Jarquin, an economist and dissident Sandinista, and Eden Pastora, a former Sandinista rebel commander.
 Mr. Ortega, who has said he is no longer a Marxist, largely ignored his rivals, steering clear of a televised debate and rarely mentioning them. On the campaign trail, he spoke of love, peace and reconciliation, and he vowed to focus more on the poor.
 The election was being monitored by about 18,000 observers. .
 Some Nicaraguans acknowledged faults in Mr. Ortega's past rule -- corruption was rampant, for instance -- but said they were sticking by him. ''Daniel robbed, but he robbed for the poor,'' said Jackelin Alcose, 33, a secretary.
 Anti-Ortega voters, however, said they feared more suffering should he become president again. 
 Anabel Rizo, 40, a physician's assistant in Managua, the capital, said she was planning to vote strategically to keep Mr. Ortega out of office.

HEADLINE: U.N. May Delay Decision on Kosovo Autonomy

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: LJUBLJANA, Slovenia, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Ethnic Albanians' hopes that Kosovo would be granted independence this year were put in doubt over the weekend as Secretary General Kofi Annan said a decision on the future of Kosovo, a United Nations-administered province, could be delayed. 
 Mr. Annan said the United Nations ''might not stick to the deadlines as we had originally planned'' because of fears that any formal proposal on Kosovo could sway coming elections in Serbia. Serbia is struggling to retain its links with the province, which it governed until 1999.
''A proposal on Kosovo must be presented at a right time, that's the key,'' he said in an interview published Saturday in Vijesnik, a Croatian newspaper. A United Nations spokesman confirmed the remarks. 
 Mr. Annan's comments are the most serious suggestion that a timetable advanced by five Western governments and adopted by the United Nations could be dropped. Those countries -- the United States, France, Britain, Germany and Italy -- favor a final decision on Kosovo by this year. Together with Russia, they are helping to coordinate the United Nations-sponsored negotiations. 
 While the timing of a possible solution might change by only a few months -- Serbia's election is expected in December -- it is seen as critical by ethnic Albanian politicians and United Nations officials in Kosovo. They worry that impatience for independence among Kosovo's Albanian majority and high unemployment might prompt a violent reaction. Those were factors in rioting and violence in 2004 that drove 4,000 Serbs from their homes in Kosovo. 
 The United Nations and Western diplomats seem to be doing a hard balancing act, as politicians in Belgrade and Kosovo fear a nationalist reaction whatever the final decision. 
 Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations since 1999, after Serb-dominated security forces cracked down on ethnic Albanian insurgents in a long campaign that also killed thousands of civilians. 
 Serbia still sees Kosovo as vital to its religious and national identity, and its government is determined to stop any independence effort. Last month Serbia adopted a Constitution, approved in a nationwide vote, that says the province is an integral part of Serbia that can never be ceded. 
 But many diplomacy experts see Kosovo's complete separation from Serbia, although with international oversight, as the most likely result of any United Nations action. 
 On Sunday, Mr. Annan's office noted that even though talks and a decision could be extended to next year, the goal was still for the United Nations' chief negotiator on Kosovo to conclude talks this year.

HEADLINE: Receding Gas Prices Quiet a Major Issue

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: SEYMOUR, Ind., Nov. 5 

 BODY:
There is uneasiness in being a marginal Republican incumbent in a longtime Democratic district. 
 It surfaced, briefly, at a country restaurant on Sunday when a friendly voice told Representative Mike Sodrel to rest easy about Tuesday. 
Mr. Sodrel, a freshman Republican, demurred, replying: ''I don't know if we got it made. But I think we're going to prevail.''
 That cautious note seemed appropriate in one of the tightest races in the country, here in Indiana's Ninth Congressional District, where an important economic concern -- high gasoline prices -- has been somewhat alleviated in the past few weeks as the price at the pump has edged down. 
 The district was held for 40 years by Democrats, including Lee H. Hamilton, the former Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, until Mr. Sodrel took it -- barely -- on President Bush's coattails in 2004. Now polls show the seat as a tossup between Mr. Sodrel and the Democrat he defeated, Baron Hill, who had held the seat for three terms.
 The race has been as sharp-edged as the southern Indiana countryside is soft and undulating. Off a pastoral road, a billboard denounces Mr. Hill as a supporter of same-sex marriage, abortion and taking ''God'' out of the Pledge of Allegiance. Across the way a sign for Mr. Hill answers: ''Stop the lies. Shame on Mike Sodrel.'' 
 The local airwaves are pulsing with commercials denouncing ''Millionaire Mike'' -- Mr. Sodrel is a self-made trucking magnate -- or ''liberal Baron Hill.'' 
 On Sunday, Mr. Sodrel reduced this grudge rematch to a simple dynamic. ''He wants his seat back,'' he said softly. 
 Mr. Hill, at a campaign stop in the courthouse square in Scottsburg, was all fire and aggression, denouncing the Bush administration's policy in Iraq, millionaire C.E.O.'s and Republicans caught in scandal. 
 Mr. Sodrel was sticking to his guns, greeting supporters at Graceland Baptist Church, a sprawling edifice in New Albany, and insisting that flag, marriage and abortion mattered more here than the war: ''I always tell people, if Norman Rockwell exists, it is in the Ninth District of Indiana.''

HEADLINE: Gaming the Search Engine, in a Political Season

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
A GOOGLE bomb -- which some Web gurus have suggested is perhaps better called a link bomb, in that it affects most search engines -- has typically been thought of as something between a prank and a form of protest. The idea is to select a certain search term or phrase (''borrowed time,'' for example), and then try to force a certain Web site (say, the Pentagon's official Donald H. Rumsfeld profile) to appear at or near the top of a search engine's results whenever that term is queried. 
 As Google has explained on the company's blog, this can be accomplished if enough ''determined pranksters'' use the selected phrase to both describe -- and link to -- the chosen site, because ''results are generated by computer programs that rank Web pages in large part by examining the number and relative popularity'' of other sites that link to them. 
It may be in Google's interest to think of link bombs as nothing more than pranks, but Clifford Tatum, a doctoral student in communications at the University of Washington, compared them in a paper published in the online journal First Monday (www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue10--10/) to the ''media mindbombs'' conceived by the late co-founder of Greenpeace, Bob Hunter. 
 ''Reaching the public consciousness through dramatic, camera-ready opposition to environmental crimes'' is how Greenpeace describes Mr. Hunter's concept. 
 To the extent that the public consciousness is now just as likely to be reached through a computer screen as a television, the idea that passionate sorts would engage in computer-ready actions should come as no surprise. 
 And yet many people were shocked by the revelation two weeks ago that left-leaning bloggers were trying to drop a Google bomb on the campaigns of dozens of Republican candidates -- not least because its bellicose promise seemed to throw into question the very integrity of search engine results. 
 This took link bombing to a new level. The key phrases targeted were the names of the Republican candidates themselves. The goal was to tweak things so that searching for ''Clay Shaw,'' the Republican representative from Florida, for example, would return -- high in the results -- a news article, preselected from a relatively mainstream publication, detailing some negative aspect of the candidate's record. This was repeated for 50 or so candidates. 
 Did it work? The short answer is yes -- somewhat. The folks at MyDD.com, where it all began, have been tracking the progress quite out in the open at mydd.com/tag/googlebomb. It's worth a visit for people of all political persuasions, if only to catch a glimpse of the future of political strategizing. 
 That, and to forever eliminate any lingering notions that one needn't think critically about what results come back from a search engine. 
 ''Anybody who looks for something on any search engine and thinks the results are the best or most impartial results, or that they came back completely organically is totally mistaken,'' said Danny Sullivan, the editor of Search Engine Watch, an online news site aimed at the search marketing industry. 
 The reasons for this are not entirely sinister, Mr. Sullivan explained. After all, as Google pointed out, search engines are programmed to gather, assess and ultimately rank sites based on their relevance to a given query -- that is, they are already making decisions for us. And while competition dictates that as search engines get better at this, their results will be similar, they aren't precisely the same. Each engine has a slightly different magic formula for indexing the incomprehensibly huge universe of Web pages out there. 
 The famous ''miserable failure'' query (a prank to some minds, an expression of popular discontent to others) now prompts just about every major search engine to return George W. Bush's official White House biography as the No. 1 result -- the handiwork of liberal link bombers during the 2004 election. 
 But conservative bloggers managed to retaliate by pushing Jimmy Carter's official presidential biography to the No. 2 position -- and more pointedly a mishmash of other results, depending upon which engine is being used, into the top 10. Microsoft's MSN.com returns the home page of the liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore in the No. 3 slot. Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate Web site is at No. 5. 
 But Yahoo's search engine returns Mr. Moore's site at No. 5, and Mrs. Clinton's is nowhere to be seen on the first page. Ditto on Google. 
 And here's an even better example: Search for the term ''waffles'' on Google and check out the top results. On Saturday, that search on Yahoo and MSN turned up the same, not entirely literal, result at No. 11 (second page of results) and No. 21 (third page) respectively. Since then, the ranking of this site has shifted mostly lower. 
 Bias? Not likely. Just difference. Google fans might say its formula is better. Fans of John Kerry might argue its formula isn't discerning enough. 
 Reaching a hand in to alter or prevent funny business is risky for search companies, because that has outcomes, too. Remove Mr. Bush from the top slot and Mr. Carter bumps up. Remove Mr. Carter and Mr. Moore might slide up. The slope of perceived bias becomes impossible to avoid. 
 And over all, the engines, which return thousands or hundreds of thousands of links, offer up plenty of material for a discerning consumer to sift through. 
 But then, that's the rub. 
 While it's clear that ordinary users can band together and massage the outcome of a search, we remain, by and large, incredibly naive users of search engines. Numerous studies have shown that precious few sleuths go beyond the first page of search results. ''If it's not on the first page, it might as well be invisible,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
 We also take much at face value. In results released last year, the Nielsen Norman Group, which surveys Internet behavior, found that fewer than 1 percent of searchers avail themselves of the advanced search options available on most search engines. And the Pew Internet and American Life Project found last year that while most consumers can distinguish between regular programming and infomercials on TV, and between regular content and advertorials in print publications, only 38 percent of searchers were aware of a distinction between paid and unpaid results among search returns.
 Lee Rainie, the director of the Pew project, said that Web users were slowly becoming more sophisticated. 
 ''Information markets self-correct themselves the way economic markets do,'' he said, ''but there's that arbitrage period that can extend long periods of time.'' 
 Until then, though, the fast-growing industry known as search engine optimization -- the buzz of business brand managers, public relations gurus and now political assassins -- may well get the better of unsuspecting search engine users, in ways far more meaningful than ''miserable failure'' graffiti. 
 ''I've been so long involved in this that it can seem obvious,'' Mr. Sullivan said, referring to the ability to massage search results. ''I think there's just going to need to be some degree of growing up.''

Iraqi Court Sentences Hussein to Death
Three and a half years after American troops captured Baghdad and ended the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi court set up to judge the brutalities of his 24 years in power sentenced him to death by hanging after finding him guilty of crimes against humanity. A1

The death penalty for Mr. 
Hussein and two of his co-defendants brought jubilation to Shiite and Kurdish neighborhoods across Iraq, gloom to Sunni ones, and a political blessing for its current, embattled prime minister. A11

Taiwan's Leader Admits Lies
President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan admitted he submitted false receipts for reimbursement from public funds and lied to prosecutors about how he spent the money, but said he had done so in the interest of national security. A6

China Sets African Trade Deals
China and a number of African nations agreed on 16 trade and investment deals valued at $1.9 billion, as Beijing extended its efforts to create a broad economic and diplomatic partnership with Africa. A6

Nicaraguans Vote for Leader
Nicaraguans went to the polls to choose a new president in a five-way contest that primarily focused on one contender: Daniel Ortega, the former Marxist president who fought American-backed contras in a bloody war in the 1980s. A8

Israel Firm on Gaza Offensive
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel said the military would not halt its offensive in the northern Gaza Strip until Palestinian rocket fire toward Israel was reduced. A11

Snag for Kosovo Independence
The hopes of ethnic Albanians that Kosovo would be granted independence by the end of this year were placed in doubt as Secretary General Kofi Annan said a decision on the future of the United Nations-administered province could be delayed. A8

Turk Hints at Freer Speech
Prime Minister Recep Erdogan of Turkey signaled he was prepared to amend a law limiting free speech, a surprise move that was apparently an 11th-hour attempt to prevent a crisis with the European Union over Turkey's troubled membership talks. A8

NATIONAL A12-19

G.O.P. Finds Issues For Rallying Its Voters
President Bush seized on the sentencing of Saddam Hussein as a ''milestone'' in Iraq, seeking to rally Republican voters with the issue of national security as some polls suggested that his party might be making gains in the final hours of the campaign. The White House said the timing of the announcement, two days before Election Day, had nothing to do with American politics. A1

Campaigning Coast to Coast
To inspire his troops on the last big day of campaigning for the midterm elections, Representative Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican in his first term, pulled out a favorite weapon of Republican candidates in the same predicament: Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican whose reputation as a maverick makes him an appealing attraction. A17

In one of the tightest races in the country, Indiana's Ninth Congressional District, an important economic concern, high gasoline prices, has been somewhat alleviated in the past few weeks as the price at the pump has edged down. A17

A new poll, which queried 400 likely voters and was published by The Miami Herald, found that 49 percent said they preferred the Democratic challenger, State Senator Ron Klein, to Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. , who drew the support of 40 percent of respondents. A17

As volunteers lined up to carry the last paper sacks of leaflets into a web of suburbs to the west of Chicago, Iraq loomed over the tense race for the Congressional seat that is being vacated by Henry J. Hyde, a Republican. A17

Many Candidates Unopposed
Though the Democrats need only 15 seats to take control of the House, 34 House candidates (30 Democrats and 4 Republicans) have no opponent at all. A16

Minister Asks for Forgiveness
Thousands of people gathered at the Colorado Springs church whose founder, Ted Haggard, was dismissed for ''sexually immoral conduct.'' Speakers urged the church's members to find a way forward without recrimination or bitterness; a letter from Mr. Haggard was read from the 8,000-seat auditorium's center stage, urging forgivness for the Denver man who broke the story. A12

NEW YORK/REGION B1-8

Final Political Push Is Felt By Voters in New Jersey
Volunteers bounded from door to door, the airwaves filled with advertisements and carefully chosen political celebrities popped up across New Jersey as the state became a battlefield for both parties in the final days of the midterm campaign. With Democrats appearing within reach of gaining the six seats they need to take control of the United States Senate, New Jersey has become a focus of national attention. B1

State Republicans Cry Foul
Anticipating historic political losses in New York on Election Day, state Republican leaders are lashing out at the national party in Washington, saying it has exploited New York donors and missed opportunities against a prime target, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. They say that, despite pleas for help, they have been ignored in Washington. B1

Cigarette Trade in Jeopardy
The tax-free sale of steeply discounted cigarettes by the Shinnecock Indian Outpost in Southampton is what keeps the tribe alive. But now the cigarette trade is being threatened by both a federal lawsuit and an expected push by the New York State government, which estimates it loses $576 million a year in the sale of untaxed cigarettes. B1

Brooklyn Development Faulted
Even in Greenpoint-Williamsburg, an area familiar with growth and gentrification, the sweeping changes wrought by the city's rezoning have left many residents feeling dizzied, and there is a sense that the government has not moved fast enough to keep pace with developers. B1

HEADLINE: China and African Nations Set Trade Deals Worth $1.9 Billion

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
China and a number of African nations agreed Sunday on 16 trade and investment deals valued at $1.9 billion, as Beijing extended its efforts to create a broad economic and diplomatic partnership with Africa, a resource-rich continent.
 President Hu Jintao also pledged to extend $5 billion in loans and credits to Africa, forgive past debts and double foreign aid to the continent. 
The aid announcement and deal-making capped a weekend of meetings that brought high-level representatives of 48 of the 53 African countries to Beijing. It was an unusually sweeping diplomatic initiative by China, which until recently had tended to focus mainly on domestic development rather than overseas expansion.
 Though China supported socialist, postcolonial African leaders in Mao's time, it had largely withdrawn its attention from Africa in the 1980s and 1990s as it accelerated market-oriented growth at home.
 More recently, Mr. Hu has made cultivating new economic and diplomatic ties to Africa a foreign policy priority even as the United States concentrates on combating terrorism.
 Analysts say the main purpose is to secure supplies of natural resources, especially oil, iron ore and copper, for China's booming economy.
 China has also sought to build diplomatic support among African nations for its priorities at the United Nations and other world organizations, where it does not always see eye to eye with the United States. 
 The Chinese government has also pushed hard to reduce the number of countries that extend diplomatic recognition to its rival, Taiwan, and even invited the five African countries that have relations with Taiwan to its weekend meeting. The five did not attend.
 The official New China News Agency said the business deals with 11 African countries announced on Sunday covered infrastructure, telecommunications, insurance and mineral resources.
 On Saturday, Mr. Hu announced a broad aid package that included loans, debt relief and technical assistance. He said that China would provide $3 billion in preferential loans and $2 billion in preferential credits over the next three years and that by 2009 China's annual aid to Africa would be double the level this year. 
 ''Common destiny and common goals have brought us together,'' Mr. Hu said in a keynote speech.
 China's outreach to Africa has been criticized by some in the West for ignoring large human rights violations or serious corruption in countries that it has courted, including Sudan, Zimbabwe and Angola.
 Western and African economists have also complained that China's approach is reminiscent of a mercantilist strategy European nations once followed in Africa because it focuses on extracting natural resources and raw materials from Africa and selling finished manufactured goods back there. The critics say that approach does little to foster long-term economic development in the impoverished continent.
 The weekend forum, which consisted mostly of formal ceremonies, handshakes and elaborate banquets, did not completely address those concerns.
 Mr. Hu and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao did say they would act to encourage greater two-way trade with Africa. They said China would increase to 440 from 190 the number of African exports that would be allowed to enter China tariff free.
 They did not specify what items were on that list, but if they included more manufactured goods, the offer could dampen criticism that China does not do enough to promote African manufactured goods.
 The huge gathering, which attracted 1,700 official delegates and many other participants, also let China show how it could ensure smooth traffic flow and even shut down polluting industries to clean up the air during a giant event -- a preview of how it intends to handle the Olympics in 2008.
 Mr. Wen predicted that bilateral trade with African nations would top $100 billion by 2010. Trade between China and Africa increased tenfold over the past decade, reaching almost $40 billion last year, and is expected to reach $50 billion this year.

HEADLINE: Win, Lose or Draw, Bush Faces Unfamiliar Terrain

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
If the balance of political power in Washington changes on Tuesday, will President Bush change with it?
 From the moment Mr. Bush took office after winning the election but losing the popular vote, he has governed as if he became president by a landslide. Bad news -- legislative losses, plunging approval ratings, chaos in Iraq -- seems only to stiffen his resolve. Good news -- a dip in the unemployment rate, the conviction of Saddam Hussein -- reinforces his confidence that his polices at home and abroad are correct.
On the campaign trail, there is little to suggest that will change. ''My vision is clear,'' Mr. Bush likes to say. Vice President Dick Cheney echoed that theme on Sunday, giving a hint of Mr. Bush's attitude when asked by ABC News whether the election would alter Mr. Bush's Iraq policy. Mr. Cheney replied that there might be some effect in Congress. But the attitude in the White House, he said, would remain ''full speed ahead.''
 ''We're not running for office,'' the vice president said. ''We're doing what we think is right.'' 
 In recent weeks, President Bush, as well, has appeared to dig in his heels on the war in Iraq, saying he would consider changes in tactics but not strategy. 
 Yet with Mr. Bush facing the likelihood of a remade political landscape in Washington, even if his party holds on to both houses of Congress, the White House is sending signals that Mr. Bush is open to a shift in approach. After six years of virtually ignoring Democrats as he pressed his own party to do his bidding on Capitol Hill, Mr. Bush and his aides are charting a course that they say will take the president back to his roots as Texas governor, when he worked in a more bipartisan way with Democrats. 
 They are piecing together a domestic agenda that includes reviving the president's failed bid to overhaul entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, White House officials and allies of the administration said. The president has assigned Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to spearhead the effort, and the White House says it is quietly reaching out to Democrats on Capitol Hill.
 But it is not clear how much bipartisanship is possible, even if Mr. Bush proves serious about it. His approval numbers remain low, emboldening Democrats, who in any case are distrustful of him. The 2008 presidential campaign is about to start, complicating political calculations on both sides. Members of both parties say Mr. Bush will be unable to accomplish much at home until he gets Iraq under control. 
 Even so, Dan Bartlett, counselor to the president, said Mr. Bush was determined not to focus exclusively on foreign policy, as so many presidents have done in the final two years of a second term. 
 ''I think his hope,'' Mr. Bartlett said, ''is that maybe, maybe we can enter into an era where the president will not be viewed as such a threatening force to Democrats who are more eager to get some accomplishments done.'' 
 Mr. Bush enters the final phase of his presidency knowing his future depends on Tuesday's election and Iraq, both of which are largely beyond his control. No matter who controls Congress, he will have a more difficult time governing. 
 The situation is in stark contrast to the one two years ago, when Mr. Bush sounded ebullient about his prospects for a successful second term after defeating Senator John Kerry.
 ''Let me put it to you this way,'' Mr. Bush said at the time. ''I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it.''
 Today, the political capital Mr. Bush intended to spend is so vastly diminished that one longtime ally, the conservative organizer Paul M. Weyrich, estimated it at ''zero'' in an interview on Friday.
 A sense of poignancy has set in. Jetting about the country on Air Force One, Mr. Bush has been playing hearts and gin rummy with his longtime political adviser and confidant, Karl Rove; Mr. Rove usually wins. At each stop, the men share memories of where they were two years ago, or four, reminding themselves of Texas and happier campaigns gone by.
 ''Any time we're on the campaign plane, it's reminiscent of past elections,'' Mr. Bartlett said, recounting the card games. But he insisted that Mr. Bush was looking ahead, not back: ''There's no cruise control into '08 for this president. He believes that two years is a long time and a lot could get done.''
 Even if Republicans keep both chambers, there is universal agreement that they will do so with slimmer majorities, further reducing Mr. Bush's clout on Capitol Hill. 
 ''Obviously, his power is waning quickly,'' said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, a close ally of Mr. Bush. ''But it doesn't have to be that way if we have a bipartisan desire to tackle tough problems.''
 On the campaign trail, Mr. Bush has already been calling on Democrats to join him in reauthorizing the No Child Left Behind Act, his signature education legislation, which was passed with bipartisan support early in his first term. But Democrats who joined him the first time are wary, said Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the chief Democratic sponsor of the bill.
 ''It's all going to be decided by what the president does with the budget,'' Mr. Kennedy said.
 The last two years of a second term are challenging for any president. Bill Clinton, facing impeachment, spent most of his time traveling, devoting himself nearly exclusively to foreign policy. Harry Truman was stuck trying to explain a war on the Korean Peninsula that ended in stalemate, and it took years for his reputation to be restored. 
 For Mr. Bush, Iraq will loom over everything. His own aides concede they had once hoped that by Tuesday's midterm election, American troops would be steadily withdrawing from Iraq. Instead, 150,000 are still there. 
 ''The fortunes of his last two years, in terms of his own political capital, will very much be a part of what takes place in Iraq,'' said Senator Mel Martinez, a Republican from Florida who was housing secretary during Mr. Bush's first term. 
 But one of the biggest guessing games in Washington is whether Mr. Bush will seize the opportunity to act in ways he could not with an election looming. Robert Kagan, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote earlier this week that ''the preferred European scenario -- Bush hobbled -- is less likely than the alternative: Bush unbound.''
 Mr. Bush's first decision may be whether to move on Iraq before a report is issued by a bipartisan group led by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Lee H. Hamilton, the former congressman from Indiana. 
 Whatever Mr. Bush does, on either the foreign policy or the domestic front, comes with the knowledge that the clock is ticking. As Mr. Bartlett spoke in his West Wing office Thursday afternoon, a digital ''countdown clock,'' distributed to the president's closest aides by Joshua B. Bolten, the White House chief of staff, revealed precisely how much time, at that moment, remained in Mr. Bush's term: 809 days, 21 hours, 21 minutes and 42 seconds.

HEADLINE: A Race for Every Vote (Left to Cast, That Is)

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BELLEVUE, Wash., Nov. 5 

 BODY:
In Darcy Burner's final rush of campaign advertisements, she compares her opponent to President Bush and says he is out of touch with his constituents on the war and social issues. Ms. Burner's opponent, Representative Dave Reichert, is running advertisements saying she lacks experience, dodges difficult questions and wants to raise taxes. 
 Yet even as the tight race intensifies between Ms. Burner, a Democrat and former Microsoft executive with little political experience, and Mr. Reichert, the first-term Republican she is challenging in the Eighth Congressional District, it is also closer to over than many others across the country.
Both campaigns said Sunday that up to 40 percent of voters here had already sent in their ballots, taking advantage of the state's mail-in voting option, and that more than 70 percent were expected to do so by Election Day, leaving a small fraction to show up at the polls on Tuesday.
 ''Hitting them all at this point just annoys them,'' Ms. Burner said Sunday as she visited homes in this affluent suburb of Seattle that her campaign had pinpointed as potentially supportive. ''So we're trying to be considerate and productive.''
 Mr. Reichert spent part of Sunday ringing doorbells but said he had also worked lines at the many Starbucks in his district, which pushes south and east from the more politically moderate Bellevue to rural areas where Republicans are strongest.
 Mr. Reichert, who holds a narrow lead over Ms. Burner in most polls, said voters had told him they were concerned about the war, immigration and the federal budget. 
 Ms. Burner, however, said Mr. Reichert was ''fiscally irresponsible and socially conservative,'' out of step with his well-educated, technologically savvy constituents on social and economic issues like abortion, stem-cell research and the minimum wage. 
 The congressman, after initially opposing embryonic stem-cell research, changed his position this year, going against President Bush. A campaign spokeswoman, Kimberly Cadena, said the shift was not politically motivated, adding, ''It's based on his heart and what the science he found told him.'' WILLIAM YARDLEY

HEADLINE: National Issues, Led by Iraq, Dominate Final Appeals In Congressional Campaigns

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON CROSSING, Pa., Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Representative Michael G. Fitzpatrick, a Republican in his first term, came here on Sunday to show off what in any other year would have been the perfect symbol of why to re-elect a congressman: a cornfield that thanks largely to his efforts would soon become a national veterans cemetery, close to the place where Gen. George Washington rescued the morale of his troops and the nation with his Christmas attack of 1776.
 But this year, with morale sagging in a different war, Mr. Fitzpatrick finds himself in a tough battle of his own, trying to distance himself from President Bush -- even on a day when the conviction of Saddam Hussein was announced in Baghdad -- without turning off the staunch Republican voters he needs to hold back his opponent, an antiwar Democrat and Iraq war veteran named Patrick Murphy. 
So, to rally his troops on the last big day of campaigning for the midterm elections, Mr. Fitzpatrick pulled out a favorite weapon of Republican candidates in the same predicament: Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, whose reputation as an outspoken maverick makes him an appealing attraction here in the Eighth Congressional District, where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats but voters have chosen Democrats for president in recent years.
 Mr. McCain hailed Mr. Fitzpatrick as an independent voice, one who ''represents the next generation of our party and of our nation'' and ''an independent who will reach across the aisle when necessary.''
 But Mr. McCain acknowledged voters' frustration with the war, as well as his own. 
 ''It's long and it's hard and it's tough,'' he told a group of veterans, as Mr. Fitzpatrick stood behind him in the sunshine of a crisp fall day. ''And a lot of mistakes have been made in the conduct of the war, and we're paying a very heavy price for it.''
 ''But my friends, we are there today,'' he added. ''And I'm convinced that if we set a date for withdrawal, as some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to do, I think you're going to see chaos in the region.''
 A few towns away, Mr. Murphy rallied other veterans alongside Representative John P. Murtha, the conservative Pennsylvania Democrat whose turnabout on Iraq a year ago has made him his party's face of opposition to the war.
 ''They say we're going to win, we're going to have a victory; they say we're going to have democracy,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''Well let me tell you, that's not a strategy, that's a goal. And there's no strategy. The strategy is stay the course. Even though they say it's not stay the course, that's what they've been saying -- his opponent has been saying stay the course. That doesn't work.''
 Both candidates had lost their voices after a weekend of rallies featuring the luminaries of their national parties: Mr. McCain for Mr. Fitzpatrick, and Mr. Murtha, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Vice President Al Gore for Mr. Murphy.
 Like Republicans across the country, Mr. Fitzpatrick, a former county commissioner, has tried to make the campaign about local issues. He accuses Mr. Murphy, who grew up in northeast Philadelphia, on the edge of the district, of moving here only to run for Congress. In a debate, he asked him how many school districts Bucks County had, leaving Mr. Murphy flustered when he could not answer.
 ''Why are we voting for Mike?'' an organizer shouted to the veterans at the Fitzpatrick rally. Then he answered himself: ''He's one of us!''
 At a boilermakers' hall, a busload of Harvard students had come for the weekend to volunteer for Mr. Murphy because he impressed them in a speech last year as a young voice for change. And at 33, he looks younger than some of them. He has no experience in elective office. But by talking about the war he saw up close, and arguing, as he did in a closing advertisement, that ''George Bush and Mike Fitzpatrick have no idea how to fix this mess,'' Mr. Murphy has pulled himself up in the polls.
 Sunday morning, he told volunteers he was five points ahead in his own poll.
 ''But polls don't vote,'' he reminded them, urging them to motivate other voters. ''We're on the crest of greatness. Let's just go execute and make it happen.''
 At the rally with Mr. McCain, Joe Amodei, a 75-year-old Korean War veteran, lamented Mr. Fitzpatrick's position in a bad year for Republicans. ''If it was just him against the other guy, and no outside national issues, he'd walk away with it,'' Mr. Amodei said. ''His opponent has made it about larger issues. If he made it about the county, he'd have no chance to win.''
 Across the country, candidates clashed Sunday over the war, immigration, the economy, ethics and the Bush administration, seeking advantage in the closing hours of an election that will determine control of the House and the Senate. With Mr. Hussein's death sentence injecting a late new element into the debate, Republicans sought to limit their losses and Democrats argued the need for change in Washington, as tens of thousands of volunteers on each side went door to door to rally voters.

HEADLINE: On the Road Again, a Sensitive Singer-Songwriter (and One-Man Band)

BYLINE: By ALAN LIGHT

 BODY:
At one point in James Taylor's show on his current One Man Band tour, which stops at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan on Thursday and Friday, he brings out a drum machine he built himself. No, he hasn't turned into some kind of electronics wizard, and he's not doing a hip-hop remix of ''Carolina in My Mind'' either.
 ''When people think of a drum machine, they think of something that's made up of bits and bytes,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''but I designed and built this Rube Goldberg thing, this big, kinetic sculpture -- bigger than a piano. It's a revolving drum with big fins attached to the outside that activate and actually play the drums for four bars. It scared the hell out of me the first time we used it, but it works great.'' 
Though it has been decades since Mr. Taylor went on the road as a solo act -- well, almost solo; he's accompanied onstage by the pianist Larry Goldings -- he wanted to do something more than just sit on a stool and play his songs. ''I needed things in between, stories, film,'' he said. ''So we've tried to enhance the show and leaven it. But we did it all locally, with friends and family. We didn't call Las Vegas and ask the Cirque du Soleil expert to come in. It gives it a certain shabbiness, but a certain cohesion too.''
 The One Man Band performances offer a look back at the career of an artist who, perhaps more than anyone else, defined the image of the solitary singer-songwriter. Mr. Taylor, 58, has been enjoying working at this smaller scale again and said he felt liberated to find new ways to approach old songs. ''I'm playing my first electric guitar solo in 30 years,'' he said with a laugh. 
 On an unseasonably warm afternoon recently, Mr. Taylor sipped coffee in his publicist's Manhattan office and removed a vest from over a well-worn mock turtleneck jersey. His conversation is much like his songs, soft-spoken and deliberate. It was John Lennon's birthday, and Mr. Taylor fondly reminisced about his days as the first artist signed to the Beatles' Apple Records in 1968. (When he made his first record, he shared the studio with the Beatles, working by day as they were making the album almost universally referred to as ''The White Album'' through the night.) 
 Mr. Taylor seemed excited, even a bit relieved, about his solo tour. ''It's how I started, and it has an immediacy and an intimacy,'' he said. ''When we go out with a 12-man band with horns and singers, it depends on a certain economy of scale. But when I'm playing to 15,000 people, there's some question of how far you can expand yourself. A lot of these songs are well placed in a smaller venue, and there's something very calibrating about just playing with piano and guitar.''
 There are two new Taylor releases in stores: out today is ''A MusiCares Person of the Year Tribute Honoring James Taylor,'' a concert on DVD that will also be broadcast on Nov. 29 as part of the ''Great Performances'' series on PBS. ''James Taylor at Christmas,'' a slightly expanded version of an album he put out exclusively through Hallmark stores last year, was released last month. 
 ''We did 'Jingle Bells' as a blues, 'Baby, It's Cold Outside' with a Latin, bossa nova thing,'' he said. It also includes his version of Joni Mitchell's ''River,'' a song recently covered on new albums by Sarah McLachlan and Madeleine Peyroux.
 The tribute concert, filmed at the MusiCares ''Person of the Year'' dinner in February, features artists including Bruce Springsteen, the Dixie Chicks, Sheryl Crow and Sting performing Mr. Taylor's songs. Mr. Taylor himself sings three songs, including ''Fire and Rain.''
 He said he was extremely skeptical about the idea at first. ''This isn't football,'' he said, ''and one of the reasons I do it is that it's not a competitive sport.'' But as the lineup came together and the evening progressed, he said he felt ''very bucked up, very encouraged and supported by the entire endeavor.''
 He singled out Mr. Springsteen's performance of the song ''Millworker'' -- a relative obscurity, taken from the 1978 Broadway show ''Working'' -- as a standout. ''His version was much more fierce and furious, where my version is more resigned and a little more whimsical,'' Mr. Taylor said.
 In his introduction Mr. Springsteen called Mr. Taylor ''an authentic Southern voice.'' It's a surprising characterization: Mr. Taylor grew up in North Carolina but has become very much identified with New England, especially the Boston area, where he lives. ''I think he wanted to say that there was something other than country-western music that comes out of the South,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''There's also Stephen Foster and William Faulkner and William Styron -- not that I put myself in that league.''
 It's been four years since ''October Road,'' Mr. Taylor's last new album, and he's starting to think about his next project, which he hopes to have out in a year or so. ''I've got a lot of starts on songs I'm feeling pretty excited about,'' he said. ''I think I'd like to keep it pretty spare this time. That seems to be working for me these days.''

HEADLINE: To Prevent Amputations, Doctors Call for Aggressive Care

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH SVOBODA

 BODY:
After leaving her job at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, Elaine Fry mapped out her life as an active retiree: daily outdoor excursions, meetings with friends, cross-country trips.
 But as her legs inexplicably began retaining more and more fluid, swelling like ripening melons, just leaving her bedroom became a struggle. Last year, an ulcer appeared on her bloated right calf, with an infection that festered for months and turned the surrounding tissue black. Her doctor confirmed her worst fears: an above-the-knee amputation was the only option.
Following the surgery, Ms. Fry, now 63, sold her house and went to live with her daughter, her son-in-law and their four children in a basement apartment of their Columbia, Md., home that she describes as ''not wheelchair friendly.'' 
 ''Before, if I wanted to go to the bookstore or grocery store, I could,'' she said. ''But now, my daughter can't just drop everything and do whatever I want to do. Losing my independence has been really hard.'' 
 Ms. Fry's story is a surprisingly common one, though amputation is often stereotypically viewed as a side effect of war, not a consequence of disease. About 1.8 million Americans have had amputations; every year, more than 100,000 non-accident-related, lower-limb amputations are performed in the United States.
 The high numbers have prompted the medical community to debate whether most foot and leg amputations can be prevented -- and, if so, how.
 Dr. Karel Bakker, a foot specialist who is a chairman of the International Diabetes Federation, believes that more effective foot care and patient education strategies would render up to 85 percent of these procedures unnecessary. Lower-limb ulcers are the most reliable harbingers of future amputation: according to a study published earlier this year in the journal Diabetes Care, nearly 9 in 10 nontraumatic foot and leg amputations come after the development of these infected sores, which can spread and quickly destroy surrounding tissue.
 Some of these amputations, like Ms. Fry's, can be traced to ulcers resulting from edema or other conditions that affect blood flow to the lower extremities. Others -- as many as 60 percent, according to some estimates -- are due to a common complication of diabetes: lower-limb numbness resulting from nerve damage from the disease.
 Dr. Michael S. Pinzur, an orthopedic surgeon at Loyola University in Chicago, has had diabetes patients who have lost so much sensation in their feet that they have been oblivious to large objects, like cigarette lighters or toy trucks, that have gotten lodged in their shoes. 
 ''Normally, if you've got something as small as an ingrown toenail, you feel it,'' Dr. Pinzur said. ''These people can't feel it.'' 
 Because there is no pain to alert them to potential danger, these patients often continue walking on increasingly sore, infected legs until they resemble hunks of raw meat.
 With proper education, observation and follow-up care, Dr. Bakker argues, most patients at high risk of amputation could be healed before reaching the point of no return. He envisions an across-the-board protocol of aggressive wound care that would function a little like early-stage cancer treatment, vanquishing relatively minor sores and irritations before they have a chance to become something more serious. 
 ''Some people do go to clinics for their ulcers and have them treated, but there often isn't any follow-up,'' he says. ''There's no good recall system. If you have an ulcer, you should really be seen every three months.'' 
 At present, he points out, only 14 percent of general practitioners perform foot exams during yearly patient visits. He hopes this percentage will increase greatly as doctors become more aware of the benefits of preventive foot care, which includes checking the feet for redness, cuts and sores.
 The World Health Organization has also lobbied for better preventive foot care to eliminate the need for amputations. 
 ''Any amputation, especially for conditions like diabetes, is a human tragedy and a gross failure of public health efforts,'' said Dr. Robert Beaglehole, W.H.O.'s director of chronic diseases and health promotion. ''We are failing desperately to prevent the most preventable conditions.''
 Dr. Pinzur, however, thinks it is unrealistic to expect the levels of patient compliance needed to achieve the results that Dr. Bakker and Dr. Beaglehole envision. Many diabetics, he notes, have difficulty learning to administer proper wound care, and many other patients do not follow doctors' orders or show up for scheduled visits. '' ''One-on-one patient education is really the only solution,'' he said.
 But Dr. Vivian Ho, an economist at Rice University, said that raising awareness about amputation danger signs among patients and doctors only addresses part of the problem. Her 2005 analysis of Medicare claims data showed that adding one vascular surgeon for every 33,000 Medicare beneficiaries in a region yielded a 1.6 percent decrease in amputations.
 These results suggest that in many poor or rural regions of the United States, there simply are not enough specialists available to perform foot- and leg-saving procedures. 
 ''Whether or not you have an amputation is a function of who you get sent to,'' Dr. Ho said. ''If there are only six vascular specialists in the entire state, many patients won't get told to see a vascular surgeon at all.'' 
 While general practitioners are trained to perform amputations, they are not usually qualified to perform complex limb-saving operations like bypasses or balloon angioplasties.
 Economically and socially marginalized groups, Dr. Ho adds, get the shortest shrift in the amputation lottery. Among diabetics in North America, Hispanics and African-Americans are 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely than whites to undergo lower limb amputations. ''There's no advocacy group for this condition the way there is for something like breast cancer,'' she said. ''It's a disease of the lower class.'' 
 Dr. Ho argues that Medicare reimbursement rates in underserved regions should be raised to create an economic incentive for specialists to move to those areas.
 ''There's correlation between the supply of specialists and how attractive an area is in terms of culture and economy -- all the factors you'd find in the Places Rated Almanac,'' she said. ''But doctors will respond to higher rates. Anywhere dollar signs come into play, you'll see an effect.''
 Some physicians, though, think Dr. Ho's focus on the drought of specialists is misguided. ''The obvious answer is, 'Let's get everyone to see a vascular surgeon,' but that won't solve anything,'' Dr. Pinzur said. ''Vascular surgeons only start seeing patients at the point when they already have nonhealing ulcers, and at that point a lot of the damage has been done.''
 Even in areas where specialists are plentiful, said Dr. Herbert Dardik, chief of vascular surgery at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in New Jersey, doctors may be performing amputations that are not absolutely necessary. 
 ''Doctors have to decide whether to spend three or four hours doing a complicated salvage procedure, or 35 minutes for a short, quick amputation,'' he said.
 Still, doctors caution against viewing amputation as something to be avoided at all costs. ''Some people say: 'If you take my leg off, my life is over. I'm going to die' '' Dr. Pinzur said. ''But it's not a black-or-white issue. You always have to ask, 'Will a salvage outperform an amputation in this case?' '' 
 One of Dr. Pinzur's patients, vehemently opposed to amputation, had been in and out of the hospital for years as a recurring infection smoldered in his foot. 
 ''Finally he said, 'Enough is enough,' '' Dr. Pinzur said, ''and two weeks after his amputation, he was walking around with a prosthesis and asking, 'Why did I wait so long?' ''
 For Elaine Fry, the recovery process has been slower -- just healing her surgical wound took several months. 
 A year after surgery, she has been attending physical therapy to get used to a recently fitted prosthesis and has been learning to drive with a left-leg accelerator pedal. 
 ''I'm looking forward to doing all the things I used to do,'' she said.

HEADLINE: China to Pass U.S. in 2009 In Emissions 

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Jad Mouawad contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
China will surpass the United States in 2009, nearly a decade ahead of previous predictions, as the biggest emitter of the main gas linked to global warming, the International Energy Agency has concluded in a report to be released Tuesday.
 China's rise, fueled heavily by coal, is particularly troubling to climate scientists because as a developing country, China is exempt from the Kyoto Protocol's requirements for reductions in emissions of global warming gases. Unregulated emissions from China, India and other developing countries are likely to account for most of the global increase in carbon dioxide emissions over the next quarter-century.
The agency's prediction highlights the unexpected speed with which China is emerging as the biggest contributor to global warming. Still, China has resisted limits on its own emissions and those of other developing countries.
 Up until now, Chinese officials have instead called repeatedly for even tighter limits on the industrialized countries' emissions of global warming gases after the Kyoto Protocol's limits expire at the end of 2012. China says rich countries bear responsibility for the increase in global carbon dioxide levels that has already taken place. 
 Moreover, the biggest current emitter of the gases, the United States, has rejected the protocol in part because most lawmakers and President Bush say its exemption for rising powers like China is unfair.
 ''You cannot tell people who are struggling to earn enough to eat that they need to reduce their emissions,'' said Lu Xuedu, the deputy director general of Chinese Office of Global Environmental Affairs, at a conference two weeks ago.
 Chinese officials did not respond to attempts by phone and fax to obtain a response to the agency's forecast.
 The energy agency also issued a sharp exhortation to all oil-consuming countries to rapidly curb their consumption or face higher prices and severe environmental damage, including changes in the global climate. But the agency acknowledged that any conservation would require a ''considerable political push'' from Western governments, as well as large developing economies like China and India, to reduce their use of hydrocarbons, including coal. 
 If nothing is done, global energy demand is projected to grow 53 percent by 2030, the energy agency said. Oil consumption is seen jumping to 116 million barrels a day, compared with 85 million barrels now, mostly because of increased oil consumption in developing countries. 
 Demand for coal, mostly for power generation, will rise 59 percent. As a result, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will increase 55 percent, to 44.1 billion tons in 2030. 
 Environmental officials from around the world began meeting Monday in Nairobi to discuss a new agreement after the Kyoto Protocol. The talks, which are not expected to produce an agreement for at least a couple of years, are aimed partly at bringing the larger developing countries like China, India and Brazil under emission controls.
 Developing countries have been wary of a deal. In addition to the United States, Australia has rejected the Kyoto Protocol, while Canada and Western European countries have found that their emissions have risen since 1990, instead of falling as the agreement required. The rise is particularly notable since 2000, according to fresh United Nations data.
 Among developing countries, ''there has been a loss of confidence, if I may say, since the developed countries, and particularly the largest ones, have not done more,'' said Rajendra K. Pachauri, India's best-known energy expert and the chairman of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
 ''They're going to shift the burden on us -- that's the popular view,'' he said in a phone interview from New Delhi before flying to Nairobi.
 The agency advocates improving the fuel efficiency of cars, expanding the use of nuclear power and financing biofuels research. It said those measures would more than pay for themselves by reducing oil imports. 
 ''If we stick with business-as-usual policies, we are ending up with a world which is vulnerable, dirty and expensive,'' Fatih Birol, the agency's chief economist, said in an interview.
 Investments needed to meet world growth in demand by 2030 are in the order of $20 trillion, the report estimated. But aggressive energy conservation policies could limit the increased oil demand to 103 million barrels a day by 2030. If that was done, carbon dioxide emissions would be 16 percent lower.
 China has taken steps to improve energy conservation, though it has justified them mainly in terms of limiting reliance on imported oil and reducing air pollution. China has set fuel-economy requirements for new cars that are more stringent than the United States', but less stringent than the European Union's. 
 China has also begun requiring power companies to invest in larger coal-fired power plants instead of smaller power plants, which tend to require more coal per kilowatt-hour generated.
 The energy agency took these steps into account in its prediction that China's carbon dioxide emissions would overtake those of the United States some time in 2009.Mr. Birol said consumer nations would face even greater risks to their supplies because of their growing reliance on energy imports from a smaller number of countries, mainly in the Middle East. Domestic oil production in Western countries will peak in the next five or six years and then decline.
 Worldwide coal consumption has risen as much in the last three years as it had in the previous 23 years, Mr. Birol said. China accounts for 90 percent of the increase, the result of steeply rising demand for electricity that is mostly generated by coal-fired power plants.
 India is responsible for about 8 percent of the increase in coal use, and the United States for most of the rest, Mr. Birol said. The agency's forecast of China's carbon dioxide emissions also reflects a revised prediction that China's economy will grow 5.5 percent a year over the next quarter-century, slightly higher than previously expected, which will result in higher energy use.
 ''Strong policy action is needed to move the world onto a more sustainable growth path,'' the agency said in a statement with the report. 
 Carbon dioxide accounts for 80 percent of the world's manmade emissions of global warming gases. A variety of gases from industrial processes, plus methane from landfills and coal mines, account for the rest of these emissions; China's emissions of those gases is growing rapidly as well.
 The global warming effects of China's rapidly increasing carbon dioxide emissions may have been masked until now by the country's high emissions of sulfur compounds, which form particles that reflect the sun's rays back into space. But the particles do not stay in the air nearly as long as the carbon dioxide, and China is now trying to reduce sulfur compounds because they cause acid rain and respiratory problems.
 ''Like the tortoise versus the hare, the carbon dioxide wins out in the long run,'' said Stephen E. Schwartz, a senior atmospheric scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y.
 China is not alone in relying more on coal. The United States is counting on coal to fill its growing energy needs. And while Western European nations have been the most enthusiastic advocates of measures to address global warming, they have also started moving back to coal.
 Britain has reopened several coal-fired power plants and imported coal lately because generating electricity from coal is much cheaper now than using oil or natural gas. Japan and Germany have both embarked on ambitious construction programs for new coal-fired plants as well.
 A British government spokesman acknowledged that British coal consumption was rising, but noted that British coal users were offsetting the increase in carbon dioxide emissions by paying energy users elsewhere in the European Union to cut emissions.
 But critics of this carbon trading plan say that European countries have estimated existing carbon dioxide emissions so high that it is easy for companies to come in below those levels and then declare that they have reduced emissions and therefore have credits to sell.
 Myron Ebell, the director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a research group in Washington that is critical of limits on global warming emissions and receives financing from energy companies, said China's rapid rise would further hurt international efforts to rein in global warming gases.
 ''It's not just China that's blowing this thing apart,'' he said. ''I don't see the Europeans cutting their emissions at all.''

HEADLINE: Committed to Coal, And in a Hurry, Too 

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Tex. 

 BODY:
In a huge pit, gigantic bulldozers and earth-moving machines are removing two layers of coal, the last shavings in a monumental task that has dug 200 feet down and expanded across 20 square miles over the last 35 years. 
 The coal feeds two plants nearby that help keep the lights on and the air-conditioners humming throughout Texas. But in doing so, the operation has released hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide, the main contributor to global warming.
Now, the pit's owner, the TXU Corporation, is embarking on its next monumental task: the nation's single largest coal-oriented construction campaign, with a plan to add more than 9,000 megawatts of new capacity, the equivalent of 3.5 percent of the nation's current coal-fired capacity. That is enough to power millions of homes, using coal from other giant pits like this one and still more in Wyoming. 
 Even as some utility executives are joining environmentalists in seeing future controls on carbon emissions as inevitable, TXU is betting that it can beat the consensus, placing a $10 billion wager on 11 new coal power plants that will produce copious amounts of global warming gases for decades to come. 
 [On Monday, TXU announced that in addition to 9,000 megawatts of capacity in Texas, it is considering 7,000 to 14,000 more megawatts of capacity in other parts of the country, possibly including the Northeast and Midwest, which would make it a national player in the industry.]
 Maybe this is good energy-system planning, or maybe it is environmental brinksmanship, outsiders say. 
 For people who want to limit global warming gases, the moves by TXU, which is based in Dallas, are a reminder that outside the laboratories and hearing rooms where scientists and policy makers talk about limiting carbon emissions, some power companies are racing to build infrastructure that will put carbon into the atmosphere into the middle of this century or longer.
 Whatever the cost to the ecosystem, it could be an immensely profitable bet. Company executives say the plants will provide cheap electricity for Texas, make lots of money for shareholders, conserve more valuable natural gas and reduce the pollutants that make smog.
 [Perhaps in a recognition of the growing concern over emissions, TXU also said Monday that the new plants would have room for construction of additions intended to capture carbon dioxide. Moreover, it said it was conducting research on oxygen firing, chilled ammonia and other technologies to capture carbon.]
 But outside groups, including Public Citizen, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and the Natural Resources Defense Council say that TXU is embarking on its immense construction campaign without taking account of its role in an emerging environmental catastrophe.
 Unlike California, which has long taken the lead among states in advancing energy efficiency and is now moving to curb carbon emissions by those supplying electricity to the state, Texas has no goals for cutting carbon emissions. Indeed, the state's Republican governor, Rick Perry, who has received campaign support from companies that burn or ship coal, has fast-tracked coal permit applications from TXU and other companies.
 Kathy Walt, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry, said all permit applications were subject to the same environmental standards. If donors were trying to seek favor in official decisions, she said, ''they'd be better off sending their money elsewhere.'' 
 TXU is not building natural gas plants, which would throw off half as much in carbon emissions as coal plants. In fact, the new plants might sideline some gas plants. The company is considering building a small number of nuclear reactors, which do not produce carbon. It is not aggressively pushing energy conservation, which many see as the cheapest way to satisfy the needs of business and consumers. 
 Instead, company executives insist that the only technology that is proved to be reliable and economical and can be built fast enough to keep the air conditioners from going out on hot summer afternoons is old-fashioned pulverized coal. 
 Some independent experts, like Ernest J. Moniz, co-chairman of the Energy Research Council at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former under secretary of energy in the Clinton administration, agree that for now coal is the most attractive fuel. And the traditional pulverized coal-burning plant may be the best way to make electricity -- adding carbon capture later on -- instead of coal gasification, which is favored by environmentalists.
 If new rules ultimately impose controls on emissions, environmentalists say, TXU seems to be betting that restrictions will not apply to plants that are already up and running; environmental groups say that TXU's ambitious coal construction plan is intended to be built and running before any new rules go into effect.
 ''Either it is plain old denial,'' said Ralph Cavanagh, an electricity specialist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, ''or they think they can be grandfathered'' so that any regulation does not apply to their existing plants.
 If it won such an exemption, then not only would TXU be able to operate carbon-dioxide-emitting plants, but it might eventually close the plants or clean up their emissions and sell its rights to produce emissions to other companies, for cash.
 It is not a wild theory, electricity experts say, and they point to the regulations that took effect in the 1990s on emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. The federal government handed out allowances, or permission to emit a certain amount of the chemical, in proportion to how much the plants produced before the law took effect.
 The government also put a cap on total emissions, and set it progressively lower in future years, permitting companies to trade their allowances so that the goal was achieved most efficiently. By installing scrubbers that captured the sulfur, companies could free the allowances they were given, and then sell them. One result was to give existing polluters an advantage over new-plant builders, who often had to pay cash for the right to pollute. 
 TXU executives deny any such calculation. ''There's not some game theory here around carbon,'' said Mike McCall, the chief executive of TXU Wholesale, which is planning the company's construction campaign. 
 Mr. McCall said building extra coal plants to get in ahead of a new rule was impractical. No one wants to build plants that will sit idle if there is too much capacity. 
 Not that he worries much that any new plant in Texas will sit idle. The population of Texas is booming, and the average new house is 2,500 square feet, often with 11-foot ceilings, in a climate where air-conditioners run around the clock for three and a half months a year. 
 Nationally, the industry expects 19 percent growth over the next decade; in Texas, it is 25 percent. The state's peak electric demand grew 5 percent last summer, compared with the summer before.
 Environmentalists are fighting TXU's plans and some elected officials have echoed their concerns. But the builders are plowing ahead and raising the specter of rotating blackouts in 100-degree heat unless the plants are built.
 ''It wouldn't be the regulator or politician that would have egg on their face if this market failed,'' Mr. McCall said, ''it would be us.''
 TXU says it is also adding wind power and has tentative plans for nuclear reactors. But it dismisses a newer variant, gasified coal, as untested and too expensive despite the view of many experts that it would be easier to adapt later to capture carbon emissions.
 Indeed, for the most part TXU is choosing the technology that will produce the cheapest power consistent with existing environmental regulations. The new plants planned by TXU and others operate at higher temperatures and pressures, and thus wring a few more kilowatt-hours of electricity from each ton of coal. With scrubbers, filters and catalytic converters, the new plants will be a lot cleaner than the smog-producing conventional ones. 
 In fact, at the plant in this city of about 3,500 people roughly 80 miles south of Dallas, the twin stacks called Big Brown are so filtered already that it is difficult to tell if the boilers are running from a distance.
 To sweeten the deal, TXU has promised that it will cut its overall emissions of smog-forming pollutants and soot by 20 percent. That means a 70 percent cut from existing plants, although it would eventually have had to make some of those improvements anyway.
 Part of the motivation for coal is that the new plants will do more than meet new demand; they will also displace old plants that run on natural gas. With Texas far more gas-dependent than other states, it was hit hard by the tripling of natural gas prices in recent years.
 Wind is an even cleaner alternative than natural gas. Texas recently surpassed California as the nation's No. 1 producer of wind energy. And wind sells well here, according to Gillan Taddune, the chief environmental officer for the Green Mountain Energy Company, which sells electricity from wind to homeowners. But all the windmills in Texas amount to only one-third the capacity of one midsize coal boiler. Windmills do not run as many hours of the year as coal boilers, either, and they tend to be particularly lackluster on hot summer afternoons, when electricity is needed the most.
 Coal plants, on the other hand, are available to meet load more than 90 percent of the time when needed. The result is that wind can be used to save fuel in fossil-fired plants, but the coal- or natural-gas-fired plants have to be built anyway, according to system planners. 
 With costly natural gas, long construction times for nuclear plants (and some uncertainty about their costs) and the unpredictable wind, that leaves mostly coal, utility officials say. ''We seem to have a good case for it,'' said William Bojorquez, director of system planning for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. The council operates Texas's power grid.
 Tom Smith, the director of Public Citizen in Texas and a longtime activist on electricity issues, said that Texas was missing an opportunity, however, both to save money and help protect the environment. ''There's cheaper, cleaner and cooler ways to provide the energy,'' he said. If Texas householders used electricity as efficiently as those in New York and California, he said, the need for new power plants could be cut by half.

HEADLINE: Time to Consider Motel 5.5?

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Al Moran, a sales director for PCT International, a supplier to the telecommunications industry, spends 90 percent of his time traveling on business. But he says he is one of the few executives at his company maintaining a heavy travel schedule. 
 To economize, Mr. Moran, based in Chicago, is downgrading his choice of hotels. ''Others are cutting back because of the cost,'' he said. ''Regional sales people are doing day trips rather than overnight trips, and cutting down their number of days on the road.''
 Mr. Moran and his colleagues may not be alone. Some hotel analysts are predicting a potential downturn in the fortunes of hotel companies, which have charged record rates and achieved high occupancy levels in the last few years, after precipitous declines in both in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 Bjorn Hanson, a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers, forecasts that growth in per capita demand among business travelers will increase only 0.8 percent this year, after rises of 3.4 percent in 2004 and 2.6 percent in 2005. 
 Mr. Hanson says the numbers indicate that ''the industry is entering the mature phase of this cycle.'' He also forecasts that per capita demand for hotel rooms among leisure travelers, which rose 2 percent in 2004 and 0.5 percent in 2005, will decline 0.3 percent this year.
 Steven Kent, lodging analyst at Goldman Sachs, has reduced his rating on hotel stocks from attractive to neutral because, he wrote in a report last month, growth in revenue for each available room will slow down next year. His prediction is based in part on forecasts of a broader pause in the economy. ''There are early indications that supply will begin to increase,'' he said, ''and the stocks have had a good run in their fourth year of positive outperformance.'' 
 Although other industry analysts and hotel companies remain quite bullish about the companies' prospects -- suggesting they count on business travelers' continued willingness to pay high rates -- Marriott acknowledges that it cannot predict the booking and spending habits of individual business travelers like Mr. Moran and his colleagues.
 Mr. Hanson noted that ''demand growth continues to exceed increases in supply.'' But he cited factors leading to slower growth in demand among business travelers, including stricter corporate policies and heightened traveler concerns about airport security.
 Also dampening business travel demand, he said, are rising hotel rates. The average daily rate increased 5.4 percent nationwide from 2004 to 2005, he said, and will rise to an expected $97.16 this year, from $82.71 in 2002. 
 Mr. Hanson says the current slowing growth in demand for business travel is, with the exception of declines immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, the greatest the hotel industry has had since the 1980s.
 ''The fact that business travel demand growth is slowing means that hotels' pricing power may peak this year,'' he said. ''As companies respond to increased travel costs, they will try to limit travel and negotiate hotel rates more aggressively.'' 
 In his report, Mr. Kent said he expected hotel demand to slow ''as a result of decelerating G.D.P. growth and corporate profit growth beginning in 2007.'' 
 He added: ''Our economic research team is currently forecasting G.D.P. growth of 3.3 percent in 2006, with a sharp deceleration in 2007 to just 2.2 percent growth. We calculate the demand growth trend line for hotels could decelerate to 1.3 percent in 2007, from 3.1 percent in 2005 and 1.9 percent year to date in 2006.''
 Mr. Kent said Goldman Sachs also estimated that corporate profit would be flat to slightly down in 2007, ''off a strong 2006 performance of up 18.9 percent.'' In the past, he said, companies have cut travel budgets after a slowdown in their operating profits.
 Mr. Kent also said that in 2008, the demand for hotel rooms and the supply would be equal, meaning ''the hotel companies' ability to push rates will not be as powerful.''
 ''Over the past nine months,'' he said, ''we have seen more significant pipeline increase in Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., New York, Boston and Miami, and we are seeing more significant pipeline increases for the full-service Marriott, InterContinental, Sheraton and Westin hotel brands.'' 
 Not surprisingly, many hotel executives and some industry experts disagreed with such forecasts. Matt Hart, president and chief operating officer of Hilton Hotels, said his company had ''seen very strong demand and is expecting continued strong demand for next year.''
 Hilton forecasts an increase of 7 to 9 percent next year in revenue for each available room ''for all types of business,'' he said, adding that 40 percent of its revenue is generated by corporate groups, 40 percent by individual business travelers and 20 percent by leisure travelers. Similarly, Marriott said it continued ''to see our growth next year based on continued strong demand, while new hotel room supply remains constricted.'' Marriott said it expected an increase in revenue per available room of 7 to 8 percent in 2007. ''We anticipate modest growth in overall occupancy next year,'' it said, with most of the increase in room revenue ''being driven by rate.''
 The company also said it was hard to predict trends among individual business travelers, because of their ''shorter booking windows.''
 In a conference call with analysts last month, Starwood's chief executive, Steven J. Heyer, said: ''We're feeling very good about our guidance for '07. Pricing power is still clearly with us.''
 American Express last month predicted that room rates at American hotels in 2007 would ''continue their upward climb amid higher occupancy rates and limited supply growth.'' Carlson Wagonlit Travel said the preliminary rates now being offered by hotels to corporations for 2007 were up 10.8 percent over negotiated rates being paid this year.
 ''Rates are going up because hotels seem to have higher occupancies,'' said Neysa Silver, a manager with Carlson. She also said more companies wanted to book cheaper hotels in 2007 than in the past. 
 Bill Connors, the executive director of the National Business Travel Association, which represents corporate travel managers, said a new survey of members found that 67.7 percent expected more trips for their company in 2007. Asked if they anticipated spending more on hotels next year, 84.1 percent said they did ''because of higher rates,'' 60.3 percent said they did because of more trips, and 47.6 percent said they did because of ''more travelers.''
 Mr. Connors said he disagreed with PricewaterhouseCoopers's findings on slowing demand for hotels among business travelers. 
 ''The big companies realize that they're playing in a global economy now, and that to be competitive, they have to have people on the road conducting business,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Must We Talk?

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Have you been trying to ignore this election? Do you avoid talking politics with friends? Do you tune out right-wing talk shows and stay away from left-wing blogs? Do you change channels as soon as you hear the words ''Pelosi,'' ''Foley,'' ''cut and run'' or ''macaca''?
 Then you owe it to your country to vote today. It's the rest of us who should stay home. 
We've lost our bearings because we've followed the old advice to discuss this amongst ourselves. Democracy, we've been told, is best served when informed citizens deliberate the issues of the day, pooling their wisdom to reach a judicious consensus.
 But what really happens when people discuss politics? Consider an experiment last year, when groups of Coloradans convened separately in Boulder and Colorado Springs to discuss global warming, affirmative action and civil unions for same-sex couples. Before the discussions, the people in Boulder were on average more liberal than the ones in Colorado Springs, but there were also moderates in both places whose opinions overlapped. 
 After the group discussions, the people in Boulder moved to the left, and those in Colorado Springs moved to the right. The researchers -- David Schkade, Cass Sunstein and Reid Hastie -- concluded that ''the major effect of deliberation was to make group members more extreme than they were before they started to talk.'' 
 This effect hasn't been studied much in politics, but it's well documented in other arenas. When jurors deliberate how much to award in damages, they often end up giving more than the average juror originally thought was fair -- and sometimes more than anyone in the group originally favored. The more they talk, the more they reinforce one another's indignation. 
 Group polarization is less of a problem if the people start with a wide range of opinions -- even if they tend to shift in whatever direction the majority favors, they'll at least be exposed to other views and become more tolerant. There's some evidence that if you purposely assemble a diverse group of discussants and systematically educate them about an issue, some of the people will moderate their opinions.
 But when people informally discuss politics, they often don't hear a range of views. As in Boulder and Colorado Springs, they may be surrounded by like-minded people in their neighborhoods, churches and offices. During local elections, they're much more likely now than in the past to hear one-sided rhetoric because gerrymandering has produced so many one-sided districts, making it impossible for moderate candidates to survive.
 Thanks to cable television, talk radio and the Internet, it's easier than ever for people to have their opinions validated around the clock. As the media audiences segregate themselves ideologically, they become more extreme in their views -- and more convinced than ever that they represent the sensible middle. 
 When conservatives have their views reinforced daily on talk radio and Sundays at their churches, they start to believe the ''mainstream media'' is a bunch of wacko traitors. When liberals spend their days reading lefty blogs, or working on campuses surrounded by ideological soulmates, they start convincing themselves that most ''corporate media'' are right wing, and that Fox News is pure propaganda.
 In fact, most journalists do try to be objective, but as a group they, too, can become polarized by spending most of their time talking to fellow journalists and experts with similar views. One of the cleverest demonstrations of this effect was a study published last year in Harvard's Quarterly Journal of Economics. The researchers, Tim Groseclose and Jeffrey Milyo, devised a scale for measuring the slant of news reports by keeping track of which think tanks -- liberal or conservative -- were quoted most often.
 The researchers found that The Washington Times and Brit Hume's evening newscast on Fox fell on the conservative side of the scale, while all the other news media outlets they studied fell on the liberal side. The surprising result -- to liberals, at least -- was that Fox was closer to the ideological center than the Big Three evening newscasts as well as all the major newspapers and newsweeklies.
 Of course, these ideological divides are small compared with the ones in the blogosphere, which is one giant version of the Colorado experiment. You can always find a group online to affirm your brilliant opinions. It's immensely satisfying, but it can also make Election Day a miserable experience. Tonight, you can't help noticing how many ignorant people out there disagree with you.

HEADLINE: Too Close For Comfort

BYLINE: By Stephanie Coontz. 
Stephanie Coontz, a history professor at Evergreen State College, is the author of ''Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage.''

DATELINE: OLYMPIA, Wash. 

 BODY:
EVER since the Census Bureau released figures last month showing that married-couple households are now a minority, my phone has been ringing off the hook with calls from people asking: ''How can we save marriage? How can we make Americans understand that marriage is the most significant emotional connection they will ever make, the one place to find social support and personal fulfillment?''
 I think these are the wrong questions -- indeed, such questions would have been almost unimaginable through most of history. It has only been in the last century that Americans have put all their emotional eggs in the basket of coupled love. Because of this change, many of us have found joys in marriage our great-great-grandparents never did. But we have also neglected our other relationships, placing too many burdens on a fragile institution and making social life poorer in the process.
 A study released this year showed just how dependent we've become on marriage. Three sociologists at the University of Arizona and Duke University found that from 1985 to 2004 Americans reported a marked decline in the number of people with whom they discussed meaningful matters. People reported fewer close relationships with co-workers, extended family members, neighbors and friends. The only close relationship where more people said they discussed important matters in 2004 than in 1985 was marriage. 
 In fact, the number of people who depended totally on a spouse for important conversations, with no other person to turn to, almost doubled, to 9.4 percent from 5 percent. Not surprisingly, the number of people saying they didn't have anyone in whom they confided nearly tripled. 
 The solution to this isolation is not to ramp up our emotional dependence on marriage. Until 100 years ago, most societies agreed that it was dangerously antisocial, even pathologically self-absorbed, to elevate marital affection and nuclear-family ties above commitments to neighbors, extended kin, civic duty and religion. 
 St. Paul complained that married men were more concerned with pleasing their wives than pleasing God. In John Adams's view, a ''passion for the public good'' was ''superior to all private passions.'' In both England and America, moralists bewailed ''excessive'' married love, which encouraged ''men and women to be always taken up with each other.'' 
 From medieval days until the early 19th century, diaries and letters more often used the word love to refer to neighbors, cousins and fellow church members than to spouses. When honeymoons first gained favor in the 19th century, couples often took along relatives or friends for company. Victorian novels and diaries were as passionate about brother-sister relationships and same-sex friendships as about marital ties. 
 The Victorian refusal to acknowledge strong sexual desires among respectable men and women gave people a wider outlet for intense emotions, including physical touch, than we see today. Men wrote matter-of-factly about retiring to bed with a male roommate, ''and in each other's arms did friendship sink peacefully to sleep.'' Upright Victorian matrons thought nothing of kicking their husbands out of bed when a female friend came to visit. They spent the night kissing, hugging and pouring out their innermost thoughts. 
 By the early 20th century, though, the sea change in the culture wrought by the industrial economy had loosened social obligations to neighbors and kin, giving rise to the idea that individuals could meet their deepest needs only through romantic love, culminating in marriage. Under the influence of Freudianism, society began to view intense same-sex ties with suspicion and people were urged to reject the emotional claims of friends and relatives who might compete with a spouse for time and affection.
 The insistence that marriage and parenthood could satisfy all an individual's needs reached a peak in the cult of ''togetherness'' among middle-class suburban Americans in the 1950s. Women were told that marriage and motherhood offered them complete fulfillment. Men were encouraged to let their wives take care of their social lives. 
 But many men and women found these prescriptions stifling. Women who entered the work force in the 1960s joyfully rediscovered social contacts and friendships outside the home. 
 ''It was so stimulating to have real conversations with other people,'' a woman who lived through this period told me, ''to go out after work with friends from the office or to have people over other than my husband's boss or our parents.'' 
 And women's lead in overturning the cult of 1950s marriage inspired many men to rediscover what earlier generations of men had taken for granted -- that men need deep emotional connections with other men, not just their wives. Researchers soon found that men and women with confidants beyond the nuclear family were mentally and physically healthier than people who relied on just one other individual for emotional intimacy and support.
 So why do we seem to be slipping back in this regard? It is not because most people have voluntarily embraced nuclear-family isolation. Indeed, the spread of ''virtual'' communities on the Internet speaks to a deep hunger to reach out to others. 
 Instead, it's the expansion of the post-industrial economy that seems to be driving us back to a new dependence on marriage. According to the researchers Kathleen Gerson and Jerry Jacobs, 60 percent of American married couples have both partners in the work force, up from 36 percent in 1970, and the average two-earner couple now works 82 hours a week. 
 This is probably why the time Americans spend socializing with others off the job has declined by almost 25 percent since 1965. Their free hours are spent with spouses, and as a study by Suzanne Bianchi of the University of Maryland released last month showed, with their children -- mothers and fathers today spend even more time with their youngsters than parents did 40 years ago.
 As Americans lose the wider face-to-face ties that build social trust, they become more dependent on romantic relationships for intimacy and deep communication, and more vulnerable to isolation if a relationship breaks down. In some cases we even cause the breakdown by loading the relationship with too many expectations. Marriage is generally based on more equality and deeper friendship than in the past, but even so, it is hard for it to compensate for the way that work has devoured time once spent cultivating friendships. 
 The solution is not to revive the failed marital experiment of the 1950s, as so many commentators noting the decline in married-couple households seem to want. Nor is it to lower our expectations that we'll find fulfillment and friendship in marriage. 
 Instead, we should raise our expectations for, and commitment to, other relationships, especially since so many people now live so much of their lives outside marriage. Paradoxically, we can strengthen our marriages the most by not expecting them to be our sole refuge from the pressures of the modern work force. Instead we need to restructure both work and social life so we can reach out and build ties with others, including people who are single or divorced. That indeed would be a return to marital tradition -- not the 1950s model, but the pre-20th-century model that has a much more enduring pedi-gree.

HEADLINE: A Bid to Save and Share Pieces of Jewish Heritage

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
When the Fire Department ordered trash removed from the balcony of a little-used auditorium at the Educational Alliance, one of New York's oldest Jewish settlement houses, part of the agency's heritage was almost tossed out. There, jumbled in a paper bag, were documents from the early 1900s about a forgotten youth theater program that cast immigrant ''hooligans'' in classic dramas to help them become good Americans. 
 Samuel L. Clemens (that is, Mark Twain) was its board president, and the muckraking photojournalist Jacob Riis was a fan.
 ''I have found going back and looking at this stuff hugely important,'' said Robin Bernstein, executive director of the Alliance, which is still a secular Jewish agency on the Lower East Side, but now serves mostly Chinese and Hispanic families. ''There are successes that we had at the turn of the century that kind of got lost.'' 
 It is to rescue records like these, scattered among five agencies that helped Jews settle and adapt in New York City throughout the 20th century, that the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, a partner of the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan, is undertaking a three-year archival project. The effort, granted $225,000 from the Milstein family and the Howard P. Milstein Foundation, was scheduled to be announced today.
 The work, called the Milstein Jewish Communal Archive Project, is planned as a model for preserving the archives of such Jewish agencies nationwide and making the records available to scholars, students and genealogists. It will eventually include a Web site, digitized documents, conferences and fellowships. 
 More than 2.7 million Jews migrated to America during the last century, according to researchers at YIVO, many escaping poverty and persecution, some just seeking a better life. That American migration is one of the most important events in Jewish history, contends Bruce Slovin, chairman of YIVO and the center, and it is a key episode in making the United States a nation of immigrants. 
 Yet the details of the story are in danger of being lost, he said, as Jewish social service agencies go out of business, change their ethnic identities, or make room for new programs by tossing out old files. 
 ''Our archives are a mess,'' Ms. Bernstein confessed, before opening a dusty and dented strongbox that contained the earliest deeds of the Alliance, which started in 1889 and was supported by the founders of Macy's, Bloomingdale's and B. Altman, all German Jews. ''We've never had the resources to organize them. But every so often I go through and find amazing treasures.''
 A special playbill from a 1907 performance of ''The Prince and the Pauper'' with Twain as host remains one of those treats. The illustrated program includes testimonials by luminaries like the president of Harvard, marveling at what had been achieved in an immigrant neighborhood by Alice Minnie Herts, who founded the Alliance theater program in 1902.
 ''It is a very squalid part of the city of New York, which is a peculiarly squalid city,'' Harvard's president, Charles W. Eliot, wrote with telling condescension. ''It is among a population which would not seem at first sight to be very well adapted to Miss Herts's plan -- Russian Jews, Polish Jews, large elements of the Jewish stock throughout the neighborhood; poor people, very poor people; the children obliged to work for their living a good part of each day.'' 
 ''And yet,'' he added, ''when I listened to those children acting I did entertain a doubt whether American children could equal them.'' 
 Rich historical material abounds at each of the five agencies participating in the archival project, but only one, the 92nd Street Y, has its own archivist. The Y, founded in 1874 by prominent Jews interested in helping immigrants assimilate, has already begun digitizing documents from its trove, which includes thousands of audio and video recordings of cultural events, lectures by world leaders like Abba Eban and Golda Meir, and performance and interview tapes of artists like Beverly Sills, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Zero Mostel. 
 At another agency in the project, Surprise Lake Camp, the records go back nearly to its founding in 1902 as one of the country's first Jewish-sponsored summer camps, and evoke the experiences of alumni who went on to fame, like Eddie Cantor, Neil Diamond, Larry King, Neil Simon, Jerry Stiller, Walter Matthau, Joseph Heller and Gene Simmons. 
 A different kind of experience is recorded in the files of F.E.G.S. Health and Human Services System (a k a Federation Employment and Guidance Service), which began its work during the Great Depression to seek jobs for thousands of Jewish men and women in an era when discrimination compounded economic crisis. 
 And at New York Association for New Americans, records that begin in 1949 tell of efforts to rescue and resettle hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from around the world, including displaced persons in Germany after the war; Hungarian Jews in the 1950s; Cuban Jews during the Castro revolution; half a million Jews from the former Soviet Union; and Syrian Jews who escaped to the United States in 1994. 
 ''It is hard to imagine where the Jews of the world would be today without this support and welcome from the United States,'' said Mr. Slovin, of the Center for Jewish History. ''There's no other country in this world that has taken strangers and assimilated them. That's what makes the United States the United States, and this is the story that epitomizes it.''
 Some of the human strands that weave that story can be teased out of nothing more than a name from the old playbill once tossed in a paper bag, as Robert Friedman, director of the center's Genealogy Institute, undertook to prove at the request of a curious reporter. 
 Solomon Neuwirth, for example, one of hundreds of adolescents with rotating roles in ''The Prince and the Pauper,'' was living at 224 Rivington Street during the 1900 census, a Russian-born child in a family of eight. By 1942, a facsimile of his draft card shows, he was married, living in Brooklyn and working at the Pix Theater in Times Square. 
 When he died in 1950, at 60, his death notice in The New York Times listed no children, but it named Sarah Heidecorn as one of the sisters who mourned him. Her daughter, Roslyn Heidecorn Benamy, died more than half a century later in Teaneck, N.J., at 72, with six grandchildren and an obituary studded with names from the larger melting pot. 
 Relatives who had never heard of Sol Neuwirth explained: Roslyn's sister had married an Irishman; her niece had married into an Italian-American family; a daughter is a rabbi married to the son of a Dutch Reform minister who converted to Judaism; a son married an immigrant from Poland. 
 The death notice in 2002 was small, but it seemed to resonate with the fulfillment of ideas championed many years ago by the Educational Alliance: ''She was a docent at the Jewish Museum in New York City, a professor emeritus of Rockland Community College -- SUNY, a worldwide traveler and Fulbright scholar,'' it said. ''Roslyn was an activist who believed in and worked for tikkun olam, the repair of the world.''

HEADLINE: Leftist Headed Toward Victory In Nicaragua 

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and JILL REPLOGLE

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Sixteen years after he left power, Daniel Ortega, a former Marxist president and the Sandinista leader who is still regarded as a sworn foe by many in Washington, appeared headed to a victory on Monday in the Nicaraguan presidential election.
 Though electoral officials had yet to release final tallies from Sunday's vote, preliminary results and the country's electoral watchdog groups all indicated that Mr. Ortega, who had failed three times before to gain the presidency in elections, would win a clear victory.
An Ortega win in a five-way race would be a defeat for the Bush administration, which strongly opposed his election and worked hard to unite a fractious opposition against him with little success. The White House has said it would withdraw aid from an Ortega government.
 With about 61 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Ortega had 38.6 percent of the ballots, about 8 points ahead of the second-place candidate, Eduardo Montealegre, a Harvard-educated financier and conservative Washington has openly supported. Final results were not expected until Tuesday, an election official said. 
 Now 60 years old and balding, Mr. Ortega has maintained he is no longer a Marxist, but more of a pragmatist. He has promised to keep good relations with the United States and chose a former political opponent as his running mate. He has also vowed to help the poor and run a positive campaign around the themes of ''peace, love and unity.''
 But he maintains close ties to Cuba and to Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, the leftist president who has become a thorn in the side of the United States. Mr. Chavez gave the Ortega campaign significant support by sending subsidized oil to Nicaragua and distributing it through Sandinista politicians. 
 Mr. Ortega's expected victory appeared to be another gain for leftists in Latin America, who, despite recent setbacks in Peru and Mexico, have also persuaded voters to abandon conservative governments in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Bolivia.
 Although the results were preliminary, supporters of the Sandinista National Liberation Front party of Mr. Ortega set off fireworks around the city on Monday, and drove around honking horns, shouting victory slogans and waving red and black Sandinista flags. Mr. Ortega had yet to make a statement. 
 Cuba immediately congratulated Mr. Ortega. ''This is good for the people of Nicaragua and for the integration of Latin America,'' Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told The Associated Press on Monday.
 Mr. Ortega's opponents refused to recognize his expected victory until all the votes were counted. The United States took a similar stance. The State Department's deputy spokesman, Tom Casey, said Monday that the administration would wait to comment until the Nicaraguan electoral council announced who won. He also said it was too early to comment on procedural problems during the voting, noting that several groups of observers planned to file reports. 
 Mr. Casey said the United States delegation in Nicaragua had remarked on ''high turnout and given praise to the Nicaraguan people for their patience and their willingness to show support for this democratic process.''
 Mr. Ortega was one of the leaders of the Sandinista rebels that swept to power in 1979, toppling the Somoza dynasty of right-wing dictators friendly to the United States and setting up an authoritarian left-wing government. 
 With the cold war still driving United States policy, President Reagan imposed sanctions on the country and financed anti-Sandinista guerrillas, known as contras, in part by secretly selling arms to the revolutionary Islamic government in Iran. It was Mr. Ortega who led his Soviet-backed government in a bloody decade-long civil war.
 The last time Mr. Ortega ran Nicaragua, he seized private assets and redistributed land to peasants. Capital fled the country, along with many of its business leaders. He vows a different approach this time.
 The advertising campaign against the former rebel leader was vicious, showing images from the civil war, women weeping, guns blaring. His opponents lost no chance to remind people of the economic collapse that followed the fighting and the United States embargo.
 Mr. Ortega was elected president in 1984 and served from 1985 to 1990, before losing to Violeta Chamorro. He struggled to regain power through the ballot box, but without success, in 1996 and 2001.
 This time, however, a change in the election law and a strong throw-the-bums-out sentiment in the country after campaign financing scandals involving former President Enrique Bolanos helped carry him to what appears to be a victory.
 He was also aided significantly by a change in election rules that allows a candidate to win in the first round with only 35 percent of the vote, so long as he is 5 points above his closest opponent. If Mr. Ortega had not won on the first round, most political strategists predicted he would not have survived a second round, as the splintered anti-Sandinista vote would have united.
 As it was, the anti-Sandinista vote seemed split mostly between Mr. Montealegre, with 30.9 percent, and Jose Rizo, the candidate of the conservative ruling party, who had 22.9 percent, according to the Supreme Electoral Council, the Nicaraguan election authority. Two other candidates, Edmundo Jarquin, a dissident former Sandinista, and Eden Pastora, a former Sandinista who later became a contra rebel, trailed behind. 
 Results of a quick count carried out by a local monitoring group, Ethics and Transparency, tracked with the official results. 
 ''It's been a pretty exact count, we can say that Ortega's triumph is almost sure,'' said Carlos Tunnerman, a political analyst and former Nicaraguan ambassador to Washington from 1984 to 1988. 
 Former President Jimmy Carter, who was in Nicaragua to monitor the election, said the quick count was ''among the most definitive I have ever seen.'' The count is based on a large, and strategically varied, sample of votes from urban and rural areas and different social strata, explained Mr. Carter and local analysts. 
 On Sunday night, following the first presentation of results by the election authorities, Mr. Montealegre denounced the early closing of some polling places and problems with the delivery of voter identification cards. He said he would not concede defeat until all votes were counted. 
 Mr. Carter agreed that there were minor problems with the voting process, but said he did not think they were significant enough to affect the results. 
 ''The likelihood is that those few anomalies, which exist in every election in the world, will not be substantive enough collectively to change the apparent results of this election,'' Mr. Carter said.
 Electoral observers have said the vote was mostly peaceful and orderly, despite long lines and some angry confrontations among voters who claimed polling stations closed before they could vote.
 Observers from the Organization of American States said 2 percent of potential voters were not able to cast ballots, and they estimated turnout around 70 percent, The A.P. reported.
 Because the front-runner was a cold-war icon for the left, the race generated interest in the United States. Even Oliver North, a former White House aide to President Reagan, visited to speak against Mr. Ortega. Mr. North was at the heart of what became known as the Iran-contra affair.
 But in recent years, American money has flowed into Nicaragua in the form of investments. The country has cheap labor and low crime rates, and recently joined the Central American Free Trade Agreement.
 During his campaign, Mr. Ortega emphasized his goal of peace and reconciliation, choosing bright pink as the color for his campaign and adopting the rhythm of John Lennon's ''Give Peace a Chance'' for his jingle. 
 For some, Mr. Ortega and the Sandinistas still conjure up memories of the war and tough economic times. Marlon Jose Sanchez Padilla, 36, who sold oranges on Sunday outside of a polling station in the town of Nindiri, bitterly recalled his two years of military service in the 1980s. ''Many people were mutilated,'' he said. ''Now he promises the sky, earth and highways, but we don't believe him anymore.''
 Others at the polls on Sunday said it was time to give Mr. Ortega another chance. ''It seems that Daniel Ortega has asked for pardon,'' said Ninosca Leets, 46, a housewife who said she fled to the United States during the former Sandinista government. ''He's asked for reconciliation. He's asked for a change, and I think he should be given the opportunity.''

HEADLINE: International Focus Is Still Foreign to Knicks

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A noteworthy pattern emerges from the opening week of the Knicks' 2006-7 season. And a characterization that not only contrasts them with opponents but helps sum up the state of professional basketball in cosmopolitan New York: downright unworldly.
 Opening night, on the road, the Knicks narrowly beat a Memphis team without its one indispensable player, the Spaniard Pau Gasol. 
 In Atlanta, they couldn't handle an unheralded center from the Republic of Georgia, Zaza Pachulia, who torched their soft interior for 22 points.
 In their home debut, the Knicks trailed Indiana by a point going into the fourth quarter, but the Lithuanian guard Sarunas Jasikevicius scored 14 of his 16 points. They lost by 14. 
 To the Knicks' credit, they didn't quit last night after being down by 19 in the fourth quarter. But the Spurs, a team with five contributing foreign-born players orbiting their hub -- Tim Duncan of the United States Virgin Islands -- brushed them off for a 105-93 victory at Madison Square Garden.
 China's Yao Ming awaits the Knicks in Houston on Friday night, the Spurs again Saturday in San Antonio and, beyond that, more reminders of how a worldwide basketball revolution somehow happened without the franchise from America's greatest melting pot.
 The Knicks play in what New Yorkers have been conditioned to believe is the world's most famous arena, but there are American cities, without intricate train lines tunneling underneath the building, that have more sophisticated basketball operations. 
 Deep in south Texas, the Spurs have won two championships since the French point guard Tony Parker and the Argentine pit bull Manu Ginobili (they combined for 39 points and 17 assists last night, 5 more than the entire Knicks team) became the fruit of Coach Gregg Popovich's longtime fascination with the international game. Dallas came close last season behind a German, Dirk Nowitzki.
 Across the Hudson, in trendy East Rutherford, N.J., the Nets have a Serbian center, Nenad Krstic, whom they stole with the 24th pick of the 2002 draft and wouldn't trade for any combination of Knicks. Utah may be one of the country's most homogenous states, but the Jazz frontline features a Russian, Andrei Kirilenko, and a Turk, Mehmet Okur. 
 In sun-drenched, conservative Phoenix, Coach Mike D'Antoni brought his freewheeling offense and it became the N.B.A. rage, quarterbacked by a Canadian (Steve Nash), with a touch of France (Boris Diaw) and Brazil (Leandro Barbosa) on the wings. Bryan Colangelo, who hired D'Antoni away from the Italian team Benetton Treviso, became the front-office heavyweight in Toronto, brought in the respected Benetton executive Mauricio Gherardini as assistant general manager and sprinkled his roster with foreign-born flavor. 
 On and on the revolution reigns, except in rare places, Manhattan among them. Dozens of young men from afar have come to David Stern's league of opportunity in the 21st century to realize their dreams while the Knicks have remained in an international scouting stupor, or sound asleep, having a recurring nightmare about Frederic Weis.
 Weis, a young French center, was the 15th pick of the N.B.A. draft in 1999 by the Knicks and was greeted with such skepticism and scorn when he arrived in New York for a summer rookie camp -- the Knicks had passed on Ron Artest -- that he went home, never to return.
 As the Knicks general manager, Scott Layden dabbled in foreign currency, with a couple of second-round picks that amounted to nothing. Isiah Thomas's reign has been marked by an insularity so thorough you have to wonder if it has been by design. 
 His one training camp invitee this fall was Nikoloz Tskitishvili, a Georgian who was selected fifth by Denver in the 2002 draft and failed to earn playing time on four teams in as many seasons. 
 While the rest of the league has been test-driving imports, Thomas has steadfastly purchased big American reputations and punitive bloated contracts. Is this dogged provincial strategy ultimately pragmatic? In the global economy, are they Knicks or are they hicks?
 Forget Nowitzki, Yao or Gasol. Landing a great player is more often about the luck of the draft draw. But look around the league at how many useful players have come from abroad via the second round, or as veteran free agents. An Andres Nocioni (Chicago) here, a Beno Udrih (Spurs) there. Could there not have been five big men in Europe -- perhaps even Weis -- who would have come to the Knicks much cheaper and been more useful than Jerome James?
 This isn't a call for diversity or quotas. If you have one of the blessed American-born stars -- a Dwyane Wade, a LeBron James -- you don't worry about what's in vogue. But as Popovich, an Air Force Academy graduate with a degree in Russian studies and a Serbo-Croatian family background, said of basketball without borders: ''This is not a trend in the sense of furniture or fashion. It's a fact. And those who don't understand that are going to be left behind.''
 Sound like any team we have been watching the past few years? 
 The more spirited post-Larry Brown Knicks say they want to play fast, just like Phoenix, but basketball is no track meet. The running game requires guards who rebound, who understand the game's geometry and spacing, who make a living off ball and body movement more than the yo-yo dribble. The passing game requires a big man or two who can step out and hit the jump shot, the way it's long been done in Europe.
 This was becoming obvious as far back as six years ago, when the United States Olympians escaped the Sydney Olympics with a gold medal, their last in a worldwide competition.
 ''What we learn from them is what they learned from us,'' Stern said in Sydney.
 How can New York City, of all places, be among the last still living in the past?

PERSON: Fereydoun Hoveyda

HEADLINE: Fereydoun Hoveyda, 82, Shah's Ambassador, Dies 

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Fereydoun Hoveyda, a former Iranian ambassador to the United Nations during the reign of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and an expert in Middle Eastern affairs, died Friday at his home in Clifton, Va. He was 82. 
 The cause was cancer, said his daughter Roxana Hoveyda.
Mr. Hoveyda represented Iran at the United Nations from 1971 until 1979, the year that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led the revolution that overthrew the shah. As a young diplomat, Mr. Hoveyda participated in preparations for the 1945 San Francisco Conference, which adopted the charter of the United Nations, and two years later he helped draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 On April 7, 1979, Mr. Hoveyda's brother, Amir Abbas Hoveyda, a former prime minister under the shah, was executed. One month later, in a letter published in The New York Times, Mr. Hoveyda called it a murder, ''because no other word can be used for the kind of mock justice he was subjected to in the dead of night in front of masked 'judges.' '' His brother was prime minister for 13 years, until August 1977. 
 After being forced out of the Iranian Foreign Service, Mr. Hoveyda became a senior fellow at the National Committee on American Foreign Policy. He also wrote more than a dozen books, in English, French and German, including ''The Broken Crescent: The Threat of Militant Islamic Fundamentalism'' and ''What Do the Arabs Want?''
 Mr. Hoveyda was born in Damascus, Syria, on Sept. 21, 1924, the younger son of Habibollah Eynol-Molk Hoveyda, then the Iranian consul general to Syria, and Afsar-ol-Molouk Fatmeh. Mr. Hoveyda earned a Ph.D. in international law and economics at the Sorbonne in Paris.
 Besides his daughter Roxana, of Clifton, Va., he is survived by his wife of 38 years, Gisela, and another daughter, Mandana Hoveyda, of New York City.
 Though he and his brother had served in the shah's government, Mr. Hoveyda was not uncritical. In another book, ''The Fall of the Shah,'' he wrote that ''corruption ran wild at the heart of the royal family'' and that ''the example of the royal family was a source of contamination which infected every level of society.''

HEADLINE: After Arizona's Housing Boom, 'For Sale' Is a Sign of the Times

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Ron Nixon contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
Until recently, this fast-growing area was a paradise on earth for home builders. Fulton Homes' developments, for example, were so popular last year that it was able to raise prices on its new homes by $1,000 to $10,000 almost every week.
 ''People were standing in line for lotteries,'' recalled Douglas S. Fulton, president of the company, one of the largest private builders in the Phoenix area. And they were ''camping overnight begging to be the next number in the next lot in the next house.''
No more. 
 Today, it is the company's sales agents that do most of the waiting. Not only are there few new customers to talk to, but many buyers who put down a deposit are not even bothering to come back for the walk-through. 
 ''All of a sudden, they just don't show up,'' Mr. Fulton said, noting that such cancellations often mean the buyers forfeit as much as 5 percent of the price. The reason? The prospective buyers got cold feet or simply could not sell their old home.
 The striking contrast tells the tale of a housing bonanza turned bust. Today, the number of unsold homes in the area has soared to almost 46,000 from just a few thousand in early 2005. And builders are pulling back as fast as they can.
 They have little choice. Sales cancellations among big builders, not just here but around the country, are running as high as 40 percent, double the rate a year ago.
 Across the nation, new-home sales are down by more than 20 percent from their peak last year. Prices fell almost 10 percent in September from a year ago. And that reported drop does not take into account the extras that builders are throwing in free or at steep discounts to lure buyers, which means that effective prices are even lower.
 The reversal in fortune is at its starkest here in the West. For-sale signs in some new subdivisions are so common that Janet L. Yellen, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, recently described them as ''the new ghost towns of the West.''
 Tumbleweeds may not be blowing through the dozen new developments along Hunt Highway in and around Tempe, but driving down the two-lane road about 30 miles southeast of downtown Phoenix provides a revealing look into the area's now vanished housing boom.
 Road signs welcoming visitors to Pinal County proffer a menu of new subdivisions. Looking for houses by D. R. Horton, the nation's largest builder? Keep driving, you have not far to go. Make a U-turn for KB Home's latest four-bedroom Mc-Mansions. For Centex homes in the Johnson Ranch development, hang a right after the next bend.
 Don't worry, there are plenty more down the road.
 So it goes in this and other suburbs of Phoenix, where builders turned scraggly desert and what were once cotton fields into neat rows of homes so fast that traffic on many country roads is often backed up a mile or more during rush hour. 
 Local officials issued 60,000 single-family permits in the metropolitan area in 2005, twice the number issued in 2000. But in the first nine months of this year, permits fell by 27 percent from the same period last year. And builders are suddenly refusing to pay the asking prices for developable land. 
 On the strength of a local economy that has added 300,000 jobs since 2000 and a population that grew nearly 20 percent from 2000 to 2005, Phoenix became an epicenter of the nation's recent building boom, along with Las Vegas and Atlanta, as well as parts of California, Texas, Florida and stretches of the Northeast.
 Phoenix, with its endless sun, lush golf resorts and myriad retirement communities, also attracted thousands of second-home buyers looking for bargains and investors seeking instant wealth.
 The influx of buyers from California, many of them individual speculators, was so strong that builders overestimated demand and constructed a lot more homes than there were people wanting to live in them, said John Burns, a real estate consultant in Irvine, Calif. He noted that investors bought roughly a third of homes sold in the Phoenix area last year, according to mortgage application data.
 Until recently, the calculation was fairly simple for individual real estate investors. ''You put $5,000 down and you sell it for a $100,000 profit,'' sometimes almost before the paint dried, Mr. Burns said. ''And then you roll into 15 more houses.''
 The speculators are gone. But builders predict that the current downturn will last no more than six months to a year, arguing that prices and sales will start rising again after the homes on the market are absorbed by the normal influx of migrants to the area.
 Though job growth here is not as strong as it once was, local developers like Mr. Fulton contend that most of the positive fundamentals of the region's economy remain intact.
 Google's plans to hire several hundred employees here is frequently cited as a sign of vitality.
 ''We will quickly grow out of it,'' said Gregory J. Vogel, a land acquisition consultant in Scottsdale who advises builders and developers, noting that before the boom it was considered normal to have about 30,000 homes on the market at any given moment.
 But other experts are not as sanguine. They worry that the supply of homes overshot demand by far more than is commonly understood.
 ''By the time all the dust settles, will this be an 18-month correction or a 36-month correction?'' said Thomas Bruin, chief executive of Hearthstone, a firm based in San Rafael, Calif., that invests pension fund assets in land and residential real estate. ''Nobody really knows.''
 Economists note that the construction sector, itself dependent on the housing boom, accounted for about a quarter of all new jobs created in the last six years. Lower-paying retail jobs added about 15 percent.
 Wages rose, too, but not nearly as fast as home prices. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and Scottsdale, median home values -- half the homes are worth more, half are worth less -- increased 64 percent, to $212,700, from 2001 to 2005, while the typical household's income rose just 5 percent, to $48,711, according to the Census Bureau. 
 New homes cost more: the median price was $270,000 at the end of August, up from $250,000 a year ago, according to Hanley Wood, a research firm.
 Jay Q. Butler, director of the Real Estate Center at Arizona State University, agrees that Phoenix is generally healthy but he wonders which industry will generate enough new high-paying jobs to soak up the more expensive homes. ''What's the next semiconductor industry?'' he asks.
 The housing correction has, thus far, had only a modest impact on the broader economy. While home builders have cut back, contractors remain busy erecting shopping malls, office buildings, schools and civic projects. Builders and contractors say the costs of concrete, drywall, copper and other building materials remain high, though the supply shortages seen last year have dissipated.
 ''We have been at such a breakneck pace here,'' said Mark Minter, executive director of the Arizona Builders' Alliance, that a slowdown ''might be good.''
 Perhaps an early indication of things to come can be found in what has happened with land sales. In September, the Arizona State Land Department postponed the auction of two parcels of prime residential land north of downtown Phoenix after builders said the starting levels were too high.
 One of those parcels, 325 acres in the Desert Ridge development, had been set at $461,000 an acre, far above the $243,000 an acre Toll Brothers, the luxury-home builder, had been willing to pay in April for an 81-acre parcel. 
 Landdevelopers and builders say they remain interested in Phoenix but not at current, lofty prices. Among them is Newland Communities, a developer based in San Diego that is financed in part by Calpers, the large California pension fund.
 Newland is developing a sprawling project southwest of Phoenix called Estrella Mountain Ranch, which has 3,300 homes today but is planned to eventually have as many as 60,000. A 30-minute drive from downtown, the development abuts a state park and features winding parkways lined with date palm trees, a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course, two artificial lakes and numerous other amenities.
 Several builders recently delayed construction on 650 single-family homes there, but on an adjacent parcel workers were starting to prepare the ground for what will in five years be 1,700 homes for retirees.
 Daniel C. Van Epp, Newland's chief operating officer, said the company was negotiating to acquire more land in the Phoenix area, some of it from builders starting to pare their land holdings. In a few years, Newland, which has a $1 billion land acquisition fund, expects to turn around and sell that same land back to builders in the form of finished lots.
 ''As sure as the grass is green, it will all come back,'' Mr. Van Epp said about the housing market.
 Thomas V. Caldwell is making essentially the same bet -- on a much smaller scale. 
 Mr. Caldwell, a 32-year-old entrepreneur, started a property management firm with a childhood friend six years ago but quickly realized he could make far more by buying homes as well as managing them for others. He and his partner, D. Brett Brewer, now own about 30 homes each and manage a total of 2,200 properties for clients, many in California.
 Their firm, Brewer Caldwell, employs about 100 people and puts on seminars in California and Arizona to teach people how to buy and manage investment properties. On a recent afternoon, their two-story office building was decorated as a haunted house for a Halloween party the company was throwing that night for the children of its employees. As they talked to visitors, a fog machine set off a piercing fire alarm.
 Asked what he thought of the contention that investors were to blame for the glut of homes on the market, Mr. Caldwell acknowledges ''there was some fluff.'' 
 But smart investors, he argued, were absorbing the surplus by buying up homes that builders were now unloading at bargain prices -- some for as little as $60 to $80 a square foot, which local experts say is barely enough to cover construction costs let alone land expenses.
 At such prices and with interest rates still low, an investor can cover his monthly costs, maybe even earn a modest income, by renting homes for $900 to $1,400 a month while the market recovers, Mr. Caldwell noted.
 ''It is not a get-rich quick scheme,'' he acknowledged. ''But investments in real estate,'' he added, ''do go up over time.''

HEADLINE: In Maine, a Public Park in Search of Public Support

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: MILLINOCKET, Me., Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Roxanne Quimby could be forgiven if she thought she was emulating the likes of Henry David Thoreau, Percival P. Baxter, John D. Rockefeller Jr. and other lovers of Maine's landscape when she started to buy bits of the vast northern woodlands near here to be the core of a new national park.
 Who knew that when she began using some of the fortune she had earned from her organic personal-care business, Burt's Bees, to buy up woods to preserve, she would be greeted with ''Ban Roxanne'' T-shirts? Or, that her efforts at preservation -- banning snowmobiling, hunting and all-terrain vehicles on 50,000 of her acres -- would be taken as an attack on the old-time values of the timberland?
Who knew that even some conservation-minded groups would be reluctant to support the decade-old vision of a national park that had inspired Ms. Quimby? 
 Still, one might have guessed, looking at the streets of this town of 4,700 people, where hunter's blaze orange is the fall fashion statement of choice during this month's deer hunting season. 
 Millinocket residents fear that turning timberland into parkland will further cut timber jobs, strip them of their accustomed hunting grounds and prevent the development of resorts and snowmobile parks they see as one way out of the downward economic spiral.
 ''What Roxanne and the others want to do, they want to create a park up here the size of Connecticut and take it out of the heartland of the Maine forest,'' Eugene Conlogue, the town's manager, said in an interview. ''That's a nonstarter for us.'' 
 Other environmental groups, while sympathetic to the idea of a national park, see it as an unwelcome distraction from their fight to block a proposed 420,000-acre resort development that the Plum Creek Timber Company has unveiled for Moosehead Lake, just west of here.
 As Brownie Carson, executive director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said, ''You can't pour energy into protection of a single area, even though it's large and hugely important, without risking losses, big losses, in other really important areas of Maine's North Woods forest.''
 Thirty years ago, Ms. Quimby was living a subsistence counterculture life in the North Woods. After building her financial empire, she was taken with an idea conceived a decade ago by Jym St. Pierre and other local conservationists for a Maine Woods National Park that would envelop Baxter State Park, in the conservation equivalent of Russian nesting dolls. The new park would be the size of Yellowstone and Yosemite combined.
 ''I find it pretty ironic, or humorous, that people make a national park out to be such a radical idea,'' said Ken Spalding, the project coordinator for the moving force behind the park, Restore, a group with offices in Hallowell and in Concord, Mass. ''American people love their national parks.'' 
 Ms. Quimby, 56, hopes Mr. Spalding and Restore's director, Mr. St. Pierre, are right. The idea of a park, she said, ''floats my boat.'' 
 She prefers that her 75,000 acres become a base on which Restore's 3.2-million acre park could be built.
 But in the past few weeks, she has started to explore conservation alternatives and has met with her opponents to see if her goals to bring the northlands back to their pre-logging state can be reconciled with their goals of finding economic value and personal freedom in the same woods. 
 In the last six years, more than six million acres of timber company land have changed hands. Timber companies have come and gone like truckers at a roadside stop.
 ''What has happened over the years,'' Ms. Quimby said, ''is that there were very few landowners and they had a very permissive policy toward land use as long as you stayed out of the way of the logging operation. So people had this unrestricted access.'' 
 ''So now that the ownership is changing,'' she said, ''it's becoming quite clear that this is private property. And as a private property owner I don't have to let anybody on it.'' 
 That, she added, ''is becoming the alternative to public land.''
 When Ms. Quimby banned snowmobiling and hunting and all-terrain vehicles from the first two tracts she bought, which totaled more than 50,000 acres, the ''ban Roxanne'' cries were heard everywhere here. When she bought her third tract, 23,000 acres, earlier this fall, adjacent to the critical parcel in a state-brokered deal to expand Baxter park, opponents erupted again.
 This time, Ms. Quimby sat down and met with them and made a deal. For at least a year, snowmobiles and hunters could continue to use the new purchase, called Sandy Stream. In the meantime, the competing visions of the North Woods' future could be debated with less pressure.
 ''Mainers are more individualistic.'' she said. ''They're used to having more space about them. They are very self-sufficient, including in the way they think about things.'' 
 It is not clear whether Ms. Quimby's efforts at appeasement will beget a more conciliatory attitude to other conservation deals, particularly the not-yet-completed purchase of land around Katahdin Lake. This is a place whose haunting views of Maine's largest mountain, have been a magnet for American landscape painters, from Frederic Church on.
 Patrick McGowan, the commissioner of Maine's Department of Conservation, has spent months trying to put all the pieces in place to add 6,000 acres to the eastern side of the 204,800-acre Baxter State Park, ensuring that Katahdin Lake, the artists' beaches and the surrounding woodlands would be preserved. The deal was buffeted on its way through the Maine Legislature, but survived, with two provisos.
 Mr. McGowan, aided by the nonprofit conservation group, The Trust for Public Lands, had to get $14 million in private donations to complete the purchase. Facing a Dec. 15 deadline, he is more than $3 million shy of the goal. The Trust is organizing fund-raising events, and artists like Evelyn Dunphy are donating canvases of Katahdin.
 The second proviso was that one-third of the new parkland-- though not the area around lake -- had to be open to ''traditional'' uses like hunting and snowmobiling.
 That deal was barely done when Ms. Quimby announced the purchase of her latest, 23,000 acre, tract from a local logging operator. 
 Hunters saw the Quimby announcement as a double blow. They were losing access to 23,000 acres, and those acres were the main way in to the 2,000 acres of proposed parkland set aside for them.
 ''Everybody perceived this as a threat,'' said Bob Cram, a local hunter and a director of the statewide hunters' group, the Sportsmen's Alliance of Maine. ''I did, too.''
 How Ms. Quimby's talks with the hunters' groups will change the landscape is unknown. Acadia and Baxter parks faced opposition before their creation. It took decades to assemble the land and gain legislative approval. Mr. Spalding, of Restore, said: ''The opposition is very much a minority. It is clear that the Maine public, statewide, overwhelmingly supports the acquisition of more public land for conservation.'' 
 For the moment, the conservation will likely continue to be ad hoc, with individuals like Ms. Quimby, groups like the Appalachian Mountain Trail Club and state-private partnerships raising the money for individual tracts. These might be combined in a national park, a national forest or a state preserve. They might also remain private, part of a checkerboard of conservation areas and resort development. 
 A national park, Ms. Quimby said, is not the only solution. ''I think a national forest is a possibility, like the White Mountain National Forest,'' she said. ''It has much broader usage.'' 
 ''Everyone has to give up something in a compromise,'' she said. ''But you get your most important things if it's a good compromise.''

HEADLINE: The Creepy Guy on 'Lost' Reveals Clues to His Past

BYLINE: By JOE RHODES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Michael Emerson, considerably less creepy in person than he is on your TV, still hasn't gotten used to the idea that people he does not know approach him in public places to declare how much they despise him. It's been occurring fairly regularly since he showed up last season on the ABC series ''Lost,'' playing the character then known as Henry Gale, the chillingly soft-spoken (in a Hannibal Lecter kind of way) leader of the frightening and mysterious Others who inhabit the show's island. 
 It happened again just a couple of weeks ago, as he was passing through security at Honolulu International Airport on his way to Los Angeles from Hawaii, where ''Lost'' is filmed. This time it was a federal security guard, who suddenly found herself distracted from checking for liquids and gels.
''She looks up and says: 'You! Oh, you, you I hate you! You're bad. You're a very bad man!' '' recalled Mr. Emerson, 51, over lunch on the patio of a restaurant here, near the apartment he shares with his wife, the actress Carrie Preston. ''She ended up laughing. I think it tickles people to come face to face with the character.'' 
 Although he was originally hired for a three-episode story line, Mr. Emerson's character (whose name, viewers learned this season, is actually Benjamin Linus) has become one of the show's most important and intriguing roles, the enigmatic and occasionally brutal leader of a sophisticated scientific operation on an uncharted island, a project whose origins and motives are, to say the least, unclear. At the end of last season, after his Others had, among other things, terrorized and killed several survivors of a plane crash, Mr. Emerson's character was asked, ''Who are you people?''
 ''We're the good guys,'' he replied.
 And maybe they are. Mr. Emerson doesn't know. But, just like the show's rabid legions of detailed-obsessed fans -- ''Losties'' -- he enjoys speculating about his character and possible explanations for the series' secrets-behind-secrets sci-fi-adventure plotlines.
 ''The Others, I think, have some great enemy,'' he said. ''But I'm not sure who it is. Doesn't it seem like they're commandos, like they're fighting some kind of guerrilla war? Maybe they are fighting people they were once in league with. Then you get the whole thing of, What is the island? What is the experiment? What is the Dharma Initiative? What was going on there all those years? I don't know. It's just fun to think about.''
 As ''Lost'' ends its six-episode fall mini-season on Wednesday night(the show will return with new episodes in February), Mr. Emerson's character is at the heart of several potential cliffhanging story lines, including whether he will survive surgery for a spinal tumor and a possible mutiny from the Others under his command.
 Henry Gale/Benjamin Linus has been a hot topic on the many ''Lost'' message boards from the moment he arrived, pretending to be a hapless lost balloonist, allowing himself to be captured and eventually tortured by the show's supposed heroes. It is his eyes -- slightly protruding and, when he is angry, disturbingly intense -- that have been remarked upon the most. The dead-gray color of a winter sky, they somehow manage to convey both danger and vulnerability, cruelty and pain: Peter Lorre eyes.
 ''Generations of serial killers have taught us that it's the meek fellow next door with the spectacles that you've kind of got to watch out for,'' said Mr. Emerson, who won an Emmy in 2001 for playing another compellingly creepy character, a confessed murderer, on ''The Practice.'' 
 ''I have a theory about this, and maybe my theories are rationalizations that flatter me,'' he said. ''But I think America, as a culture, is so suspicious of articulation. We don't like talkers; we like doers. So we're pleased to have our villains be verbal and articulate. There's a tension between being mild-mannered, soft-spoken and a purveyor of violence.''
 My instinct,'' he said of his portrayal of Henry Gale, ''was always to give little away, to put the focus on others and sort of not be there. And, somehow, the more I disappear, the more people worry about me.''
 The ''Lost'' executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse had seen Mr. Emerson's guest appearance on ''The Practice,'' in an episode written by David E. Kelley, and when coming up with the idea of a leader for the Others decided, according to Mr. Lindelof, that, ''we need to do the David Kelley trick where the audience is convinced one week that a character is a raving lunatic and the next week think they are being absolutely railroaded.''
 Mr. Emerson grew up in tiny Toledo, Iowa; studied theater and art at Drake University in Des Moines; and in 1976, right out of college, moved to New York to begin the acting career he knew he was meant to have.
 ''I hadn't a clue or any friends or contacts to say, 'Well, here's how you might begin auditioning,' '' he said. ''So I just kind of let go of my acting dream, put it on the back burner and tried not to think about it. It was kind of painful.''
 He said he worked for a while at a Pottery Barn in Manhattan, but eventually fell back on a career as an illustrator, ''not knowing that it was every bit as tough a racket as acting.'' 
 He was good at it, successful enough to become a regular contributor to, among other publications, The New York Times. ''I did all right,'' he said. ''It was hard work. And I'm sort of an obsessive-compulsive person. My technique, the way I drew pictures, was very painstaking and slow. So it didn't make economic sense. I would slave for a week over a drawing that would pay me $100. So the more I drew, the poorer I got.''
 When he left New York for Jacksonville, Fla., in 1980, he told himself it was because of a woman and because he'd grown tired of the solitary illustrator's life. But the real reason Mr. Emerson left New York, he said, was to give himself a chance to rekindle his acting dreams. He started doing community theater in Jacksonville, supporting himself between plays with landscape gardening, carpentry, house painting, any outdoor job he could find. He worked his way up to regional theater, playing Equity houses around the South. Then, after a year of fine-tuning at the University of Alabama's Masters of Fine Arts program, he returned to New York in 1995, by then 40, smarter, more confident and less likely to be driven away.
 In 1997, just as he was starting to consider whether returning to regional theater might be a better idea, Mr. Emerson landed the lead role in Moises Kaufman's ''Gross Indecency,'' about the trials of Oscar Wilde. After rave Off Broadway reviews, the play went on to a national tour, and Mr. Emerson's career took off with roles on Broadway (''The Iceman Cometh'') and a string of small and mostly villainous parts in films and television that eventually led to ''The Practice.'' 
 When his run on ''Lost'' ends, Mr. Emerson wants to return to New York. ''The stage is what will save me,'' he said, asked if he feared being typecast as creepy villains for the rest of his life. ''The plays I do -- Shakespeare, Ibsen, O'Neill -- let me play other types. And that will sort of clear the palate.''
 As to when that might happen, Mr. Emerson has no idea. ''You would not be a wise actor to get too comfortable there,'' he said of his life in Hawaii and on ''Lost.'' ''Showbiz in general, and 'Lost' inparticular, shows you that it ain't forever. And I would think if you're playing a villain, if episode after episode you are in harm's way, then the day could come when you might not make it. It wouldn't take a whole rearrangement of the story line for me to be gone.''

HEADLINE: Looking at a Stalled World Through a Renault Windshield

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
Depression, drugs and professional stasis commingle in ''The Magic Gloves,'' a limp urban comedy not nearly as whimsical as its title. Written and directed by Martin Rejtman, an Argentine Jim Jarmusch whose taste for the absurd is irretrievably heavy-hearted, the movie circles characters whose stalled lives reflect a larger economic blight. 
 Chief among these is Alejandro (Gabriel Fernandez Capello), a 35-year-old freelance cabdriver -- he shuttles people around in a decrepit Renault -- whose live-in relationship has just died of boredom. Alejandro's friends, like him, are all trapped several rungs below their aspirations: a flight attendant who dreams of international travel, a musician relentlessly playing his self-produced CD to captive guests, an actor who settled for a career in pornography. Their desultory attempts to change course are dampened by a pervasive melancholy that no one seems capable of dispelling -- least of all our easygoing protagonist, whose passivity grows increasingly wearisome with every passing scene.
 Enervated and uninvolving, ''The Magic Gloves'' plays out in the foreground of a smudged, featureless Buenos Aires, which slips past the Renault's windows without registering a personality. Paths cross and lock without import, and lives inch sideways (the cabdriver becomes a bus driver) to no purpose. 
 At times the movie recalls the surrealism -- if not the danger or momentum -- of Martin Scorsese's ''After Hours,'' and the fleeting moments of deadpan humor are pungent enough to suggest that Mr. Rejtman is saving himself for greater things. 

The Magic Gloves
Opens today in Manhattan.

Written (in Spanish, with English subtitles) and directed by Martin Rejtman; director of photography, Jose Luis Garcia; edited by Rosario Suarez; music by Diego Vainer; produced by Hernan Musaluppi and Mr. Rejtman; released by Cinema Tropical. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is not rated.

WITH: Gabriel Fernandez Capello (Alejandro), Valeria Bertuccelli (Valeria), Fabian Arenillas (Sergio), Susana Pampin (Susana), Cecilia Biagini (Cecilia) and Diego Olivera (Luis).

HEADLINE: Cezanne Brings the Top Price at Auction

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
No matter what the economic climate, great works of art bring great prices at auction. But when a sale of Impressionist and modern art that can best be described as a mixed bag brings strong prices -- as the standing-room-only crowd at Sotheby's witnessed last night -- it shows just how many new buyers don't seem to mind that works had been on the market in the not too distant past. 
 ''People are feeling very optimistic,'' said Alberto Mugrabi, a Manhattan dealer, as the sale was coming to an end. ''The sale did far better than anyone thought it would.'' 
Throughout the evening, paintings by masters like Cezanne, Modigliani and Matisse that had been up at auction in recent years not only sold but also brought solid prices. Although there were few fireworks and only an occasional bidding war, the evening totaled $238.6 million, Sotheby's highest auction total since spring 1990 and right in the middle of its estimate, $219 million to $299 million. Of the 83 lots, only 11 went unsold. 
 Savvy dealers like William Acquavella were betting on market's good health. Mr. Acquavella was the seller of the evening's prize painting and the most expensive work of the evening: a 1895 Cezanne, ''Still Life With Fruits and Ginger Jar,'' one of the last still lifes by the artist still in private hands. It was exhibited in his first retrospective in Paris the year it was painted and has been owned by several other famous dealers, among them Ambroise Vollard and Bruno Cassirer. Mr. Acquavella had bought it at Christie's in London six years ago for $18.1 million; last night it was expected to bring $28 million to $35 million and ended up going to an unidentified telephone bidder for $36.9 million. Mr. Acquavella had astutely negotiated a guarantee -- an undisclosed minimum price promised to the seller regardless of a sale's outcome -- that experts said was more than $30 million. 
 (Prices of record include Sotheby's commission: 20 percent of the first $200,000 of the hammer price and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
 The Cezanne wasn't the only painting from the 2000 London season that was back on the market. Monet's ''Beach at Trouville,'' a sun-dappled seascape, fetched $16.4 million then, after selling for $10.7 million at Christie's in New York in 1988. Last night, it was estimated at $16.5 million to $20 million. But the audience thought that was too much, and the painting went unsold. 
 A rash of Modigliani portraits have been on the market in recent years, and several familiar faces were back at Sotheby's. The cover image of the sale's catalog was ''The Concierge's Son,'' Modigiliani's 1918 portrait of a boy sitting with his hands folded in his lap. At first, six bidders went for the painting, which had brought $5.8 million at Christie's in May 1997. But as the numbers rose, only two tenacious contenders held on, one bidding by telephone and the other, Doris Ammann, a Zurich dealer, in the salesroom. Ms. Ammann bought the painting for $31 million, far above its $18 million high estimate. 
 More familiar, perhaps, was the artist's 1916 portrait of the art dealer Paul Guillaume. The painting had been at auction twice in the last 10 years, first at Christie's in 1996, when the Las Vegas casino owner Stephen A. Wynn bought it for $3.4 million, and then at Sotheby's in New York in 2000 for $4.6 million. Last night the Nahmad Gallery, dealers in New York and London, bought it for $4.8 million, just below its $5 million low estimate.
 Popular tastes these days have been gravitating toward Expressionist paintings, and last night Kandinsky's 1908 landscape ''Lake Starnberg'' had many bidders interested. The painting, estimated at $6 million to $8 million, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $9 million. 
 The sale included 12 Picassos; some did better than others. One of the evening's biggest casualties was was ''The Rescue'' (1932), showing a group of female bathers at the beach. Jerome Fisher, a Palm Beach collector, bought the painting at Sotheby's in 1993 for $4.4 million. Last night it was estimated at $12 million to $16 million, but bidding stopped at $10.7 million. It had been in the collector of Stanley J. Seeger, a reclusive American who lives in London. Another painting from the same series was sold at Sotheby's two years for $14.7 million. 
 Not all the strong prices were paid for modern works. Many Impressionist paintings performed well, often being bought by dealers like Richard Green from London, who were obviously buying for stock. ''There was incredible depth in the Impressionist market,'' said David Norman, head of Impressionist and modern art for Sotheby's worldwide. ''When we got the estimates right, people responded.'' 
 Still, many in the audience wondered if buyers were holding out for tonight's stronger sale at Christie's. ''If this sale was any indication,'' said Sandy Heller, a Manhattan art adviser, ''then Christie's should be a blockbuster.''

HEADLINE: Turkey and Europe: Why Strained Friendship Is Fraying

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
The already reluctant partnership between Turkey and the European Union looks increasingly as if it may be headed for a messy breakup, prompting many in Europe and the United States to ask an uncomfortable question: will the large, secular Muslim country then look east instead of west? 
 It is a question with potentially great consequences.
''If the E.U. turns its back on Turkey, it is the West that will be the big loser,'' warns Mehmet Dulger of the ruling Justice and Development Party and the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Parliament. ''The West would risk losing a vital bridge with the Islamic world at a time when having this bridge is more important than ever.'' 
 The mutual suspicion is reaching a crisis point. On Wednesday, the European Commission is to release a report critical of the progress Turkey has made toward conforming to European standards and toward qualifying for membership. 
 A more important deadline looms next month at a European summit meeting, where leaders could decide to suspend talks with Turkey on a number of problems, while continuing in other areas. This is something the group never did as it was expanding to its current 25 members. 
 Political analysts in Turkey say such a rebuff would intensify an anti-European backlash and play into the hands of nationalists and Islamists, some of whom are already asking whether the country should reject Europe before it rejects Turkey.
 ''Until recently, Turkey has been able to pursue pro-Western policies because public opinion believed this was in the national interest,'' said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish research program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''But with the E.U. constantly raising the bar for Turkey, Turks are questioning this accepted wisdom.''
 From Europe there are equal measures of exasperation. 
 ''Patience with Turkey is running out,'' says Joost Lagendijk, a member of the Dutch Green Party and co-chairman of a committee dealing with Turkish issues in the European Parliament. It is not only the question of Turkey's reforming to meet European standards, but a wariness of admitting a poor, overwhelmingly Muslim country of 70 million with only 3 percent of its land geographically a part of Europe. 
 Those positions may harden with the European Commission report on Wednesday, which is expected to rebuke Turkey for the sluggish pace of political reforms. A draft of the report cited Turkey's refusal to meet a deadline this year to open its ports to the Greek-speaking part of Cyprus, an issue on which Turkey refuses to move. It also complains about the treatment of minorities, and a law limiting free speech that has made ''insulting Turkishness'' a crime. 
 The enlargement commissioner of the European Union, Olli Rehn of Finland, welcomed signals this week from Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan that he would consider reforming Turkey's code on free speech. But European officials say Turkish intransigence over Cyprus, a member of the union, leaves them with few alternatives other than to consider a partial suspension of entry talks. 
 But even a partial collapse of talks would have far-reaching consequences. Bordered by Iran, Iraq and Syria, secular Turkey is a powerful symbol of how democracy, capitalism and Islam can co-exist. At a time when Europe is struggling to integrate its 12 million Muslims, rejecting Turkey would give fodder to those Muslims who argue that the West will never accept them. 
 Faced with a barrage of criticism, some analysts say a dejected Turkey would look to the Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa as alternatives to Europe and the United States. A June poll by the Pew Research Center found that Turkish support for the United States had plummeted to 12 percent, from 23 percent last year. Support for the European Union plunged to 35 percent, half what it was two years ago. 
 Mr. Cagaptay argues that the Justice and Development Party, which has religious roots, has already been reorienting the country toward the Middle East and criticizing the United States. As an example he points to the American-led attack on Iraqi insurgents in Falluja, an attack that was labeled genocide by senior Turkish officials. 
 At the same time, he says, the European Union's continual snubbing of Turkey has played into the hands of Muslim conservatives, and all the while Prime Minister Erdogan ''is preaching Muslim solidarity and consciousness,'' Mr. Cagaptay said.
 At the beginning of the conflict in Lebanon in the summer, Mr. Erdogan criticized Israel for trying to ''wipe out the Palestinians'' in Lebanon. In the spring he invited top Palestinian officials to the capital, Ankara. A recent demonstration in Istanbul against Israel, which has maintained strong relations with Turkey, drew around 100,000 people; before the Erdogan era, Mr. Cagaptay said, a few hundred might have attended. 
 The appeal of the East was evident on a recent day at Cemberlitas Hamam, a monumental 16th-century Turkish bath, where a dozen men lay on a giant slab of steaming marble as they were pummeled by pot-bellied masseurs in an Ottoman tradition rooted in the Orient.
 Kadir Uzun, 21, a Turkish engineer who lives in Germany, said the European Union's hardening stance was prompting Turks to question whether the Arab world would be more welcoming. ''Many Turks feel like we are just wasting our time with the E.U., which will never accept a Muslim country,'' he said. ''We are too Western to look toward Iran, but we are also too Eastern for the E.U.'' 
 Many Turkish analysts, officials and executives argue that looking to the East is not an option. For one thing, Turkey is viewed with deep suspicion there. 
 ''We do not want to become overextended in the Middle East,'' says Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat in Tripoli. ''At the same time, the countries that were ruled by the Ottoman empire -- Egypt, Jordan, Syria -- are reluctant about Turkey having a leading role in the region.''
 Also, secularism is established in its Constitution, and Turkey is inextricably tied to the West, economically and strategically, by, among other things, a trade agreement with the European Union and membership in NATO. To these analysts and executives, it is less imperative to join Europe than it is to anchor Turkey to a membership process that assures political and economic reform.
 But there are obvious signs that Islam is strengthening its grip on daily life. Members of Mr. Erdogan's party have set up zones where liquor is banned in accordance with Islam, though drinking has long been accepted in Turkish society. Secularists have looked with alarm at proposals for women-only parks in Istanbul and the introduction of government-recommended textbooks with Islamic themes, including a character in a Hans Christian Andersen story who wears a head scarf.
 Rather than choosing between the Middle East or the West, a wounded Turkey could turn to the emerging economic giants of Russia, India and China in search of allies. Russia has expressed keen interest in using Turkey as a distribution point for energy supplies to the Middle East and the southern Mediterranean. 
 But Egemen Bagis, a senior adviser to Mr. Erdogan, counters that Turkey will stay moored to Europe, with or without the European Union. 
 ''If the talks with the E.U. fail,'' he said, ''we can be a prosperous, Western-looking democracy outside the E.U. Norway has done this, and so why can't we? We are undertaking reforms not for the E.U., but for the Turkish people.''

HEADLINE: Rival's Concession Clears Way for Ortega, Once and Future President of Nicaragua 

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.; Jill Replogle contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
As election officials finished the final vote tallies on Tuesday and his leading opponent conceded defeat, Daniel Ortega, the onetime cold-war nemesis of the United States, was assured of winning the presidency here and fulfilling his 16-year struggle to regain power.
 With 91 percent of the vote counted from Sunday's balloting, Mr. Ortega led five other candidates with 38 percent of the vote, while the second-place candidate, Eduardo Montealegre, a conservative, trailed with 29 percent, election officials said Tuesday night. The third-place candidate, Jose Rizo, received 26 percent. 
 ''With his triumph, he has taken on an enormous responsibility,'' Mr. Montealegre, a 51-year-old Harvard-trained banker, said as he stepped aside moments after the results were announced. ''He has to govern democratically.''
 Later in the evening, Mr. Ortega and Mr. Montealegre appeared together at the Sandinista headquarters, where they pledged to put aside past differences. Mr. Ortega promised to keep the country open to foreign investment and to seek consensus with his political opponents to battle poverty. 
 ''Here we cannot talk about winners or losers,'' he said. ''Here simply we have a process where really everyone will work together for the good of Nicaragua.''
 About 300 of Mr. Ortega's supporters rallied outside the headquarters, waving their party's black and red flags and chanting ''The people united will never be defeated.'' Across the city, fireworks and car horns went off in celebration.
 Mr. Ortega, who is 60, maintains that both he and the country have changed since the 1980s, when he was a hard-line Marxist president accepting Soviet aid and fighting a United States-backed insurgency. The cold war is over, and Nicaragua's economy now depends heavily on exports to the United States and free markets. 
 While Mr. Ortega still rails against ''savage capitalism'' and the failure of free trade to alleviate poverty, he has become a more pragmatic leftist over the past decade and a half. Gone is the fiery Marxist oratory, replaced with talk of reconciliation, peace and God. He has traded his anti-American campaign songs for John Lennon's ''Give Peace a Chance.'' 
 He has also become openly religious, regularly attending church and often asking people at his rallies to pray. He even pushed through a bill to ban abortion recently, in part to attract Catholic support.
 Still, no one is sure how much of the change in Mr. Ortega's political outlook is real. Many business leaders and political analysts say the future of this impoverished country may hinge not just on whether Mr. Ortega's style has evolved, but whether Nicaragua's democracy is strong enough to keep a leftist president with an authoritarian past in check.
 ''If he hasn't changed, he will have to change, because it's not the same Nicaragua in 2006 as the Nicaragua in which he came to power at the head of a revolutionary movement,'' said Carlos Tunnerman, a political analyst.
 The United States has made it clear that it does not like the prospect of its cold war foe returning to power, especially in light of Mr. Ortega's close relationship with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. Still, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States would respect the decision of the Nicaraguan people and see what policies the next government follows before making decisions about future relations. Bush administration officials had threatened before the vote to suspend aid if Mr. Ortega won.
 Former President Jimmy Carter monitored the polling here and said the election was clean and fair. He said Mr. Ortega had given him assurances Monday night that he would respect property rights, civil liberties, free enterprise and the free trade agreement with the United States. 
 Business leaders said they were confident Mr. Ortega would not roll back the free-market reforms in the Nicaraguan government since 1990, when he agreed to hold an election to end the civil war and lost to Violeta Chamorro. 
 Since then, the government has sold off more than 360 state-owned enterprises, liberalized its markets, privatized the banks and entered a free trade agreement with the United States and its neighbors. 
 Erwin J. Kruger, president of the Superior Council of the Private Sector, the nation's largest business group, said Mr. Ortega and his party, the Sandinista National Liberation Front, had given assurances they would not dismantle the free-market economy. 
 ''We don't know how he's going to be tomorrow, or next month, or next year, but we are going to give it a chance,'' Mr. Kruger said. ''We paid a high price for our freedom and neither side wants to lose that.''
 Most political strategists said Mr. Ortega won because the conservative anti-Sandinista vote split in two.
 After former President Arnoldo Aleman was convicted on corruption charges, Mr. Montealegre and other conservatives broke away from the governing Constitutionalist Liberal Party and formed the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance. As a result, Mr. Montealegre and Mr. Rizo, who carried the banner for the old ruling party, divided the voters who had consistently opposed Mr. Ortega and the Sandinistas in past elections, defeating him three times. 
 Mr. Ortega's ability to enact radical challenges is severely hampered by the National Assembly, which remains divided between four parties. To rule, he must reach agreements with the two conservative parties. What is more, the president's power has been curbed by constitutional changes pushed through in recent years, giving the assembly more say over cabinet positions.
 Even members of Mr. Ortega's party said he had not won a popular mandate to make radical changes, like the expropriation of private businesses or the redistribution of land, as he did in the late 1980s. 
 ''The important point is not what he wants to do, the important thing is what is feasible to do,'' said Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, an economist and member of the Sandinista party. ''Nicaragua has changed tremendously. The mandate he has received does not give him the opportunity to do his will.''

HEADLINE: Heard the One About Mississippi? It's Fighting Back 

BYLINE: By BRENDA GOODMAN

DATELINE: OXFORD, Miss. 

 BODY:
For decades, a search at the bottom of the nation's barrel of rankings has always seemed to come up with the same state. When anyone wants to know the nation's poorest state, or its fattest, or least educated, or sickest, or most corrupt, the answer has most often been Mississippi.
 It has even been rated the worst place to raise a child. 
Mississippi has long chafed at those perceptions, which in some cases spring more from stereotype than from statistic. Some time back, however, Rick Looser, chief operating officer of the Cirlot advertising agency in Jackson, acting at his own initiative, set out to counter the low self-esteem inspired by them.
 The advertising campaign that Mr. Looser and his colleagues created -- called ''Mississippi, Believe It!'' -- addresses the old cliches directly and seeks to turn them to its advantage as a way of spreading a message about some of the state's more notable accomplishments. 
 The 14 posters in the campaign, which were sent to schools in Mississippi last year, take umbrage at backwoods stereotypes including monster trucks, hog calling and Klan rallies. In smaller print, the posters describe in detail the achievements of native authors, athletes, scientists and businessmen, and the state as a whole.
 ''In Mississippi, we always have our hand out,'' reads one advertisement, showing an open palm. ''But it's usually to give, not receive. And the last shall be first. We always hear about Mississippi being last. Last in this, last in that. Well, at last, Mississippi is first. And what a first place to hold in generosity. For eight years in a row, our generosity has won out over every other state in the nation. Per capita, we give more in relation to income than any other state. Any other state. Mississippi. Yes, our hands are out. And our hearts are open.''
 Another poster, with the headline ''Yes, we can read,'' continues, ''Some of us even write.'' It goes on to list notable Mississippi writers including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and John Grisham.
 The creators of the campaign, who are raising money to spread it nationwide, make no apologies for its direct references to the stereotypes.
 ''We're just talking about the 800-pound gorilla that's already in the room,'' said Mr. Looser, adding that he was trying to save the state from ''list fatigue.''
 Mr. Looser, who created the campaign without charge and has not allowed any corporate logos, even his agency's, to be placed on the posters, said he wanted to start changing the way everyone, especially Mississippians, saw the state.
 In setting out to do that, he said, he realized he was ''biting off a big ol' piece.'' Indeed, there proved to be a fine line between boosterism and apology: many, feeling that the campaign failed to strike the right balance, found its defensiveness an unwelcome surprise.
 Kathy J. Herbert, 46, the receptionist at Oxford Elementary School, agrees that the state needs a better image, saying that when her teenage children travel, they are frequently embarrassed to say they are from Mississippi. But she takes exception to the posters' approach.
 ''I think it's pitiful,'' Ms. Herbert said. ''It's pitiful we have to do that.''
 Others say a public relations campaign to make people feel good about Mississippi only glosses over a need to solve real problems.
 The perceptions of the state ''are not that far off,'' said Kristen M. Chase, who moved from New Jersey to Mississippi in 2002 to take up a post as a college professor and director of a career-oriented undergraduate program. ''It's hard to not be surprised when your students attend separate black and white proms or when you go to a restaurant and the husband of a couple will only talk to your husband.''
 But many Mississippians like the campaign, and say it is time somebody stood up to the stereotype and those who promote them. Many here noticed when Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, in an interview this year about social services, told a reporter for The Dallas Morning News, ''I don't want to become Mississippi.''
 Jolee C. Hussey, the librarian at Oxford High School, said she planned to ask students to write about one of the famous Mississippians pictured on the posters. Ms. Hussey said she supported any effort to show students the possibility of a brighter future.
 ''You've got to make Mississippians have pride,'' she said. ''You've got to make them believe in themselves first to help them rise.''
 Mr. Grisham, the best-selling author, who lives in Oxford, said he understood the sentiment that had brought on the campaign.
 ''It's kind of a way of fighting back, because we do get hammered,'' he said. ''But things aren't all hopeless down here. There is some life and culture and education and football and stuff like that.''
 Still, Mr. Grisham -- who in 1983 ran for the Legislature, successfully, because Mississippi had failed to establish a public kindergarten program, unlike any of the 49 other states -- said the problems were much bigger than collective low self-esteem. 
 ''A P.R. campaign might make us feel good,'' he said, but ''I'm not sure it's going to help anything. What's going to help is education and economic development. We've been on the bottom economically since the Civil War, essentially our entire history.''

HEADLINE: No Atheists in a Foxhole? No Idiots, Either

BYLINE: By Tim Kane and Mackenzie Eaglen. 
Tim Kane is the director of the Center for International Trade and Economics at the Heritage Foundation. Mackenzie Eaglen is a senior policy analyst there.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
THE Pentagon's announcement that all military branches reached or exceeded their active-duty recruiting goals for fiscal year 2006 grabbed plenty of headlines. Small wonder. After all, it flouts the conventional wisdom that our military is mired in an unpopular war. Recruiters must be looking under rocks and bending standards to fill the ranks, right? 
 Wrong. Indeed, a study we conducted of the recruiting classes for all military branches in 1999 and from 2003 through 2005 puts the lie to the crass assumption that the United States is fielding a low-quality military. 
 A common misperception is that the ranks are increasingly filled with relatively uneducated young men and women from low-income households. Yet this myth doesn't hold up under inspection. 
 Our study analyzed demographic data on every single enlistee, not just a sample, and found that in terms of education, last year's recruits were just as qualified as those of any recent year, and maybe the best ever. Over all, wartime recruits since 1999 are in many respects comparable to the youth population on the whole, except that they are on average a bit wealthier, much more likely to have graduated from high school and more rural than their civilian peers. 
 As for the idea that the military poaches from poor families, the fact is that, as the conflict in Iraq continues, youths from wealthy American ZIP codes are volunteering in ever higher numbers. Additionally, enlistees from the poorest fifth of American neighborhoods fell nearly a full percentage point over the last two years, to 13.7 percent. In 1999, that number was exactly 18 percent. 
 Yes, the Army has changed its standards -- for example, our study found that 4.4 percent of Army recruits received Category 4 scores (the lowest ranking) on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test. This is up from 2 percent in previous years, and has been widely touted as evidence of decline. Yet we also found that the percentage of enlistees with Category 1 scores, the highest level, is rising. 
 More important than enlistee test scores is a comparison of military volunteers to their civilian peers. And here there is no contest. Counting enlisted troops only, 29 of 30 have a high school diploma, compared to about 4 out of 5 civilians. And the typical enlistee reads at a level roughly a full grade higher than other young American adults.
 Critics have also focused on the fact that age limits on recruits have been raised -- the Army's old threshold of 35 has been changed to 42 for active-duty troops and to 40 for reserves. But this was simply an acknowledgment of reality: older recruits today are much healthier on average than in previous generations. 
 We also looked at a much-noted curiosity: Why were the years 1999 and 2004 harder for recruiting than the others in our study? The answer, most experts agree, is a strong economy. Indeed, the Pentagon always faces a challenge enlisting young people when jobs are plentiful. Thus the Army is crediting its current recruiting success, in part, to significant cash bonuses and other financial perks. And that's the way it should be: using market incentives for volunteers, not a draft of the less fortunate. 
 While achieving last year's recruiting goals is a success, there is some cause for concern regarding future recruitment and retention efforts -- particularly in the National Guard and Reserves -- if military spending over all isn't increased. We feel that the Army's 2008 budget proposal is $20 billion or more below what it should be. 
 During a time of war abroad and prosperity at home, tens of thousands of young Americans remain willing to make real sacrifices for the rest of us. Congress and the Pentagon should not shortchange them on pay and benefits. The soldiers themselves might appreciate getting paid more of one other thing: Respect, both for their intelligence and their decision to serve.

HEADLINE: Billionaire's $250 Million Donation Saves Private University in Germany

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: BREMEN, Germany, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Klaus J. Jacobs, a German-born billionaire who lives in England and studied at Stanford, came back to his hometown here the other day to announce that he was donating more than $250 million to the International University Bremen.
 The gift is the biggest private donation ever made to a German university -- so big, in fact, that its only real parallel is the kind of mega-philanthropy that periodically swells the coffers of American universities. 
That is precisely the point for Mr. Jacobs and for the newly appointed president of the university, Joachim Treusch. 
 ''I hope that this sets a precedent,'' Mr. Jacobs, 69, said. ''There is a lot of wealth in private and corporate hands in Germany. It certainly would be desirable to see more of it going to institutions.''
 Mr. Treusch aspires to vault the International University Bremen into the front rank of German universities. To do that, he has decided to rename this five-year-old institution Jacobs University Bremen to honor its benefactor and to serve notice of its American-style ambitions.
 ''Stanford is not a place but a name; Harvard is not a place but a name,'' Mr. Treusch said in an interview after the announcement. ''International University Bremen was a rather flat name.''
 It was also on the verge of bankruptcy. Now restored with the money from Mr. Jacobs, this fledgling institution is determined to chart a new course in a country that helped pioneer the modern research university in the 19th century but has lost its edge in recent decades.
 Mr. Jacobs, a Swiss citizen who was born in this bustling northern German city, said he hoped his gesture would encourage more large-scale philanthropy in a land where it is largely unknown.
 Private giving to German universities is limited by several factors, ranging from the lack of a philanthropic tradition to rules that limit the amount of tax-free donations. The biggest hurdle, however, is the state, which has historically been the main financier of higher education.
 One result is that German universities lack the resources of their American rivals. The United States spends 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product on higher education; the Germans, only 1.1 percent.
 Germany's most famous universities -- Heidelberg, Humboldt and Munich -- are public institutions, largely financed by federal and regional governments. Until recently, tuition was nominal. Starting next year, they will be allowed to charge 500 euros ($635) a semester.
 ''In Germany, the call for the state is the easy one to make,'' said Mr. Jacobs, who inherited his family's coffee company and expanded it into chocolate, amassing one of Europe's great private fortunes. ''It's always there, and if you shout loud enough, you get the money.''
 The Bremen university, which teaches engineering, science, humanities and social sciences, is private -- one of a few dozen in Germany. Though it received some start-up capital from the Bremen government, it has had to survive on tuition and fund-raising. Tuition for undergraduates is $19,050 a year, and $550 a month for room and board.
 Fund-raising has been erratic, apart from a gift of 10 million Swiss francs ($8 million) from the Jacobs foundation in 2001, which established the Jacobs Center for Lifelong Learning. Without this new gift, the university would have run out of cash by next April.
 ''It's about the minimum we needed to stay open,'' said Mr. Treusch, a theoretical physicist who negotiated the donation with Mr. Jacobs over three months. ''We still have to struggle, but that's O.K.''
 The decision to rename the university for a businessman was not universally welcomed. A few students complained that it was not dignified. In Germany, extreme wealth is still viewed with suspicion rather than reverence. Others countered that the Jacobs name and money would help the university establish a distinct brand image, not to mention keep it afloat.
 It is to receive 15 million euros ($19 million) a year from the Jacobs foundation for the next five years to defray its operating expenses. In 2011, Mr. Jacobs will turn over the balance of the gift -- 125 million euros ($158 million) -- to support teaching and research ''at a competitive level.''
 The notion of competition is also evolving in Germany. Since the early 1970's, when admissions were thrown open by government decree, there has been a sort of artificial equality among German schools, which masked disparities in the quality of teachers and students.
 Now Germany is acknowledging those differences by channeling hundreds of millions of euros into so-called elite universities, chosen last month by a panel of public officials and scholars.
 The International University Bremen did not make it into that charmed circle, but the gift from Mr. Jacobs is double the amount that the three elite schools -- the University of Munich, the Technical University of Munich and the University of Karlsruhe -- will each receive over the same period.
 Germany has other private universities, but they tend to specialize in disciplines like law or management. Otto Beisheim, a wealthy merchant, endowed a management school at Witten/Herdecke University, Germany's oldest private university, in the industrial Ruhr Valley.
 Jacobs University is housed on a converted German military base. Three-quarters of its 1,000 students come from outside Germany, with half from Eastern Europe and Russia. Classes are taught in English.
 That cosmopolitan mix appealed to Mr. Jacobs. ''There is no other university like this in Europe,'' he said.
 Putting his name on the door in Bremen, Mr. Jacobs said, was as big a risk for him as it was for the university, since their fortunes are now publicly linked. Still, he said, he would play only an advisory role.
 Why didn't Mr. Jacobs give his millions to his own alma mater, the University of Hamburg? ''They didn't ask,'' he said.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 17, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 8 about Klaus J. Jacobs, a German-born billionaire who is donating more than $250 million to the International University Bremen, misstated the name of an institution that another German businessman, Otto Beisheim, endowed.

PERSON: Ham Richardson

HEADLINE: Ham Richardson, 73, a Star In Tennis Despite Diabetes 

BYLINE: By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
Ham Richardson, who surmounted juvenile diabetes to become a leading American tennis player in the 1950s and early '60s, died Sunday in Manhattan. He was 73.
 The cause was complications of diabetes, his family said. 
 When he was 15 years old and one of the best junior players in the United States, Richardson was found to have diabetes.
 ''The first physician we went to said I could not play competitive tennis again,'' Richardson recalled in a 1997 interview with The New Orleans Times-Picayune. ''So I went to a second doctor. He said the same thing, so I went to a third. When I finally found one who said I wouldn't have to give it up, my tennis picked up right where it left off.''
 Richardson, a native of Baton Rouge, La., was a two-time N.C.A.A. singles champion at Tulane University, then went on to an outstanding career in amateur tennis in the final decade before the open era.
 He was the No. 1-ranked player in the United States in 1956 and 1958, won 17 national titles and played on seven Davis Cup teams with a record of 20-2. He teamed with Alex Olmedo to win the men's doubles at the United States Nationals, the forerunner of the United States Open, at Forest Hills in Queens in 1958.
 Richardson and Olmedo came back from a two-set deficit to win the doubles in the Davis Cup finals against Australia at Brisbane in December 1958, after the Aussies defeated the United States in the finals the three previous years. They outlasted Mal Anderson and Neale Fraser, 10-12, 3-6, 16-14, 6-3, 7-5, and the Americans went on to a 3-2 victory.
 Hamilton Farrar Richardson's triumphs came among continuing struggles with diabetes. 
 When he won the 1950 French junior championship, he had to spend every night at a Paris hospital while doctors tried to stabilize his fluctuating blood-sugar levels. He passed out as a result of low blood sugar on the way to a party the evening before he was to play in the finals of a Newport, R.I., tournament in 1951, then won the championship in a five-set match.
 After earning a bachelor's degree in economics at Tulane, Richardson was a Rhodes scholar. He was studying at Oxford University, from which he received a master's degree, the first time he was ranked No. 1. 
 He worked in the investment field for the past 35 years and at his death was president of Richardson and Associates, a New York investment and venture capital firm.
 Richardson is survived by his wife, Midge Turk Richardson, a past editor in chief of Seventeen magazine; his sons, Kevin, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and Kenneth, of Eastchester, N.Y., and a daughter, Kathryn Ann Sawers, of Dallas, from a previous marriage that ended in divorce; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Paper Ousts Top Editor

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Dean Baquet, the editor of The Los Angeles Times, who defied orders from his corporate bosses to cut jobs, was forced out of his own job yesterday, shocking the newsroom just as it was gearing up to cover election returns.
 He is to leave his post Friday and be succeeded by James O'Shea, the managing editor of The Chicago Tribune, who will start Monday.
 Mr. Baquet's departure follows that of the paper's publisher, Jeffrey M. Johnson, who openly objected to cuts ordered by the Tribune Company in September and was fired last month. 
 David Hiller, who succeeded Mr. Johnson as publisher, said in a statement yesterday that he had had discussions with Mr. Baquet about staffing levels. While the company maintained its position that further cuts might be necessary, Mr. Baquet still considered them excessive. 
 ''After considerable discussion during the past several weeks,'' Mr. Hiller said, ''Dean and I concluded that we have significant differences on the future direction of The Times.'' 
 Colleagues of Mr. Baquet said the firing had less to do with a dispute over job cuts than his vocal resistance to them, made plain in a speech last month in New Orleans, in which he encouraged editors at other newspapers to ''push back'' against owners who wanted to cut newsroom staffs. In fact, when Mr. Hiller addressed the newsroom yesterday, he said he expected no job cuts, at least for the rest of the year, and he told editors it was still possible that any further cuts could be reached through attrition, according to people at the paper.
 Mr. Hiller said in an interview later that public debate was not a ''fatal problem.'' But he added of Mr. Baquet's speech in New Orleans: ''I did not think it was helpful to Dean and me in working through things. My issue was what it said about whether we saw eye to eye on how we lead this great newspaper forward.'' 
 Of future job cuts, he said he did not know what next year would bring, and he did not have a specific staffing level in mind, but that ''over time'' he expected that the staff would be reduced. In the last five years, the newsroom's size has fallen to 940 from about 1,200.
 The Los Angeles Times has steadily lost circulation in the last decade or so, falling to 776,000 daily as of Sept. 30 from a peak of 1.2 million in 1990. 
 The two-month showdown in Los Angeles has been a stark example of the conflict between many newsrooms and boardrooms across the country as papers face an economic slump and continued demands by Wall Street for improved financial results. 
 The stock prices of most public newspaper companies have fallen in the last two years, yet many of the publications remain profitable. The Los Angeles Times reported that its operating profit margin was 20 percent, higher than that of the average Fortune 500 company.
 Mr. Hiller said in his statement that changes were ''threatening the financial position of the whole industry,'' and that the cuts were not about maintaining high profit margins. ''Look no further than recent reports on other large metro papers in Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas and San Francisco,'' he said. 
 Many colleagues of Mr. Baquet said they had considered his departure a matter of time. The news was supposed to have been announced tomorrow, but word began leaking out yesterday, and at midafternoon, Mr. Baquet confirmed it to his staff. ''Believe me, I didn't want it to come out this way,'' he wrote in a memo. He could not be reached for comment last night.
 Many on the staff of The Los Angeles Times said the news caught them off guard and threw the paper into turmoil, coming on election night, one of the busiest and most complicated times for news organizations. Mr. Baquet's departure, on top of the potential sale of the paper, creates even further uncertainty for the staff.
 ''People are crushed,'' said Alice Short, a deputy metropolitan editor. ''People really believed in Dean and that as long as he was in that front office, we were going to be O.K.''
 Vernon Loeb, an investigations editor, said the employees were stricken. ''It was like a parent had just died,'' he said. ''We've kidded ourselves into thinking that Dean is such an artful dodger, he could play this string out forever.''
 It was not immediately clear whether other editors who were close to Mr. Baquet would leave in solidarity with him. But the two managing editors said they would stay. One, Douglas Frantz, said in a memo to the staff, ''While I'm angry and heartbroken, I'm not quitting.'' The other, Leo C. Wolinsky, said, ''Losing Dean is the most difficult change I've had to weather.'' But he added, ''I intend to stay and fight to keep this paper great.'' 
 Mr. Baquet's prospects for future employment, at least in the newspaper business, seemed uncertain. For Mr. Baquet, editor of the country's fourth-largest paper, there are only a few other newspaper jobs that would be considered promotions or even lateral moves. His options might be further limited by a reluctance on the part of publishers to hire someone who had defied his paper's owners.
 Moreover, Mr. Baquet had begun going on the road with his message of newsroom resistance. In his speech in New Orleans, he encouraged editors at other papers to resist cuts, a problematic view as the newspaper industry retrenches and many papers are cutting their staffs.
 ''We need to be a feistier bunch,'' Mr. Baquet said there at the annual meeting of The Associated Press Managing Editors. He said the public service aspect of newspapers was at stake, even as the industry faced declining revenue. ''We understand the business model is changing and we have to do some cutting,'' he said, ''but don't understand it too much.''
 The news of Mr. Baquet's ouster prompted a local group, the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, to urge subscribers to tell the Tribune Company to stop further cuts at the paper or to risk cancellation of their subscriptions. 
 Jamie Court, president of the group, which is nonpartisan and nonprofit, also scolded the company for allowing the news to come out on a busy news day, saying, ''It is obvious that the owner of Los Angeles's largest news organization wanted to bury this news in the maelstrom of Election Day, even at the risk of shaking up its staff.'' 
 Mr. O'Shea was named managing editor at The Chicago Tribune in 2001. Before then, he was deputy managing editor for news and worked in a variety of assignments, having joined the paper in 1979 after serving as a reporter, editor and Washington correspondent for The Des Moines Register.
 Mr. Baquet's staff gave him a sustained ovation yesterday as he stood on a desk in the newsroom to announce he was leaving. He said he did not want them to dwell on the last month but to remember the last six years -- when the paper broke news stories, forced laws to be changed and won Pulitzer Prizes. His management team stood behind him. 
 Mr. Hiller climbed on the desk afterward. He said he had hoped this day would never come.
 The Tribune Company, under pressure from investors, is considering selling some or all its assets, which include 10 other papers and two dozen television stations.
 David Geffen and two other Los Angeles billionaires have expressed interest in acquiring The Times. The hope of some in the newsroom is that Mr. Geffen, or someone, will buy the paper and rehire Mr. Baquet as editor.

HEADLINE: Lagging Car Sales Reduce Borrowing

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing fell in September by the most since the recession in the early 1990's, weakened by a big drop in auto loans, a report from the Federal Reserve said Tuesday. 
 The Fed said that consumer borrowing declined at an annual pace of 0.6 percent in September, in contrast to an increase of 4.6 percent in August. Borrowing fell by $1.2 billion in September, the biggest decline since a $1.78 billion decrease in April 1992.
It was the first decline since March, when borrowing edged down by 0.24 percent.
 Borrowing in the category that includes auto loans slipped at an annual pace of 3.2 percent in September, reversing an increase of 3.5 percent the previous month. In dollar terms, those September loans fell by $4.05 billion, the largest decrease since a drop of $4.81 billion in October 1991.
 By contrast, the Fed report showed that borrowing in the category that includes credit cards rose at an annual pace of 4 percent in September, down from a 6.7 percent pace in August.
 The Fed's consumer credit report does not include mortgages or other loans that are secured by real estate.

HEADLINE: High-End or Starter Homes, Builders Remain in a Slump 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Two of the nation's major home builders reported dismal results in their most recent quarters yesterday, confirming that the slump in the once-hot housing market is far from over. 
 Toll Brothers, the country's largest builder of luxury homes, said revenue from home building fell 10 percent, to $1.81 billion in its fourth quarter, ended Oct. 31, compared with $2.01 billion in the period a year earlier. The results are preliminary; the company will report earnings on Dec. 5.
Toll Brothers' backlog of projects declined 25 percent and its signed contracts plunged 55 percent as the company suffered from a rash of cancellations concentrated in the formerly hot markets of Florida and Northern California. 
 ''I don't think we can call where the floor is,'' said Joel Rassman, chief financial officer of Toll Brothers. ''We have not seen a turnaround yet.'' 
 The decline was not limited to the luxury segment of the housing market. The Atlanta-based Beazer Homes USA, a smaller rival that builds many homes for first-time buyers, reported that net income fell 44 percent, to $91.9 million, or $2.19 a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $164.4 million, or $3.61 a share, in the period in 2005. 
 Revenue increased 4 percent, to $1.88 billion. But new orders plummeted 58 percent, and the company forecast a substantial decline in earnings for 2007.
 More than a year into a housing market bust, the home builders' deteriorating fortunes are hardly a surprise. In September, sales of both new and existing homes were running around 14 percent below their level a year earlier. 
 Home prices have not fallen uniformly across the nation; in some areas, they have, however, declined steeply. By September, the average price of a newly built home was about 2 percent below the price of a year earlier, according to government figures. 
 Stuck with unsold inventory that is the equivalent of more than six months of sales, builders have slammed on the brakes. New-housing starts in September were running about 18 percent below their level in September 2005.
 Toll Brothers, which is based in Horsham, Pa., cut its forecast for home deliveries in 2007 by 9 percent to 10 percent, compared with its previous forecast. And it trimmed its portfolio of land to 74,000 lots, 19 percent below its high in the fiscal second quarter, which ran from February through April.
 James O'Leary, chief financial officer at Beazer Homes, said the company reduced its number of lots by 15 percent in the quarter. It also cut about 1,000 jobs in September and October, about 25 percent of the company head count.
 The slump in construction has hurt the broader economy. Residential investment, which accounts for about 5 percent of the nation's total economic production, plummeted 17.4 percent in the third quarter of the year, according to government data. It was the biggest quarterly decline in more than 15 years, single-handedly reducing the growth in gross domestic product by roughly 1.1 percentage points.
 Mr. Rassman at Toll Brothers argued that the housing market's chill is a question of confidence, ''led by the consumer being afraid'' that prices might fall. But he argued that still-low interest rates combined with continued employment growth should eventually feed through into growing demand for homes.
 Economists, however, point out that it will take some time for builders to clear out their bloated inventory of unsold houses -- a requisite for them to break their fall. With home prices still high by historical standards compared with potential buyers' incomes, this may be a protracted process, requiring more income gains or price declines.
 Richard DeKaser, chief economist at the National City Corporation, predicted that it would take about 9 to 12 months for the supply and demand of homes to come back into balance. ''We are probably two-thirds of the way down the slope,'' Mr. DeKaser said. ''The bulk of the decline is behind us, but we are not yet out of the woods.''

HEADLINE: Toyota Profit Jumps 34%; Sales Forecasts Are Raised 

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and MICHELINE MAYNARD; Martin Fackler reported from Tokyo and Micheline Maynard from Detroit.

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Toyota Motor's profit for the last three months rose 34 percent, the company said Tuesday, as it released a forecast showing that it is on track to become the world's biggest auto company as early as 2007.
 Record sales in North America fed Toyota's rise in profit during the quarter that ended in September. It grabbed market share from Detroit's struggling auto companies with strong sales for its fuel-efficient vehicles like the RAV-4 sport utility vehicle, the Yaris subcompact and its Prius hybrid-electric vehicle. 
Toyota officials raised their sales forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2007 to 8.47 million vehicles. They also said the company expects to sell 9.8 million vehicles in the fiscal year ending March 2008, with about 3 million of those sales coming in North America. 
 That forecast would easily put it ahead of General Motors as the world's biggest automaker, and analysts say Toyota may pass G.M. next year or even later this year.
 G.M. sold 9.2 million vehicles worldwide last year, but its sales and market share have dropped in 2006, when it has battled to bounce back from a financial crisis in the United States that has led to its latest revamping efforts. G.M. is expected to sell 9.2 million vehicles this year, but it has not issued forecasts for 2007.
 On Friday, Toyota will dedicate its seventh North American assembly plant in San Antonio, where it is building a new, bigger version of its Tundra pickup truck that is set to be introduced early next year.
 Toyota officials are also deciding whether to expand the San Antonio plant or build an eighth assembly plant in North America, as well as whether to build another engine plant. 
 Tennessee, Arkansas, Virginia and Mississippi remain the four leading candidates to land the new assembly plant, if Toyota decides to build it instead of expanding in San Antonio, people involved in the discussions said Tuesday.
 American officials have not yet made a recommendation to Japan about a site for the plant. One factor will be the outcome of Tuesday's elections, these people said, insisting on anonymity because of the confidential nature of the deliberations.
 Toyota also is deciding whether to build another vehicle at its largest North American factory in Georgetown, Ky., where it produces the Camry sedan, the best-selling car in the United States.
 The Georgetown factory recently began building a hybrid version of the Camry. It also produces the Solara coupe.
 Officials at the Georgetown factory, which has already cleared space for a new model, hope Toyota will make a decision in early 2007, said Gary Convis, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America.
 ''We want to show Toyota we have the flexibility, the space, the intellectual property and the capability. We want them to say, 'Kentucky can do that,' '' Mr. Convis, who also is president of the Georgetown plant, said in an interview this week.
 Among the possibilities, analysts said, is a crossover vehicle, perhaps even a car that Toyota has not yet announced. Another choice could be a model from Lexus, the top-selling luxury brand in the United States. Mr. Convis said: ''I'd love to build a Lexus. Time will tell.''
 Strong North American sales were one reason Toyota raised its worldwide sales forecast to 8.47 million vehicles from 8.45 million.
 Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, said a weak yen and cost cuts helped offset rising prices for steel and other materials, which have hurt other automakers' profits. It said net profit in the three months through September rose to 405.7 billion yen ($3.45 billion), on sales of 5.83 trillion yen ($49.6 billion). The weaker yen makes exported cars more attractive overseas and dollar-denominated sales more valuable in Japan. 
 G.M. lost $115 million in the quarter, while the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, lost $1.5 billion. Ford Motor, meanwhile, lost $5.8 billion, its biggest quarterly loss in 14 years. 
 The strong gains came despite a spate of recalls that have dented Toyota's reputation for sterling quality and forced the company to step up its efforts to eliminate defects. The quality problems have appeared as the company struggles to keep pace with surging global demand for its vehicles, analysts say.
 ''Our business is growing,'' Takeshi Suzuki, a senior managing director at Toyota, said Tuesday. ''Our biggest job now is to maintain quality and build cars that are competitive in price.''
 Also Tuesday, Toyota announced it would buy a 5.9 percent stake in the smaller Japanese carmaker Isuzu for an undisclosed price, in an apparent bid to strengthen its position in fuel-efficient technologies. Toyota said the companies would jointly develop alternative-fuel engines as well as diesel engines. Last month, a rival, Honda, said it would develop a diesel engine that it planned to offer for sale in its cars.
 Toyota reported strong gains in both the United States and Europe, where it expects to meet its 2010 sales goal two years early. 
 Toyota raised its full-year net profit forecast 18 percent to 1.55 trillion yen ($13.2 billion). The company also said it expected its annual operating profit, which reflects the earnings of its core auto business, to reach 2.2 trillion yen ($18.7 billion). 
 With a market value of about $214 billion, Toyota is by far the world's most valuable auto company, worth more than the next three automakers -- Honda, DaimlerChrysler and Nissan -- combined. By contrast, G.M.'s entire market value is $19.6 billion.
 Toyota said that its quarterly vehicle sales rose 19 percent, to 717,000 vehicles in North America. Unlike Detroit auto companies, whose lineups are still dominated by sport utilities and minivans, Toyota sells more cars than trucks in the United States. It reported strong demand for its RAV-4, Yaris and retro FJ Cruiser, an S.U.V. introduced this year. 
 Toyota and other Japanese automakers have been gaining market share in the United States. 
 Through October, Toyota's American market share rose 2 percentage points, to 15.2 percent, putting it in third place, ahead of DaimlerChrysler. Toyota passed Ford in July to rank briefly as the market's second-biggest auto company, behind G.M. Long term, it is likely to take second place as Ford cuts jobs and closes factories under an overhaul plan called the Way Forward.
 In Japan, Toyota said, sales fell 1.1 percent, to 530,000, for the quarter, reflecting the shrinking size of that nation's mature auto market. Global sales rose 8.5 percent, to 2.05 million vehicles, Toyota said. The automaker has said it will expand or build factories in China, Russia and Thailand.

HEADLINE: A Report by the World's Largest Auditors Urges Relaxed Standards for Liability 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The heads of the six largest auditing firms in the world issued a call for relaxed liability standards for their companies yesterday, in what appears to be the start of a campaign to protect their franchises while reducing the risk that bad audits could bankrupt one or more of them.
 In a report, the executives said that they supported efforts to standardize accounting and auditing standards around the world and that eventually, ''a new business reporting model'' should be developed that would provide better financial information more rapidly. 
But while the report, entitled ''Serving Global Capital Markets and the Global Economy,'' offered little detail in that area, it was most detailed in its warnings that auditor liability needed to be restricted and in mounting the arguments for that outcome. 
 It did not offer specific proposals on how liability could be restricted while continuing to protect investors if auditors failed to do a conscientious job. Instead, it pointed to a restriction on auditor liability as being essential to solve many problems of the industry, and suggested that if investors were worried about fraud, they should be willing to pay for more detailed and more expensive audits than those prepared now.
 ''Our firms are not and can never be the insurers of last resort for the capital markets,'' the report said. It cited an ''expectations gap'' between what investors wanted from an audit in detecting fraud ''and what audit networks are actually capable of doing, at the prices that companies or investors are willing to pay for audits.''
 One idea the report raised, which could bring in more revenue with less risk for auditing firms, was to create a separate category of forensic audits, which would cost more than ordinary ones and be more likely to uncover fraud. It said companies might be required to have such an audit every five years, or to face such audits on a random basis. Or, it said, investors could choose whether they wanted their companies to face that additional cost.
 Since the collapse of Arthur Andersen in the wake of the Enron scandal, there has been worry over excessive concentration of business in the Big Four firms -- PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Deloitte & Touche and Ernst & Young. The report, signed by the heads of those four firms as well as of the next two, much smaller firms -- Grant Thornton and BDO International -- suggested that more competition would appear if liability concerns were eased.
 It argued that fear of lawsuits had led to detailed accounting rules in the United States that encouraged a ''check the box'' style of auditing and accounting that in some cases made fraud more likely and information less useful. It endorsed the idea of accounting rules that are more ''standards based,'' with fewer details and more responsibility for auditors to interpret them.
 The report acknowledged that the big firms had often sought detailed rules in the hope that would protect them from lawsuits, but said that had not worked.
 While the largest firms in major countries bear the same or similar names, they are organized as partnerships in each country, reflecting differing regulations on what accountants and auditors can do. The firms asked for more consistent global rules and for ways to allow the heads of the international firms to enforce standards on all those in a network without making all the firms in the network liable for a firm's errors.

HEADLINE: With Teacher Pact at Hand, City Looks at Health Costs 

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and SEWELL CHAN; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After announcing a tentative contract with the teachers' union late Monday, the Bloomberg administration signaled yesterday that its next major negotiating goal was to achieve savings on health coverage for 300,000 municipal workers.
 James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner, said he hoped to open talks soon over health coverage with the umbrella group for the city's unions, the Municipal Labor Committee.
Mr. Hanley said Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, had committed to bargain about health coverage -- mayors traditionally negotiate on that subject with the broader labor committee and not with individual unions. Ms. Weingarten is chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee. 
 ''Randi has said a number of times she has a commitment to try to see if the city can't provide better benefits more economically,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at the City Hall news conference announcing the teachers' union deal. ''The cost of medical care continues to go up. That's even more worrisome than pension costs.''
 The deal announced late Monday gives the teachers a 7.1 percent raise over two years, increasing the base salary for the most senior teachers to just over $100,000.
 The agreement was unusual because, according to Mr. Hanley, it was the first time that a New York mayor reached a major labor deal so long before the current contract's expiration. The current contract, which covers 83,000 teachers and about 30,000 other school employees, expires in October of next year.
 Many labor experts were puzzled as to why the two sides would agree to a new contract long before the old one had run out.
 Ms. Weingarten had an answer. ''What I think the mayor gets from this is stability and certainty,'' she said. ''And there's something else -- nobody can say a contract fight is an excuse or an impediment for not working together to help the kids.''
 Moreover, by settling with the teachers, Mr. Bloomberg is expected to have an easier time persuading that powerful union to help him lobby Albany to reauthorize direct mayoral control over the city's schools.
 Charles M. Brecher, research director for the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed group, faulted Mr. Bloomberg for giving the teachers what he said was a generous raise without having first nailed down concessions on health costs. 
 ''I think it's a big mistake managerially,'' Mr. Brecher said. ''Why would they give up something now in the hope that they might get something in return later? Why is he putting all this money on the table and letting them walk away, hoping that they'll be nice someday in the future?''
 Hanley, the labor commissioner, said the city reached the agreement now because the two sides were making progress in their negotiations.
 ''Our plan is to bargain and address health issues with the Municipal Labor Committee,'' he said. ''Whether there is a teacher settlement in place or not is not really the issue. We've settled other contracts over this period of time -- and the health insurance issues are separate.''
 In the past, Mr. Bloomberg has said he would like to persuade the unions to have municipal workers start paying part of the premiums for health coverage. Many union leaders have balked at that idea.
 Ms. Weingarten said: ''The commitment I made on health is the commitment that is always made on health. As the chair of the M.L.C., we will always meet with the city to engage in ways to find affordable, quality health care. There's no commitment beyond that.''
 The teachers' deal calls for a 2 percent raise in the first year and 5 percent in the second year. The contract needs the approval of the Panel for Education Policy and union members. 
 The teachers' raise over two years is expected to serve as a pattern for other municipal unions. 
 ''Naturally I'd like to do a little better if I possibly could,'' said Harry Nespoli, president of the sanitation workers' union, whose contract expires in March. ''The city has a ton of money right now. That's why now is the time to negotiate.''
 Many teachers applauded the deal, which made their salaries more competitive with those in nearby suburbs. But many principals voiced anger about the teachers' deal because their union, the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, has been without a contract since June 30, 2003.

PERSON: Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber

HEADLINE: J.-J. Servan-Schreiber, French Man of Ideas, Dies at 82

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, a self-described ''agitator in ideas'' who helped mold the intellectual and political life of France and whose 1967 book warning of American economic domination of Europe provoked a firestorm on both sides of the Atlantic, died yesterday in Fecamp, in northwest France. He was 82. 
 The cause was complications of bronchitis, his son Edouard told The Associated Press. He had long been afflicted with a degenerative brain disease. 
Mr. Servan-Schreiber called himself a public man, and for nearly half a century as author, publisher and politician, he helped set the public agenda in France. 
 He started an influential magazine, L'Express; was prosecuted for writing a book on torture he saw as a French soldier in Algeria; won and lost elective offices; headed a political party; and served in France's governing cabinet.
 ''One life wasn't enough to contain his energy, creativity and enthusiasm so he forged multiple destinies,'' President Jacques Chirac said in a statement.
 Mr. Servan-Schreiber's book ''The American Challenge'' crystallized a historical moment when American investment seemed to some like a tidal wave about to submerge the European economy. 
 But rather than advocating protectionism, Mr. Servan-Schreiber proposed that Europe unite economically, welcome almost any kind of investment from anywhere, and get to work emulating American innovation and management.
 ''The evil is not the capacity of the Americans, but rather the incapacity of the Europeans,'' he wrote.
 Even though some original reviewers thought it too pro-American, ''The American Challenge'' has retained relevance over the years. In 1988, The Economist published a long article praising Mr. Servan-Schreiber for promoting free trade and open markets while still advocating nationalist goals. In 1996, the magazine said journalists, politicians and historians continued to refer to the book when discussing the effects of American capitalism on Europe.
 The book was an instant best seller, selling 600,000 copies in France, most unusual for a political essay. It was published in 22 languages and eventually sold more than three million copies.
 Mr. Servan-Schreiber emerged as an intriguing personality, with the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calling him ''a European of the Kennedy generation'' in the forward to the book's American edition (1968). He liked to be known by just the initials JJSS, the ''most famous initials in France, along with BB, for Brigitte Bardot,'' he claimed in an interview with The Washington Post in 1981.
 Unlike many of his countrymen, he was eager to converse in English and hardly spurned labels like ''the Lone Ranger of French economics'' that kept coming up. The Post wrote: ''In the era of the American century, he seemed to be the Frenchman of the era.''
 Mr. Servan-Schreiber was the grandson of Joseph Schreiber, a German Jew who was political secretary to Bismarck, the unifier of Germany, The New York Times Magazine reported in 1968. When Bismarck prepared to fight France, Mr. Schreiber, a Francophile, went into exile in Paris. His French-born son Emile Schreiber adopted the literary pseudonym Servan during World War II, and after the war, the family called itself Servan-Schreiber.
 Jean-Jacques Schreiber was born in Paris on Feb. 13, 1924, the eldest son of Emile Servan and the former Denise Bresard. His father and an uncle founded Les Echos, the first French newspaper to specialize in financial, economic and industrial news. The influential father introduced his young son to cabinet officers and other highly placed people.
 Though Jean-Jacques and his four siblings were raised as Catholics, the family fled to Spain when the Nazis conquered France and began to persecute people of Jewish heritage. From there, Jean-Jacques went to Alabama to train to fly a fighter for the Free French. He never saw combat, but was fascinated with America.
 After the war, he earned an engineering degree at the Ecole Polytechnique. After briefly running a hotel in Brazil with Madeleine Chapsal, his first wife, he joined Le Monde, the prestigious Paris newspaper, as a political writer. After briefly leaving to write for Paris-Presse, he became Le Monde's political editor.
 In 1953, with his close friend Francoise Giroud, he founded L'Express, which began as a leftist weekly publishing authors like Camus, Sartre and Malraux. It later became less politicized, and it so closely resembled a French version of Time that Time sued. In L'Express, Mr. Servan-Schreiber fiercely attacked France's colonial war in Algeria.
 The government soon relaxed its practice of not drafting junior officers who had seen World War II experience and drafted him. He was sent to Algeria and served with distinction. 
 But after leaving the army, he wrote a fiery book castigating French behavior there and was indicted on charges of subverting the troops' morale. The charges were dropped.
 He was later secretary general and president of the Radical-Socialist Party, and lost two campaigns for the National Assembly before winning and serving three terms or partial terms. He was minister of reform for 12 days during the administration of Valery Giscard d'Estaing before resigning in protest over France's nuclear testing.
 His books included ''The World Challenge,'' published in the United States in 1981, which argued that computers were the salvation of mankind. In the mid-1980s, he moved to Pittsburgh to teach at Carnegie Mellon University, where his sons David, Emile, Franklin and Edouard studied.
 His first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, the former Sabine Becq de Fouquieres, their sons; and two grandchildren.
 Another highlight of Mr. Servan-Schreiber's career was working as a young man as an aide to Pierre Mendes-France, the 1950's prime minister perhaps best remembered in the United States for his spectacularly unsuccessful campaign to persuade the French to drink milk instead of wine.
 In interview in The Washington Post, Mr. Servan-Schreiber was asked why America had not gobbled up Europe as he had predicted. He had a ready answer: ''They listened to my warning. They did what I told them.''

HEADLINE: Winning Easily After Finishing Rowland's Term, Rell Wins 4 Years of Her Own in Connecticut 

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Providing something of a brake to the Democratic tidal wave that some said would wash over Connecticut, Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican who has been finishing out the term of John G. Rowland after he resigned in disgrace, was elected by a commanding margin Tuesday night to serve a full four-year term in her own right. 
 Minutes after the polls closed at 8 p.m., The Associated Press called the race in Mrs. Rell's favor, but her Democratic challenger, Mayor John DeStefano of New Haven, did not concede for two more hours, when preliminary results from nearly a third of the state's election precincts showed her with an strong lead, 61 percent to 36 percent. 
 ''She has earned our support over the next four years,'' Mr. DeStefano said in his concession speech at Hula Hanks, a bar in New Haven.
 Standing beside her husband, Lou Rell, in the Hartford Marriott's ballroom about 10:30 p.m., Mrs. Rell warned the crowd, ''Lucky for you, I have a little bit of a cold, so I can't talk too loud and I can't talk too long.'' 
 Addressing her supporters, she added, ''This is a wonderful moment, and I want to say thank you.'' 
 Though Mr. DeStefano had closed some of the double-digit gap between himself and Mrs. Rell in recent weeks, the lopsided race made it clear that voters generally appreciated the tone she has set from the top since taking over from the embattled Mr. Rowland in the summer of 2004, as well as her pragmatic leadership style, born out of an incremental, fiscally conservative approach to tackling the big problems of the day.
 Where Mr. DeStefano was urging voters to take a broad view of what government can accomplish, Mrs. Rell advocated a more modest view.
 She compromised with Democratic lawmakers to get bills passed that strengthened ethics rules in awarding state contracts and limited the ways that political campaigns could raise money, in an effort to address some of the problems of the Rowland years. On pocketbook issues, she has been cautious about increasing public debt, and her call to abolish a highly unpopular car tax, a chant the Democratic legislature never echoed, was just one of the ways she promised voters small, but steady, economic relief if they backed her.
 That record made it possible for Mrs. Rell, who is 60 and a resident of Brookfield, to hew to what some critics called a low-risk ''Rose Garden'' strategy for much of the campaign. That kept the potential for any mishaps to a minimum, but also irked Mr. DeStefano, who wanted to draw her into debate, as he did ably during two televised debates that helped his numbers more than hers.
 But Mr. DeStefano was also hurt by divisions in his own party. He ran through much of the war chest he had spent years amassing to clinch a victory at the Democratic primary in August and entered September without the resources or momentum to battle a popular incumbent's formidable lead, even with many new Democratic voters added to the rolls and a desire by many voters to punish Republicans for actions by the Bush administration.
 ''He raised $5 million but spent most of it in the primary,'' said Robert Farr, the Republican candidate for attorney general, who lost to the Democratic incumbent, Richard Blumenthal. ''She only raised about $4 million, but she was able to pace herself better in the end.''
 In poll after poll, voters have credited Mrs. Rell with stabilizing the state after Mr. Rowland resigned amid an impeachment hearing and a few months before he pleaded guilty to having deprived voters of his honest services. She was lieutenant governor when he resigned.
 Local Democrats may yet have the last laugh. Many local Republicans said they did not see much of a coattail effect with Mrs. Rell's victory. Local Democrats also had high hopes of adding a few seats to the majority they already have in the State House and Senate.
 Going into the election, they were only two votes shy of a veto-proof majority in the General Assembly, and if they now pick up those critical last seats, Mrs. Rell may find it hard to govern.

HEADLINE: Formidable Task Awaits Spitzer: Trying to Get Albany to Budge

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Eliot Spitzer, who made a name for himself attacking wrongdoing on Wall Street, now faces a more formidable task as governor: overhauling a moribund state government that has been called the most dysfunctional in the nation.
 Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, is about to learn that his campaign promise -- ''Day 1, everything changes'' -- may not be so easy to fulfill when he is faced with a famously intransigent State Legislature and entrenched interests that have long grown used to getting their own ways in Albany. Given the realities of Albany, changing things much in his first 100 days, or first year, or first term could be a tall order.
The Spitzer agenda is an ambitious one: on the stump he has spoken about reviving the stagnant upstate economy, resolving the lawsuit that ordered billions of dollars more in spending on New York City's schools, cutting property taxes, expanding health care coverage while reining in health care costs and reforming an entrenched state government in Albany. 
 To accomplish much of what he wants to do, Mr. Spitzer will not only have to take on the lobbyists and the powerful special interests who showered money on his campaign, but he will also need to win over a politically divided Legislature that will probably be under the same leaders who were responsible for the infamous gridlock under three terms of Gov. George E. Pataki.
 Mr. Spitzer spoke of his lopsided victory as a mandate for change.
 ''Our agenda is not without ambition, and the road ahead will not be without difficulty,'' he said last night. ''And that is why, to get there, I truly believe it will take more than just a new governor or a new party.''
 ''The New York we seek will require a new brand of politics, a break from the days when progress was measured by the partisan points you scored or the opponents you beat,'' he said. ''From here on out we need a politics that binds us together, a politics that's forward-looking, a politics that asks not what's in it for me, but always what's in it for us.''
 On paper, at least, New York's governorship is one of the most powerful in the nation, and it has attracted similarly outsized personalities, like Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Al Smith and Nelson A. Rockefeller. But over the last few decades, the Legislature has re-established itself with a fury to rein in the governor's power. Where it was once reluctant to pass bills that a governor had threatened to veto, in recent years it has gleefully overridden vetoes again and again. Enter Mr. Spitzer. As attorney general, he was seen as more iron hand than velvet glove, as many a Wall Streeter can attest. But aides to Mr. Spitzer said that he has three strategies to try to get his agenda through the Legislature. 
 Mr. Spitzer, they say, hopes to share the credit and make everyone come out a winner when big items are tackled, to try to set an example of doing things on their merits, in a nonpartisan way, to build support for them -- and to fight tooth and nail if the first two strategies fail.
 Complicating matters for Mr. Spitzer is the reality that the Legislature has proved extremely adept at insulating itself from accountability to the voters, whether through laws that let incumbent lawmakers draw their own district lines to virtually ensure re-election, or through lax campaign- finance laws that allow large donations, and that make it easy for political parties to funnel huge sums of money to aid the rare endangered incumbent.
 Mr. Spitzer has roundly denounced these practices. But if he takes aim at them right away, he risks souring his honeymoon period and endangering parts of his agenda. If he does not, though, he risks finding himself where many a governor has found himself before: frustrated again and again by lawmakers who risk no retribution at the polls. 
 Michael Waldman, the executive director of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, which branded New York State's Legislature the most dysfunctional in the nation, said Mr. Spitzer has his work cut out.
 ''This is potentially a reform moment that comes along once every generation or two, where people broadly are fed up, where candidates get elected with specific mandates,'' he said. ''But reform moments don't always turn into reform. Spitzer has a big agenda, and it won't be easy. ''He's been very gutsy in laying out an agenda that was much more specific than it had to be, and he can claim a mandate for it. But the Legislature is still the same Legislature. And governors and presidents with big electoral mandates don't always get the deference from Legislatures that they want.'' No relationships in Albany are more complicated, or more important, than those among the three men who actually run the state: the governor, the Assembly speaker, and the majority leader of the State Senate. Agendas can live or die based on those relationships.
 Mr. Spitzer has taken pains not to attack the speaker, Sheldon Silver, who has been the lone Democrat in the ruling triumvirate for the last 12 years and has often taken heat for being an obstructionist as he angled for leverage to achieve his priorities. But their relationship took an awkward turn in recent weeks, after Mr. Spitzer withdrew his endorsement of State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who used a state worker as a chauffeur for his wife, while Mr. Silver continued to publicly support the comptroller.
 And it is hard to know what Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader in the Republican-controlled Senate, will be like in his new role as the odd Republican out. Mr. Bruno has long espoused a get-it-done philosophy, and has shown himself to be ideologically flexible. But he has been unhappy with Mr. Spitzer in recent weeks as Mr. Spitzer has campaigned with gusto against some of the Republican senators Mr. Bruno needs to maintain his slim majority.
 Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno have proved more than willing in recent years to put their partisan interests aside in order to do something they both like: gang up on the governor, usually in the hope of spending more money at budget time. So Mr. Spitzer, like all governors, will have to learn to play their form of three-dimensional chess. 
 Mr. Hevesi's re-election, too, is already casting a long shadow over Mr. Spitzer's agenda. Mr. Spitzer said that Mr. Hevesi's ability to do his job was compromised. But if Mr. Hevesi does not resign -- and he made clear last night that he intends to serve -- Mr. Spitzer could find himself instigating a messy removal trial in the State Senate that would dominate and probably undermine his honeymoon period, making it hard for him to accomplish his goals. 
 Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist and the dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the State University at New Paltz, said a governor's first year often holds out the most promise for getting things done. ''It's the best year,'' he said. ''Everyone is most distant from re-election, staffers might have aspirations to join the executive branch, legislators may want to be judges or commissioners, there is a wellspring of positive predisposition to the new governor.''
 Mr. Spitzer made his broad ambitions clear last night, calling his success ''a victory not of one candidate or one party, but of all those irrepressible optimists who have hoped and dreamed of a resurgent New York.''

HEADLINE: Ohio Democrats Win Races For Senate and Governor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Representative Ted Strickland on Tuesday became the first Democrat to win election as governor in Ohio in 16 years, benefiting from voter disaffection with Republican corruption scandals and a hobbled state economy.
 Another Democrat, Representative Sherrod Brown, defeated Senator Mike DeWine, the Republican incumbent.
The double victory recasts the political scene in Ohio and gives Democrats a solid footing in what is expected to be a crucial state in the 2008 presidential election. 
 Mr. Strickland, 65, defeated the Ohio secretary of state, J. Kenneth Blackwell, in a seat left open when Gov. Bob Taft decided to leave office after pleading no contest to ethics charges last year. 
 John C. Green, the director of the Bliss Institute, a political research center at the University of Akron, said that Ohio voters were responding to local issues, but that the result could have more far-reaching implications.
 ''Whoever holds the governorship has a leg up in terms of organizing the state and raising money,'' Mr. Green said, referring to the governor's ability to influence the presidential race. ''A popular governor can help a candidate with the voters, but the real value is in terms of organizing the state.''
 Mr. Strickland comes from a conservative Congressional district in southeast Ohio. He opposes gun control and, as an ordained United Methodist minister was able to appeal to conservative Christians.
 That may have helped offset the conservative credentials of Mr. Blackwell, who opposed same-sex marriage and abortion. Mr. Blackwell was seeking to become Ohio's first black governor.
 A survey of voters by The Associated Press showed that voters unhappy with the state's economy strongly supported Mr. Strickland.
 In contrast to the conservative leanings of the governor-elect, Mr. Brown is considered one of the most liberal members of the state's Congressional delegation. He opposed the constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage and voted against authorizing the war in Iraq. And while Mr. Strickland's election may have been a voter comment on local issues like the economy, Mr. Brown won strong support from voters angry about the war in Iraq, according to The Associated Press poll.
 Both candidates appeared to benefit from traditional Republican voters who wanted a change.
 ''I must admit I voted Democrat just because our Republicans aren't doing anything, not honoring the mandates they spoke up for the last few elections,'' said Gary Serafin, 58, who voted Tuesday in northwest Columbus.
 Mr. Serafin described himself as a Republican who often split his vote between both parties. But on Tuesday there was no split: he said he voted for Democrats for governor, the Senate and Congress.
 ''You still have to send a message,'' he said. ''We aren't pleased with the way things are going or where they're headed.''
 Mr. Green of the Bliss Institute said the shift of alignments in Ohio, with exit polls showing a majority of independents and a sizable portion of Republicans voting for Democrats, could last for several years.
 ''Ohio is a very closely divided state, very closely contested, but it often swings solidly Republican or solidly Democratic. I think what we've seen tonight is a swing to solidly Democratic.'' 
 He compared the election results to 1994, when the Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives for the first time in decades, and also consolidated their hold on statewide offices in Ohio.
 ''If we could now look back and say 1994 was the beginning of a Republican era, we may be looking at the beginning of a Democratic era.''
 In the Senate race between Mr. DeWine and Mr. Brown, about two-thirds of both independents and moderate voters said they had voted for Mr. Brown, according to an exit poll.
 Ohio is a Republican-leaning state that twice voted to elect George W. Bush as president and gave him his Electoral College margin of victory in 2004. No Republican has won the White House without carrying Ohio, and some political observers believe that the significant shift toward the Democrats here could spell trouble for the Republicans in two years.
 Polls showed voters strongly favoring Democrats on many issues, and three weeks before Election Day, Republican officials at the national level all but abandoned the Senate and governor's races and began diverting resources to other states where they believed they had a better chance of winning.
 Ohio voters had much to consider this year: political corruption, economic worries, concerns about the direction of the country and, for many, deep misgivings about the war in Iraq.
 The state Republican Party was wounded by scandal surrounding Governor Taft, who received thousands of dollars in gifts. And Representative Bob Ney, a Republican, pleaded guilty in October to corruption charges relating to his ties to Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff. 
 Many voters said after casting their ballots that they had been influenced by the scandals. Darlene Carter, 47, a supervisor in the state workers compensation office, said she voted for Governor Taft four years ago and now believed that his indiscretions had cast all state employees in a poor light.
 ''I just didn't want to see another Republican governor for a while,'' Ms. Carter said after voting in Columbus.
 Ohio was one of several states that shifted this year to electronic touch-screen voting machines. Concerns that the new machines could create widespread problems were at least partly borne out, with reports that several dozen polling places in Cuyahoga County, in and around Cleveland, opened late because of problems with the machines. A judge ordered that 16 sites remain open an extra 90 minutes, until 9 p.m.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 11, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about election results in Ohio misstated the circumstances that created an open seat for governor. Gov. Bob Taft was prevented from seeking re-election because of term limits. He did not decide to leave office after pleading no contest to ethics violations last year.

HEADLINE: The Impetus for Changes: Voters Display Frustrations and Dissatisfactions

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Reporting was contributed by Randal C. Archibold from Tempe, Ariz.; Theo Emery from Nashville; Eric Ferkenhoff from Glen Ellyn, Ill.; Brenda Goodman from Atlanta; Adam Nossiter from Memphis; Susan Saulny from St Louis; Lynn Waddell from St. Petersburg, Fla.; and Andrea Zarate from Miami.

DATELINE: BARNARDSVILLE, N.C., Nov. 7 

 BODY:
When Dave Anderson filled out his ballot late Tuesday morning, he knew what he would be voting for: change.
 Mr. Anderson, a bulldozer operator, said he had always voted for Senator Jesse Helms and his current congressman, Charles H. Taylor, both Republicans. He voted twice for George W. Bush.
But as Mr. Anderson made his daily stop at the D&D Grocery store, 15 miles north of Asheville, in a part of the county that used to be a town called Democrat, he said he would be voting for Mr. Taylor's challenger, Heath Shuler.
 ''I don't know if he'll do a better job than Taylor or not,'' Mr. Anderson said, ''but I'm voting for the change.'' 
 On a day that held the prospect of tilting the balance of power in Congress, voters showed intense interest and even excitement. In competitive races, turnouts ran high, and dissatisfaction ran higher. 
 Over and over, voters said they were unhappy with the Iraq war, even as they disagreed on the course of action or who is at fault. Voters expressed discontent over the economy, the cost of health care, gasoline prices and illegal immigration. 
 Many said they yearned for government to overcome what they perceived as corruption, extremism and partisanship.
 Democrats brimmed with optimism in places where they were once resigned to losing, like Glen Ellyn, Ill., a Republican stronghold west of Chicago that drew international attention when Tammy Duckworth, a wounded Iraq war veteran, decided to try to win the Congressional seat as a Democrat. 
 ''Go back an election cycle, and you practically didn't need to show up,'' Tracy Mehr, 44, a high school counselor, said. ''You knew which way it was going. It was simply Republican. But I've lived here a few years now, and I at first thought it would be the same. But I'm thrilled. It's a contest, and Tammy Duckworth has a real shot at making a difference, not only here, but on the national level, as well.''
 Here in the 11th Congressional District, the race was as pure a measure as any of voter disaffection. Neither candidate has been hurt by a major scandal or gaffe. Both are conservative on social issues, against same-sex marriage and abortion rights. 
 Mr. Shuler, a former professional football player and a wealthy real estate broker, is an evangelical Christian. Mr. Taylor is a wealthy banker who took office in 1991. Race is not a part of the equation. The two candidates are white in an overwhelmingly white district. 
 Polls made the contest too close to call.
 Yet not everyone favoring change voted against Mr. Taylor. Kevin Cole, a Democrat, and his mother, Patsy, a Republican, said they supported him. 
 ''I hope that things will change in Washington because I think it's really bad,'' Ms. Cole said. ''I don't like the war.'' 
 But, she added, ''I don't see anything wrong that Charles Taylor has done.''
 Many voters, however, were willing to take a chance on unknown quantities. 
 In St. Louis, Floyd Butcher said he was not aligned with either party but would vote for Claire C. McCaskill, the Democratic challenger to Senator Jim Talent.
 ''I'm sick of hearing Talent lie about McCaskill and sick of hearing McCaskill lie about Talent,'' Mr. Butcher said. ''But we've had Talent for years now and we know that he did not do a lot for us. McCaskill may be just as bad, but at least we don't know that for a fact.''
 In the closely watched Senate race in Tennessee, Iraq was a central issue. 
 ''I think we should pull out,'' said Sara Langer, an optometry student who voted for the Democrat, Harold E. Ford Jr., at a fire station north of downtown Memphis. ''This is, like, our highest month of casualties. It's a civil war over there.'' 
 Even some Republicans said they were concerned enough about Iraq to change their habits.
 ''I don't think we're fighting the war correctly,'' Steve Kite-Powell, a Republican lawyer, said. ''We're in a quagmire.'' 
 At first leaning toward the Republican Senate candidate, Bob Corker, Mr. Kite-Powell wound up voting for Mr. Ford. 
 Voters across the spectrum voiced disgust on one issue that they could not vote on, the tone of political advertisements and debates, which many said had plumbed new depths. 
 In St. Petersburg, Fla., one voter said she was so sick of campaign advertisements that the Christmas onslaught would be a relief.
 Another voter, in Tempe, Ariz., said the barrage had done nothing to help her decide. 
 ''They mixed me up more than anything,'' the voter, Carolyn Smith, 26, said. ''It was one after the other, and I don't remember it being so mean, everybody saying everybody else is a liar.''
 Yet some voters conceded that they were influenced by negative commercials like one in Florida that criticized Representative Jim Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor, for absenteeism in Congress, showing an empty desk chair rolling around Washington. 
 ''That ad that they showed about Jim Davis really got to me,'' Dorothea Williams, 50, said as she voted at a cultural arts center in Miami. ''I asked myself: 'Is this true? Did he do that? Is he really not there?' '' 
 Ms. Williams declined to say for whom she had voted. 
 But, she added, ''It really did sway my vote, let me put it that way.''
 In battleground states like Virginia, where Senator George Allen fought to hold off his Democratic challenger, Jim Webb, and Missouri, with the Talent-McCaskill race, officials said turnout was heavier than predicted. 
 In Tennessee, nearly a quarter of registered voters cast ballots early, representing nearly a 50 percent increase over 2002.
 A spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office in Missouri, Stacie Temple, said turnout was very heavy. 
 ''We think we'll probably exceed the 49 percent turnout we projected,'' Ms. Temple said.
 In other states, though, interest seemed to flag. Here in North Carolina, the Taylor-Shuler race was a hot spot in a showing so poor that elections analysts predicted that the state would hit a record low at 40 percent. The analysts attributed the lack of participation to disgust with negative campaign tactics and rainy weather.
 In Flat Creek, the Democratic captain, Stewart Hamlin, said he had been working at the polls for more than 10 years. 
 ''It's as heavy as I've ever seen it,'' Mr. Hamlin said. 
 By contrast, Mississippi, with no close races, expected 30 percent of registered voters to show up.
 Despite what many voters characterized as overload, it was clear in some interviews that recent events had made their mark. 
 In Florida, Jeffery Gaus, 46, said he voted for Mr. Davis for governor although he was impressed that the Republican candidate, Charlie Crist, skipped a rally on Monday with Mr. Bush in Pensacola. 
 ''What happened yesterday when Crist snubbed the president speaks volumes about how people in this country are fed up with the president and the war,'' Mr. Gaus said. ''He doesn't have a plan for getting us out of Iraq.''
 Several voters said the comments of Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, portrayed by Republicans as an insult to enlisted troops, had helped them make up their minds. 
 In a wealthy suburb south of Nashville, Mr. Kerry's remarks were decisive for Larry Deters, 66, who ran a Veterans' Administration hospital for 15 years. 
 ''I still had a few questions up until that point, but that really bothered me,'' Mr. Deters said.
 Several habitual Republican voters at his polling place said they intended to switch to Democrats, but Mr. Deters said he ultimately decided to back Mr. Corker for Senate, saying Mr. Ford was ''trying a little too hard to be a conservative.''
 ''He was trying too hard to portray himself as something that his voting record didn't really indicate,'' Mr. Deters said. ''I guess I would have been more inclined to vote for him if he'd been a little more straightforward on his feelings.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Oust G.O.P. In Governing Six States

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Democrats won open governor's seats in five states Tuesday and knocked off the Republican incumbent in Maryland, tilting control of the majority of governorships to Democrats for the first time since the 1990s.
 The Republicans began Election Day with a 28 to 22 advantage over the Democrats in governorships.
 But they were faced with the daunting prospect of defending nine of the ten open seats amid a mood that was decidedly anti-Republican in many parts of the country. Democrats were able to capture statehouses in the Northeast, the West and the South. The open seats were in Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York and Ohio.
 In Florida, Republicans were able to protect the seat that Gov. Jeb Bush has controlled for two terms. But in Maryland, Mayor Martin O'Malley of Baltimore, a Democrat, edged Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. 
 In dozens of other races, incumbents in states like Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Texas carried the day, despite some solid challenges.
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California handily defeated his Democratic rival, delivering a high-profile Republican victory in a state where not a single Republican held high state office just four years ago. His re-election highlighted a night of victories by incumbents. 
 But it was the races for the open seats -- 10 in all, out of a total of 36 contests -- that held much of the political attention.
 In Ohio, Ted Strickland, 65, a five-term congressman, defeated J. Kenneth Blackwell, a Republican and the secretary of the state. 
 Ohio Republicans were under a cloud because the current governor, Bob Taft, a Republican, pleaded no contest last year to ethics charges arising from dealings with a crooked investment manage. Until Tuesday, Republicans had dominated Ohio state politics, including the governor's office for the last 16 years.
 In Massachusetts, voters elected Deval Patrick, a civil rights lawyer and former Clinton administration official. Mr. Patrick, 50, defeated Kerry Healey, the Republican lieutenant governor. He is the first African-American elected as governor in Massachusetts and will become only the second elected black governor in the nation's history since Reconstruction. The current governor, Mitt Romney, a Republican, chose not to run again.
 In New York, the state's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, easily defeated John J. Faso, a Republican, to capture the seat now held by George E. Pataki, the nation's longest-serving governor. Mr. Pataki, a Republican who came to office in 1994 with an upset victory over the Democrat Mario M. Cuomo, did not seek re-election.
 The Democrats picked up a fourth open seat in Arkansas, where the attorney general, Mike Beebe, defeated Asa Hutchinson, a former official in the federal Department of Homeland Security.
 President Bush and other officials in his administration had made repeated visits to Arkansas on behalf of Mr. Hutchinson in recent weeks. Political analysts said before the election that conservative voters in the state had been dispirited by the war and the sex scandal in Congress involving under-age pages. Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican was barred by term limits from running again. 
 In Colorado, Bill Ritter, a Democrat and former district attorney in Denver, defeated two-term Representative Bob Beauprez, a Republican, in the race to succeed Gov. Bill Owens.
 It was a night that saw incumbent after incumbent raise hands in victory.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger's victory was particularly remarkable given that the governor, who won his seat in a 2004 recall of the Democratic governor, appeared to be all but finished just six month ago after a series of ballot initiatives he presented to voters failed.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger outspent his opponent, Phil Angelides, the state treasurer, and outdanced him to the left during the campaign. He passed a minimum-wage increase, a bill to curb heat-trapping gases at the potential expense of large companies, a measure approving prescription-drug discounts, all the while supporting stem cell research and openly criticizing the White House on issues like its order to police the Mexican border with National Guard troops
 In Connecticut, Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican, defeated John DeStefano, the mayor of New Haven and a Democrat. Gov. Sonny Perdue, Republican of Georgia, and Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, also a Republican, were both re-elected. 
 Republicans also held onto the governor's seat in Florida that many Democrats had desperately coveted -- if only for the psychological impact on the Bush administration, since it was being vacated by Jeb Bush, President Bush's brother, who could not run again because of term limits. Charlie Crist, the Florida attorney general, beat Representative Jim Davis in that race.
 In New Hampshire, Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, was re-elected over his Republican challenger, Jim Coburn. And Edward G. Rendell, the Democratic incumbent in Pennsylvania, held on to win re-election against his Republican challenger, Lynn Swann, the former professional football player who is now a sports commentator. 
 The Democratic incumbent in Illinois, Rod R. Blagojevich, also turned back a Republican challenge, from Judy Baar Topinka. Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat, also won re-election, easily defeating his Republican challenger, Jim Bryson.
 But some incumbent victories came after a fierce political fight, especially in Michigan, where Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, held off her challenger, Dick DeVos, to win re-election. Ms. Granholm won despite the unhappiness of voters who had seemed ready, earlier in the campaign season, to blame her for the state's bad economy and lost auto industry jobs.
 In the Rocky Mountain West, where Democrats have made big gains in governors' seats and in state legislatures in recent years, Democratic incumbents won all their races. Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona won re-election, as did Gov. Dave Freudenthal in Wyoming and Gov. Bill Richardson in New Mexico.
 As voters cast their ballots across the country Tuesday, the big question in many state capitals was how much national politics they would effect their choices. 
 .
 In Rhode Island, one of the most solidly Democratic states in national elections, Gov. Donald L. Carcieri, a Republican, scrambled to remind voters why they had elected him four years ago. 
 But in the end, the real key to the governors' elections, many party leaders and political scholars said, centered on one big factor: the number of open seats.
 Six incumbents, including Governor Bush of Florida, were barred by term limits from seeking re-election, and four governors -- James E. Risch of Idaho, Tom Vilsack of Iowa, Mr. Romney of Massachusetts and Mr. Pataki of New York -- chose not to run again. In the 10 governors' races without an incumbent, nine of the governors who were stepping aside were Republicans.
 Mr. Patrick's victory in Massachusetts will make him the nation's only sitting black governor. L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat from Virginia, was the nation's first elected black governor since Reconstruction, serving from 1990 to 1994.
 Mr. Patrick served as a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in the early 1980s, working mostly on death penalty and voting rights cases. He met Bill Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, when he sued him in a voting case. In 1994, when he was president, Mr. Clinton appointed Mr. Patrick assistant attorney general for civil rights, the nation's top civil rights post.

HEADLINE: On Wave of Voter Unrest, Democrats Take Control of House

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
Democrats rode voter unrest over Congressional misconduct and the war in Iraq back to power in the House on Tuesday night, ending 12 years of Republican rule by persuading voters it was time to change course in Washington.
 Led by a string of victories in the Northeast and Midwest, Democrats gained at least 21 seats, 6 more than the 15 required to install Representative Nancy Pelosi of California as the first woman to become speaker of the House. Assuming they hold on to enough of their incumbent seats elsewhere, Democrats will hold the House majority for the first time since 1994.
''Today, the American people have stated loud and clear that they want a new direction for our country,'' said an ebullient Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, who is in line to become the chairwoman of the House Rules Committee in the new Democratic regime. 
 Republicans were dogged by scandal throughout the campaign, and it cost them dearly. They lost seats in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida as the direct result of criminal cases and other misconduct. Exit polls showed that corruption weighed heavily on the minds of voters. 
 But public dissatisfaction with the Iraq war and other issues was clear. Three Republican incumbents were defeated in conservative Indiana and another in Kentucky. Two moderate Republicans were ousted in New Hampshire and at least one more in Connecticut. New York, with Democrats leading the top of the ticket, gave the party at least two more seats. Democratic gains mounted as votes were counted in the West.
 The White House acknowledged that the once overwhelming Republican majority in the House had slipped away. 
 ''We believe Democrats will have control of the House and look forward to working with Democratic leaders on the issues that remain foremost on the agenda, including winning the war in Iraq and the broader war on terror and keeping the economy on a growth path,'' said Tony Snow, the White House spokesman.
 Ms. Pelosi told an enthusiastic crowd in Washington that her resurgent majority was prepared to work with Republicans ''in partnership and not in partisanship,'' hoping to break the gridlock of what could be a divided Congress.
 ''The campaign is over -- Democrats are ready to lead,'' she said. ''Today we have made history -- now let us make progress.''
 Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, who was expected to retire should Republicans slip into the minority, was not ready to concede, though he said, ''We've watched some of the House races, especially in the East -- been kind of tough out there.''
 The Republican setback will likely spur leadership fights beginning Wednesday as ambitious lawmakers in both parties try to find their way in the reshaped House. 
 Democratic control of the House will begin a new era in Washington, giving the party the votes to install its members as committee leaders and initiate more aggressive oversight of the Bush administration. Democrats have complained for years that Republicans have ignored their responsibility as an independent branch of government to police the executive branch.
 The party has also promised a legislative agenda that starts with an increase in the minimum wage and giving the government the power to negotiate for lower drug prices for Medicare. But with control of the Senate uncertain and the margin so close, it is unlikely the new Democratic majority will have a free hand.
 In Indiana, three Republican incumbents who were top targets of the Democrats -- John Hostettler, Chris Chocola, and Mike Sodrel -- lost.
 In Connecticut, Chris Murphy, a Democrat, was declared the winner in a race against Representative Nancy Johnson, a moderate Republican.
 And in Kentucky, another Republican Representative, Anne M. Northup, a veteran lawmaker who had withstood strong challenges in the past, lost narrowly to her Democratic opponent, John Yarmuth, a former Republican political candidate and publisher of an alternative newspaper in Louisville. Democrats had not counted on beating Ms. Northup in making their calculation for a House takeover.
 In Georgia, in fact, two Democratic incumbents, John Barrow and Jim Marshall, were in tight races of their own, though they were among only a few party lawmakers who were considered in danger of defeat. 
 Republicans had known for months that they faced a volatile political environment, but they believed they could stem serious losses because many of the lawmakers most in jeopardy were in Republican-friendly districts and the party had the benefit of a powerful turnout operation.
 They were also counting on the fact that House races traditionally turn on local issues rather than the national political picture. But a national exit poll indicated that most voters in House races were viewing this crucial midterm through the prism of national concerns. In another sign of struggle for the Republicans, voters also rated corruption as one of their major considerations. 
 The seeds for the Republicans' precarious position in the House were planted in the early days of the 109th Congress in January 2005, when House leaders found themselves in a clash with Democrats over charges of corruption and their iron-fisted management of the chamber. Over the next two years, the Republicans were plagued by a series of lobbying and personal scandals, internal disputes over spending, and an uncertain new leadership.
 At the pinnacle of the chamber's turmoil was Tom DeLay, the former Republican leader and key architect of the party's control over the House, who was indicted in Texas on a campaign finance law charge and faced an ethics inquiry in Congress. Angry over a series of rebukes by the ethics committee to Mr. DeLay, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert forced through a series of changes that Democrats and watchdogs saw as a campaign to weaken internal policing. Democrats balked, setting the angry and combative tone for the session.
 At the same time, the influence-peddling scandal tied to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff continued to simmer and other scandals, notably a bribery case that led to the conviction of former Representative Randy Cunningham, Republican of California, provided substance for the Democratic charge that the Republican-led House had lost its ethical bearings.
 As they left for the campaign trail at the end of September, Republicans found themselves where they began, contending with the toxic fall-out of former Representative Mark Foley sexually suggestive messages to male teenage pages, throwing the party badly off message and providing a last straw for voters already upset with the majority.

HEADLINE: Exit Polls Show Independents, Citing War, Favored Democrats

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MEGAN THEE

 BODY:
A majority of independent voters aligned with Democratic candidates yesterday, driven by their distress over the Iraq war, disapproval of Congressional leadership and concern about the direction President Bush was leading America, according to interviews with voters as they left their polling places.
 In a contentious midterm election in which both parties forcefully mobilized their bases, voters in the center of the electorate aided Democrats in their quest to overtake Republican majorities in the House and Senate. 
The economy, corruption, terrorism and Iraq, according to the exit polls, were extremely important factors in the minds of about 4 in 10 voters. At the same time, 3 in 10 voters said values and immigration had been extremely important topics.
 Almost 6 in 10 voters disapproved of the war in Iraq, according to the exit polls, and about the same number said they believed the United States should withdraw some, or all, of its troops. Six in 10 voters also said the war had not improved the long-term security of the United States, while one-third of voters said it had.
 The surveys were conducted nationwide by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International for the National Election Pool, a consortium of television networks and The Associated Press.
 Though Mr. Bush was a central character in the campaign, particularly in the Democrats' television advertisements and talking points, only about 4 in 10 said they cast their votes as a specific show of opposition to the president. About the same number of voters said Mr. Bush had not played a part in their decision, while about one in five voters said they viewed their ballot as a way to support the White House. 
 Still, the president's sagging popularity provided an unavoidable theme for the campaign, and about 6 in 10 voters said they disapproved of how Mr. Bush was handling his job. A majority of voters declared that the nation was seriously on the wrong track, according to the exit polls, and about half of voters said the state of the economy was bad. Of those who were troubled by the economy, 8 in 10 voted for the Democratic candidate.
 While white voters split their support between the main parties, according to the exit polls, a strong majority of black and Hispanic voters picked the Democratic candidate. 
 A majority of voters said they were more concerned with national issues than local ones, which was precisely the sentiment Republicans had worked to avoid as they tried to keep the fight for control of Congress as a series of individual elections rather than a national campaign. 
 The race for the Senate turned on the results in a few states, including Missouri, where 3 in 10 white evangelical voters said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's job performance. 
 Over all, though, white evangelicals were twice as likely as all other voters to voice their approval for the president. On the war, about two-thirds of evangelicals said they approved of Mr. Bush's course, while about two-thirds of all other voters said they disapproved. 
 While the tug of war between the parties went down to the final moments yesterday, with a barrage of television commercials and telephone calls in competitive districts across the country, nearly three-quarters of voters said they had made up their minds last month or earlier. About one-quarter said they had decided within the past week. 
 Even though there were sporadic concerns about the integrity of the election yesterday, nearly 9 in 10 voters said they were confident that their votes would be counted. 
 About 6 in 10 voters said they disapproved of how Congress was handling its job, with fewer than 4 in 10 voicing approval. The findings were potentially perilous for Republican incumbents, particularly in the House, where Democrats believed they could make their strongest showing. 
 It was the mood of the independent voters, though, that provided the biggest dose of optimism for Democrats, with about 6 in 10 supporting the Democratic candidate. While one-third of independents said they were satisfied or enthusiastic about Republican leaders, two-thirds said they were dissatisfied or angry. 
 While economic issues were often overshadowed in the campaign, about half of the voters surveyed said they had just enough money to maintain their standard of living. One-third of voters said they were getting ahead financially, and nearly 2 in 10 said they were falling behind. 
 Six in 10 voters said illegal immigration was of great importance to how they cast their votes. But nearly as many voters said that most illegal immigrants working in the United States should be offered an opportunity to apply for legal status. About 4 in 10 voters said illegal immigrants should be deported.
 In other questions asked of voters, a majority -- nearly 6 in 10 -- rated values issues like same-sex marriage and abortion as important.

Conducting the Polls
 The Election Day polls were based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left polling places throughout the country.
 The polls were conducted by Edison Media Research of Somerville, N.J., and Mitofsky International of New York City for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News.
 The national results are based on 12, 878 voters in 249 precincts across the United States. These include 1,490 absentee voters and early voters interviewed by telephone.
 The state results are based on 1,151 to 2,805 voters in 25 to 50 randomly selected precincts across each of 13 states analyzed by The New York Times. In certain states some interviews were also conducted by phone with absentee voters and early voters.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus one to two percentage points nationally, and three to four points in each state, from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters who cast ballots in each of these elections.
 Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out the questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into a poll.
 Prof. Helmut Norpoth of the State University of New York at Stony Brook and Dr. Michael R. Kagay, of Princeton, N.J., assisted The Times in its polling analysis.

 BODY:

A Democratic wave sweeps west from Rhode Island, with some landslides along the way.

CONNECTICUT
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who ran as an independent after losing badly in the Democratic primary to Ned Lamont, a former town selectman in Greenwich, roared back to defeat Mr. Lamont with heavy support among Republican voters. The Republican candidate, former State Representative Alan Schlesinger, was never a serious contender. 
 Mr. Lamont, who financed his own campaign, ran on a strong antiwar message. Mr. Lieberman, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2004 and was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2000, was mostly spurned by Democrats. But enough Republicans and independents sought out his name at the bottom of the ballot to lift him to a fourth term.
In a stunning pickup for the Democrats, State Senator Chris Murphy ousted Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a 12-term incumbent Republican. Two of the country's most fiercely contested Congressional races remained undecided past 2 a.m. as the Republican incumbents, Christopher Shays and Rob Simmons, faced stiff challenges. 
 Gov. M. Jodi Rell, the Republican who succeeded Gov. John G. Rowland in 2004 after he was implicated in a corruption scandal, won easily.

DELAWARE
 Senator Thomas R. Carper, a Democrat who is a former governor and congressman, easily won re-election, defeating the Republican, Jan C. Ting, a Temple University law professor, by 42 percentage points. 
 In the race for attorney general, Joseph R. Biden III, a Democrat and the son of Delaware's senior senator, beat his Republican challenger, Ferris Wharton, by 13,000 votes.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Adrian M. Fenty, 35, became Washington's youngest mayor in a largely ornamental race after he won the Democratic primary in September. Some 75 percent of voters are Democrats. Mr. Fenty, a two-term city councilman, ran a campaign notable for breaking through racial and economic divides, becoming the first candidate to sweep all eight of the city's voting districts in the primary. The city's delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, won a ninth term unopposed.

MAINE
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a centrist Republican, easily won a third term in the Senate, defeating her Democratic opponent, Jean Hay Bright. Ms. Bright had denounced Ms. Snowe's original vote to authorize the war in Iraq. But in recent weeks, Ms. Snowe criticized the administration's strategy there and said her views reflected the ''independent spirit'' of Maine. 
 The state's two Democratic House members, Representatives Tom Allen and Michael H. Michaud, easily won re-election. Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, defeated his Republican challenger, State Senator Chandler Woodcock, who emphasized the state's economic troubles and criticized management of a new health program for the uninsured.

MARYLAND
 Lt. Gov. Michael S. Steele, a Republican, lost to Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, a Democrat, in a closely watched campaign to succeed Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Democrat who is retiring after 30 years. 
 Mr. Steele, who is black, had some success courting black Democratic voters, running an image-based campaign depicting himself as not beholden to either party. But Mr. Cardin likened Mr. Steele to President Bush and took steady aim at his opposition to abortion and embryonic stem cell research, and to his support of the president's handling of the war in Iraq. 
 Democrats also regained the governor's mansion, with Mayor Martin O'Malley of Baltimore narrowly defeating Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., who four years ago was the first Republican elected governor since 1966. In the House, Democrats kept their six-to-two majority, with incumbents winning across the board and John P. Sarbanes, a Democrat and the son of Senator Sarbanes, picking up Mr. Cardin's vacated seat.

MASSACHUSETTS
 Ending 16 years of Republican control of the governor's office, Deval L. Patrick, a former assistant attorney general in the Clinton administration, was elected the Bay State's first black chief executive. He defeated Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey, a Republican, and two others to succeed Gov. Mitt Romney, who is retiring after one term to explore a presidential run in 2008. Heavy turnout was reported. Mr. Patrick, who grew up poor in Chicago, was the Justice Department's top civil rights officer until 1997, and then a corporate lawyer. His campaign focused on education, property taxes and housing. 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy easily won an eighth term. The state's 10 House incumbents, all Democrats, were re-elected. A ballot measure to allow local authorities to license food stores to sell wine was defeated.

NEW HAMPSHIRE
 House races in the traditional Republican stronghold of New Hampshire emerged as last-minute battlegrounds, with Democrats capturing both seats from incumbent Republicans. In the First District, Carol Shea-Porter, the Democrat, defeated Jeb Bradley; in the Second District, Paul Hodes, the Democrat, defeated Charles Bass. Polls suggested that voters saw the election as a referendum on the war in Iraq and on President Bush. New Hampshire has grown more liberal as people from the Boston suburbs and high-technology companies have migrated north.
 Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, easily won re-election. 

NEW JERSEY
 In one of this year's most closely watched races, Senator Robert Menendez and his Republican opponent, Thomas H. Kean Jr., waged a down-and-dirty battle, peppered with accusations of corruption and other personal attacks. In the end, Mr. Menendez, a seven-term congressman appointed to the Senate in December by Gov. Jon S. Corzine, wound up the winner, beating Mr. Kean by a narrow margin. 
 Retaining Mr. Menendez's seat was regarded as a major coup for the Democrats, who were locked in a spirited fight to gain control of the Senate. Mr. Menendez drew most of his support from voters who opposed President Bush. Nearly half the voters interviewed as they left the polls rated the war in Iraq and corruption in government as ''extremely important'' in determining their vote.
 Of the state's 11 House races, 10 went to the incumbent. In the other race, Albio Sires, a Democrat, was elected to the 13th District seat vacated by Mr. Menendez for the remaining two months of his term, as well as a subsequent two-year term.

NEW YORK
 The headliners did not supply the drama in this show. Eliot Spitzer was elected governor by a record margin, and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton cruised to re-election.
 Surveys of voters leaving the polls showed that both fared especially well among people who oppose the war in Iraq. And after a decade of inroads by Gov. George E. Pataki, who is leaving office, surveys showed Democrats reasserting their traditional dominance among Hispanics, Jews and union members. 
 Andrew M. Cuomo easily defeated Jeanine F. Pirro in the race to replace Mr. Spitzer as attorney general, and Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi was re-elected by a wide margin, giving Democrats all the statewide offices for the first time since 1942.
 Democrats captured three Republican-held Congressional seats, and three Republican incumbents narrowly won in normally safe districts, as their party felt the backlash over the war in Iraq and assorted scandals. Michael Arcuri, a Democrat, won the seat of Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, who is retiring, and two Democrats, Kirsten Gillibrand and John Hall, unseated Representatives John E. Sweeney and Sue W. Kelly. 

PENNSYLVANIA
 Senator Rick Santorum, a staunch conservative who held the No. 3 position in the Senate Republican leadership, lost to Bob Casey, the state treasurer nominated by the Democrats. Exit polls showed a clear split on Iraq. Of those who said they disapproved of the war, 86 percent reported voting for Mr. Casey, while 14 percent voted for Mr. Santorum, according to a poll conducted for The Associated Press and TV networks.
 Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat seeking a second term, easily defeated his Republican challenger, Lynn Swann, a former football star with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
 Democrats defeated several incumbent House Republicans. In the Seventh District, Joe Sestak, a retired vice admiral, unseated Representative Curt Weldon, a 10-term veteran. Federal agents are investigating whether Mr. Weldon used his influence to help his daughter, a registered lobbyist, win consulting contracts. In the 10th District, Christopher Carney, a Democrat, defeated Representative Don Sherwood, a Republican who apologized to voters for having an extramarital affair with a Peruvian immigrant less than half his age. Representative Melissa A. Hart, a Republican, lost to Jason Altmire, a Democrat, in the Fourth District.

RHODE ISLAND
 Senator Lincoln Chafee, the most liberal Republican in the Senate, opposed the war in Iraq. Rhode Island voters admired him -- 62 percent of them told exit pollsters that they approved of his job performance.
 But 63 percent of voters told exit pollsters they wanted the Senate to change hands, and that was enough to get Mr. Chafee tossed out in favor of Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat and former attorney general. 
 Because Mr. Chafee and Mr. Whitehouse agreed on major issues like tax cuts, abortion and gun control, Mr. Whitehouse's campaign focused largely on Mr. Chafee's party affiliation.
 Mr. Whitehouse also benefited from a bruising Republican primary in September that left Mr. Chafee's war chest depleted. Going into the home stretch, Mr. Whitehouse and his Democratic allies outspent Mr. Chafee on television advertisements by more than $1 million.
 Rhode Islanders re-elected their two Democratic congressmen and Gov. Donald L. Carcieri, a Republican. They also voted to allow the Narragansett Indian tribe to open a casino. 

VERMONT
 In Vermont's only House race, State Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat, defeated Martha T. Rainville, a Republican who is adjutant general of the Vermont National Guard. 
 In the race to succeed Senator James M. Jeffords, the retiring independent, Representative Bernard Sanders, an independent who votes with the Democrats, defeated Richard Tarrant, a Republican businessman. The victory by Mr. Sanders became an immediate bit of political trivia: he will be the third sitting senator, along with Charles E. Schumer of New York and Norm Coleman of Minnesota, to be a graduate of James Madison High School in Brooklyn. 
 Gov. James Douglas, a Republican, easily won re-election.

WEST VIRGINIA
 Senator Robert C. Byrd, first elected to the House in 1952 and to the Senate in 1958, is the longest-serving senator in United States history and a few years shy of having the longest Congressional tenure. He easily won a ninth term, defeating John R. Raese, a businessman and former state Republican chairman. All three House incumbents, two Democrats and one Republican, were re-elected.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 9, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies yesterday on the State by State pages about a proposal on the Rhode Island ballot to amend the state Constitution to allow the Narragansett Indian tribe to open a casino in West Warwick misstated the result. Voters there rejected the proposal; they did not approve it.

HEADLINE: Election's Over. Now to Tackle The Realities.

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
Email: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For everyone who is worried about the country's big economic problems -- energy policy, health care, the budget deficit -- today is a good day.
 It should be a good day regardless of whether you're elated or disappointed by last night's results, because a campaign that included almost no serious discussion of these issues has now ended. Today marks the start of the 2008 presidential race.
Unlike midterm elections, presidential races tend to revolve largely around economic plans, be it Bill Clinton's 1992 promises to the ''forgotten middle class'' or George W. Bush's vow in 2000 to cut taxes. As Gene Sperling, a former Clinton adviser, says, ''In presidential campaigns, there is a premium on new ideas.'' 
 We could use some fresh economic ideas right now. An honest accounting of the budget deficit would show it to be even larger than the government says it is. High oil prices have helped finance extremist governments across the Middle East, while the five warmest years on record have all occurred in the last decade. Health care costs, like the numbers of the uninsured, keep rising. Wages for most Americans have failed to keep pace with inflation over the last five years. 
 In some cases, the outlines of a potential -- even bipartisan -- solution have already begun to take shape outside of Washington. In other cases, the two parties each have a chance to claim a big issue as their own. With an eye toward Nov. 4, 2008, here is a breakdown of the four biggest:

THE DEFICIT -- When the latest budget numbers came out this summer and they showed a drop in the estimated deficit, I called some former Bush aides -- Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, Doug Holtz-Eakin, Andrew Samwick -- to give them a chance to gloat. But not one of them was in the mood.
 They all said that the decline was obscuring a much bigger problem: the enormous long-term deficit caused by future Social Security and Medicare payments. ''The real big problem is a decades-long generational issue,'' Mr. Mankiw said. ''That basic challenge often gets forgotten when the short-term situation is getting better.''
 Fortunately, imagining a bipartisan agreement on Social Security isn't all that difficult. Small groups of economists from both parties, including Mr. Samwick, have already negotiated some hypothetical deals. 
 Republicans might compromise by agreeing to increase the amount of income that is subject to the payroll tax -- now $94,200 -- and by cutting benefits for high earners. ''We have a problem,'' Mr. Hubbard says, ''and the most well-off among us ought to bear the biggest burden.'' 
 Democrats could then clear the way for an expansion of personal retirement accounts. Even people who hated Mr. Bush's failed plan for personal accounts should be able to agree that more individual savings would be a good thing.

HEALTH CARE -- There are two main problems with American health care today, and they tend to get confused. The first is that far too many people don't have health insurance. If you are not insured through your job, buying a policy is incredibly expensive, because insurers know that the people in the market for a policy are the ones who expect to get sick.
 A few states -- like Arkansas, Massachusetts and New Mexico, all with ambitious governors -- are trying to address this problem by pooling together their uninsured residents into one buying group, much as a company spreads its medical costs across sick and healthy workers. It's a great idea.
 But it won't solve the second problem: soaring health care costs, which are a much larger part of the long-term deficit than Social Security. Reining in these costs will require cutting back on expensive drugs and procedures that haven't been proved to make a real difference. This issue is about the toughest one around, and I would be surprised if its political moment had yet arrived. We'll probably have to wait for health care spending to go even higher.

GLOBAL WARMING -- Two weeks ago, Sir Nicholas Stern, a top economics official in the British government, released a report that should change the debate over climate change. Sir Nicholas and his staff concluded that without sharp reductions in greenhouse gases, global warming -- and the droughts, hurricanes and floods that it brings -- will probably reduce the world's economic output by at least 5 percent a year. ''The benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting,'' the Stern report stated.
 In this country, neither political party is serious about the problem. Instead, both have trotted out laundry lists of futuristic alternative-energy programs. No one can know which ones will actually work, and the planet will keep getting hotter in the meantime. 
 There are only two ways to slow global warming. One is to raise the cost of putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, through an energy tax. From Alan Greenspan and Mr. Mankiw on the right to Al Gore and Larry Summers on the left, there is enormous support for this idea, which would do far more to spur research than the current hodgepodge of alternative-energy tax credits.
 That said, none of the big advocates of an energy tax are running for office right now. The second idea -- less efficient but perhaps more politically palatable -- relies on regulations like higher mileage standards for vehicles and limits on carbon use by companies. Senator John McCain says he favors such caps. I suspect we'll hear more from him in the next couple of years. 

LIVING STANDARDS -- Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, recently noted that sweeping economic changes threatened the livelihoods of many workers, and he warned that rising inequality could set off a political reaction. Henry M. Paulson Jr., Mr. Bush's Treasury secretary, said that ''many Americans simply aren't feeling the benefits'' of the current expansion. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, puts it this way, ''For the first time in generations, parents worry that their children will not be better off than they are.''
 So where are the bold new solutions? 
 Republicans like to talk about education, skipping over the question of how better schools could help struggling workers in their 40s and 50s. Democrats have become fond of trade barriers, which don't exactly have a good record of lifting a country's living standards. 
 I'm not suggesting the answers are easy. But if we can agree that globalization and technological innovation have made the country richer -- and they have, enormously -- then we should be able to talk about how the winners can do a better job of compensating the losers.
 An immigration policy that lets in fewer low-wage workers, but more doctors and scientists, might be a start, notes Benjamin M. Friedman, the author of ''The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth.'' So might tax cuts for the middle class -- paid for by tax increases on the well-off, who have done very nicely of late.
 There will, inevitably, be huge fights over the solution to any one of these issues. At times, the fights will get nasty, and people will come forward to decry the lack of civility in American politics. So be it. Economies, like democracies, can thrive without civility. They don't thrive if they try to ignore their biggest problems forever.

 BODY:

In a Republican stronghold, two close Senate races were crucial to the party's success.

ALABAMA
 Considered vulnerable early this year, Gov. Bob Riley, a Republican, made a remarkable comeback and won re-election over Lt. Gov. Lucy Baxley. Mr. Riley had angered conservatives with a proposed tax increase that voters rejected, and Democrats noted his peripheral connections to Washington's lobbying scandals. But he won credit for his handling of the economy and Hurricane Katrina. Five of the seven contested House districts were considered safe for Republicans.

ARKANSAS
 In the race for governor, State Attorney General Mike Beebe, a Democrat, defeated former Representative Asa Hutchinson, a Republican and a former under secretary in the Homeland Security Department. Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican, was barred by term limits from running again after a 10-year tenure.
Arkansas had not had an open race for governor since 1978, and the contest generated record spending and a parade of appearances by heavyweights including President Bush and former President Bill Clinton. In House races, none of the four incumbents, three Democrats and a Republican, faced a close challenge. 
 Voters approved a measure to allow bingo and raffles by charitable groups; Arkansas was one of only four states where that type of gambling was illegal.

FLORIDA
 Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, overwhelmed his Republican challenger, Katherine Harris, the former secretary of state best known for her oversight of the presidential recount of 2000, who ran an erratic campaign. In the battle to succeed Gov. Jeb Bush, who had high approval ratings but was unable to run because of term limits, State Attorney General Charlie Crist, a Republican, easily defeated United States Representative Jim Davis, a Democrat. On the eve of the vote, Mr. Crist declined to appear with President Bush, who flew to Florida to campaign for Republicans.
 Capitalizing on voter discontent with the war in Iraq and the Congressional page scandal that forced the resignation of Representative Mark Foley, Democrats increased their share of Florida's 25 Congressional seats to 9 from 7. One victory came in the race to succeed Mr. Foley, whose name remained on the ballot; the Democratic candidate, Tim Mahoney, a rancher and political newcomer, defeated State Representative Joe Negron, a Republican, who adopted as his campaign slogan ''Punch Foley for Negron.'' 
 In the district that includes Fort Lauderdale, State Senator Ron Klein defeated Representative Clay Shaw, the Republican incumbent. 

GEORGIA
 Georgia, where President Bush campaigned repeatedly in recent weeks, appeared likely to become more Republican than ever. Gov. Sonny Perdue, Republican, overwhelmed his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor. Only 2 of 13 House races appeared competitive, and both were in districts where the president campaigned against incumbent Democrats : Representative Jim Marshall faced a credible challenge from Mac Collins, a Republican former congressman; and Representative John Barrow was battling another former congressman, Max Burns. 

KENTUCKY
 A majority of voters in Kentucky are Democrats, but going into this election, Democrats held only one of the state's six Congressional seats. This year they increased their share to two. In the district that includes Louisville, Democrats had long sought to dislodge Representative Anne M. Northup, a Republican who sits on the House Appropriations Committee. John Yarmuth, a Democratic businessman who once edited an alternative newspaper, defeated Ms. Northup, winning 51 percent of the vote to her 48 percent. 

LOUISIANA
 A 13-way bipartisan brawl for the seat of Representative William J. Jefferson, a Democrat from New Orleans suspected of taking bribes, will require a runoff in December to decide. But the seat will remain Democratic: the two front-runners are Mr. Jefferson, a suave eight-term incumbent, and Karen R. Carter, a state representative who received the state Democratic Party endorsement. 
 Despite being accused by the F.B.I. of stashing $90,000 from a technology company in his freezer, Mr. Jefferson had drawn 29 percent of the votes with 73 percent of precincts reporting. Ms. Carter had collected 25 percent. Louisiana requires a runoff if no candidate gets more than half the votes. The state's six other congressmen -- five Republicans and a Democrat -- were all re-elected.

MISSISSIPPI
 Four years ago, Trent Lott resigned as Senate majority leader after making what many felt were racially insensitive remarks by praising the late Strom Thurmond and his segregationist presidential campaign of 1948. His political influence has not waned at home, though, and Mr. Lott, a Republican, comfortably secured his re-election.
 Mr. Lott, who has represented Mississippi in Washington since 1973, raised and spent $3 million on a race against two cash-strapped opponents: State Representative Erik Fleming, a Democrat, and Harold M. Taylor, a Libertarian and construction worker.
 Recovery from Hurricane Katrina was a top issue, and Mr. Lott heavily promoted his role in helping to pass a huge aid bill for the state's rebuilding projects. In interviews, he said he was weighing a return to leadership if Republicans retained their Senate majority. 

NORTH CAROLINA
 Heath Shuler, a Democratic businessman and former National Football League quarterback, defeated the eight-term Republican incumbent, Charles H. Taylor, for the House seat in the 11th District, in western North Carolina. 
 Before the election, Republicans held a seven-to-six advantage over Democrats in the state's Congressional delegation, but Mr. Shuler's victory tipped that balance. It also helped the Democratic Party's bid to win overall control of the House. 
 A political novice, Mr. Shuler pushed a conservative platform in an area where registered Democrats are in the majority but Republicans usually win national races. Like Mr. Taylor, he opposed abortion and amnesty for illegal immigrants, and supported the right to carry guns.
 In another closely watched race, Michael B. Nifong, the Democratic prosecutor in the Duke University rape case, was re-elected to the Durham County district attorney post. 

OKLAHOMA
 Voters closed a loophole in the state Constitution allowing legislators to be paid even if they are jailed. They also lifted a ban on Election Day alcohol sales that had been on the books since statehood. 
 Gov. Brad Henry, a Democrat, easily won a second term, defeating Representative Ernest Istook, who served seven terms in Congress. Lt. Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, won Mr. Istook's seat. Ms. Fallin will become the state's second woman to serve in Congress and the first since 1923.

SOUTH CAROLINA
 Voters approved a constitutional amendment barring legal recognition of same-sex unions and re-elected the Republican governor.
 The amendment prohibits the state from conferring any domestic-partner benefits or recognizing marriages or civil unions from other states. South Carolina is one of eight states voting on such proposals this year. 
 Gov. Mark Sanford defeated State Senator Tommy Moore, a Democrat endorsed by some prominent Republicans. 
 Troubles with electronic voting machines resulted in long lines. Mr. Sanford was initially turned away by poll workers because he did not have a voter registration card.

TENNESSEE
 In one of the nation's most bitterly fought Senate races, Bob Corker, a Republican, narrowly defeated Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., a Democrat from Memphis. 
 Exit polls showed Mr. Corker drawing strong support from white evangelical Christians, who comprised about half of the electorate. Mr. Corker will succeed Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, who is retiring after two terms and weighing a presidential run.
 Mr. Corker, a businessman, was state finance commissioner from 1995 to 1997 and mayor of Chattanooga from 2001 to 2005. 
 Mr. Ford, a five-term congressman, was trying to become the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction. 
 Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, easily won a second term, defeating State Senator Jim Bryson.
 In the House races, David Davis was elected to succeed Representative Bill Jenkins, a fellow Republican, who is retiring. In the race to succeed Mr. Ford, State Senator Stephen I. Cohen, a Democrat, defeated Mark White, a Republican, and Jake Ford, an independent candidate who is a brother of Mr. Ford. 
 A constitutional ban on same-sex marriage passed overwhelmingly.

TEXAS
 A crowded field in the race for governor helped Rick Perry, a Republican, win re-election without winning a majority of the vote. There is no runoff election in Texas for governor.
 Chris Bell, a Democrat who had to raise fresh campaign funds as recently as late October to keep his ads on radio and TV networks, was expected to finish second. Trailing were Carole Keeton Strayhorn, the state's Republican comptroller, who ran as an independent; Kinky Friedman, the musician who sought to channel Jesse Ventura; and the Libertarian candidate, James Werner.
 Democrats picked up the Congressional seat previously held by Tom DeLay, the former Republican House majority leader who resigned earlier this year but whose name remained on the ballot. With 97 percent of the precincts reporting, Nick Lampson, a Democrat, had 54 percent of the vote to 40 percent for Shelley Sekula-Gibbs, a Republican and Houston City Council member who ran as a write-in candidate. 
 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, easily won her race.

VIRGINIA
 A razor-thin margin separated the candidates in Virginia's closely watched Senate race. Senator George Allen, a Republican haunted by campaign miscues, traded leads throughout the night with Jim Webb, a Democrat, in a contest that seemed headed for a recount. 
 With nearly 100 percent of precincts reporting but with absentee ballots still being counted, Mr. Webb was leading by two-tenths of a percentage point. More than 130,000 absentee ballots had been requested. Virginia law allows for a state-financed recount if the margin of victory is within one-half of a percentage point. 
 Mr. Allen had been expected to win a second term easily, but after he called a Webb supporter of Indian descent ''macaca'' at an August campaign rally, he was left defending himself against charges of racial insensitivity. 
 Mr. Webb, a Vietnam veteran who was Navy secretary in the Reagan administration, switched parties in opposition to President Bush's handling of the war in Iraq. 
 In House races, incumbent Republicans, Representatives Thelma Drake and Frank R. Wolf, held on in the hotly contested 2nd and 10th Districts, dashing Democratic hopes of picking up vulnerable seats. 
 Voters also passed a state constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.

 BODY:

Solidly red, or an incursion of blue? The Republicans try to hold onto their turf.

ALASKA
 After beating the Republican incumbent in the primary, Sarah Palin, the mayor of an Anchorage suburb, held a strong lead this morning over a Democratic former governor, Tony Knowles, with half of the votes counted. She hoped to become Alaska's first female governor. Alaska's congressman, Don Young, was re-elected to a 17th term.

ARIZONA
 Immigration was the defining issue in Arizona, where Senator Jon Kyl, the once-untouchable Republican, won a tough re-election campaign against the Democratic challenger, Jim Pederson, a shopping mall developer and former state Democratic Party chairman. With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Kyl had 53 percent of the vote compared with 44 for Mr. Pederson.
Representative J. D. Hayworth, a Republican in a conservative district, lost his fight for a seventh term to Harry Mitchell, also a former state Democratic Party chairman. The seat of Representative Jim Kolbe, a Republican who is retiring, was won by the Democrat, Gabrielle Giffords. Mr. Kolbe refused to endorse the Republican candidate who won the primary. 
 Voters approved a largely symbolic ballot measure to make English the official language of Arizona, though many Hispanic voters opposed the measure. Other initiatives included an increase in the minimum wage, antismoking measures and one to amend the state Constitution to ban same-sex unions. Another initiative would prevent illegal immigrants from participating in certain state-financed programs.
 Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, defeated her Republican opponent, Len Munsil. 

CALIFORNIA
 A Republican in a Democratic state, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger began the year in trouble after voters rejected his bid to reshape Sacramento with ballot initiatives. But he mended fences with the Legislature, moved to the center, and easily won his first full term.
 Senator Dianne Feinstein was re-elected, and a fellow Democrat, former Gov. Jerry Brown, was leading in early returns for attorney general, hoping to return to statewide office after 24 years.
 In races influenced by the national anti-Republican mood, Republican Representatives Richard Pombo and John Doolittle were in neck-and-neck races for re-election.
 Californians weighed a variety of initiatives, including one to require parental notification before a minor can have an abortion, a $2.60-per-pack increase in cigarette taxes, a lifetime monitoring of sex offenders via a global positioning system and a ban on eminent-domain seizure of private property for private use.

COLORADO
 A strong Democratic showing turned Colorado from red to purple. Democrats elected a governor, expanded their share of Colorado's seven-seat Congressional delegation to at least four from three, and appeared likely to maintain their hold on both houses of the legislature, partial returns indicated. 
 In the race to succeed Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican who is retiring, Bill Ritter, a Democrat and former Denver district attorney who campaigned as a problem-solver, defeated Representative Bob Beauprez, a Republican.
 In the election for the seat Mr. Beauprez vacated in the Denver suburbs, former State Senator Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat, defeated the Republican, Rick O'Donnell, a Republican former chairman of the state's Commission on Higher Education.
 In the Congressional district that represents Colorado's eastern prairie counties and Fort Collins, partial returns showed the Republican, Representative Marilyn Musgrave, in a surprisingly tight contest with the Democrat, State Representative Angie Paccione.
 Even before the vote, some Republicans were blaming not only the war in Iraq but also conservatives in their party for nominating extreme candidates who irritated moderates.

HAWAII
 Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, appeared headed for an easy victory over his Republican challenger, State Representative Cynthia Thielen, to win his third full term. Gov. Linda Lingle, a Republican, was running for a second term and was expected to withstand a challenge from the Democratic candidate, Randy Iwase, a former state senator.

IDAHO
 This heavily Republican state had two surprisingly close races. A three-term Republican congressman, C. L. Otter, known as Butch, was ahead of a Democratic newspaper publisher, Jerry Brady, with 42 percent of precincts reporting. Gov. James E. Risch -- a Republican who took office in May after his predecessor, Dirk Kempthorne, became the United States interior secretary -- decided not to seek a full term but to instead run for his former job as lieutenant governor. In the western of Idaho's two House districts, which Mr. Otter represents, State Representative Bill Sali, a Republican, had an early lead over Larry Grant, a Democratic lawyer.
 On the ballot were a proposition to limit the use of eminent domain for economic development and a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.

MONTANA
 The Senate contest here could not have been tighter or the stakes bigger: Jon Tester, a Democrat, was leading Senator Conrad Burns, a Republican seeking his fourth term. With 64 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Tester was ahead, 51 percent of the vote to 47 percent.
 In surveys of voters leaving the polls, 60 percent said they believed Mr. Burns had been in office too long and 55 percent said they disapproved of the way President Bush was handling his job.
 Gov. Brian Schweitzer has used the race to promote a new style of Western Democrat: strong on gun rights and environmental protection, against free trade deals and in favor of the death penalty, lower taxes and abortion rights. The national significance drew recent visits by Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney in support of Mr. Burns.
 Voters approved an increase in the minimum wage to $6.15 and a measure banning certain state officials from becoming lobbyists too soon after leaving their government jobs.

NEVADA
 An accusation of an improper sexual advance helped narrow the gubernatorial race in Nevada, but Jim Gibbons, a Republican congressman from Reno, had enjoyed a sizable lead over Dina Titus, a Democratic state senator, until late last month when a waitress accused him of trying to force himself upon her in a garage.
 With 85 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Gibbons led by 14,000 votes, or a 47-percent-to-45-percent margin.
 Mr. Gibbons has denied the accusation and has said he walked the woman to the garage and steadied her when she stumbled. Footage from security cameras could prove crucial.
 Mr. Gibbons and Ms. Titus, a political science professor, competed to replace Gov. Kenny Guinn, a popular Republican who cannot run again because of term limits.
 In the Senate race, John Ensign, a Republican, was on track to soundly beat Jack Carter, a Democrat and son of former President Jimmy Carter.
 Nevadans also rejected a proposal that would have legalized marijuana. A separate proposal banning smoking in public places was too close to call. 

NEW MEXICO
 In a House race where Democrats hoped to wrest a seat from Republicans, the Democratic attorney general, Patricia A. Madrid, led the incumbent, Heather A. Wilson, by less than a percentage point with 59 percent of precincts reporting. 
 Iraq was a hot topic in this campaign to represent a district around Albuquerque that has sent Republicans to the House for nearly 40 years. Ms. Wilson, a former National Security Council staff member, sits on the House Intelligence Committee, and Ms. Madrid has held her partly to blame for inaccurate reports on Iraq's weapons programs.
 New Mexico's Democratic senator, Jeff Bingaman, and Democratic governor, Bill Richardson, won easy re-election, as did the state's other two representatives, a Democrat and a Republican.

OREGON
 Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski, a Democrat, won re-election, overcoming a tough challenge from his Republican opponent, Ron Saxton. 
 Mr. Saxton had cast the race as a referendum on four years of ''lackluster leadership'' by Mr. Kulongoski. He promised new ideas to improve schools and increase the efficiency of state government.
 The state's five House members, four Democrats and one Republican, all won re-election. Representative Darlene Hooley, a five-term Democrat, faced the stiffest challenge, in the Fifth District, from Mike Erickson, a businessman who put more than $1.3 million of his money into the race. Mr. Erickson said he was ''not part of the partisan bickering, not a part of the scandals'' in Washington.
 Voters were also deciding an initiative on parental notification for abortions.

UTAH
 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Finance and Judiciary Committees, easily won a sixth term, defeating a Democratic opponent, Peter Ashdown, the founder of an Internet service provider. Utah's three House incumbents, two Republicans and one Democrat, were easily re-elected.

WASHINGTON
 Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, defeated her Republican challenger, Michael McGavick, to win her first re-election bid.
 Ms. Cantwell's seat seemed in jeopardy earlier this year, when she faced tough criticism from liberal constituents over her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq. She rebounded, though, managing to fend off Mr. McGavick, a business executive, and three left-wing rivals with a solid campaign based on issues like renewable energy and environmental preservation; both are dear to local voters.
 Ms. Cantwell opposed the repeal of the federal estate tax, and a majority of voters agreed with her. With 28 percent of the precincts reporting, it was unclear if the other two other initiatives on the state ballot, which dealt with energy conservation and eminent domain, would be approved. 

WYOMING
 Representative Barbara Cubin won her at-large House seat during Newt Gingrich's ''Republican revolution'' of 1994. But even in conservative Wyoming, Ms. Cubin's sometimes caustic personality turned off some voters and gave Gary Trauner a once unthinkable chance of winning a seat for Democrats in Vice President Dick Cheney's home state. Ms. Cubin was leading Mr. Trauner by about 650 votes with 98 percent counted in a race that was too close to call. Gov. Dave Freudenthal, a Democrat, and Senator Craig Thomas, a Republican, kept their seats.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 22, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Reports about Washington State in the State by State election summary on Nov. 8 and 9 referred incorrectly to a voter initiative on property rights, which was defeated. The measure would make governments pay for enacting zoning restrictions that reduce the value of private land; it would not regulate eminent domain.

 BODY:

A big shift in Ohio, and a Senate battle in Missouri that turned all eyes to the Show Me State.

ILLINOIS
 For more than 30 years, the Republican elder statesman Henry J. Hyde held an unbreakable grip on the suburbs west and northwest of Chicago. As he retires, his party will retain control of his Sixth District seat, with State Senator Peter Roskam, a Republican, winning a tight race against Tammy Duckworth, the Democratic candidate. 
 Ms. Duckworth, a former helicopter pilot who lost both her legs while serving in the war in Iraq, had a compelling personal story and fervently attacked President Bush's handling of the war, giving Democrats high hopes of picking up a Republican seat. But Mr. Roskam prevailed, clashing with Ms. Duckworth on abortion rights, embryonic stem cell research and tax cuts. He had to tread carefully in supporting the war without seeming to question Ms. Duckworth's patriotism.
Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, a Democrat, won a second term despite a federal investigation into the state's hiring practices. 

INDIANA
 
 The Republican bloodbath started early in Indiana, which along with Kentucky had the earliest poll closings in the country. In the Eighth Congressional District, nicknamed the ''Bloody Eighth'' because of its history of close races, the outcome was anything but close. Brad Ellsworth, a conservative Democrat, handily defeated John Hostettler, the six-term Republican. Mr. Ellsworth, the sheriff of Vanderburgh County, was one of three Democrats to oust incumbents. 
 In the Second District, Joe Donnelly, a lawyer, defeated Chris Chocola, who had been seeking a third term. In the Ninth District, Baron Hill, a former two-term congressman, took back the seat from Mike Sodrel, who won in 2004. Senator Richard G. Lugar, a Republican, easily won re-election to a sixth term.

IOWA
 Chet Culver, the Democratic candidate for governor, defeated Representative Jim Nussle, a Republican, in the race to succeed Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat. Mr. Culver, the son of former Senator John C. Culver, is the Iowa secretary of state. Mr. Nussle, a member of Congress for 16 years, has cast many votes to cut spending as chairman of the House Budget Committee.
 In a typical attack, Mr. Culver said that President Bush and Mr. Nussle had cut student loans to help pay for ''trillions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.''
 In the contest for Mr. Nussle's seat in Congress, the Democratic candidate, Bruce L. Braley, a former president of the Iowa Trial Lawyers Association, defeated the Republican, Mike Whalen, who owns and operates hotels and restaurants. Mr. Braley said Congress must ''roll back the Bush tax cut for millionaires.''
 In the Des Moines area, Representative Leonard L. Boswell, a moderate-to-conservative Democrat, won re-election, defeating Jeff Lamberti, a Republican state legislator.

KANSAS
 It can be hard to tell Democrats from Republicans in Kansas, where Democrats have nominated party-switchers for several offices.
 Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, a Democrat, easily won a second term, and for the second time she chose a lieutenant governor candidate who until recently was a Republican.
 Another former Republican, Paul Morrison, a district attorney, defeated Attorney General Phill Kline, who was criticized for using evangelical churches as extensions of his campaign organization.
 Representative Jim Ryun, a Republican, lost to Nancy Boyda in a mostly Republican district.

MICHIGAN
 Voters approved a hotly contested proposition that prohibits public institutions from considering race or sex in public education, employment or contracting. 
 With 75 percent of the precincts reporting, the measure passed with 58 percent of the vote, even though it was opposed by much of the state's political and civic leadership. It was backed by Ward Connerly, a former University of California regent, and a white woman who was denied admission to the University of Michigan. Despite a late spurt of Republican spending in the state, Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, won a second term, overcoming a largely self-financed challenge by Dick DeVos, a former president of the Amway Corporation. 
 Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, defeated Michael Bouchard, a sheriff and a Republican, to win her second term.
 Democrats were hoping to take control of at least one chamber of the Michigan Legislature. Both houses have had Republican majorities since 1999. 
 None of the state's 15 Congressional seats, 9 of which are held by Republicans, were expected to change hands, however.

MINNESOTA
 In one of the most hotly contested governor's races, Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, battled the Democratic challenger, Mike Hatch, the state attorney general. The campaign season in Minnesota was largely defined by debates on Iraq, immigration and taxes. Mr. Pawlenty, once discussed as a possible vice presidential candidate, found himself in an unexpectedly difficult race; in recent polls he trailed Mr. Hatch by several percentage points. 
 Polls suggested that Minnesota voters were extremely dissatisfied with Congress. Representative Gil Gutknecht, a six-term Republican, was in a close race with the Democratic challenger, Tim Walz, a teacher and former member of the National Guard.
 The seat being vacated by Senator Mark Dayton, a Democrat, was won by another Democrat, Amy Klobuchar, the county attorney in Hennepin County. She defeated Representative Mark Kennedy, the Republican, who was hurt by his defense of President Bush's position on the war.

MISSOURI
 In a crucial Senate victory for Democrats, the state auditor, Claire C. McCaskill, narrowly defeated the Republican incumbent, Jim Talent.
 Ms. McCaskill's margin tracked closely with the vote on a hotly debated ballot measure on stem cell research that she supported and Mr. Talent opposed; it appeared headed for approval. The initiative would block the state legislature from banning any federally allowed stem cell research, including the embryonic cloning opposed by conservative Christians.
 President Bush visited Missouri twice in recent days to support Mr. Talent. But exit polls found that Ms. McCaskill drew 57 percent of the votes of those who decided in the last three days.
 Missourians voted to increase the minimum wage to $6.50 an hour from $5.15, with an annual cost-of-living increase. They also raised cigarette taxes by 80 cents a pack. The state's five Republican and four Democratic House members were all re-elected.

NEBRASKA
 Senator Ben Nelson, a former governor who is one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, easily won a second term. 
 The Republican challenger, Pete Ricketts, who was the chief operating officer of Ameritrade, the financial services company, spent millions of dollars of his own money on advertisements. 
 But Mr. Nelson, who had voted for many of President Bush's tax cuts, had bipartisan appeal in this Republican-leaning state.
 The governor, Dave Heineman, a Republican, also won re-election. He defeated the Democratic challenger, David Hahn, a political newcomer, lawyer and Internet entrepreneur. 
 Scott Kleeb, a Democrat and Yale-educated rancher, won the endorsement of the conservative Omaha World-Herald, the state's largest newspaper, in his bid for an open House seat.

NORTH DAKOTA
 Although this is a heavily Republican state that favored President Bush by 27 percentage points in 2000 and 2004, two Democrats -- Senator Kent Conrad and Representative Earl Pomeroy -- easily defeated their relatively unknown challengers.
 Voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative to curb the government's power to seize private property through eminent domain.
 This has been a hot issue around the country since the Supreme Court last year upheld the government's right to transfer property from one private party to another for the purpose of economic development. 

OHIO
 Republicans' long dominance of Ohio politics came to an end.
 Voters angered by government corruption, factory closings and President Bush's handling of the Iraq war elected Democrats for governor, United States senator and the top state posts of attorney general, secretary of state and treasurer. Democrats also increased their share of Ohio's 18-member delegation in the House of Representatives. Gov. Bob Taft was leaving office disgraced by scandal. The Democratic candidate to succeed him, Representative Ted Strickland, a Methodist minister, crushed the Republican, Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, a Christian conservative and a leading black politician in the state.
 In the Senate race, Representative Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, unseated Mike DeWine, the incumbent Republican, after attacking him during the campaign for backing President Bush on Iraq and for supporting free trade agreements that now appear to have cost the state jobs.
 Zack Space, a Democratic lawyer, won the Congressional seat held by Representative Bob Ney, who pleaded guilty in October to accepting illegal gifts from lobbyists. Mr. Space defeated State Senator Joy Padgett, the Republican candidate.

SOUTH DAKOTA
 Voters rejected a measure passed by the Legislature that would bar doctors from performing abortions except to prevent the death of pregnant women. The measure had been described as a ''full frontal attack'' on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.
 With 70 percent of precincts reporting, 55 percent of the vote was against the measure. In pre-election polls, a majority of voters indicated opposition to it because it did not include exemptions for rape and incest. The measure would have allowed abortions only if necessary to save a woman's life.
 In the major statewide race, Gov. Mike Rounds, a Republican, comfortably won re-election against his Democratic challenger, Jack Billion, a former state representative.

WISCONSIN
 Gov. James E. Doyle, a Democrat seeking his second term, won a close race for governor against Representative Mark Green, the Republican, in a campaign dominated by debates over stem cell research, taxes and the economy. The stem cell issue is strongly felt in Wisconsin, where the first human embryonic stem cells were isolated. Mr. Doyle favors all types of stem cell research, while Mr. Green opposes research on embryonic stem cells.
 Senator Herb Kohl, a Democrat, easily won his fourth term in office.
 Voters considered two ballot initiatives. One asked whether the death penalty, banned in the state since the 1850s, should be reinstated. And voters approved a measure to amend the state Constitution to prohibit same-sex unions; early polls indicated voters had been strongly divided over the issue.

HEADLINE: Democrats Topple G.O.P. Incumbents in Three Senate Contests

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
Democrats defeated Republican senators in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island and held off spirited Republican challenges in New Jersey and Maryland in their bid to win back control of the Senate, which was lost to the Republicans in 2002.
 Democrats turned out the incumbents Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania, Mike DeWine in Ohio and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, all of whom had been struggling against a Democratic tide that built throughout the fall.
 One of the most closely watched races -- and one that could well determine control of the Senate -- was in Virginia, where Senator George Allen, a Republican, was in an excruciatingly close contest with Jim Webb, a Democrat and former secretary of the Navy. The margin was whisker-thin, and the race could be headed for a recount. 
 With votes still being counted, Mr. Webb addressed a cheering crowd after 11 p.m., saying: ''This is a very, very close race. When we look at where the votes are that have yet to be counted, it looks very, very good for our side.''
 ''It's going to take awhile to count all the rest of these votes,'' said Mr. Webb, who said his campaign would be carefully monitoring absentee ballots, which he said seemed to be leaning in his favor.
 The Democrats need to pick up six seats to gain control of the Senate, which Republicans control 55 to 45. If Mr. Webb prevails, the Democrats would win control of the Senate by unseating Republican incumbents in Missouri and Montana, but those races were undecided early this morning.
 In poll after poll in Pennsylvania and Ohio, voters expressed concern about the economy, dismay with corruption scandals involving Republican officials and discontent about the war in Iraq.
 The Senate race in Pennsylvania was the nation's second most expensive, after New York's, with Mr. Santorum spending $23 million trying to fend off a challenge from Bob Casey, a moderate, anti-abortion Democrat who spent $13 million.
 In Ohio, Mr. DeWine lost to Representative Sherrod Brown, a liberal Democrat.
 Ohio was particularly difficult ground for Republicans, who fielded a weak candidate for governor in J. Kenneth Blackwell, the secretary of state. Corruption scandals involving two other Republicans, Gov. Bob Taft and Representative Bob Ney, hurt the party's chances from the top to the bottom of the ballot.
 Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic former attorney general of Rhode Island, defeated Mr. Chafee, a liberal Republican who defied President Bush on the Iraq war. But Mr. Chafee could not hold his seat in heavily Democratic Rhode Island in a climate that favored Democrats across the country.
 In New Jersey, Senator Robert Menendez's victory denied Republicans one of their few chances to gain a Senate seat held by Democrats. Mr. Menendez was appointed to the Senate in January when former Senator Jon Corzine became New Jersey's governor.
 Maryland, ordinarily a reliably Democratic state, gave Democrats a scare in recent weeks as the race grew tighter between Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, a Democrat, and Michael Steele, the Republican lieutenant governor.
 Mr. Steele, who is black, won the endorsement of Wayne K. Curry, the influential former Democratic county executive in majority-black Prince George's County. But in the end, Mr. Steele was unable to overcome Maryland's nearly two-to-one Democratic tilt in voter registration.
 Democrats were also expected to benefit from two victories by independents. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut won re-election as an independent after losing a bitter Democratic primary to Ned Lamont, a wealthy antiwar candidate from Greenwich. Another independent, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, also won election to the Senate. Both are expected to caucus with Democrats.
 Elsewhere, most incumbents coasted to re-election as expected. The Democratic Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Bill Nelson of Florida, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Thomas R. Carper of Delaware all won.
 Republicans held on to the seats of Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, Trent Lott of Mississippi, Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Craig Thomas of Wyoming. 
 Political analysts have been saying for weeks that control of the Senate would come down to races in Missouri, Montana, Tennessee and Virginia, and their predictions appeared to hold as polls closed. 
 Democrats had singled out Republican-held seats in Virginia, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, Tennessee and Montana and poured tens of millions of dollars into those races. To win a majority, Democrats also needed to make sure they protected seats in competitive contests in New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Washington.
 Other threatened Republican Senate incumbents were Conrad Burns of Montana, a three-term Republican conservative who narrowly won re-election six years ago, and Jim Talent in Missouri, who was running against Claire McCaskill, the state auditor. Mr. Burns faced Jon Tester, State Senate president, third-generation rancher and hunting enthusiast. While Montana supported President Bush in 2000 and 2004, two years ago it elected Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, as governor. 
 Voters in Virginia were to decide on the political aspirations of Mr. Allen, a Republican who was once considered credible presidential material. But a series of racially insensitive comments and his poor handling of revelations that his mother was Jewish weakened his re-election campaign and may well cripple his political career.
 Mr. Webb, a decorated marine combat veteran and respected novelist, is a former Republican who served as Navy secretary under President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Webb faced criticism for things he wrote more than two decades ago questioning whether women belonged in combat and the military academies.
 One unsuccessful Democratic candidate, Harold E. Ford Jr., had faced an uphill fight in Tennessee. Despite running what political professionals called one of the most skillful campaigns in the country, he lost to Bob Corker, the Republican former mayor of Chattanooga, in the race for the seat vacated by the retirement of Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader.

HEADLINE: For Start-Ups, Web Success On the Cheap

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
When Seth J. Sternberg and two colleagues started Meebo, a Web-based instant-messaging service, they didn't go looking for venture capitalists. Using their credit cards, they financed the company themselves to the tune of $2,000 apiece. It was enough to cover their biggest expense -- leasing a few computer servers at $120 a month each. 
 Within a month of its introduction in September 2005, Meebo was getting as many as 50,000 log-ins a day, and it needed more servers. It decided to take a modest $100,000 from three angel investors, wealthy individuals who typically contribute small amounts but do not get involved in management decisions.
''We had a bunch of V.C.'s talking to us about potentially putting more money in,'' Mr. Sternberg said. ''We said no. A lot of things happen when you raise a V.C. round, and they really slow you down.'' 
 Eventually, Meebo did raise money from venture investors -- about $3.5 million from Sequoia Capital. But that was after the company was well on its way to showing that its service was a hit; Meebo had about 200,000 daily log-ins. 
 In the last couple of years, hundreds of other Internet start-up companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere have followed a similar trajectory. Unlike most companies formed during the first Internet boom, which were built on costly technology and marketing budgets, many of the current crop of Internet start-ups have gone from zero to 60 on a shoestring. 
 Some have gone without venture capital altogether or have raised far smaller sums than venture investors would have liked. Many were sold for millions before venture capitalists could even get in. That has been a challenge for venture capitalists, who have raised record amounts in recent years and need places to put that money to work. 
 ''V.C.'s hate it; they want you to take big money,'' said Jay Adelson, who is the chief executive of two start-ups, Digg and Revision3. Digg took some venture money, but far less than backers offered, and Revision3 has been running on about $850,000 raised from a group of angel investors.
 Several venture firms are seeking to adapt. Just last week, Charles River Ventures announced it would offer loans of $250,000 to entrepreneurs as a way to gain access to promising start-ups. Other firms are also giving out small loans, albeit not as a part of any formal program. 
 For its part, Mohr Davidow Ventures has increased the number of ''seed'' investments -- small sums given to embryonic companies -- to about 10 a year from 5. And Union Square Ventures, which was formed in 2003, has made nearly half of its investments at $1 million or less, a departure from its initial plan to make first-round bets of $1 million to $3 million, according to its Web site. 
 ''I think there is in the V.C. community a sense that the rules have changed or are changing,'' said John Battelle, a journalist and entrepreneur, who is a host of a technology conference in San Francisco this week that will include a panel on the subject. ''How does the V.C. who is set up for a model that requires millions, if not tens of millions, revamp for a different scale?'' 
 And as large firms try to go small, they are encountering a new crop of competitors who are happy to bankroll start-ups on the cheap and are fueling the current Internet boom. They include a large pool of angel investors and a number of small venture funds whose specialty is to invest tens of thousands of dollars, or hundreds of thousands at most. 
 There is even a group called Y Combinator, whose rule of thumb for investing in start-ups is $6,000 per employee. One of its investments, Reddit, was acquired last week by Wired Digital, which is owned by Conde Nast Publications, for an undisclosed sum.
 ''I came to the conclusion that $500,000 was the new $5 million,'' said Michael Maples Jr., an entrepreneur who created a $15 million venture fund aimed at investing in companies that required little capital. Mr. Maples sees himself not so much as a competitor to venture capitalists, but as someone who is filling the gap between angels, who may invest $250,000 or so in a start-up, and venture investors, whose typical early-stage bet is closer to $5 million.
 Several forces are allowing companies to operate cheaply compared with the first Internet boom. They include the declining costs of hardware and bandwidth, the wide availability of open-source software, and the ability to generate revenue through online ads. 
 ''It's a great time to be an entrepreneur,'' Joe Kraus, a veteran of the dot-com boom, wrote in a widely noted blog posting last year. Mr. Kraus said it took $3 million to get his first start-up, Excite.com, from idea to product, much of it spent on servers and software, which have since become much cheaper or even free. His new start-up, JotSpot, was started on just $100,000. 
 With the notable exception of YouTube, many recent acquisitions involved Internet start-ups that simply could not effectively use large amounts from venture capitalists or produce large returns, said Paul Kedrosky, a venture capitalist and blogger.
 ''The problem is that as a V.C., these companies don't soak up enough capital,'' Mr. Kedrosky said. 
 To succeed, a firm with a $250 million fund needs a handful of investments from $10 million to $15 million that can return payouts of $150 million or more, Mr. Kedrosky said. But even a twentyfold return on a $1 million investment will not do much for the success of a large fund, Mr. Kedrosky said. 
 For smaller funds, the economics are far different. For starters, those who manage them do not earn huge management fees. Instead, they are almost always among the largest investors in the fund, so they will earn a return if the investments pay off.
 ''I think large venture funds in this economic model have a challenge,'' said Josh Kopelman, managing director of First Round Capital. Since starting First Round in 2004, Mr. Kopelman has made about 30 investments that range from $250,000 to $500,000. Mr. Kopelman, who made a fortune as a serial entrepreneur, is the largest investor in First Round's $50 million fund. 
 Y Combinator is aiming at even smaller firms, and its approach is decidedly unorthodox. It chooses companies for financing in two batches of 8 to 12; one batch is selected in the winter from companies based in Silicon Valley, the other in the summer from those in Cambridge, Mass. 
 ''When you change the amount of money, a lot of things change,'' said Paul Graham, one of four partners in Y Combinator, who made millions when his company, Viaweb, was sold to Yahoo in 1998. ''We have to mass-produce things. We can be more risky. We are like mice, and V.C.'s are more like elephants. They can only make a few deals, so each one has a whole amount of weight and worry attached to it.'' 
 As for the target investment of $6,000 for each employee, an explanation on Y Combinator's Web site makes it clear that Mr. Graham and his colleagues are not looking for computer science entrepreneurs who want to be pampered: ''C.S. grad students at M.I.T. currently get $2,000/month to live on, so this represents three months' living expenses. Though in fact most groups make it last longer.''
 Established venture capitalists, however, say the new crop of capital-efficient start-ups represents an opportunity, not a problem. 
 ''Companies have bootstrapped themselves in earlier eras,'' said Gary Morgenthaler, a general partner at Morgenthaler Ventures. ''There is no shortage of companies that need venture capital and company-building skills.'' 
 Jon Feiber, a general partner at Mohr Davidow Ventures, said it was ''incredibly good and healthy'' that many Internet start-ups were able to do more with less. 
 ''A small percentage of those companies will lend themselves to the model of a larger fund,'' Mr. Feiber said. ''If your goal is to generate something of huge value and scale, it is going to take more than $300,000 or $400,000.'' 
 JotSpot, the company that Mr. Kraus started on $100,000, may fit that mold. The company eventually took in $4.5 million from a pair of venture capital firms, and last week it was acquired by Google for an undisclosed sum.
 ''I think it could be a great time to be a venture capitalist,'' Mr. Kraus said in an interview. ''Like in any competitive market, fear and hope are the two competing forces.'' And for venture capitalists, the success of scrappy start-ups may simply be heightening the fear. ''I think there is a lot of fear that people won't get into the best deals,'' Mr. Kraus said.

HEADLINE: China's Trade Surplus Climbs Sharply 

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
China said Wednesday that its trade surplus with the rest of the world had leapt to a record $23.8 billion in October, the latest sign of this country's phenomenal rise as a trading superpower. 
 The surplus, which blew past the previous record of $18.8 billion set in August, is almost certain to add to longstanding trade frictions with the United States and the European Union and lead to renewed calls for China to allow its currency to appreciate at a faster pace.
 For the last few years, the Chinese economy has been growing at a blistering pace -- as high as 10 percent. Its foreign currency reserves, the world's largest, hit $1 trillion this week, and its factory floors are pumping out millions of toys, textiles, DVD players and laptop computers. 
 In the first nine months of this year, China says it has racked up a $133 billion surplus with the rest of the world, primarily with the United States and the European Union. In all of last year, China reported a record $101 billion surplus.
 Indeed, China's surplus for the month of October was almost as big as its surplus for the entire year of 2004, which was $25.5 billion.
 Economists were surprised at the size of the October gain, which has come after months of government efforts to slow the economy and trim the surplus in hopes of easing trade frictions. 
 ''This is obviously going to raise eyebrows,'' said Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. ''And so we may now have more talk about currency appreciation.'' 
 The Chinese government did not release precise details of the monthly surplus, but it said that in October exports rose 29.6 percent, to $88.1 billion, while imports climbed just 14.7 percent, a slowing from September. 
 Stephen Green, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said that the real surprise was the weakness in imports, which came despite a rise in oil imports. 
 ''This is not being driven by them selling more, it's being driven by them buying less,'' he said. ''It's all a bit strange.'' 
 He said the government began its efforts to slow both the economy and overheated investment in the summer, but imports remained strong. And Beijing has let the currency appreciate modestly, which would encourage purchasing goods from the rest of the world. 
 Some experts believe that Chinese buyers are putting off purchases because of the government efforts, and investments in new factories could be slowing because those efforts are just beginning to be reflected in the figures.
 But exports to the United States and Europe continued to grow at a fast pace. 
 According to the Chinese government, China has already racked up a $116 billion surplus with the United States this year. But the United States government, because it calculates its trade figures differently, often shows much bigger gains for China. 
 Many economists doubt the situation can be easily addressed by trade negotiations or by pressuring China to revalue its currency. 
 ''This is the reality,'' said Mr. Tao, the Credit Suisse economist. ''Structurally China is the world's factory floor. Two, everyone expected American demand to slow down, and it hasn't. And third, China needs to ease its economy.'' 
 He added: ''Nothing is going to change overnight, so sit back and fasten your seat belts. This big surplus is not going to go away anytime soon.''

HEADLINE: In Retirement Planning, There Is Nothing Certain About Death and Taxes 

BYLINE: By Austan Goolsbee. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and a research fellow at the American Bar Foundation. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
For millions of Americans, November means open enrollment time -- the brief period when employees make their choices about next year's benefits, including 401(k) savings.
 If you are one of the millions of people trying to decide about 401(k)s, you have probably heard about the dangers of investing too much into your own company's stock and have compared the risks of investing in stocks versus bonds. You may even have asked co-workers for hints about what to do.
You probably have not given much thought to political tax risk, however, or perhaps have even heard of it. Yet the purely political question of what will happen to tax rates over the next 30 years has become one of the most important factors in thinking about tax-deferred savings accounts -- more important than many of the conventional issues you have spent your time thinking about. 
 Future increases in tax rates potentially threaten to significantly reduce the value of your retirement savings and may even mean that you should not save in 401(k) accounts at all.
 To understand why, think about the traditional advantages of a tax-favored account like a 401(k). Relative to a regular account, where you first pay taxes on your income and then put money into the account and pay taxes on the interest you earn every year, a 401(k) gives you a bonus. You get to put money into the account without paying income tax on it this year and you do not have to pay taxes as it builds up. You just pay income tax on the full amount at the very end when you finally pull out the money in retirement.
 The tax-free buildup can give you a nest egg that is significantly greater than conventional savings. That has induced millions of people to participate in these accounts.
 But the lurking catch is that the tax you will pay on your account will be at the rate in place when you retire, not the rate now. And that may be very different.
 Budget analysts unanimously agree that the current fiscal situation of the country is unsustainable. According to the latest numbers from the Government Accountability Office (http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d061077r.pdf), the total fiscal gap facing this country in the future is about $60 trillion, and some budget experts suggest even that is an underestimate.
 One of them, Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University, says that if we try to close the fiscal gap with higher taxes, it will take an immediate and permanent increase of more than 80 percent in all income taxes. When I reached Professor Kotlikoff for a comment, he said, ''The government's accounting is far worse than Enron's.'' His view, summarized bluntly, is that ''the U.S. is bankrupt.''
 While future budget policy seems far removed from your company's open enrollment, you had better pay attention. How the government decides, ultimately, to balance its budget will have a tremendous impact on your retirement savings. If income tax rates double between now and when you retire, the value of your 401(k) may be cut in half.
 Professor Kotlikoff says that closing the fiscal gap entirely from income taxes is ''a political nonstarter'' and may be ''economically ruinous.'' But others think the public will never agree to the major cuts in Social Security and Medicare that would be needed to close the gap. 
 Will it be taxes or spending? No one knows. And that is exactly the point for your 401(k). Political uncertainty is an extremely important type of risk that most people, even the ones who spend time extensively analyzing whether to invest their 401(k) in this or that emerging market, have not given a moment of thought.
 If you think the government will raise income tax rates in the future but will keep capital gains and dividend tax rates low, you may not want to invest in a 401(k) at all. Paying your income tax and then investing money in the stock market may leave you better off in your retirement than investing in the supposedly tax-advantaged savings accounts.
 To be clear, if your employer gives you a generous match for the money you put into your 401(k), that will tend to outweigh any tax risk and so you may as well take the free money and invest. Similarly, if you are the kind of person who invests only in bonds, so you have lots of interest payments, you should stick with the 401(k). If you need the restrictions of the 401(k) to keep you from spending your retirement savings, again, just go ahead and ignore the tax risks.
 But if you are one of the millions of people who did not answer ''yes'' to any of those questions, you should be thinking about the reality of tax risk. One way to avoid such risk would be to put your retirement savings into a Roth I.R.A. Unlike the 401(k), you pay the income taxes on the money when you put it into the Roth rather than when you take it out. It gets the tax-free buildup but there are no taxes when you withdraw it. All the taxes are paid up front so you do not need to worry about what the rates will be when you retire. The problem is that if your family income is more than $160,000 a year, you are not eligible. And even if you are eligible, you cannot put more than about $5,000 a year into a Roth account. Anything more you want to save will entail tax risk.
 So what's a hard-working American to do? You really do not have the information you need. You will have to guess, and just realize that the amount you are going to have to subtract off the top of your 401(k) when you retire may be very big.
 Ben Franklin wrote of the certainty of death and taxes, but he really missed the point that concerns us today. Old Ben never had to face an open enrollment deadline. These days there is nothing certain about the timing, at least, of death and taxes. And for planning your retirement, that can really cost you.

HEADLINE: Victorious Democrats Vow Cooperative Approach on Taxes and Economy 

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting from Washington and David Leonhardt, Eduardo Porter and Alex Berenson contributed from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Maybe Washington can get something done after all.
 Democrats may have won big on Tuesday, but the lawmakers who will soon oversee tax, trade and economic issues on Capitol Hill are trying not to sound confrontational -- or even to crow.
Instead they are pledging to seek common ground with the White House and Congressional Republicans, arguing -- admittedly in the face of skepticism -- that divided government in Washington does not have to be a recipe for fights or gridlock. 
 On Wednesday, as the Democrats woke up to a huge victory at the polls, they were starting to talk about some issues on trade, taxes and regulations on which they and their longtime adversaries might even agree.
 Among these were what Republicans and Democrats alike said were a mutual interest in keeping taxes from rising on middle-class families, tax relief in energy and education and providing regulatory relief for small business. 
 Many analysts said that the possibility of such agreement was not out of the question. Both parties, they said, were aware of voter disgust with partisan confrontations.
 In recent months, business interests, anticipating solid Democratic gains, have also been pouring millions of dollars into Democratic campaigns with the hope and expectation that the new Congressional leadership would support some of their agenda.
 Still, many lawmakers, lobbyists and Congressional aides said that the emerging divide between the White House and Congress would make it hard to achieve agreements on certain issues like trade and health care.
 The top Democrats in the House and Senate tax-writing committees said they would not try to repeal the tax cuts enacted in 2001. They also called on President Bush to show what they said would be similar good faith and not resubmit his proposals for Social Security personal savings accounts.
 On the issues of greatest importance to businesses -- taxes, trade, immigration and health care -- lawmakers expect there will be battles not only between Republicans and Democrats but within the parties as well.
 With the loss of several moderate Republicans in the election, the party is expected to have an even more conservative cast in the House and Senate, even though some Republicans want the party to be more centrist.
 At the same time, a quarter of the House Democrats in the next Congress are from districts that voted for Mr. Bush just two years ago, including more than half of the incoming class. These members could end up in disputes with many of the new committee heads from the party's liberal wing as well as Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is expected to become the House speaker next year.
 Democrats vowed to try to work with Republicans, in part by limiting their ambitions.
 Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the probable next chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said shortly before the election that he hoped to forge an agreement with the Republicans in limiting the growing reach of the alternative minimum tax, which has started to hit many middle-class Americans who claim deductions for state taxes and other expenses. 
 Mr. Rangel said he would also seek to avoid a confrontation that would pit Republicans who want to extend tax breaks on large estates and investment income beyond their scheduled expiration in 2010 against Democrats who want to rescind those measures ahead of time.
 ''Why should we be talking now about 2010?'' Mr. Rangel said. ''I'm 76 years old, and I don't buy green bananas.'' 
 Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who could soon become the head of the Financial Services Committee, said he and other Democrats who have been advising Ms. Pelosi are planning to propose a ''grand bargain'' with business interests. 
 If business groups support the Democrats' efforts to increase the minimum wage, extend student loans and expand affordable housing programs, Mr. Frank said, then the Democrats would support efforts to reduce trade barriers and burdensome regulation.
 ''We are liberal internationalists,'' Mr. Frank said. ''Businesses know they have an interest in working with us.''
 Representative John D. Dingell, who seems likely to once again head the Energy and Commerce Committee, said he intended to focus on an energy bill aimed at making America less dependent on foreign oil. And he plans to hold hearings on what he considers unfair trade practices that hurt American industries and workers. 
 Mr. Dingell, who began serving in the House in 1955 and is the chamber's senior member, said he intended to work with Republicans in shaping legislation because ''it's best to legislate from the middle.''
 But he also said that ''it won't be the easiest task because the far right has controlled the House and I'm not sure how we can emancipate the Republican Party and work with them.'' 
 One big winner from the election is organized labor, which has been increasingly marginalized in Washington in recent years and now has some important allies in leadership positions.
 Following is a closer look at the election's impact on major areas of interest to business and investors:

Taxes
 The two Democratic lawmakers likely to lead the tax-writing committees in Congress prefer to work with Republicans and the Bush administration on limited tax revisions agreeable to both sides. But some of their priorities could lead to fights, they acknowledge.
 ''We have to build up a sense of trust between Republicans and Democrats,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''After all, we only have two years as Democrats to prove that the people made the right choice. On any of the big tax items, it's politically dangerous if it's not done in a bipartisan way.''
 Both Mr. Rangel and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who would become chairman of the Senate Finance Committee if Democrats take control of that body, said Democrats would be making a mistake to pursue rescinding the income tax cuts enacted by Congress in 2001 and expiring in 2010.
 Mr. Rangel said that his goal for a retreat among Democrats and Republicans would be to have them meet away from the Capitol and hear from experts, including perhaps Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin.
 Mr. Rubin, however, is known as a ''deficit hawk'' and has advocated an approach to cutting the federal deficit that would include both spending cuts and tax increases, at least for the wealthy.
 Mr. Rangel and Mr. Baucus said that one target by Democrats would be to revise what is known as the alternative minimum tax, which imposes taxes on taxpayers that take large deductions and reduce their tax rate below a certain ceiling.
 But reducing that tax could involve a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and Democrats are loath to propose alternative ways of raising the money.

Trade
 Democrats and Republicans agree that the new Congress is likely to be less hospitable to trade deals negotiated by the Bush administration, since any such deals are likely to involve cuts in tariffs and subsidies that could cost manufacturing jobs.
 The main issue would be a possible global trade agreement negotiated by the World Trade Organization. Major business organizations support such a deal but farm groups are ready to oppose anything that does not require tariff and subsidy reductions by America's trading partners.
 Any deal would have to be approved by next June 30, when President Bush's legal authority to get a single up-or-down vote on any such deal expires. Some experts hope to negotiate a deal by February or March and then get a Congressional vote, but the skeptics outnumber the optimists.
 ''If the administration comes through with a trade deal in March, it will be impossible to do it by July 1,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a Republican who has been, and still could be, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ''After it expires, it's not going to be renewed until we get a new president.''
 Trade officials said that discussions have begun on reviving the global trade talks, but there is no evidence that Europeans and other countries like India, Indonesia and Brazil are willing to cut their farm tariffs dramatically. In turn, there is no sign that the Bush administration would cut American farm subsidies below $22 billion.

Governance
 A small but growing movement has begun pushing to reduce the cost of the landmark business law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that was adopted in 2002 in response to a raft of corporate scandals.
 The law's most ardent supporter, Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, is retiring from the Senate this year, and other senior Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, including Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, have recently suggested that it should be re-examined to reduce what they see as some of its most burdensome requirements. 
 Mr. Frank said he also intended to once again sponsor legislation that would give shareholders the right to vote on the pay packages of senior executives. That measure has been opposed by administration officials and Republican lawmakers. 

Energy
 A Democratic House is likely to stall two major Republican efforts sought by oil companies: opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling and lifting a 20-year moratorium on drilling in new areas along the Outer Continental Shelf.
 Industry groups are hoping they may be able to win support for a more limited Senate bill opening up some coastal areas to drilling during a lame-duck session of Congress with Republicans still in control.
 Democrats are all but certain to attack many of the tax breaks and other incentives for oil and gas producers.
 The bigger question is what Democratic leaders will try to accomplish. They will almost certainly push for more government support of alternative fuels, hybrid cars and new infrastructure -- from pipelines to pumps -- to distribute new fuels.

Pharmaceuticals
 Even as the market advanced yesterday, drug stocks fell sharply in a sign of Wall Street concern that Democrats would try to change the Medicare drug program to give the government the right to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices.
 Companies may also face closer federal scrutiny of their marketing practices, including so-called off-label promotion of drugs for conditions for which they have not been approved.
 Drug makers have enjoyed a relatively close relationship with Republican leaders in the House, said Catherine Bennett, a former Pfizer vice president who is now a partner at the Venable law firm in Washington. 
 ''Off-label marketing of drugs, patent litigation settlements, and drug safety will all be on the table, something that pharma companies have not had to worry about under a Republican-controlled House,'' she said.

Immigration
 Washington may sink into partisan fighting in the next two years. But there is one piece of proposed legislation that will have a better chance of becoming law after Republicans surrender control of the House.
 ''The chances of comprehensive immigration reform being enacted in the next Congress go up significantly,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a pro-immigration lobby group in Washington. ''It might be one of the few issues in the next Congress that could see the light of day on a bipartisan basis.''
 Despite support from Mr. Bush, Republican resistance in the House managed to block a broad immigration reform package passed by the Senate in the summer. The bill included tougher border security provisions, a new immigrant guest-worker program and a path for millions of illegal immigrants to attain legal status.
 Instead, the House passed a bill to build a 700-mile fence along the Mexican border, a proposal that passed the Senate in September and was signed into law last month by Mr. Bush. The resistance by a hard-core group of Republicans opposed to easing restrictions to immigration spread as opposition to illegal immigration became a rallying force in Republican campaigns throughout the summer. 
 But the anti-immigrant fervor did not seem to work on Tuesday. Many Republicans who campaigned on a hard anti-immigrant platform lost.
