HEADLINE: Port-au-Prince Journal;
Carnival's Theme: Let Lent Come, Haiti Has Hope

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 28

 BODY:
With the country living under a military dictatorship and harsh economic sanctions, Haitians did not feel much like celebrating the annual pre-Lenten Carnival last year. No wonder, then, that with President Jean-Bertrand Aristide back in power, this year's celebration was quickly baptized "the Carnival of Hope."
Signs of Haiti's newly relaxed political atmosphere have been everywhere during the 72 hours of nationwide festivities, which end early on Wednesday. Here in the capital, a few participants have dressed as roosters, the symbol of the Lavalas movement of Mr. Aristide, or worn Uncle Sam costumes -- masquerades that would have earned them a beating, or much worse, just last year. 
 As marchers paraded Sunday and Monday nights past the National Palace, where a special reviewing stand has been built for Mr. Aristide and invited guests from Haiti and abroad, many chanted the President's name. Over and over again, others sang the politically charged song that has emerged as the popular favorite of this year's Carnival, "Pale Yo," or "Tell Them," which proclaims that the Haitian people are "like little matches, catching fire."
"We've had to endure three long years of Lent" during Mr. Aristide's exile, said Etienne Jean-Louis, a young reveler whose face was speckled with glitter and painted red and blue, Haiti's national colors. "Now we finally get to have three true days of Carnival."
Even so, the fragile security situation of the country and its precarious economy have managed to intrude on the celebrations. On Feb. 21, the Justice, Defense and Interior ministries issued an unusual joint communique, warning that Haitian intelligence had detected what was called "an attempt to destabilize the country on the occasion of Carnival."
The main target of the unidentified plotters, the Government said, was "vital installations in the metropolitan area" as well as Carnival events. As a result, the multitudes that have taken to the streets here each night are dancing, singing, marching and kissing under the watchful eyes of American soldiers and international police monitors.
Concerns that anti-Aristide forces might attempt, under the cover of Carnival, to provoke violence also led the Government to decree a one-week prohibition on the sale of alcohol as of last Wednesday. That ban, though only selectively enforced, has proved unpopular and appears to have put a bit of a damper on the festivities.
"Carnival just isn't Carnival without plenty of beer and rum," Ghislaine Baptiste, a toothless street vendor who was forced by the measure to switch to sales of soda, fruit juice and sugar cane, lamented on Monday night. Besides, she added, "they are interfering with my livelihood."
In many neighborhoods, the electricity shortage that has afflicted the capital since Christmas also kept many celebrators at home or from watching Carnival events on television. The Government had promised a large increase in the electricity supply, but managed to illuminate little more than the parade route and the surrounding downtown area.
If the festivities themselves had a certain slapdash, homemade look, that too may have been evidence of the Aristide Government's economic circumstances. Despite Culture Minister Jean-Claude Bajeux's early vow that this year's Carnival would be "built on new bases" to allow the people to express themselves, the Government could come up with only 12 million gourdes, about $900,000, less than a quarter of the amount initially promised.
But in a country as poor as Haiti, even those relatively small amounts of money are seen as spoils and sources of political patronage to be fought over. Come Carnival time, neighborhood associations, musical groups and parade organizers all flock to local political leaders, seeking money to help pay for their floats, stands and costumes.
"This year, we have had more than a thousand groups register with us," said Evans Paul, the Mayor of Port-au-Prince. "Unfortunately, our budget is such that we can only select a hundred" for any form of official support.
In the poor suburban municipality of Carrefour, there was consternation when the local Mayor announced he did not have enough money to pay musicians, and a band hired for Carnival refused to play. The Mayor of the more prosperous area of Delmas, complaining that the national Government was trying to centralize control of Carnival for political gain, rejected the $5,000 offered that municipality as an insulting pittance.
But the money problem may have been most severe for Mr. Paul, who also got less than he expected. He looks to be one of the strongest candidates in the presidential election scheduled for December, and while he has been a political ally of Mr. Aristide, some of the President's advisers are said to prefer a more malleable successor with no power base of his own.
Under the military dictatorship, of course, Col. Michel Francois, the Port-au-Prince police chief, simply summoned the rich and made it clear it was in their best interests to make donations.
"The difference this year is that we have not called in the businessmen like Michel Francois did last year and said to them 'You have to contribute,' " Mr. Paul said. "We want Carnival to be accessible to everyone, but we also want it to be democratic."

HEADLINE: NATO Secretary General Questioned in Belgian Scandal

BYLINE: NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 28

 BODY:
A corruption scandal in Belgium involving kickbacks and bribes in the purchase of helicopters from an Italian company has led to the investigation of the Secretary General of NATO.
Willy Claes, the NATO Secretary General and a leader of the Flemish Socialist Party, was Belgium's Economics Minister when Brussels agreed to purchase 46 helicopters from Agusta, an Italian manufacturer, in the late 1980's. State prosecutors now want to question him about what he knew of a reported $1.7 million "gift" Agusta made to the Flemish Socialist Party in 1989, after the Italian company sold the helicopters to Belgium for $267 million. 
 Agusta, which is based in Milan, denies making such payments.
Mr. Claes has not been accused of any wrongdoing. But conflicting statements in which he first denied any knowledge of the payments, then acknowledged that he was at a meeting where they were discussed, have led to calls for him to resign his NATO post. The Flemish-language newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws reported a poll in which 96 percent of Flemish speakers believed Mr. Claes should quit.
Those calls increased today when Johan Delanghe, who was an aide to Mr. Claes when he was a minister in the Belgian Government, was arrested in connection with the bribery case.
"We think he should step down, not because we say he is guilty, but we think it would make it easier for him to defend himself and easier for prosecutors to do their investigation," said Koen Van Caimere, spokesman for the People Unity Party, a mainstream Flemish nationalist party. "We think international politics is losing confidence in Mr. Claes."
Within NATO, most countries have closed ranks behind him, On Monday Vice President Al Gore issued a statement saying that "the United States has full and complete confidence in Secretary General Claes."
But some countries began to express impatience and concern over how the scandal would affect the alliance. "If this drags on, it's bad for NATO," Joris Voorhoeve, the Dutch Defense Minister, said today.
NATO officials concede there is concern over damage to the alliance as well as the distraction to Mr. Claes at a crucial time for NATO. The organization is facing such long-range issues as how to expand NATO to include countries of the former Warsaw Pact and what kind of relationship to establish with Russia, as well as short-term issues such as whether NATO troops will be used to help evacuate United Nations forces from Bosnia later this year.
Although NATO officials say they are worried, they do not expect Mr. Claes's departure soon, barring further revelations.
"I think that if it is a matter of just remembering something differently from the past and then it goes no further, he's not in danger," said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But it can't go further than that."
A spokesman for Mr. Claes said he was not available for comment. Mr. Claes is about to depart for a 10-day trip to the United States and Canada.
Although the Agusta deal is the most wide-reaching scandal in recent Belgian history, it is only one of several to hit European military establishments in recent years.
In the 1980's, Sweden was rocked by a series of military arms scandals involving bribes paid to Indian officials, illegal shipments of explosives to Iran and Iraq, and sales of surface-to-air missiles to Singapore that ended up in Dubai and Bahrain.
Britain has uncovered illegal arms sales to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq before the Persian Gulf war in 1991, and has been accused of paying large bribes to Saudi officials to win defense contracts.
German officials resigned over illegal arms shipments to Turkey, and France has been under pressure for years to halt payments to developing countries to secure arms deals.
According to analysts familiar with the investigation, when the Belgian military sought to buy a fleet of helicopters in 1988, German and French companies submitted what were considered good offers. Agusta prevailed, the analysts said, because it offered not only $1.7 million to the Flemish Socialist Party, but made payments to the French-speaking Socialist Party, and the Flemish and French Christian Democrat parties, which make up the ruling coalition with the Flemish Socialists.
The scandal emerged when a murder investigation in Liege uncovered payments to the French-speaking Socialist Party. In January 1994, three French-speaking Belgian officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme, resigned after they were accused of taking bribes in the Agusta deal.
This month the scandal spread to the Flemish Socialists with the arrests of two party officials. One of them, Etienne Mange, the party's treasurer at the time, has admitted he took money.
Suspicion immediately extended to Mr. Claes, who was one of the Belgian Government officials who approved the deal.
On a radio talk show last week, Mr. Claes said, "I wish to formally confirm not only that I am not involved in the whole affair, but also that I have never, from no one or nothing and nowhere, heard or received any suggestion or proposal whatsoever to set up any such thing."
But hours later, Frank Vandenbroucke, Belgium's Foreign Minister, said on the same station that he remembered a meeting involving Mr. Claes, himself and the party's current head, Louis Tobback, at which Mr. Mange raised the issue of the kickback.
By the end of the day, Mr. Claes had changed his statement.
"We had a meeting," he said. "About what, I do not remember. And there Mange told us in passing that he had heard that the Italians were going about dangling money."
Walter de Bock, a journalist with the independent De Morgen newspaper, said, "Claes is getting the attention of the media because he lied. And lying in politics is becoming a nasty business."

HEADLINE: Oneidas Seeking Casino at Monticello Raceway

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
The Oneida Indian Nation wants to establish a casino at Monticello Raceway in Sullivan County, just 90 miles from New York City. But Gov. George E. Pataki pledged yesterday to block the plan.
The tribe's proposal would place casino gambling closer to New York City than Atlantic City or the Foxwoods Resorts Casino, operated by the tiny Mashantucket Pequot tribe near Groton, Conn. 
 The casino would be in the heart of the Catskills, where the owners of faded resorts have long wanted to attract casinos but have been blocked by Albany.
The Oneida plan would need Federal designation of the site as tribal land, excluding the area from state laws banning gambling. The Interior Department generally looks to governors before ruling on such requests, and Mr. Pataki made clear that he would oppose the Oneida effort.
At a news conference yesterday outside the Executive Mansion in Albany, he said: "I think it is absolutely wrong for that to happen. I'm very concerned that we'll see the proliferation of casinos and entertainment complexes that pay no property taxes, pay no sales taxes, pay no income taxes. I don't think we should allow it to the extent that we have the legal authority to stop it."
Louis Berenson, who has owned the 220-acre raceway since 1984, would not comment on plans for the track. But other people involved with the Oneidas, with Monticello Raceway and with businesses in the Catskills, said the tribe and the raceway had scheduled a news conference today to announce the sale of the track and the tribe's plans to operate a casino on part of the site.
Under Federal law, Indians can run casinos on tribal lands, and the Oneidas already have a casino, Turning Stone, in Verona, 35 miles east of Syracuse.
A spokesman for the Interior Department said yesterday that two efforts to extend gambling to lands acquired by tribes in Oregon and Michigan had foundered, in part because of local opposition.
Federal law exempts Indian lands from Federal, state and local taxes, as well as zoning regulations.
The tribal representative of the Oneida Indian Nation in New York, Ray Halbritter, said, "When all the factual and accurate information is presented, the Governor and the state will see the tremendous economic benefits the state will see."
The Governor suggested that it might be time to take another look at amending the State Constitution to permit legalized casino gambling in a form that would benefit taxpayers. Last year the Legislature failed to agree on such an amendment, which would have to be passed by two consecutive Legislatures before being put to voters in a referendum.
The chairman of the 1,200-room Concord Hotel in nearby Kiamesha Lake, George Parker, said he had spoken to the people dealing with the Oneidas and expressed support for their plans. Mr. Parker, who has campaigned for legalized gambling in the Catskills, where tourism has been depressed in recent years, noted that the state already had casino gambling at Turning Stone, the $10 million hall that the Oneidas opened in July 1993.
"The only thing this is going to do is bring it closer to the New York metropolitan area and help us out," Mr. Parker said. "It can't hurt us. It can only help. It would increase occupancy dramatically in all the hotels, and the Indians would not be building a hotel on their property."
The publicity chairman of the Sullivan County Chamber of Commerce, Scott Samuelson, said he could give no information before the news conference, and he declined to confirm a report in The Daily News yesterday that Mr. Berenson would sell Monticello Raceway to Watermark Investments of the Bahamas. Watermark, the report added, would in turn sell part of the site to the Oneidas.
Mr. Samuelson said that whatever today's announcement might be, "we are supporting it." A lawyer from Albany who represents the Indians, John J. Poklemba, former State Commissioner of Criminal Justice Services, said the raceway would continue to operate under the plans to be announced.
Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican of Yonkers who is a leading proponent of legalized gambling, bridled at the prospect of an Oneida casino in Monticello. "That they could purchase land and decide to make it part of their reservation is beyond the spirit of the law and mocks the law," he said.
Mr. Spano said he would ask the Governor to block the project. "We get absolutely no benefit from an Indian casino," he said. "They've exempted themselves from every law except the one that exempts them from being taxed. It would do nothing to help towns in the Catskills. It would provide no economic help to the state of New York."
Mr. Halbritter said a study by Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, showed that Turning Stone had created 2,000 jobs and delivered $11 million in economic benefits to the state.
About 70 tribes nationwide offer gambling under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. Intended to generate wealth on impoverished reservations, the law allows tribes to operate games of chance not otherwise outlawed by the state. The Federal law also lets tribes to buy land and declare it part of their sovereign nation.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: BALANCED BUDGET;
Republicans Postpone a Balanced-Budget Vote

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Senate Republicans, a lone Democrat short of the 67 legislators they need to adopt a balanced-budget amendment, reneged tonight on a promise to vote on the measure and abruptly threw the chamber into recess instead.
Asked later when the Senate might vote on the amendment, the majority leader, Bob Dole, replied with a half-smile, "Maybe this week." A second Republican who is leading the amendment debate, Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, predicted a vote on Wednesday. 
 Mr. Dole's delaying tactic landed like firecrackers in an institution that still likes to equate a politician's word with a solemn bond. For his part, he made no bones as to his motive: Republican efforts to lure a single Democratic holdout, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, to the side of the amendment's supporters, had stalled after an increasingly frantic day of lobbying.
The chief opponent of the amendment, Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, damned Mr. Dole's move as "a sleazy, tawdry effort to win a victory."
Mr. Dole retorted by saying that the balanced-budget vote was probably the most important of the senators' careers.
"And we don't take amending the Constitution lightly."
But he acknowledged that the delaying action could cost him the very support he was seeking among the undecided Democrats who are the key to the amendment's fate.
"The sad spectacle is, we may lose this vote," he said.
Mr. Conrad seemed to confirm that after the Senate had quit for the night. "I told Senator Dole we may as well vote tonight," he said. "I don't see a prospect of a meeting of the minds."
The manager of the amendment drive for the Republicans, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, said later that he would work through the night in an attempt to change Mr. Conrad's mind anyway.
Tonight's actions only prolonged a political battle that had seemed a cakewalk for amendment supporters when it began early this year but evolved into a crackling legislative thriller that has rocked the Senate to its staid roots.
At stake was whether Congress should enlarge the Constitution, for only the 28th time in 208 years, to make it more difficult for the Federal Government to spend more money than it earns. Present law allows Congress and the President to spend money the nation does not have with the approval of a simple majority of the House and Senate.
The essence of the amendment is to bar such spending without the approval of three-fifths of the entire membership of both chambers, a standard that would be much more difficult to reach.
But by day's end, arguments of fiscal principle had given way to a virtual dragnet across the Capitol's north wing for any Democrat who would push the cause over the top.
Few would have predicted the supporters' plight. Only five days ago, they claimed they were on the verge of victory, with 52 solid Republican supporters, 12 Democrats and the prospect of quickly picking up at least three more.
But support began to waver Thursday when Senator Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat long viewed as a near-certain "yes," demanded that the amendment be changed to bar the Federal courts from ruling on it.
Mr. Nunn reasoned that any court dispute over whether the amendment was being obeyed would amount to an invitation for Federal courts to dictate taxing and spending decisions that the Constitution now accords to Congress alone.
Mr. Nunn's opposition only solidified the doubts of four other undecided Democrats: John B. Breaux of Louisiana, Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, and Mr. Conrad and his fellow North Dakotan, Byron L. Dorgan. And by today, the prospect that all five would be lost prompted Mr. Hatch and other Republicans to agree to change the amendment so that the courts could not intervene in fiscal matters.
That change sailed through the Senate late today, 92 to 8, and Senators Nunn and Breaux immediately proffered their support. But that still left the Republicans a vote short of passage. And when Senators Ford and Dorgan failed to come aboard, amendment supporters converged on Mr. Conrad.
Mr. Conrad not only had shared Mr. Nunn's concern, but had a second one: that the amendment would tempt the Government to pay down the deficit by taking money from taxpayer contributions to the Social Security trust fund.
The fund is building up a huge surplus which is earmarked, at least on paper, to finance the retirement of today's baby-boom workforce. Mr. Conrad sought a guarantee that that money would not be spent to reduce the deficit, and through the day, Republicans trooped to his Senate seat with proposals to mollify him, to no apparent avail.
Finally, out of the range of television cameras but well within the riveted gazes of those in the packed Senate gallery, Republicans delayed a final vote and, surrounding Mr. Conrad in a knot of dark suits, dragooned him off the floor and into their cloakroom. Mr. Conrad emerged minutes later, only to be hauled off by the minority leader, Tom Daschle, and other Democrats into their cloakroom.
Democrats said later that Mr. Dole had offered Mr. Conrad a bargain: should he support the amendment, Mr. Dole promised, the Senate would immediately pass legislation guaranteeing that within 12 years any surplus in the Social Security trust fund would be excluded from budget calculations.
But Mr. Conrad rejected that as insufficient.
Later, Mr. Hatch said that he had believed that Mr. Conrad had struck a deal in the Republican cloakroom to vote with supporters. But after Mr. Conrad met with Mr. Daschle and other Democrats, Mr. Hatch said, Mr. Conrad returned with a second demand: that Congress be allowed to suspend the amendment, by majority vote, in times of economic emergency.
"We thought we were there," Mr. Hatch said. "We thought we had made it clear we couldn't support the economic emergency language."
Mr. Conrad disagreed with that, saying Republicans had never satisfied his concerns about the use of Social Security contributions to reduce the deficit.
Another Republican said, "The real problem is that he just doesn't like the amendment."
A White House official said that President Clinton would telephone wavering senators tonight to persuade them to hold out against the Republican pleadings.
The White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, and the Administration's legislative director, Patrick Griffin, met with the President to discuss strategy just after the Senate delayed the vote.
Mary Ellen Glynn, the deputy White House press secretary, said that Mr. Clinton had monitored the debate and planned to discuss the situation with Mr. Daschle. The drama surrounding the holdouts unfolded against a day of debate that was stirring even by congressional standards. Supporters argued, again and again, that the Government was hurtling toward insolvency and that, short of a constitutional change, it would never summon the will to brake itself.
"Remember the rallying cry of the American revolution: taxation without representation," said Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who is one of the measure's champions. "What are we doing to our grandchildren and generations to come? If that isn't taxation without representation, nothing is."
"This is a shoot-now, ask-later approach," Mr. Daschle warned late in the debate, "and we will regret it."
No one bettered Mr. Byrd. Twice in the final hours, he rose from his seat in the rear of the chamber to deliver attacks, in almost Shakespearean language, on the measure he derided as "this shop of horrors," and "this macabre twisting of the balance of powers."
"Change is the watchword of the day; change merely for the sake of change is suddenly a virtue above all others, a goal to be achieved at all costs," Mr. Byrd thundered. "But I will never, never bow to those messengers of expediency or to the managers of any political party's agenda. The hurricanes may blow, the tides may rise, but there still remain those of us who will never bend."
Mr. Dole paid tribute to his old opponent's oratorical powers minutes later. "I'm trying to get C-Span to give college credit for those who watch it across the country," he said.

HEADLINE: Outlook for Orange County

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Feb. 28

 BODY:
William Popejoy, the new chief executive of Orange County, Calif., said tonight that the bankrupt county's financial crisis was "much worse" than he had thought upon assuming office two weeks ago.
Mr. Popejoy told the board's monthly meeting that to get through the next six months, the county was likely to use bridge financing and might have to delay debt payments. But he insisted that defaulting on the county's debt was not an option. 
 He said the county would make deep cuts, including substantial layoffs in its 15,000-person work force, to chop $188 million, or 41 percent, from the county-financed portion of its 1995-96 operating budget. The new fiscal year begins July 1. "They'll be nasty," Mr. Popejoy said of the cuts, which he intends to announce next week, along with details of his proposed budget.
He said he would announce on March 28 details of a financing plan to meet $1 billion in bond payments due Aug. 10. At present, he said, the county is $382 million short.
"I've never guaranteed that we'd repay bondholders exactly when they're due," he said. "It's going to be difficult, but I think there are ways we can do it."

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: THE ENVIRONMENT;
HOUSE APPROVES SWEEPING CHANGES ON REGULATIONS

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The House of Representatives today approved far-reaching changes in how Federal agencies enforce health, safety and environmental laws.
It directed regulatory agencies to base rules primarily on economic calculations of costs and benefits. Statistics and finances would override the health-based standards at the heart of many existing environmental laws. 
 The bill, approved 286 to 141, is supported by industry groups as strongly as it is opposed by environmentalists. It is the most comprehensive in a series of antiregulatory initiatives being debated in the House under the Republicans' 1994 campaign manifesto, the Contract With America.
If a measure like this eventually becomes law, it would affect every major industry, and decisions about everything from automobile safety standards and workplace rules to emissions from smokestacks and the purification of drinking water could be changed.
It would put newly proposed regulations, even those issued under existing laws, through an elaborate system of risk assessments in an effort to measure scientifically their likely effectiveness, and would require that the financial costs to industry of complying with the rules must be justified by the anticipated benefits to the public.
Opponents have called it a prescription for delay, and maintain that it would override a generation of existing laws.
Sixty Democrats joined all but two Republicans to approve the measure. But the bill was passed only after a spirited debate among the Republicans themselves, as they argued over how far to press the campaign to roll back a generation of environmental laws.
The Clinton Administration opposes the risk assessment bill, and it is far from certain how the Senate will deal with several similar bills that have yet to be considered by committees. In the past, even under the control of Democrats, the Senate has easily approved bills to require risk assessments in new regulations, but no proposal before the Senate has ever gone as far as the one the House passed today.
The bill does not explicitly amend any existing statute. But the laws Congress passes do not have much effect until agencies write regulations to carry them out, and the changes the House approved would go to the heart of that process.
Despite an attempt mounted by some of the most conservative House members from both parties, the House voted not to let industries appeal to agencies for retroactive review of regulations that have long been on the books. Future regulations are affected even if they carry out laws previously passed by Congress.
In an unusual break from the pattern of nearly total solidarity among House Republicans in passing major elements of their 100-day agenda, some amendments to limit the bill's broad reach were offered and supported by a handful of defecting Republicans, but were rejected.
Representative Sherwood Boehlert of upstate New York, a Republican, sponsored the most significant of these unsuccessful amendments, which would have removed what environmental groups considered the most unwelcome part of the bill: its language overriding the environmental standards set by such past laws as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
His amendment recommended that whenever a regulatory agency finds that a cost-benefit analysis conflicts with public health or other existing standards used for making regulatory decisions, the agency should report back to Congress, which could then decide whether it wanted to amend the law.
Opponents also lost in efforts to weaken the bill's provisions on judicial review of regulations, to take away the role it gives industry representatives on special panels that will review the risk assessments of new rules and to limit the risk assessments to regulations costing industry at least $100 million, instead of just $25 million.
The bill would give regulated industries an opportunity to go to court to challenge the adequacy of the risk assessments, a provision that opponents said would invite extensive litigation. And it would not prevent interested parties from sitting on the peer review panels established to examine those risk assessments.
But proponents said both provisions were needed to insure fairness to industries that they said must spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year complying with Federal regulations.
Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said: "This legislation is not reform, it is a full frontal assault on protecting public health and the environment."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "THE BILL AT A GLANCE: Risk Assessment"
 
BILL Risk Assessment and Communication Act of 1995 (H.R. 1022)
 
HIGHLIGHTS: Requires proposed regulations protecting health, safety and the environment to undergo a detailed scientific assessment of how effectively the rules would reduce risks to the public, and requires agencies to certify that the costs of compliance are justified by the anticipated benefits. Risk assessments would be reviewed by expert panels that could include industry representatives, and would be subject to judicial review. The cost-benefit calculations would supersede health-based standards of existing environmental laws.
 
POLITICS Although risk assessment and cost benefit analysis are supported by many Democrats and Republicans alike, most Democrats argue that this bill goes too far and would unduly
 
 restrict regulators. Industry groups favor the measure; environmental groups are strongly opposed. It is one part of a broad assault on Federal regulatory powers being pushed through the House of Representatives as part of the Contract with America.
 
COST Backers say that the legislation would reduce the costs of regulation to businesses and focus spending on the most serious risks. Opponents say it would be costly for Federal agencies to carry out the required studies.
 
STATUS House passed on Tuesday. Several versions of risk assessment legislation have been introduced in the Senate, but none have been considered by committees.
 
WHITE HOUSE Administration officials have argued against the legislation, saying it would roll back existing environmental protections. (pg. A17)

HEADLINE: Communities Fear the Pain Base Closings Will Cause

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
New Jersey would suffer the heaviest blow in the metropolitan region under the list of military base closings released yesterday by the Pentagon, though New York and Connecticut face hard losses, too.
Under the proposal, which is not final, New Jersey stands to lose a naval center in Lakehurst and a marine terminal in Bayonne that sent much of the military hardware to operations in Haiti, Somalia and the Persian Gulf. 
 The recommendations, which would cut 1,866 civilian and 758 military jobs in the state, angered some local officials, who contended that their areas had been unfairly singled out. Others, like the Mayor of Bayonne, tried to put the best face on the news, suggesting that some bases could be transformed into vibrant commercial hubs.
Though the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne and the Lakehurst Naval Air Warfare Center in Ocean County would be shuttered, the Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, which some officials had thought was threatened, was spared, preserving more than 4,000 jobs. And, officials said, Fort Monmouth in Monmouth County would gain 1,188 civilian and 35 military jobs from the closing and reorganization of other bases, including the terminal.
New York would lose 41 military and 1,415 civilian jobs, most of them from the closing of the Rome Laboratory at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, N.Y., near Utica. Nine military and 316 civilian jobs would be cut at the Seneca Army Depot in Romulus. But in Brooklyn, Fort Hamilton would lose only 52 civilian jobs and gain 3 military jobs.
In Connecticut, 609 civilian jobs would be cut, mostly from closing the naval base in New London. Statewide, there would be a net increase of 13 military jobs. But the Pentagon figures do not account for the unexpected announcement that the Army's tank-engine factory in Stratford is to be closed.
The factory employs more than 1,000 people under a contractor, the Allied Signal Corporation, whose executives expressed surprise yesterday that the site was on the list.
Besides the direct loss of jobs across the region, there is expected to be a spillover from the proposed closings that could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of other people in towns around the bases -- from supermarket workers to auto dealers to hotel owners.
Some officials vowed to fight the Pentagon plan, with the State of New Jersey, for example, agreeing to pay a law firm $300,000 to lobby the base-closing commission. But the going may be rough, as Congress has tried to insulate the process from politics, and the President and lawmakers must accept or reject the commission list in its entirety.
"It's too early to pronounce this dead," said Representative Robert Menendez, a Democrat whose district includes Bayonne.
Mr. Menendez questioned the military's decision to transfer much of the cargo from the Military Ocean Terminal to surrounding commercial terminals in the New York Harbor, maintaining that the flow of military goods during times of national emergency might seriously disrupt nonmilitary operations.
Mayor Leonard P. Kiczek of Bayonne said he regretted the loss of jobs at the terminal -- 100 military and 1,267 civilian -- but he noted that many of those personnel would be moved to Fort Monmouth. He added that he was hopeful that the city would bounce back quickly.
The Mayor said some good could actually come from the terminal's closing. He noted that because it was owned by the Government, the terminal had never paid taxes, even though it occupies about one-fifth of the city's land. The city might benefit greatly, he said, if it were turned into a complex of private terminals, stores, factories and other enterprises. "If a successful plan is enacted, it could be a great boon to our economy," he said.
Others were not so optimistic.
"It stinks," said Paula LoRe, who has worked 20 years at the terminal. "The politicians in this area did nothing to keep the base open."
At the Airship Tavern in Lakehurst, a small borough at the northeast edge of the Pine Barrens, the mood was somber. Francis Mazzotti, a technician at the base, said the cuts were a "threat to national security and a threat to humans."
In neighboring Monmouth County, officials were jubilant. Fort Monmouth had been high up on the list of bases to be closed in 1993.
"This is the shot in the arm that we need," said Art Chasey, a member of the Eatontown council and a real estate appraiser.
But Mayor Ann Y. McNamara of Tinton Falls said: "No one is taking anything for granted. There will be a review of these proposals and a lot of jurisdictions that have been cut will be very active to get these decisions reversed. So we still have to be on guard."

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
At the Jefferson Courthouse, the Bell Finally Tolls, and Rings Out History

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman 

 BODY:
FOR 20 minutes on Monday evening, the two-ton bell in the tower of the old Jefferson Market Courthouse rang over Greenwich Village, breaking a virtual silence of 97 years.
Except for throat clearings of a few bongs now and again, the bell, said to be the second largest in New York City, after one at Riverside Church, had not tolled seriously since sounding Adm. George Dewey's victory at Manila Bay during the Spanish-American War. 
 That was when some battle-enthralled graffiti painter had daubed "To hell with Spain -- Remember the Maine -- 1898," inside the bell's skirt, where the inscription is still visible. But this week's peal had nothing to do with jingo bells.
Instead, what was being marked as Tom Sharkey, the superintendent of the building, pushed and pulled the clapper was a triumph somewhat more parochial than the dismantling of the Spanish Empire; namely, the preservation and restoration of the courthouse at 10th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, which had been modeled after a Bavarian trifle and now houses a branch of the New York Public Library.
"It's a very lyrical moment," said Margot Gayle, who 37 years ago set about rescuing the building as it was about to be auctioned to developers coveting the ground it stood on. She paused and looked up before joining some 80 people who had gathered to recall a long trail of community action now that the building's renovation has been capped off with a new slate roof.
"I keep thinking of all of us who got involved years ago and I realize that we really did it," said Ms. Gayle, who was sitting next to Marvin Schneider, the clockmaster of the city's clocks. "When the bell rang, I felt my spirits rise."
IT was in 1959 that Ms. Gayle began organizing. "I was working for the Department of City Planning and living on Ninth Street. I got to know some architects and they pointed out just how spectacular that courthouse was."
It had been built in 1877 on the edge of what was then one of the city's poorest neighborhood, pushed forward as another of Boss Tweed's extravagances. Large sums were appropriated before anything was ever built, and when construction began, no opportunities for kickbacks seemed to have been ignored, with contractors providing stained-glass windows, gargoyles, Venetian fountains, intricate ebony door frames, the clock with its four faces and the huge bell.
Among the wealth of details, there is an inscription cut into the circular stairway stipulating that "the precepts of the law are these: to live correctly, to do an evil to none and to render to everyone his own." By the time the building was completed, this third requirement must have been fulfilled with everyone duly rendered unto.
The New York Times observed at the time that putting up so lavish a building in such a rundown neighborhood was like placing "a jewel in a swine's snout," and the architects, Frederick Clarke Withers and Calvert Vaux, one of the designers of Central Park, were accused by some critics of incompetence, even insanity.
But 10 years later the courthouse was voted by architects as one of the 10 most beautiful buildings in America.
THE courts moved out in 1927 and by the time Ms. Gayle's interest in the building developed, city agencies had moved out and it was empty.
"It's hard to believe now, but there was absolutely no interest back then in public Victorian architecture," Ms. Gayle said. Plans were made to sell off the property, along with the adjoining Women's House of Detention that was ultimately razed.
"I thought we should focus on the clock," said Ms. Gayle. "For years, its hand had stood at 3:20 and I thought everyone would want the clock to move. So we named our group the Committee of Neighbors to Get the Clock on Jefferson Market Courthouse Started. We were a small group, but we had this very long name."
PEOPLE joined in, among them Lewis Mumford and Jane Jacobs, the architectural critics, and E. E. Cummings, the poet who lived across 10th Street. By 1961, the group had raised enough money to restart and illuminate the clock. That effort spurred greater ambitions, and in response to the committee's appeals, in 1961 Mayor Robert F. Wagner announced the building would be preserved as a library.
Since opening in 1967, the library branch has, according to Paul Schmidt, the director, become one of the best used in the city. "It is a gloriously welcoming building," said the librarian, who has been there from the start. "No, we've had no reports of ghosts. I guess the weirdest thing I can remember is that once a reader left me a note saying that twice the world has been saved because of what had happened in this library. I really don't know what he had in mind."
Ms. Gayle said that bell's ringing had inspired her.
"Don't you think it would be neighborly if the bell rang out the hours?" said the woman who got the clock to move. You could see her thinking.

The stock market rebounded yesterday in a comeback that carried the Dow Jones industrial average back above 4,000 to close less than a point below its all-time high.
Takeover news affecting technology and other stocks inspired buying, as did a late pickup in the bond market. 
 In staging its comeback, Wall Street managed to overcome uneasiness about the implications of the sudden collapse of a venerable old British merchant bank, Barings P.L.C., and uncertainty about the direction American interest rates would take in the near future.
The Dow industrials, which did not stray far from their starting point for most of the session, advanced decisively in the final 90 minutes of trading to finish at 4,011.05, up 22.48 points. The gain almost erased Monday's drop of 23.17 and hoisted the blue-chip indicator within one point of the record close of 4,011.76 reached on Friday.
Most broader gauges also gained. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.97 points, to 264.65. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 3.43 points, to 487.39, or less than a point shy of its high of 488.11, also set on Friday. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 9.23 points, to 793.73, while the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 4.27 points, to 452.71.
Advancing Big Board stocks beat decliners by 1,603 to 690. Volume was 317.6 million shares, compared with 285.8 million shares on Monday.
Renewed buying in the bond market helped stocks. For most of the day bonds were weighed down by a report from Chicago area purchasing managers that traders worried contained hints of inflation. Then a Johnson Redbook Service report that retail sales were off prompted bond buying in the afternoon.
Also, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes fell 4.5 percent in January to the lowest level in 21 months in a sign that high mortgage rates have discouraged buyers.
Market analysts said investors are torn between hopes that the Federal Reserve is close to achieving its goal of subduing economic growth to a noninflationary pace and worries that the central bank is not yet satisfied and will raise short-term interest rates again to ward off inflation.
Robert Walberg, an analyst at MMS International, said takeover announcements and speculation involving a range of companies provided the main positive influence on equities trading.
News that Samsung Electronics is taking a stake in AST Research helped repair confidence in high-tech issues and lifted the sector, he said.
CBS gained 2 5/8, to 64 5/8, in response to news that Turner Broadcasting had expressed renewed interest in acquiring the network.
Marion Merrell Dow gained 1, to 24 7/8, on heavy volume of more than 2.9 million shares after the company disclosed that it might be acquired by Hoechst of Germany for more than $7.1 billion. Dow Chemical, which owns 71 percent of Marion Merrell Dow, rose 2 3/8, to 67.

HEADLINE: Finally, 16 Months Late, Denver Has a New Airport

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DENVER, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Denver International Airport finally opened today, hailed by its proponents as a mighty catalyst for the economy of the Rocky Mountain region and ridiculed by detractors as a $4.9 billion monument to boosterism and boondoggling.
At 6 A.M., United Flight 1062 pushed back from Gate 38 and headed off for Kansas City, soaring steeply into a snowy sky to inaugurate the first full day of operations. Not since the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport opened 21 years ago had a major new airport been opened in the United States. 
 And never, said aviation experts, had a more technologically advanced terminal and set of runways been opened.
"We finally did it!" Mayor Wellington Webb declared after he and Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena, a former Denver Mayor and a central figure in the development of the 53-square-mile airport, snipped a bright ribbon at Gate 38 just before daybreak.
When three jetliners landed simultaneously in bad weather, the only place in the world where it is possible, Mr. Pena exclaimed, "This is a historic first in aviation!"
Because of numerous construction delays, contracting problems and financing difficulties -- some of them now the subject of legal action and government investigations -- the opening ceremony at the new airport came 16 months behind schedule. And the final cost was $2 billion over budget, with a balky, ultramodern baggage system that initially shredded bags blamed for $100 million or more of that overrun.
Critics say all this could have been avoided if the city had modestly expanded Stapleton International Airport, which was shut down just hours before the new airport opened. It served Denver for more than 65 years and its defenders say it easily could have helped take Denver into the 21st century.
"Somehow, we've managed to end up with an airport that has longer runways and a bigger terminal but that -- get this -- also has fewer gates," said Michael J. Boyd, an airline consultant from Golden, Colo., who is one of the new airport's most outspoken critics.
"It's built on dubious traffic projections, and not very well at that, and except for some flights to Mexico and Canada, it has only one international flight -- once a week to London," Mr. Boyd said, adding, "It ought to be called Denver International Avarice."
The inquiries into the construction and financing of the airport are being conducted by the Denver district attorney, the United States Attorney here, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Transportation and the General Accounting Office. Some purchasers of bonds used to finance the airport have filed suit, saying they were not given accurate facts about the project.
City and airport officials deny any wrongdoing.
Whatever the case, as the first passengers scurried through the new terminal today, many marveling at its sheeny spaciousness and its multi-peaked white roof that mimics the Rockies on the distant western horizon, Mayor Webb sought to put the controversy behind.
He noted that no serious problems had been encountered in the initial hours of the new airport's operation. Even the much-maligned $193 million baggage system performed as advertised, except for some soiled luggage.
Mayor Webb confidently said he expected no future glitches, though he confessed that he, like just about everybody else in the terminal, could feel the mysterious vibrations in the floor that had puzzled engineers.
"Now what we must collaborately do is bond our hands together and market this airport and out great city," he said. "To those who would continue to debate whether it ever should have been built, that is nonsensical. It's here. It's working."
By and large. But there was one highly embarrassing moment.
Eleven minutes after Flight 1062 departed from Gate 38, a special flight of airport officials and honored guests arrived, right on schedule, at adjacent Gate 40. A huge crowd was there to greet them.
And then the jetway jammed. The plane, and the ceremony, were unceremoniously moved to Gate 38.
One of the first passengers to use the new field, Leanne Orcutt, a computer programmer from Lake Tahoe, Calif., was willing to concede Mayor Webb his contention that the airport would be a success.
"I've heard about the problems and all the controversy and debate," she said as she checked in for a flight. "But it's still a very impressive place. Maybe Stapleton was O.K., too. Whatever. I just want to get home."
Lying 15 miles closer to the city's eastern edge than Denver International Airport, which sits 23 miles northeast of downtown Denver on an empty prairie, Stapleton was ruled obsolete years ago by city officials. They said its runways were too close for efficient, safe operation in bad weather and too crowded in by suburbs for economical expansion.
Many Denverites and aviation experts countered that expansion was possible and that the city's plan was but the grandiose scheme of ambitious politicians, greedy business executives and dreamy civic boosters.
The doubters also warned that even though bonds would be sold to pay for the project, it nevertheless would end up costing the average citizen money because air carriers would have to raise fares to meet higher landing fees and taxi companies would have to charge passengers for longer trips.
In fact, the fares for many flights in and out of Denver International have been raised $20 each way above the fares to and from Stapleton. Airlines say the increase is necessary because the landing fee for the new field is more than $18 a passenger, compared with $6 for Stapleton.
As for ground transportation costs, a taxi to or from the city's center now costs about $35, more than twice the old Stapleton fare.
"I don't like the extra costs," said Richard Mills, a sales manager from Colorado Springs. "But we've got this new facility now and so it'll just have to become part of doing business. We'll just have to see what tourists and skiers and the like do."
Utah ski resorts think they know. They have mailed out advertisements that read: "In Denver, you could lose your luggage. In Utah you could lose yourself."
If, despite all the problems, the opening of Denver International was a notable achievement, so too was the closing of Stapleton.
After the last flight departed on Monday at 9:38 P.M. -- Continental Flight 34, bound for London -- the runways were officially closed and airport employees then labored through the rest of the night to complete the transfer of more than 10,000 baggage carts, plane tugs, fire engines, catering trucks, de-icing machines and untold truckloads of tickets, tags and gift shop sundries.
Stapleton will be put up for sale, with the city hoping that busy industrial parks and peaceful suburbs will be built where planes once roared. But thus far there has been no great rush to acquire the tract. Likewise, as has often occurred at other new airports in their early days, there is no great rush yet to build on the outskirts of Denver International.
As Continental Flight 34 lifted out of Stapleton on Monday night, ending an era stretching back to the days of open cockpit barnstorming, the tower radioed a final message.
"Continental 34," said the controller, "the torch is passed to you."
There was a snatch of static and then the Continental pilot came on the air. "We'll miss the old place," he said. "A lot of memories. See you over at the new place."

HEADLINE: Drug Trade Imperils Aid To Colombia

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CALI, Colombia Feb. 25

 BODY:
Bulkier than most courtroom evidence, two Boeing 727 jets impounded at the international airport here symbolize the push and pull between the United States and Colombia over its rampant cocaine exports.
Last month, Colombia angrily denied reports that refitted jets were carrying tons of cocaine to Mexico. But in a reversal two weeks ago, officials reassigned air traffic controllers and impounded the jets. 
 Behind the reversal was a March 1 deadline for President Clinton to certify that Colombia was cooperating with the United States in fighting the drug trade. Colombian officials feared being placed on an outlaw list that last year included only Iran, Nigeria, Syria and Myanmar.
To head off international ostracism, Colombia's President, Ernesto Samper, hurriedly unveiled a program to eradicate all of Colombia's cocoa leaf and opium poppy fields by the end of 1996. Long a cocaine refining country, Colombia emerged in the 1990's as the world's third-largest source of cocoa leaves and the fourth-largest source of opium.
Skeptics in Washington say the plan places a low priority on capturing kingpins of drug cartels based in this city, Colombia's third-largest.
If some Republican members of Congress have their way, Colombia would lose United States aid not related to combatting drugs, as well as other economic privileges.
In Cali, a tropical city enjoying a construction bonanza of largely mysterious origin, business leaders held a press seminar at a local country club, repeatedly telling visiting journalists: "We are the victims."
At the press seminar here, Colombia's Defense Minister, Rafael Botero Zea, gave a graphic explanation of why no major Cali cartel figure has been captured during Mr. Samper's six-month-old presidency.
"If Pablo Escobar used a machete, Cali uses a scalpel knife," the minister said, as local business leaders listened and chafed as if they were witnessing a major breach of local etiquette. "The Cali cartel hires the best people -- the best lawyers, the best accountants, the best computer experts."
The minister plunged ahead, saying that the cartel's information network includes about 1,600 Cali taxi drivers, 1,250 street vendors and 7 private security companies.
"When someone arrives at the airport and goes to a hotel," the minister continued, "very quickly the information goes to the cartel."
Studying a personal computer seized from the cartel, detectives deduced recently that the cartel has access to all telephone calls made in this city of two million. By cross-checking numbers, traffickers decide which telephones to tap. Taped conversations are digitalized. By tapping a few computer keys and running a program, a cartel computer expert can summon up all conversations that used a key word -- like the name of the commander of a police drug unit.
The minister's presentation did not elicit any response from business leaders present -- not a gasp of awe, not a smirk of hometown pride.
After an uncomfortable silence, a local newspaper editor took the microphone and lectured the visitors: "We are not the victimizers. We are the victims."
With Colombia's cocaine flow virtually unchecked in recent years, the nation escaped Washington's list last year largely because police tracked down and killed Pablo Escobar, leader of the Medellin cartel, in December 1993.
This year, the most concrete action against cartel leaders was the recent announcement that family members of cartel leaders had lost their coveted United States visas.
In what could be Colombia's first legal action against the leaders, officials announced recently that they are preparing to try in absentia a leading Cali fugitive, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, on charges of smuggling cocaine to the United States.

HEADLINE: Mayor Details Plan for Small Businesses

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced several measures yesterday intended to assist small businesses by providing working capital, financing and financial benefits.
The Mayor said his administration would establish a program under which manufacturers would be able to buy new machinery and equipment through tax-exempt financing at rates about 25 percent less than the prevailing borrowing rates. The financing would be provided through the city's Industrial Development Agency. 
 The Mayor also said the city would begin allowing the Industrial Development Agency to help companies to enter into leases without issuing bonds, enabling the company to receive tax benefits without the high costs associated with bonds.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Earnings at Morgan Stanley Fell Sharply in 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Reflecting the effects of the worst bond market in a generation, the Morgan Stanley Group reported yesterday that profits tumbled nearly 79 percent for the fourth quarter.
Morgan Stanley, the country's fourth-largest securities firm, said that net income for the quarter, which ended Jan. 31, fell to $39 million, or 29 cents a share, from $181 million, or $2.18 a share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped about 15 percent, to $790 million from $925 million. 
 Results include a one-time, after-tax relocation charge of $39 million for Morgan Stanley's pending move to a new New York headquarters and new offices in Tokyo. Excluding the charge, the firm earned $78 million, or 80 cents a share, in its fourth quarter.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Morgan Stanley shares advanced $1.25 to close at $67.375.
"Probably every major firm in the industry experienced difficulty in trading in these three months," said Perrin H. Long Jr., an analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. "The environment for the industry is tough, and I don't see things changing much for 1995."
For the full fiscal year, Morgan Stanley had earnings of $395 million, or $4.18 a share, down roughly 50 percent from $786 million, or $9.59 a share, in the 1994 fiscal year. Revenue was off nearly 16 percent, to $3.5 billion from $4.15 billion. Excluding the one-time charge, net income totaled $434 million, or $4.68 a share, for the year.
Before yesterday's announcement, analyst forecasts were close to the actual net income before non-recurring charges. The mean estimate was 91 cents a share for the quarter and $4.83 for the year, according to the Institutional Brokers Estimate System.
In its statement, Morgan Stanley cited rising interest rates and inflation concerns and noted that although asset-management and global-clearing revenue increased, sales and trading revenue decreased.
Morgan Stanley also said it would raise its regular quarterly dividend by 2 cents, or 7 percent, to 32 cents a share. This dividend is payable on March 24 to stockholders of record on March 13.
In addition, the company's board of directors authorized $150 million more to be spent in its stock-repurchase program, bringing its overall buyback authority to $316 million, approximately 6 percent of common shares outstanding.

HEADLINE: Bishops Assail Pataki's Budget, Calling It Devastating to the Poor

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 28

 BODY:
New York State's Roman Catholic bishops harshly criticized Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget today, saying its deep cuts would be devastating for the poor.
The bishops, including Bishop Howard Hubbard of Albany and John Cardinal O'Connor of New York, met with Mr. Pataki for three hours today to discuss the impact of the cuts, but the Governor said the session failed to change his mind. 
 "I don't expect to see any major Medicaid or social service changes from our standpoint as a result of this meeting," he said, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Cardinal O'Connor.
Barely two hours after the bishops met with the Republican Governor, another element of Mr. Pataki's financial plan moved forward when the State Senate overwhelmingly approved his four-year tax-cut plan, which would cost the state $720 million this year. The plan is opposed by Democrats, who contend it favors the wealthy and will force the state to make harsh spending cuts for years to come.
The day's events starkly highlighted elements of the emerging debate over Mr. Pataki's proposed $32 billion budget, in which proponents of government welfare programs have been pitted against Republicans who contend that Mr. Pataki was elected with a mandate to reduce state spending and taxes drastically.
The Catholic bishops opened their attack on Mr. Pataki's budget in the morning when Bishop Hubbard described the spending plan as "a much meaner budget than we've seen probably ever in the history of the state."
The Pataki budget calls for slashing social service programs by $1.9 billion in the coming fiscal year, the largest cut to spending for the poor in state history. The largest portion of that cut would be $1.2 billion for Medicaid, the health care program for the poor and elderly.
After meeting with the bishops at the Executive Mansion, Mr. Pataki said he told them that high taxes had driven numerous companies out of the state and that even under his budget, New York would continue to have the most generous Medicaid program in the nation.
"I understand New York's long-term history and commitment to those less fortunate, and I believe this budget will allow us to continue that, not just this year but to build on it in the future," the Governor said.
Cardinal O'Connor said: "Our concern was that the Governor listen. The Governor listened."
As the operators of a sprawling network of hospitals and community programs for the poor, the Catholic Church has traditionally been a strong advocate for increased spending on social services. But the bishops' criticism of Mr. Pataki's budget was unusually vehement.
The bishops said they were also worried about the size of Mr. Pataki's tax-cut plan, which will cost the state $6.8 billion a year in revenues when fully phased in by 1998.
"Given the devastating effects of the proposed budget, it seems to me that a scale-back of the tax cuts that are proposed really needs to be considered," Bishop Hubbard said.
Because Mr. Pataki's tax-cut plan would grow tenfold in the coming four years, Democrats have said that this year's budget cuts will pale in comparison to the reductions Mr. Pataki will have to make to balance the budget in 1998.
Mr. Pataki contends that even without cutting taxes, the state would have to reduce spending this year because it is facing a projected shortfall of $4 billion in the fiscal year that begins April 1.
The Governor and his supporters have also argued that the tax cuts will spur economic growth that will mitigate the need for future budget cuts. But Mr. Pataki has made clear that he believes the state's welfare system needs to be revamped to push people into the work force.
That debate was echoed today on the floor of the Senate, which passed Mr. Pataki's tax-cut plan by a 44-10 vote, with 10 Democrats joining the Republican majority in supporting the bill.
The vote was largely symbolic, because the Democratic-controlled Assembly has rejected Mr. Pataki's plan and, on Monday, passed its own tax-cut bill. The differences now will be resolved in negotiations over the budget.
Under Mr. Pataki's plan, the top income tax rate would fall from 7.87 to 5.9 percent over four years and the number of people paying that top rate would decline markedly.
The Democratic Assembly plan is smaller than Mr. Pataki's, worth $1.7 billion per year when fully implemented. But it would give a larger percentage of its savings to people who make less than $100,000 a year. Under that Democratic plan, the top rate would fall to only 7.75 percent by 1996, while various tax credits and deductions would be phased in to help moderate-income taxpayers.
Senator Pedro Espada Jr., a Bronx Democrat, called Mr. Pataki's plan a continuation of "12 years of Reaganomics" and questioned whether the Governor's margin of victory last year was a true mandate for his deep cuts.
"That 150,000-vote edge would not hold up to the kind of social upheaval, the urban destruction that these kinds of tax cuts, these kinds of budget cuts will have on our communities," he said.
But Senator Michael F. Nozzolio, a Seneca Falls Republican, called the bill "the tax cut plan that the people of New York demanded last November. It will lead to the economic recovery and resurgence of New York State."

HEADLINE: Teacher's Absent. Now What?;
New York Schools Face a Chronic Lack of Substitutes

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
On paper, everything was in order. The substitute teacher had the required license and had taught at other schools.
But the lesson she gave the sixth graders last November at Public School 64 in the High Bridge section of the Bronx shocked even the children. In the middle of a poetry lesson, the 45-year-old woman wrote on the blackboard an obscene verse about boys, girls and sexual intercourse. 
 Some children told the assistant principal, and after an investigation by the Board of Education, the woman was banned from teaching in the school system. But the episode illustrates the daily difficulty New York City schools have in finding and screening substitutes.
On any given day last year, roughly 3,000 of the system's 70,000 teachers and support staff were absent. But even though the need for trained, reliable substitutes is constant, the school system has been unable to supply every school with them.
And even those who do substitute sometimes do more harm than good. Some can't teach in the language the students speak. Others have disciplined unruly children by striking them with pointers. And many substitutes are so inexperienced that they do little more than baby-sit, principals say.
As a result, some schools have largely given up on substitutes and instead shuffle children to other grades or to the auditorium for the day. At Public School 307 in Brooklyn, for example, the science teacher and librarian sometimes act as substitutes, although this means that the rest of the students can't use the lab or library that day.
"It's not really what you want to do," said Carol Griffin, principal of P.S. 307, "but sometimes you just can't find a sub."
And some parents, when they learn there will be a substitute, have just kept their children home.
The problem is considered serious enough that beginning today, the school board will take more control over how substitutes are screened and trained.
Under the current system, schools and districts are largely on their own to find acceptable substitutes. Some have been inventive and produced systems that screen substitutes carefully and give them the information they need to build lessons for the classes they take over. But other schools, especially those in poor neighborhoods or with low achievement, have had disastrous experiences.
New York has struggled over finding substitutes for years. In 1990, budget cuts prompted the school board to scrap a central registry for substitutes, which some principals said was a failure, anyway. But losing the registry has actually been more costly, because it allowed far more teachers to claim they were unemployed and therefore qualify for benefits. Even a move several years ago to raise the daily substitute pay -- it is $97.69 now -- did not help, officials say.
Now the school board has another plan: a more centralized screening process in which principals or districts interview prospective substitutes and nominate them to the board, which has final say over their approval.
The board will also strongly recommend that day-to-day substitutes take the teaching courses required annually of longer-term substitutes, those who teach more than 40 days a year. Right now, all that is required to be a day-to-day substitute is a bachelor's degree, a medical exam and a background check. The board is also considering bringing back the central registry.
 
It's a Tough Job, Wherever the School
 Most substitutes make the best of what is always a difficult job, teaching children who may see a substitute as an excuse to misbehave. Many substitutes complain about the lack of training or preparation given by schools, which sometimes do not tell them what subject or grade to teach until they arrive. Most consider themselves lucky if the teacher has left a lesson plan, and even then, detailed directions are scarce.
The problems are not confined to New York. Finding good substitutes is "one of those systemic and perennial problems that urban school systems have," said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, a national organization of city school systems, "and nobody has really found a satisfactory way of addressing it."
In Chicago, for instance, "There's a big substitute shortage and we do have substitutes that don't want to go into certain areas," said Ursula Anderson, supervisor for substitute teacher assignment for the Chicago public schools. But, she added, things would be worse without a central registry. "If you just said 'Subs, go wherever you want to go,' then some schools will never get subs."
Los Angeles has a similar system that officials say works well, in part because candidates must pass the same state exam given to regular teachers, said Ken Sutherland, the school district's assistant director of certificated placement and assignments. Los Angeles also urges substitutes to take the same kinds of courses that New York plans to encourage.
In New York, "The quality of subs certainly is questionable," said Art Aronstein, Superintendent of District 9, in the Bronx, where the obscene poetry incident occurred. "They have no curriculum background. They don't know content. They don't know methodology. Many of them don't know what to do. They create havoc."
 
A Struggle to Find Good Substitutes

At Public School 110, Florence Nightingale School on the Lower East Side, one substitute on the Board of Education registry arrived about five years ago with dirty clothes, grimy hair and a patient's ID bracelet from a psychiatric ward.
"She looked like she was a homeless person," said Mary Ann Fagen, the school's assistant principal. "She was very disoriented."
What's more, the woman refused to leave. "Finally, we called a fire drill so we could get her out of the building."
More recently at the same school, where 4 of 30 teachers might be absent on a given day, another substitute, a retired teacher, showed up in a house dress a few years ago, Mrs. Fagen said.
"I knew she wouldn't work out well, but I let her go into one class," she said. "When I went to check on her half an hour later, she was asleep on the desk."
For some schools, particularly in poorer areas or with low test scores, the search for a substitute is especially difficult. Good substitutes usually have their pick of schools and tend to apply to those in less troubled neighborhoods or with strong academic reputations. Those who take teaching courses to make them better substitutes may be scooped up for long stretches or become permanent teachers.
Public School 110 is considered an academic jewel of District One. But its location, under the Williamsburg Bridge, near housing projects, hampers its search for substitute teachers. "When you do get subs," Mrs. Fagen said, "you're often better off not having them."
Public School 27 in the South Bronx has a teacher out about four times a week, but the principal, Awilda Astondoa, said she could rely on only two substitutes, one of whom "has a difficult time controlling the classes." She pulled eight first graders from class in January because they were throwing erasers. Also in January, she discovered that a substitute hired for an English-speaking second-grade class could speak only Spanish.
Some schools make do without substitutes, which means regular teachers have to work harder and students may be shortchanged. At P.S. 110, classes may be splintered: some second graders will go to third grade; some will go to first grade.
"Schools will tell you that in many cases they would rather not take a chance on having a disaster in the classroom," Mr. Aronstein said.
 
So Much to Do, So Little Support
 On a recent schoolday, Brenna Guidotti, 7, swung her black patent-leather shoes aimlessly and doodled a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger. Jason Rubinstein, 8, nestled his head on his desk, eyelids closing sleepily, and Daniel Fields, 7, vroomed a red plastic sports car over his notebook.
The 21 second graders in Room 401 of P.S. 110 had a substitute teacher trying hard to get their attention.
The teacher, Audrey Fraenkel, hadn't expected to be there that day. But when she arrived at the school to drop off her son and daughter, the assistant principal stopped her. The regular teacher had the flu; could she stay? Ms. Fraenkel thought she could handle it, even though she had only been licensed to substitute for two weeks. Already, she had taught first, third and fourth grades, and had even filled in for her daughter's first-grade class.
With no time to prepare and no lesson plan from the teacher, Ms. Fraenkel relied on the contents of her brown shoulder bag. She had a copy of "The Five Chinese Brothers," a book she had read the day before to another class for Chinese New Year. She had some pictures from magazines; the children could use them to make get-well cards for their teacher.
Despite her inexperience, Ms. Fraenkel's willingness to teach has made her something of a savior at P.S. 110. She is better than many other substitutes the school has had, the assistant principal said.
That morning, Ms. Fraenkel wrote "Groundhog Day" on the board and asked the class to spell words with the letters. She reviewed homework and held a math bee.
After lunch, she sent Michael Ng to the principal's office because Lillian Quinones said he had kicked her in the schoolyard. Then she read "The Five Chinese Brothers," followed by "Thumbelina," which she borrowed from Evie Hernandez, in the front row. The second graders fidgeted, but Ms. Fraenkel kept reading -- only faster.
"We're almost done," she said.
Monique Ratliff, 7, said she liked it better "when nobody comes and we go into the third grade."
"We don't do nothing," she said. "We can just chill."
 
Treating Substitutes As Real Teachers
 At Public School 124, Yung Wing Elementary in Chinatown, dominated by low-income families, children see substitutes as real teachers, not just teachers du jour.
That wasn't always the case.
Seven years ago, when Judith Chin became principal, she found the substitutes were "just baby-sitting."
Now, Ms. Chin requires teachers to arrange their own substitutes, from a pool screened by the principal. The teacher prepares the substitute on classwork in detail; the substitute leaves a debriefing note for the teacher at day's end.
As a result, P.S. 124 has become one of the city's schools with a substitute system that works.
But Ms. Chin said that, at first, some teachers balked.
"Teachers in many schools will refuse to call the subs themselves," she said. "They feel that is the job of the administration." But now, they see substitutes as a crucial link at the school, where most days, 2 of 75 teachers are absent.
In Room 217, a fourth-grade class for the gifted, a substitute, Judi Brown, can easily follow the regular teacher's intricate lessons on bridge-building and bookmaking. She is confident enough to assign her own idea, acrostics for a poetry lesson.
Ms. Brown, 44, has been teaching at P.S. 124 for seven years. She received a degree in elementary education 20 years ago, but put it aside to be a Madison Avenue hairdresser. Now, she fills in three times a week, teaching any class she is asked to.
"I definitely feel like I make a difference," Ms. Brown said. "Two or three days without the regular teacher could break the continuity. I keep the continuity going."
The children seem to agree.
"She does a lot of things my teacher would do," said Robin Wong, 9. "It's the same. We try to do some real work."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Global Casino

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
So I decided to put a little money into global markets last year. I brushed up on Spanish and invested in Argentina. Took a Berlitz course in Japanese and bought a few Tokyo bonds. Lavishly tipped the waiters at the House of Hunan Chinese restaurant and picked up some stock tips in Shanghai. I even learned the difference between G.N.P., G.D.P., DDT and AT&T and invested in equities from Paris to Istanbul. For old times' sake my broker suggested I buy some Lebanese bonds, but I told him our house already had wallpaper.
At the end of the year, I looked over my dismal balance sheet and realized that with all my multilingual, multicultural, multinational research there were two little words I forgot to learn: "Alan Greenspan." 
 Like me, so many mutual fund holders who sailed off into international waters pretended that they really understood the economic reforms under way in Mexico or Thailand or China and found them worthy investments. In reality, though, they were simply going offshore because interest rates in the U.S. had fallen so low that when presented with the chance to earn 10 percent they jumped at the opportunity without comprehending the risks.
But as soon as Mr. Greenspan started hiking interest rates a year ago, a lot of that hot money that had been flowing mindlessly into emerging markets like Mexico hiked right back home into safe, well-paying U.S. T-bills. As that happened, the emerging markets became sagging markets and investors got ravaged.
Lesson 1: If you are investing in international markets you are much better served by studying the words of Chairman Greenspan than the words of Chairman Mao (or Zedillo, or Menem or Rao). In a world where money flows back and forth across borders, no one has more influence over the direction and rate of that flow than Mr. Greenspan. So skip the Chinese takeout and throw away the Japanese language tapes. The best language to be fluent in on the global investment highway is "Greenspanese." Understanding what he is doing with interest rates at home is the first step to investing abroad.
But 1994 was rich in other lessons about the global economy as well.
Lesson 2: Daddy always said, "Diversify, diversify, diversify." So a lot of global investors diversified. They bought bonds in Japan, bonds in China, bonds in Mexico and bonds in Germany. And guess what happened? They got killed all across the board. They thought they were diversified, but in fact they just owned bonds in what is now a single, unified global marketplace. The linkages between global markets today are so tight that you cannot diversify by simply investing in a smorgasbord of different countries. The only way to really diversify is not by country, but by investment instrument and level of risk. You have to spread out among low-, medium- and high-risk stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. If you just buy bonds in different countries you will quickly discover that you never left home.
Lesson 3: Governments may have lost a lot of power to markets, but they still matter. It is government policies that first shape the quality of the bonds and currencies trading around the globe. Mexico initially got into trouble because its Government tried to buy an election by printing money without devaluing the fixed-rate peso. All the money managers did was tell Mexico this was unsustainable. That is why the global investor George Soros likes to say, "I am the most highly paid theater critic in the world." The leaders put on the show, the money managers write the reviews and the countries suffer (or enjoy) the consequences.
Lesson 4: With markets opening up in China, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, never have more people been making more investments in more places they cannot find on a map with more people whose names they cannot pronounce in more financial instruments they do not understand. Robert Baldoni, head of the Emcor derivative consulting firm, has a golden rule for navigating the new world. It applies to individual investors, treasurers of Orange County and 28-year-old traders at Barings. Says Mr. Baldoni: "I invest money for my mother, who is now retired. I will invest in a variety of instruments, but I won't make any investment for my mother the logic of which she can't repeat back to me."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Rally to End Day Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Fresh economic news yesterday left investors unsure whether the economy was slowing down as much as the Federal Reserve would like, and therefore whether the Fed would find it necessary to raise short-term interest rates once again.
Nevertheless, prices of Treasury securities staged a late rally to finish mixed, after dropping in early trading as investors sold on worries that interest rates would rise and erode the value of their fixed-income holdings. Buyers re-entered the market, lowering yields of the longer maturities while helping the short and intermediate part of the market bounce off the day's lows in the afternoon on news that retail sales were off. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 11/32 of a point, to 102 8/32 , for a yield of 7.44 percent, down from 7.47 percent on Monday.
Thomas W. Synnott 3d, the U.S. Trust Corporation's chief economist -- who has predicted the Fed will raise short-term interest rates one more time in May, sending longer-term interest rates back up in sympathy -- said that the Fed's policy of gradually tightening credit and raising interest rates had a very good chance of slowing the economy to a sustainable, noninflationary pace. But that's only part of the problem. "Of almost equal importance is the Fed's responsibility to control the growth of money and credit," he said.
Of the data released yesterday, Mr. Synnott said the slower home sales were consistent with the slowing economy, but they were still fairly high. "We here at U.S. Trust had been looking for a 9 percent drop in housing starts this year, to an average of 1.31 million units on a annualized basis, from 1.45 million units," Mr. Synnott said.
While home sales are down 15 percent from a year ago, he said, "you have to remember that last year was a record level." He added, "You're coming off the mountain."
The market reacted badly to the Chicago purchasing managers' report yesterday, which will be followed by national purchasing data today. "The Chicago report showed a very large jump in the price index component," Mr. Synnott said.
"This data may be a cautionary signal for the bond market, which I think has gotten a little ahead of itself," he added, "leaving itself open for correction."
The Chicago purchasing managers' index for February eased just slightly, to 62.7 percent from 63 percent, about as expected, although the prices-paid component of the index jumped to 88.3 percent from 82 percent.
Johnson Redbook Service also gave traders reason to believe that the Fed's previous rate increases could be sapping the economy's strength. The service reported retail sales were down 2.5 percent in February, and that helped bond prices in the afternoon.
In the corporate bond market yesterday, AT&T, Capital One and Southwest Air sold $ 800 million of investment-grade debt, with the long- distance telephone operator dominating activity with the sale of $ 500 million of 12-year notes through Lehman Brothers.
The senior unsecured debt was given a 7.75 percent coupon and priced at 99.966 to yield 7.754 percent, or about 46 basis points more than Treasury securities with a comparable maturity. The securities, rated Aa3 by Moody's Investors Service, AA by Standard & Poor's and AA+ by Duff and Phelps Credit, are noncallable through maturity. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

HEADLINE: Fed Backs Removing Bank Curb

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve today joined the White House and key Congressional Republicans in calling for an end to the legal barriers that have separated the nation's commercial banks and securities firms since the 1930's.
But Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, questioned some details of the Clinton Administration's plan for abolishing the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act that established the barriers. He also urged Congress not to move quickly on a proposal by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, to allow nonfinancial companies to own banks. 
 Mr. Greenspan said that the benefits from financial deregulation were so substantial that members of Congress should strive to overcome their differences to strike a compromise. The central bank's "support for the expansion of permissible activities reflects the desirability of removing outdated restrictions that serve no useful purpose, that decrease economic efficiency, and that, as a result, limit choices and options for the consumer of financial services," he told the House Banking Committee.
Most Republicans on the committee echoed Mr. Greenspan's call for quick action to effectively repeal the law that requires investment banks and commercial banks to operate separately. Democrats expressed less support, with several warning that new financial conglomerates might be insensitive to the needs of consumers and small businesses, particularly those in low-income and minority neighborhoods.
But no Democrat went so far as to promise a vote to retain Glass-Steagall. The House Banking Committee has been a bastion of support for changing the law.
When Democrats ruled Congress, the House Energy and Commerce Committee blocked efforts to change the law. But the Republicans took authority over the law away from that committee and gave it to the banking committee.
The Federal Reserve, by itself and through the banks it regulates, wields tremendous political influence on banking issues. Last year, the Fed derailed the Administration's plan to consolidate bank regulatory agencies, which would have diluted the Fed's power over the nation's banking system.
Without criticizing the Administration by name, Mr. Greenspan took issue with a key element of its plan.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin outlined on Monday two ways in which the Clinton Administration might allow these banks and securities firms to merge. One would let a bank own a securities firm outright. The other would allow the creation of a corporate parent, known as a holding company, that would own a bank and a securities firm under one umbrella.
Mr. Greenspan said he favored allowing only the holding company approach, in which the bank would not own the securities company directly. Mr. Greenspan said that this approach was more likely to prevent the new financial institutions from taking risks with Federally insured deposits.
Mr. Greenspan took issue with advocates of outright mergers, who argue that certain legal barriers, commonly known as fire walls, can be placed between a bank and a securities affiliate to prevent the misuse of insured deposits.
"Fire walls are not as effective as we used to believe," he said. "They tend to melt inordinately."
The Treasury Department disagreed with Mr. Greenspan's assessment. "We believe that with appropriate fire walls, operating subsidiaries can provide the same protection as the bank holding company structure," a Treasury spokesman said tonight.
The Federal Reserve has an institutional interest in defending the expanded use of holding companies, because it already regulates bank holding companies. Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who heads the banking committee, has introduced a bill that would require the creation of holding companies for securities firms affiliated with commercial banks.
Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency and a senior Treasury official, told the committee today that Mr. Leach's bill would so completely separate banking from securities trading that it would prevent companies from taking reasonable advantage of the two industries' similarities.
Banking industry lawyers were also alarmed by Mr. Greenspan's stance today. Robert M. Kurucza, the general counsel of the Bank Securities Association, which represents big banks that have already set up small securities operations in their holding companies, said that banks needed to be able to conduct at least retail brokerage activities within bank subsidiaries.

A Fresh Wind Is Blowing at Talks

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 28

 BODY:
The effort may fall short, but negotiators in baseball's labor dispute made it clear today they are earnestly trying to make a deal that would enable legitimate major leaguers to replace the replacement players.
On the 201st day of the strike and the second day of this round of talks, neither side could point to concrete progress on the central economic issues of payroll tax, revenue sharing and salary arbitration/free agency. Nevertheless, their relationship remained peaceful and their work positive. 
 "Each side is feeling the impact of the economic activity here and therefore positions change," one lawyer involved in the talks said, trying to explain the difference in the approach the two sides have taken this week.
The results of the second of the day's two meetings perhaps were reflected in the view of Donald Fehr, the union leader, when he explained that the meeting had been recessed so the players' group could discuss some of the new information learned today about the clubs' revenue-sharing plan.
"I do not want to suggest there's any major breakthrough or tremendous thing we've learned that we didn't know before," Fehr said. "But there were a number of points clarified. There were some things we've learned over the last two days that suggest we have not communicated with one another as precisely as we might have liked on some issues."
Meeting at the golf club on Gainey Ranch, the two sides spent about an hour and a half in full committees reviewing their positions on noneconomic and governance issues. They actually have tentative agreement on some of those issues, minor though they may be.
Then two smaller groups held a three-hour discussion on the economic issues, and it is those groups that planned to reconvene Wednesday morning after the players' unit had a chance to digest whatever new information it gleaned.
"Rather than the objective parts of the revenue-sharing plan, maybe we have different views about what Fort Lauderdale does, what effect it may have," Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said, referring to the plan by the site of its adoption 13 months ago. "The objective today was to increase our level and their level of understanding. I would hope the dialogue both days maybe contributed to that, which maybe gives them a different view than they've had before as we explained our rationale and how Fort Lauderdale got put together."
The revenue-sharing plan has presented a sticking point in the talks because the two sides have different views about how the money for the low-revenue clubs should be generated. It is also linked to the tax the clubs want to place on payrolls to create a drag on salaries.
If the two sides can find a way to reconcile their differences on revenue sharing, they may find it easier to deal with the tax problem.
Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies, one of five members of the owners' small-group negotiators, emerged from the session stating the questions that remain critical to the clubs: "How do we achieve significant economic change? What do we do in terms of a tax and the drag that will produce?"
Calling the meeting "the most positive bargaining session we have had since we began these negotiations," McMorris said in his typically optimistic manner, "A settlement could come tomorrow." But he quickly added, "Is that likely tomorrow? Probably not."
No one else was willing to go that far.
"I believe there's an equal desire on both sides to get a deal and that's where Jerry's optimism comes from," Lauren Rich, a union lawyer, said. "But it's still too early to judge whether we can bridge the large, large gap between us."
Fehr said the talks were not being conducted in the manner of one side making a proposal and the other side presenting a counterproposal. Rather, the negotiators have been looking at the economic elements as a package.
"Everybody knows roughly what the numbers look like," he said, referring to the debate over a payroll tax. "You're dealing with combinations of concepts that might put you closer together."
The two sides, McMorris said, did "a little bit of probing conceptually on how a tax might work in conjunction with looking at the full package together."
In a strike-related matter, the 32-game exhibition schedule of the Baltimore Orioles will be canceled on Wednesday.
When spring training began, the Orioles, the only team that has refused to field replacement players, notified their 12 exhibition opponents that they would not play them if they planned to use replacement players in the games.
At the direction of the commissioner's office, 11 of the 12 clubs individually sent the same notices to the Orioles, telling them if they didn't inform the clubs by 2 P.M. Wednesday that they had reversed their stance, the games would be canceled. Only the Colorado Rockies, who are scheduled to play the Orioles in the last exhibition game, did not send that notice.
"We're not going to respond further," Roland Hemond, Baltimore's general manager, said by telephone from Sarasota, Fla. "They say they are canceling the games. If things get settled, I imagine the league will pick up the schedule where it stands."

HEADLINE: Barings Officials Optimistic on Finding a Buyer

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Optimism ran high within Barings P.L.C. today that the failed firm could be sold within days, probably in pieces, despite the $1 billion loss sitting on its books.
Two days after Barings was brought down by a single trader's enormous losing bet on the direction of Japanese stocks and interest rates, Barings executives said representatives of banks and investment houses from around the world were discussing possible deals with a court-appointed administrator. 
 The rumored suitors were a veritable roll-call of the financial services industry. They included Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust and GE Capital of the United States, National Westminster Bank and the HSBC Corporation of Britain, ABN-Amro of the Netherlands, Deutsche Bank of Germany and various Japanese institutions. None of them made any public statement of their intentions.
Barings executives said they had completed presentations to six potential buyers, whom they declined to identify. Similar presentations are scheduled over coming days as the firm's bankruptcy administrator scrambles to sell as much of the company for as high a price as possible to make up the huge loss incurred by Nicholas W. Leeson, a 28-year-old trader in the Singapore office of Barings.
Mr. Leeson disappeared on Thursday just before Barings discovered the losses. Despite an intensifying manhunt by the police throughout Southeast Asia, Mr. Leeson, who has not been charged with a crime, was nowhere to be found today.
There was continued speculation within the firm that Mr. Leeson might have been working with someone inside or outside the firm, perhaps in a deliberate attempt to bring down Barings -- a possibility raised by Peter Baring, the firm's chairman, in an interview with The Financial Times today.
But Barings executives and Bank of England officials said it was still too soon to know how and why Mr. Leeson made his disastrous investments. They said he had covered his tracks skillfully, probably by using a variety of accounts and his knowledge of back-office settlement procedures from his early years with the firm, which he joined in 1989.
Bank of England officials said they hoped that an intensive investigation of the Barings records in Singapore and London would determine the extent to which fraud, lax internal controls or poor regulation in Singapore led to the huge losses.
Barings has three major operating divisions that are all expected to attract bidders: its fund-management subsidiary, which had $46 billion invested on behalf of clients last year; its corporate finance arm, which is one of the most active advisers on mergers and acquisitions in Britain and throughout Europe, and its securities business, which is highly respected for its research and trading operations, especially in the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.
"There seem to be an adequate number of interested buyers for all the businesses," a Barings executive said.
But Barings and its court-appointed bankruptcy administrators from the accounting firm of Ernst & Young face a number of daunting obstacles.
Still, the Ernst & Young administrators have told Barings employees that they believe they can sell the operating units before knowing the full extent of the losses from Mr. Leeson's trading, saying in effect that they can sell the assets of the firm without linking them to its liabilities. The lack of buyers willing to take on such unknown liabilities was what doomed the Bank of England's attempt to put together a rescue package for Barings over the weekend.
It is unclear how Ernst & Young can sell assets before defining the losses and stopping them from increasing further, especially since at least some of the operating units are directly affected by the losses. The asset-management business, for example, is believed to have deposited some of its clients' cash in the banking operation, which currently has all its funds frozen. Ernst & Young did not respond to a telephone request for comment.
It is also unclear just how big the firm's losses might become. That will depend in part on whether Japanese stock prices fall further. Monday's 3.8 percent decline in the Nikkei 225 stock index, for example, added $280 million to the losses.
There was also speculation in the financial markets that there could be a ticking time bomb in Mr. Leeson's positions. Analysts and traders in Asia said that in addition to his stock and interest-rate positions, Mr. Leeson appeared to have engaged in a third kind of bet, a complex maneuver known as a straddle, in which he was selling for cash a combination of options on the Nikkei index.
The straddle was a bet that stock prices in Tokyo would remain stable, enabling Mr. Leeson to keep the cash price of the position. Industry executives speculated that Mr. Leeson had sold the straddles to raise cash for margin calls on his deteriorating futures positions in stocks and interest rates. But with the Japanese market having dropped sharply, the straddles would have run up huge losses very quickly, executives said, losses for which Barings would be liable. The Bank of England's public estimate of $1 billion for the Barings losses has not included any accounting for straddles.
A Bank of England spokesman said the central bank was still working to piece together Mr. Leeson's investments, and that it did not yet know whether there was a large straddle position. A senior Barings executive said he doubted whether a large straddle position remained undetected, but that it was possible.
Within Barings today, there was a clear split developing between the various operating arms. The securities business in particular made an effort to portray itself as a cohesive, self-contained unit willing if not eager to break with the banking side. Many executives in the securities business blame the banking and capital markets group for failing to oversee Mr. Leeson.
"There is some blame being apportioned, but there's no merit in pointing the finger at a partnership that no longer exists," a securities unit executive said. "We're concerned about our own future."
The executive said that he knew of no employees in his division who had left to take another job since the firm's collapse and that employees were rebuffing executive recruiters and other firms when they called.
 
Greenspan on Barings
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned today that Barings P.L.C. of Britain might not be the last financial institution to encounter huge losses because of the actions of an individual employee.
It's going to continue," he said as he testified before a Congressional committee, "basically because the technology is there for that to happen."
Preventing damage to the domestic and international financial system was more important than preventing losses at individual institutions, he added. The Fed chairman also said careful regulation was preferable to legislation to try to control such abuses.
"Unless you want to reverse technology," he said, "unless you want to reverse knowledge, move the clock back, it's not capable of being eliminated. Human nature is going to do what human nature has always done, bad things on occasion. Our job is to prevent that from becoming systemic."
Later, at a cocktail party with business economists in Washington, Mr. Greenspan joked that 25 years ago no single individual could have lost $1 billion -- because in the days before computers that would have required filling out a remarkable number of trading slips.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber and Copper Plunge On Weak Home-Sales Data

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Copper and lumber prices fell sharply yesterday after a report of weaker home sales last month raised fears of softer demand for the commodities.
Lumber prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell by their allowed limit, while copper dropped to its lowest level in almost three weeks on the Commodity Exchange of New York. 
 On other commodity markets, cotton prices soared to a record high.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 0.67 point, to 234.25.
The National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that sales of existing homes fell 4.5 percent in January to an annual rate of 3.59 million, the lowest level since April 1993. Analysts attributed the decline to higher interest rates.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lumber for May delivery dropped its daily limit of $10, to $312.20 for 1,000 board feet, its lowest price in more than two months. The May copper contract slid 2.50 cents, to $1.2855 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange.
Lumber prices received some support as concerns eased about a possible strike at the CP Rail System of Canada. The company said it hoped to reach a settlement with its unions this week.
Cotton prices closed at the highest level in the history of the New York Cotton Exchange, which was founded in 1870. The price is the highest since the cash market traded at $1.90 during the Civil War.
Cotton for March delivery rose 3.37 cents, to $1.0575 a pound, as traders scrambled to secure supplies before the contract expires on March 9. The May contract gained its allowed limit of 2 cents for the second consecutive day to end at $1.0217.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Moderately While Mark Gains Broadly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell moderately against leading currencies yesterday, weakened by an early selloff in the United States bond market, while the German mark advanced broadly as more financial and political jitters swept Europe.
Worried about the durability of governments from London to Rome, high government debt across the Continent and the stability of Europe's financial markets afterthe collapse of Barings P.L.C. of Britain, investors fled weaker currencies to the perceived safety of the mark. 
 "It's a flight to quality, and at this point quality is found in the Deutsche mark," said Dave Glowacki, senior trader at the NBD Bank in Detroit.
While the market focused on trading among European currencies, the dollar was caught in the downdraft and declined through much of the day until a late recovery in Treasury bond prices helped provide support. Gains in United States markets tend to increase demand for the dollars needed to buy American securities.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.4625 marks, from 1.4660 on Monday. The dollar, which is trading at its lowest level against the mark since October 1992, has fallen more than 6 percent against the mark this year.
The dollar also slipped to 96.75 yen from 97.07 yen.
With seemingly no safe, long-term bets, many investors have put money into German banks and short-term German securities while they wait for the turmoil to subside. The shift has driven up demand for marks. The mark is viewed as a safer haven than the dollar because of concerns about the impact of Mexico's financial crisis on the United States economy.
Heightening financial worries in Europe yesterday, Compagnie de Suez, parent of Banque Indosuez, a leading French bank, reported a 1994 loss of more than $900 million as a result of huge losses on its real estate operations.
"Coming on the heels of Barings, it was a concern," Mr. Glowacki of the NBD Bank said. "It added to the 'buy the mark' syndrome."
Currency dealers also cited as a concern today's vote in the British Parliament on Prime Minister John Major's Europe policy. The vote is seen as a critical test for Mr. Major's Government.
But the British pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.5835, from $1.5812 on Monday.

HEADLINE: January's Home Resales Suggest a Slowdown

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
High interest rates are taking a toll on the housing market, pushing January sales of previously owned homes to the lowest level in nearly two years.
Analysts said the larger-than-expected decline of 4.5 percent reported today by the National Association of Realtors suggested the economy was slowing. But they warned that other reports were sending mixed signals. 
 "Put the sales figures together with slower housing starts and they certainly point to a long-awaited slowdown in the housing sector," Dan Seto, an economist for Nikko Securities, said.
But he added that a new report on consumer confidence by the Conference Board, a research group based in New York, was less clear-cut.
The board's widely followed index of consumer willingness to borrow and spend fell to 99.0 in February from a revised reading of 101.4 in January. Analysts said while the trend was down, the level remained high and was normally associated with a vibrant economy.
In a third economic report released today, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its index of inflation rose to 88.3 in February from 82 last month. Based on price increases experienced by managers, the index is an early indication of inflation.
 The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes totaled 3.59 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in January, down from 3.76 million.
The January rate is the lowest monthly pace since 3.46 million in April 1993 and is 13.9 percent below the 4.17 million rate of a year ago. The Northeast was the only region where sales rose.
Fixed-rate 30-year mortgages averaged 9.15 percent in January, down slightly from 9.19 percent in December and 9.17 percent in November but more than two percentage points higher than January 1994.
An increase from 7 percent to 9 percent adds $139.32 to the monthly payment on a $100,000 mortgage.
"There's no question that high interest rates have priced out some buyers," said Edmund G. Woods Jr., president of the real estate group. "However, we also have lost a lot of prospects who could still afford to buy but are too jittery about rates to go through with it."
The group forecasts 3.74 million sales in 1995, down from 3.95 million last year.
While higher rates made housing more costly, the median price of a previously owned home remained stable during the year. It inched up just one-tenth of 1 percent, to $108,100. The median is the midpoint, meaning half the homes cost more and half cost less.
Regionally, sales rose 3.7 percent in the Northeast in January. But they fell elsewhere, including a 9.9 percent plunge in the Midwest; a 7.4 percent slide in the West, and a 2.1 percent dip in the South.

Camelot's Seamy Side, Brazenly Reconstructed

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:

AMERICAN TABLOID
By James Ellroy
576 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.
"I'm saying it's so big and audacious that we'll most likely never be suspected," says a character in James Ellroy's densely malevolent new novel, "American Tabloid," as he proposes a plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. "I'm saying that even if we are, the powers that be will realize that it can never be conclusively proven. I'm saying that a consensus of denial will build off of it. I'm saying that people will want to remember the man as something he wasn't. I'm saying that we'll present them with an explanation and the powers that be will prefer it to the truth, even though they know better." 
 Mr. Ellroy, a skilled purveyor of brutally tough prose, assumes the same sort of gullibility on his readers' part. Tapping into an enduringly popular vein of paranoid fantasy, he extrapolates from President Kennedy's assassination to create a scheme that's as intricate as it is irresponsible. Oliver Stone's "J. F. K." looks like the Disney version beside Mr. Ellroy's web of triple-dealing operatives, hapless thugs and public figures -- including Howard Hughes, J. Edgar Hoover and Jimmy Hoffa -- whose private activities are freely imagined and embroidered here.
Mr. Ellroy's prologue offers a defiant justification of such tactics. "It's time to demythologize an era and build a new myth from the gutter to the stars," he maintains. He also notes: "Mass-market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed. Hagiography sanctifies shuck-and-jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight. Our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight. Only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight."
This becomes the shaky foundation for Mr. Ellroy's skyscraper of cards, a brazen, violent, sometimes caustically funny assemblage of assassination-linked facts and rumors. What command attention are the sheer intricacy of the author's plotting, the depth of his bottomless cynicism and the staccato energy of his prose, which neither minces nor wastes words. "Nobody talked -- Jimmy Hoffa sulking killed chitchat" is a typically crystalline observation.
Though California crime stories are his usual milieu, Mr. Ellroy segues into political intrigue without missing a beat or changing his tune. Deadly mayhem rears its head at regular intervals. ("They left a cable clamped to Sal's tongue. Voltage burned his face shiny black." "Pete blew his brains out halfway through a rosary.") Navigating their way through this novel's sea of crooks and opportunists are three pivotal tough guys who give the story its back-stabbing intensity.
One is Kemper Boyd, "still too handsome to live," who is attracted to the Kennedy family even as he agrees to spy on them for Hoover, and whose taste for high living lands him on the payrolls of the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the United States Senate Select Committee on Investigations. Another is Ward Littell, a friend of Boyd's and ex-Jesuit seminarian, with an admiration for Robert Kennedy that turns dangerous during the story.
There's also Pete Bondurant, the Canadian hit man and extortionist who is responsible for many evils, including the deaths of his own parents and brother. "People have this tendency to tell me things they don't want to," Pete says, with admirable understatement.
The chicanery that Mr. Ellroy creates for this threesome is so complicated that it requires constant summarizing and repeating of plot points. Memos, letters and transcripts of taped conversations are all too necessary to make this story "slow and easy for the stupes in the peanut gallery." For all its stylistic economy, the book often sprawls. But the author can sometimes make ingenious use of real historical events, like the killing of four children in the bombing of a black church in Birmingham, Ala. An elaborate feat of gamesmanship ties that bombing to the murder of President Kennedy.
Mr. Ellroy's great flair is for hard-bitten, minimalist locutions (Sam Giancana: "I rue the day I bought Jack Illinois"), which aren't easy to sustain in this context. Putting words in the mouths of real figures is chancy at best, downright awkward when it comes to Presidential pillow talk. ("You see, Darleen, Bobby's more heroic than I am because he's truly passionate and generous," President Kennedy supposedly says.) Walk-ons are better, as when Dean Acheson and Bennett Cerf are spotted at a Kennedy cocktail party and don't have to deliver any dialogue. When the book devotes endless attention to the Bay of Pigs fiasco, it's a relief that Fidel Castro is only referred to as "the bombastic bushy-haired beatnik bard" by a Hughes-owned scandal sheet, and never required to speak.
Mr. Ellroy has as much trouble writing female characters as he does heads of state. "American Tabloid" treads water during its isolated, perfunctory romantic scenes, some involving Boyd with an illegitimate daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy and Gloria Swanson. The book trades knowingly on the existence of such a character, making it part of the swirl of gossip that colors the narrative. Movie stars' sexual preferences and proclivities are used to heighten the inside-dirt ambiance of the title.
For every bit of cleverness engendered by this name-dropping -- as when Boyd mischievously creates the rumor of a President Kennedy-Marilyn Monroe affair -- there's sure to be something specious, like the casual claim that Monroe slept with pizza delivery boys and Rin-Tin-Tin's trainer. At such times, Mr. Ellroy reveals much more about the liabilities of fact-bending fiction than about other types of crime.

HEADLINE: Bean Pies Have Grand New Home

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 28

 BODY:
In a style as grand and audacious as its leader, the Nation of Islam opened a new $5 million restaurant complex on Chicago's South Side today. The opening marked a return to the food service business that helped establish the Nation, the black Muslim religious sect, as a steady economic presence in African-American neighborhoods across the country in the 1960's and 1970's.
Unlike the Nation's earlier restaurants -- small places with Formica-topped tables and tiled floors -- the new Salaam Restaurants and Bakery is a lavish two-story, 15,000-square-foot mosque-like structure. 
 With its landmark yellow star and crescent rising from a 90-foot rooftop pole, the sand-colored restaurant stands in stark contrast to the surrounding neighborhood of brick-and-concrete buildings pockmarked with boarded storefronts and empty lots and dotted with mom-and-pop shops. It is a tough, predominantly black neighborhood of gang conflicts and drug deals, one that most developers have turned their backs on.
Diane Ivy, who lives three blocks from the restaurant, got to peek through the doors Monday, and it was enough to whet her appetite.
"It's beautiful," she said of the building, whose construction she had watched for years. "It makes you want to get dressed up to eat bean pie."
The restaurant's opening, scheduled for 10 this morning, was pushed back to 4 P.M. as workers frantically added finishing touches and tended to a broken water pipe.
Judging from the publicity surrounding the opening, it seems as if Salaam, whose name means "peace" in Arabic, is not just a restaurant; it is a movement by the organization and its leader, the minister Louis Farrakhan, to broaden the Nation's reach beyond its membership and other parts of the black population.
In press information to announce the opening, the Nation of Islam lists its building contractors and consultants and their business affiliations and racial and ethnic backgrounds: 21 blacks, 9 whites, 3 Jews, an Egyptian, an Italian, a Chinese and an Indian. The restaurant will be staffed by local residents and members of the Nation, according to the press information.
Responding to questions from reporters about how his restaurant would be received given the anger and suspicion he has aroused among some ethnic and racial groups over the years, Mr. Farrakhan, known for his fiery and sometimes antiwhite, anti-Semitic oratory, said at a news conference last week that "all" are welcomed at Salaam's tables.
"That star and that crescent says that all of the world and its people are welcome in this establishment and all will be treated with the highest dignity and quality," he said.
He said he viewed the new venture as "a blueprint for economic development and investment in our neglected communities," providing about 100 jobs. The restaurant, on West 79th Street and South Union Avenue, is a few blocks from the Nation of Islam's national headquarters, which includes a mosque, an office building, a bookstore and the building that houses The Final Call, the Nation's newspaper. Mr. Farrakhan said he planned to expand the site later this year.
In Salaam, on the second floor of the complex, a prototype shows the future: a proposed 2,000-seat performing arts center, to the left of the restaurant complex, that will be known as the Emerald Palace.
"We placed this in the heart of the so-called ghetto to say, 'Black people, we love you and you are worth every dime that we invest in you,' " Mr. Farrakhan said. " 'This is your palace. Come here and be treated like the kings and queens that you really are.' "
Janet Hampton and Florence Knight were at the steam tables at 4:30 P.M., ordering fried whiting, sesame chicken, collard greens and macaroni and cheese. The two had been waiting since 3:15 P.M. to taste the food that they remembered from the days when they ate at the old Salaam in the nearby Chatham neighborhood. "My only regret," Mrs. Hampton said as her friend nodded in approval, "is that we had failed to make reservations for the upstairs dining, a mistake we won't make this Sunday."
The project, which took 10 years to develop, was financed by the Nation of Islam, which once claimed as many as 500,000 members, and sales of The Final Call. Recent estimates put the national membership at 100,000, with about 30,000 in Chicago. Members were asked to tithe $600 each for the project. The Nation plans to open five more restaurants, investing up to $2 million in each -- the next in Atlanta later this year, followed by New York, Los Angeles, Houston and Miami.
Several people in the restaurant industry said that even factoring in the differences in regional costs in terms of labor, materials and construction, $5 million is a major investment for a restaurant. Among recent construction of high-profile restaurants, the Gramercy Tavern in New York, which opened last July, cost $3 million, and Wolfgang Puck's Granita, which opened in Malibu, Calif., in 1991, cost $3.5 million.
Salaam is actually three restaurants under one roof. In accordance with the Muslim prohibition of the eating of pork or consumption of alcohol, Salaam's executive chef, Early Primus, former chef to Muhammad Ali and to Mr. Farrakhan, has prepared a menu of soul food and other ethnic dishes from places like North Africa and the Caribbean.
Salaam includes Blue Seas, a small takeout and eat-in restaurant featuring seafood and salads; the Atrium, with a weekend dinner buffet and Sunday brunch under skylights, and Salaam Fine Dining, a grand restaurant with white tablecloths and waiters in white jackets. Salaam Fine Dining features marble columns and floors, crystal and brass chandeliers, a brass elevator and a grand piano.
On the menu at Salaam Fine Dining are Salaam snapper medallions, sweet and sour flying fish, vegetarian jambalaya jardin, double lamb chops Morocco and meatless barbecue spare ribs (their contents are a closely held secret).
Entrees at Salaam Fine Dining range from $12.95 to $15.95. Meals at the Blue Seas restaurant, whose menu includes a selection of vegetarian plates, sandwiches, rotisserie chicken and a full salad bar, average $5.50. The Atrium will serve a buffet, from $7 to $10.
Salaam Fine Dining seats 65 people; Blue Seas and the Atrium, both on the first floor, seat 100 each. A computerized kitchen that cost more than $600,000 can prepare up to 1,400 meals an hour, said Tracey D. Hughes, a Salaam publicity agent.
Free valet parking is available, and members of the Fruit of Islam, the Nation's unarmed security unit, will patrol the area. "There are no police around," said Alderman Allan Streeter, who represents the 17th ward, where the restaurant is situated. "The brothers are walking the streets, taking care of business and looking out for the patrons."
The opening prompts memories of the Nation of Islam's earlier days, when under the leadership of its founder, Elijah Muhammad, the group owned and operated a string of Salaam restaurants in cities like Chicago, New York and Washington.
In Harlem, the Nation's restaurant on Lenox Avenue was popular during the late 1960's and 1970's. Malcolm X and Mr. Farrakhan, his successor as minister of the Harlem mosque, often dined there. Politicians like Charles B. Rangel, the Democratic Congressman from Manhattan, and celebrities like Muhammad Ali were known to order the fried whiting sandwich on whole wheat bread and the navy-bean pie.
The previous Salaam in Chicago, four miles east of the new site, was the last to close, in the late 1970's. According to published reports, the closing was a result of internal conflicts and financial problems in the Nation of Islam, as well as an exodus of business from the area.
At a private party at the restaurant last Wednesday, complete with Hollywood search lights bright enough to pick out enemy planes, public officials and celebrities like Vicki Winans, of the gospel-singing Winans family, and Eugene Sawyer, former Mayor of Chicago, Mr. Farrakhan told guests that they no longer had to go to the gallery district north of the Loop to break bread with the stars. Michael Jordan and Oprah Winfrey own restaurants there.
Ricardo Webb, 29, had heard about the old Salaam restaurants and decided to see for himself whether the new one could live up to the reputation for great food and courteous service. He brought along his son, Ricardo Jr., 7, and his friend Tanya Jones. "It's good for young people to see that a restaurant like this, owned by blacks and in the black community, can be done in such high style," he said.
"It means that we don't have to go all the way to downtown Chicago to be among white folks to have a fine dining experience."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
EVERY year at this time, Americans find out how much wine they drank last year, what kind it was, and what their vinous intake for the year ahead is likely to be. And it looks like wine drinking is going up.
"The wine business has finally turned the corner," said Jon Fredrikson, a wine industry consultant in San Francisco. "Last year was a good year, and we expect 1995 to be the same." 
 Shipments of all wine in the United States reached 455 million gallons in 1994, he estimated, up 2 percent from 448 million in 1993. But a better indicator of wine growth, he said, is the 5 percent increase in shipments of table wine, which includes everything from California jug wine to Chateau Latour, to 356 million gallons.
The improved climate for wine in America, and especially for California wine, has brought back a touch of the euphoria that surrounded the wine business in the 1970's and early 1980's, Mr. Fredrikson said. "Investors are looking for land and planting vineyards," he added. Wineries are rationing their production and scrambling to find good grapes.
"A couple of years ago, export was seen as the way to save the industry," said Mr. Fredrikson, whose firm, Gomberg & Fredrikson, has been tracking the industry for more than 50 years. "Now, they are talking about cutting back on exports to supply the booming domestic market."
His optimism is supported by figures from Infoscan, a service of Information Resources Inc., which monitors sales through supermarket electronic scanners. About 30 percent of all wine sold in the United States is sold in supermarkets.
The star performers last year, according to Infoscan, were two red wine varieties, merlot and pinot noir, which were up 46 percent and 47 percent respectively over the previous year. Cabernet sauvignon, long America's favorite premium red wine, was up 23 percent, while chardonnay, the country's favorite wine of any color by a wide margin, was up 27 percent over 1993.
The strong showing by red wines reflects the continued impact of the so-called French Paradox, which was explored on "60 Minutes" in 1991. The television program reported that red wine as part of a regular diet helped keep down the incidence of heart disease in France. Red-wine shipments have increased 60 percent in this country since the report was first broadcast, Mr. Fredrikson said.
Wine sales have still not matched those of 1984, when the industry peaked, Mr. Fredrikson said. But then, they were mostly sales of inexpensive wines; now they are sales of wines of higher quality.
"California is in a great spot," he said. "We have had five excellent vintages in a row, from 1990 through 1994, which is a lot more than anyone in Europe can say. They've had a string of poor years.
"What's more, we've got all that good wine in the barrel. There are a lot of happy wine makers around the state right now."
Overall consumption last year was dragged down by an 18 percent drop in shipments of wine coolers and an 8 percent drop in "all others," he said, a category that includes domestic and imported fortified wines like sherry.
Mr. Fredrikson's figures are not final; the California results were based on figures from 10 months; the results for wines from all over the United States were based on figures from eight months. Import results were based on figures for the first nine months of the year. Final figures in both categories will be available within four months.
One of the surprises of the new figures was the strong showing of bag-in-the-box wines. Three-liter boxes were ahead 50 percent and five liter boxes were ahead 61 percent over 1993 in supermarket sales. Gallo, which uses the name Peter Vella for its bag-in-the-box wines, and Franzia are the leaders in this category. A five-liter "box" holds the equivalent of 6.7 regular 750 milliliter wine bottles. The box can be stored in a refrigerator and poured through a built-in spigot.
Mr. Fredrikson noted that the drop-off in wine coolers was largely technical. "It's true that they are only at a fifth of what they were at their peak in 1987, but there are still plenty of cooler sales being made," he said. "Gallo sold 14.5 million cases of 24 bottles of coolers last year. But they were malt based, not wine. So they don't show up in the wine figures. Gallo is in the brewing business now, along with everything else."
Imported wine shipments, which were off 9 percent in 1993, showed an 11 percent increase last year, Mr. Fredrikson said. "It's a sign of our improving economy," he continued. "Why else would French Champagne be up 11 percent?"
The wine industry was battered in the 1980's by social and health concerns. A heightened awareness of the problem of drunk driving along with a nationwide emphasis on the benefits of physical fitness served to cut deeply into wine's image as a beverage of moderation.
"Those concerns remain," Mr. Fredrikson said, "but things seem to have balanced out somewhat."

TASTINGS
Ridge Vineyards Merlot, Santa Cruz Mountains, 1991; about $24.
 
Merlot is the grape -- and the wine -- of the moment. It is the second most important grape in the Medoc, and in most years the only grape in the fabled wine of Chateau Petrus. But neither fact explains the extraordinary popularity of the California version. Could it be that people are bored with cabernet? Ridge Vineyards, in the mountains south of San Francisco, has been growing merlot since the 1960's and selling it as a varietal since 1974. This version includes 20 percent cabernet sauvignon and displays typical Ridge Vineyards intensity. It spent 17 months in American oak barrels, was bottled in May 1993 and was released in January. It is usually softer and rounder than cabernet sauvignon, and goes with any meal that calls for a rich red wine.

HEADLINE: New Look at a Mexican Murder

 BODY:
President Ernesto Zedillo, already reeling from the consequences of two inherited crises -- an overvalued peso and the armed conflict with peasant rebels in Chiapas -- has courageously taken on a third, the unsolved assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Mr. Colosio was the front-running presidential candidate when he was shot at a campaign rally last March. Mr. Zedillo, his campaign manager, was chosen by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to take his place.
The new investigation is not yet complete. But it has already brought two new arrests and some preliminary findings by the new Attorney General, Antonio Lozano Gracia, a temperate lawyer chosen by Mr. Zedillo from the conservative opposition. Mr. Lozano contends that the man imprisoned as the gunman could not have acted alone. Instead, he points to a conspiracy that allegedly reaches into the ranks of the ruling party and involves employees of the private security firm hired to protect Mr. Colosio. The Attorney General also finds that previous investigators during the presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari ignored critical evidence and deliberately manipulated the crime scene. 
 Mr. Zedillo's administration now stands poised to break Mexico's biggest and most dangerous taboo by ferreting out the murderous connections between corrupt politicians and drug lords. These shadowy alliances are the biggest obstacle to reform and democracy in Mexico. Fighting them may be unsettling to foreign investors, but is unavoidable if reform is to succeed.
Politics and drugs are believed to be behind the killings not only of Mr. Colosio, but of the PRI's reform-minded Secretary General, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, last September and a Roman Catholic Cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, in 1993. Yesterday a brother of former President Salinas was arrested in connection with the Ruiz Massieu murder.
Mr. Colosio, like Mr. Zedillo and President Salinas, came from the reform wing of the PRI, committed to free markets and less fraudulent elections. Mr. Colosio pushed the party to acknowledge its 1989 defeat in the state of Baja California Norte. The state capital is Tijuana, the city where Mr. Colosio was subsequently killed.
The investigations of the Colosio killing during Mr. Salinas's term lacked credibility. Although the victim was shot from two directions, full blame was placed on a single deranged gunman. Videotaped evidence showing suspicious movements by others in the crowd was not pursued. Mr. Lozano reports that critical evidence was tampered with.
Mr. Lozano's investigation has not yet solved the crime. But its spectacular findings would seem to make any further cover-up all but impossible.
Mr. Zedillo has been unfairly caricatured as a timid technocrat. By taking up this challenge, he demonstrates his commitment to political as well as economic reform. Although at odds with much of his party, he can count on support from reformers in both main opposition parties. He should also be able to count on the strongest possible backing from the United States, which has a great deal to gain if he succeeds and a great deal to lose if he fails.

HEADLINE: New Round of Base Closings Hits 34,200 Civilian Jobs

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
In what may be the last round of military base closings, the Defense Department said today that about 34,200 civilians would lose their jobs as it shuts down 33 big installations and shrinks or consolidates 86 smaller sites.
Although Defense Secretary William J. Perry said this year's list is smaller than once expected, most legislators predictably howled in anger over the choices -- none louder than Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. 
 To protest what they consider the improper injection of politics into the issue, Mr. D'Amato, a Republican, and Mr. Moynihan, a Democrat, moved to hold up the confirmation of seven of the eight members of the Presidential commission that oversees the closings.
Yet the two Senators were protesting cuts that were announced in 1993, not the current round made public today. "The main thing is, New York was not treated fairly" in 1993, said Kevin Sheekey, a spokesman for Senator Moynihan. "And those wounds have not healed, and they may never heal."
The latest round of closings will eliminate 4,650 military and civilian jobs in the New York area and could cost the region more than $300 million in lost wages, contracts and other benefits.
With the end of the cold war and sharp cuts in Pentagon spending, the Clinton Administration has slashed billions of dollars in overhead costs from the armed forces to pay for training and new weapons. But Mr. Perry said this year's round was scaled back because of the steep expenses that are incurred in closing a base and doing related tasks like environmental cleanup.
Indeed, the Secretary directed that for this year's round the armed forces identify installations that had lower closing costs and yielded faster paybacks. As a result, once the Pentagon pays to close and clean up all the bases in this round as well as the ones in 1988, 1991 and 1993, it expects to save $6 billion a year starting in about 2001.
"This has been a painful process for D.O.D. and for the communities involved, but it's necessary to close unneeded infrastructure," Mr. Perry said. In addition to the closings and reductions, the list announced today includes dozens of adjustments at installations involved in earlier rounds of closings.
This is the last scheduled round of base closings, although Mr. Perry said he would probably ask Congress this year to approve another round for three or four years from now.
Some lawmakers said the Pentagon had not gone far enough in this year's recommendations. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the chairman of the House Republican Caucus, said on Monday that the Clinton Administration apparently was satisfied to keep more military overhead than it needs.
"We still have a tremendous number of bases in our country that are no longer necessary or needed for national security," said Mr. Boehner, whose district is next to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which will gain 2,500 positions from two bases that are closing. "As painful as it is for the communities in which those bases are located, we ought to bite the bullet."
But the Pentagon plan has provoked uproar in states and Congressional districts where bases are shutting or shrinking, moves that will unleash economic turmoil that will certainly last for years.
The states with the highest loss of military and civilian jobs would be Texas with 6,981, New Mexico with 5,138, Alabama with 4,946 and Pennsylvania with 3,600. California, a strategically important state in the 1996 Presidential campaign, would lose several thousand civilian jobs at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard.
"Texans have a long tradition of not giving up our military installations without a fight," said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas.
Mr. Perry and Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch acknowledged today that they had had "hundreds of conversations" in recent months with lawmakers, community officials and senior White House aides about the process. But they said politics did not play any role in the final selections.
Senior military officials said that while they received no explicit instructions to put a base on or take one off, the body language from senior Pentagon civilians was clear. "We put bases on and off the list depending on what we thought they wanted upstairs," one Army official said.
Mr. Sheekey said that both Senator Moynihan and Senator D'Amato were still upset about closings in 1993, when the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission ignored the recommendations of the Defense Department, which wanted to close McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey and move the jobs to Plattsburg Air Force Base in New York. Instead the commission, then under the chairmanship of former Representative Jim Courter of New Jersey, closed the New York base and moved the jobs to New Jersey.
As a result, the new head of that commission -- and for now its only member, former Illinois Senator Alan J. Dixon -- will probably be sitting alone on Wednesday as he opens hearings on the latest recommendations.
Mr. Sheekey said late in the day that Mr. Moynihan had released his "hold" on the nominations, saying he had made his point and held up the nominations until it would be too late for the Senate to vote on them before the commission meeting.
Wade Nelson, a commission spokesman, said Mr. Dixon fully expected to appear solo at the hearing.
For most members of Congress, the outrage over the closings is partly political theater. The difficult decisions are supposed to be made by the Presidential commission, which was set up to insulate Congress from angry constituents.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Colombia Refuses To Cooperate in Drug War

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The Administration severely criticized the Government of Colombia today, calling it "the world's primary cocaine production center" and saying it was not doing enough to crack down on the drug trade. But the Administration stopped short of cutting off economic aid.
In its annual drug report, the State Department accused Colombia of prosecuting few traffickers, giving light prison sentences and having no laws against money laundering. 
 The State Department removed Colombia from its list of countries that cooperate in fighting drug trafficking, saying, "Weak legislation, corruption and inefficency hampered efforts to bring mid- and high-level narcotics traffickers to justice."
Colombia criticized the report, saying, "It does not acknowledge the magnitude of the effort our country has made in the struggle against drug trafficking, at a high cost in human life and economic resources."
The Colombian Government said that it was considering rejecting the $16 million it receives every year from the United States to fight drug trafficking, Reuters reported. The agency qoted the Interior Minister, Horacio Serpa, as saying the aid was minimal in view of the $1 billion he said Colombia spends each year to fight the drug trade.
By law, if the State Department finds that a country is not cooperating on narcotics matters, it must cut off foreign aid and veto loans by the World Bank and other international institutions, unless it determines that there are "vital national interests" to continue such aid.
Despite Colombia's lack of cooperation, the State Department invoked the "vital national interests" clause. But the Republican staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is urging Congress to overturn the decision and end aid.
In its report, the State Department said Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Nigeria and Syria continued not to cooperate on drug matters and would receive no American aid. Saying opium production in Afghanistan rose 39 percent last year, the report removed that country from the list of nations receiving waivers.
Robert S. Gelbard, the Assistant Secretary of State for international narcotics and law enforcement, said the State Department believed that continued engagement was the best way to get Colombia to do more to combat drug trafficking.
"It is the most critical country in terms of the President's Western Hemisphere drug strategy," Mr. Gelbard said. "We want to continue to try to develop further bilateral cooperation."
But he adopted a much harsher tone toward Colombia than he did last year, saying at a news briefing: "We are seriously concerned about the fact that there were no major drug prosecutions in Colombia."
He also said there was widespread corruption among Colombia's law enforcement authorities and cited a 13 percent increase in coca production in Colombia last year.
Mr. Gelbard had a few encouraging words for some actions by Colombia, among them setting up a commission to review prison sentences and talking with Washington about enacting laws on money laundering.
The State Department condemned Myanmar, formerly Burma, which it said produced more than half of the world's heroin. It also accused Nigeria, which was added to the list of non-cooperating nations last year, of having "courier organizations that span the globe."
Bolivia, Lebanon, Pakistan, Paraguay and Peru were also found not to be cooperating but, like Colombia, they were given national interest waivers, partly because the United States does not want to sour relations with them.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Loan Is Expected for Ukraine

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
In a development that could have important implications for economic change in neighboring Russia, Ukraine is expected to borrow close to $1.5 billion from the International Monetary Fund later this month.
Ukraine's representative at the I.M.F. in Washington, Oleh Havrylyshyn, and Anders Aslund, a Swedish economic adviser to President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine, confirmed in separate interviews yesterday that the Ukranian Government would sign a letter this week accepting the I.M.F.'s terms for the loan, which would be by far the largest the institution has given to any country of the former Soviet Union. Ukraine has 52 million people. 
 The confirmations came after Mr. Kuchma announced yesterday the resignation of Prime Minister Vitaly Masol, a holdover from the Soviet era, and replaced him with First Deputy Prime Minister Yevhen Marchuk, who is widely considered to be more sympathetic to the President's efforts to create a free-enterprise economy in Ukraine.
"This is the beginning of a big surge forward in Ukraine," Mr. Havrylyshyn said.
Mr. Aslund, who said the I.M.F.'s executive board was likely to give formal approval to the loan later this month, described it as "a stamp of international approval for Ukraine's effort to transform its economy."
He added that Ukraine had already privatized 11,000 state-owned enterprises and planned to sell an additional 8,000 large and medium-sized companies this year. He said it had also cut its inflation rate from 10,200 percent in 1993 to about 1 percent a month and had reduced the budget deficit to the equivalent of 5 percent of the economy's output.
In a further show of support for Mr. Kuchma and his economic policies, the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, will visit Kiev, the capital, next week, officials said.
The immediate purpose of the new I.M.F. credit is to help Ukraine gather about $6 billion in foreign economic assistance this year to finance economic development.
Mr. Aslund said he hoped to raise the rest of the money by persuading Russia to reschedule $2.5 billion in Ukrainian debts that come due this year for imports of oil and natural gas and to get money from the World Bank, the United States, Western Europe and Japan.
But he warned that Ukraine's success in borrowing from the I.M.F. might make Russia -- which is still negotiating for a much larger $6.5 billion I.M.F. credit -- reluctant to reschedule the debts that Ukraine owes it. "The Russians will ask why they should help Ukraine when they are not getting I.M.F. help but Ukraine is," he said.
Mr. Aslund also criticized the Europeans for slowness in assisting Ukraine, saying that although Germany and the Netherlands were sympathetic, France, Italy and Spain were more interested in aiding Algeria and other Arab countries of North Africa in a struggle against Islamic fundamentalism.
However, I.M.F. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were reasonably confident that they could successfully conclude their loan negotiations with the Russians within the next few weeks, so that both Russia and Ukraine would get their assistance at about the same time.
Mr. Camdessus has already made tentative plans to visit Moscow at the end of the month in anticipation of such an agreement, these officials said.
These officials and some private experts also suggest that granting Ukraine its loan now will put extra pressure on Russian ministries to compromise and accept the I.M.F.'s terms. The big stumbling block, they say, is the reluctance of the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Economic Relations to surrender their control over Russian oil exports, as the I.M.F. is demanding.
"When other branches of the Russian Government see Ukraine is getting I.M.F. money, they will put extra pressure on them to stop blocking the deal," said Donald Green, a Russian expert with Plan Econ, a Washington economic consulting concern that specializes in the former Communist world.
In fact, Mr Green said, the I.M.F. is already effectively helping Russia by lending to Ukraine and some other parts of the former Soviet Union because these countries spend much of the money buying oil, gas and other raw materials from Russia.

HEADLINE: Indians Offer Part of Profit From Casino

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 1

 BODY:
As they unveiled a plan to build a casino 90 miles from New York City, leaders of the Oneida Indian Nation said today that they would discuss giving New York State a share of their profits in exchange for Gov. George E. Pataki's approval.
Mr. Pataki, who wields virtual veto power over such proposals, has said he opposes the plan to build a casino at Monticello Raceway in the Catskill Mountains of Sullivan County, and his aides reiterated his opposition today. Republican legislators close to the Governor said they would try to block the plan, arguing that it would enrich the Oneidas but not the state or taxpayers. 
 But at a news conference at the racetrack today, Oneida leaders and their business partners marshaled more than 100 local business owners to endorse the idea as a potential economic boon and to urge Mr. Pataki to honor campaign vows to help their financially strapped region.
"Governor, we're in dire straits," said Chris Ehrlich, an official of the Pines Hotel and a member of the Catskills Resort Association, a trade group. "When the members of the Catskills Association met with you last year, you made a promise to try to help us."
Raymond Halbritter, the Oneidas' elected representative, said the tribe wanted to build a casino with a 100,000- to 150,000-square-foot gambling area on the grounds of the racetrack. The 1,100-member tribe already operates a smaller casino, Turning Stone, in Verona, about 35 miles east of Syracuse.
Under an agreement the tribe has with Watermark Investments, a Bahamian bank that is seeking to buy the racetrack, the Oneidas would invest $5 million to refurbish the track if the casino plan is approved. Mr. Halbritter also said the tribe would pay $2.5 million a year for 10 years into a Sullivan County fund for economic development.
And if the state does not legalize gambling outside Indian lands, he said the tribe would pay $2.5 million a year to Sullivan County's treasury for as long as the casino operates.
Mr. Halbritter said the Oneidas would not build hotels at the racetrack or sell tax-free cigarettes and gasoline in bulk, as is done on many Indian reservations, to avoid competing with Catskill businesses.
Asked how much of their profit the tribe would be willing to give to the state in exchange for approvals, he said, "That's up for discussion."
In Connecticut, the Mashantucket Pequot tribe agreed to pay the state at least $100 million a year from its Foxwoods Casino in Ledyard in exchange for a monopoly on operating slot machines in Connecticut.
Under Federal law, the Oneidas can run a casino on tribal lands, but the raceway is more than 100 miles south of their lands. However, the law does allow tribes to run casinos elsewhere if the Federal Department of the Interior and the Governor approve.
Casino gambling outside Indian reservations is prohibited by the State Constitution. However, there are efforts underway in the Legislature to legalize casino gambling, which would require approval by two consecutively elected Legislatures and by voters in a referendum.
Mr. Pataki has not publicly endorsed casino gambling but has said he would support the initial passage of a constitutional amendment so the state could study the idea. He has said he opposes the proliferation of Indian casinos because Indian businesses and land are not subject to corporate, sales and property taxes.
"We want to be sure that if casino gambling is instituted, we want the owners to pay property taxes, sales taxes and incomes taxes," said his spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha.
Supporters of legalized gambling attacked the Oneidas' plan, calling the proposal to give Sullivan County $2.5 million a year "insulting" and warning that the tribe would use gambling profits to fight the spread of casinos outside reservations.
"Why cut a deal with the Indians in Sullivan County at the expense of Niagara Falls and Lake George and so many other areas of the state that might want casinos?" said State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Yonkers Republican.
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Rensselaer County, denounced the plan, saying, "I don't think it's in the public's best interest to have the Indians all becoming multimillionaires within the state's borders when the state receives practically no revenue."
But Catskill business owners and officials who support the Oneida proposal said their hardscrabble region can't wait the three years or more it will take to legalize casino gambling.
"This is New York's best chance to stem the flow of money that is going out to New Jersey and Connecticut now," said Andrew Boyer, chairman of the Sullivan County Board of Supervisors.

HEADLINE: Fall in Auto Sales Raises New Fears of Slowdown

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 1

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks fell in February, in contrast to a robust period a year ago, according to company sales reports released today and estimates by analysts.
The results were below the expectations of Wall Street analysts, heightening fears of an economic slowdown and sending auto stocks falling on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Taken individually, the sales reports varied widely. At the Chrysler Corporation, sales of light trucks, including mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, plunged, while car sales increased; at the General Motors Corporation, light-truck sales climbed, while car sales took a nose dive. Sales dropped over all at Honda, but rose at Toyota.
Because of such confusing signals, which began to appear in January, monthly vehicle sales have become a kind of economic Rorschach test, revealing perhaps more about the biases of those who interpret them than about the actual demand.
Some auto industry analysts, citing production cuts and rising rebates together with the slower sales, said they saw the beginning of the end of the economic expansion. That view appeared to prevail among investors today, as auto stock prices, already at roughly two-thirds their 52-week highs of a year ago, fell further.
In a generally weak stock market, shares of Chrysler, the second-most active on the New York Stock Exchange, fell $2, to $41.375, a 52-week low. Shares of G.M. fell $2.125, to $40.50, and shares of the Ford Motor Company fell 50 cents, to $25.625.
In the optimists' camp, auto executives and many auto stock analysts argue that sales are slowing because the Federal Reserve has safely brought the economy to a so-called soft landing by raising short-term interest rates. They say that is good news for the industry, portending years of gradual growth rather than the traditional boom and bust. They point to rising incomes as a sign that the fundamentals of the expansion remain in place.
"The U.S. economy is in a sound state," Helmut Panke, chief executive of BMW North America, said today. He predicted moderate growth in vehicle sales this year of 3 percent to 4 percent from unit sales of 15.1 million last year.
Regardless of which view of the market proves to be correct, the slowing of sales is surely good news for vehicle buyers. "We're seeing a shift from it being a seller's market in 1994 to being a buyer's market in 1995," said David M. Garrity, auto analyst with Smith Barney in New York. As sales soften and inventories rise, rebates are rising as well, offsetting the effect of higher interest rates.
A year ago sales rose almost 20 percent from February 1993, outstripping the industry's projections and emptying dealers' inventories. Sales reached an annualized rate of 15.4 million cars and light trucks, higher than the actual results for the year.
By contrast, this February dealers sold vehicles at an annual rate of 14.8 million, according to an estimate by Ward's Automotive Reports. In January the rate was 14.9 million. "It puts auto sales on a path consistent with the sluggishness in home sales," Mr. Garrity said.
The complete sales reports were not available. In February most auto companies began reporting monthly sales on the first business day of the subsequent month. But some auto makers -- most notably Ford -- continue to report on the third business day.
Ward's bases its estimates on production schedules, past market shares and other company information.
Among the most startling results for February was the poor performance of Chrysler's light trucks, which had been setting sales records. Chrysler's light-truck sales fell 15 percent, to 95,214. Sales of the maker's sport utility vehicles fell 14 percent, to 29,138, while sales of Chrysler mini-vans fell by almost a third, to 31,867.
Chrysler said that without Ford's sales report, it could not determine the reason for the drop in sales of its sport utility vehicles. "Without a better industry picture, it's hard to say," said Jim Crawford, a spokesman for Chrysler. But the company attributed the weak sales of its mini-vans partly to the incentives that Ford had placed on its Windstar mini-vans.
Last week Chrysler responded to the marketing move by Ford with increased rebates on its mini-vans, which dealers said had given sales a jump-start.
But Ford has again upped the ante, announcing today a rebate program called "Chrysler Conquest." On top of other, enriched rebates, people who own or lease a Chrysler mini-van can receive $750 cash if they buy or lease a Ford Windstar, Ford Aerostar or Mercury Villager.
At G.M., total vehicle sales fell 8.9 percent, to 365,103. While truck sales rose 2.3 percent, car sales plunged 15.5 percent, in a drop that G.M. attributed partly to a cutback in its sales to fleet customers. Oldsmobile, for example, said its retail sales increased, but a drop in its less profitable fleet sales produced an overall decline in sales of 26.2 percent.
A bright spot for G.M. continued to be Saturn. Sales of its small cars rose 14.3 percent, to 19,275, setting a record for the 12th consecutive month.
Chrysler reported that its total sales fell 6 percent, to 166,572. Sales at Honda fell 10.0 percent, to 50,847, while sales at Toyota rose 5.8 percent, to 74,020. Mazda reported that its sales fell 11.2 percent, to 22,592.

HEADLINE: Thou Shalt Not Traffic in the Demon Gossip;
In a World of Envy and Talk Show Values, a Pacifist Sect Takes a Higher, Harder Way

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIFTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
The rest of America may be feeding on modern gossip as an industrial-size staple of the gross national product, but not Christoph Arnold and his fellow Christian pacifists, who live quietly as the Hutterian Brethren here on the banks of the Wallkill River.
"It would tear us to pieces," Mr. Arnold said. 
 The brethren define gossip, demon gossip, as a sin, even as much of the nation seems to wallow in all its electronic and printed titillations.
Humble in attitude, Amishlike in dress, open-handed in greeting visitors, the Rifton Hutterites dedicate themselves to uprooting uncharitable gossiping, backbiting and petty calumnies in their common life with a commitment that could make Geraldo blush.
"That's a no-no, big time," said Ian Winter, one of the brethren who once resisted the group's anti-gossip rule and had to withdraw into solitude until he worked up the courage to confess and apologize before his neighbors and gossip victims.
Other Hutterite tenets sound far more dramatic and rocklike as members stand opposed to abortion and capital punishment, to war and homosexuality, and demand lifetime commitment to marriage and the brethren community. But it is the fight against unneighborly jealousies and social hypocrisies, the childlike urge to tattle and connive, that members smilingly admit to as the true daily cross.
"Each of us is his own main problem," said Art Wiser, 74, who joined the Hutterites 40 years ago, after his experience as a conscientious objector in World War II left him searching for a more honest and fulfilling life.
Mr. Arnold, 55, the brethren's elder, recited the sorry stuff of the Hutterites' struggle. "Selfishness, greed, ego, anger, jealousy," he said amid the serenity of the brotherhood's 190-acre compound here in the Hudson Valley north of New Paltz. "We do fall into gossip, and we must recognize this is wrong."
The Rifton Hutterites, a modern variant of a branch of Anabaptists dating to the 16th century, began flourishing in America in the 1950's after being exiled as pacifists from Nazi Germany. More socially curious and venturesome than Old Order Amish and other related religious groups, the brethren have grown from fewer than 100 pioneer members to 2,000 members in six American communities.
As they have taken root, they have sought to follow their signature stricture, known as the first law of Sannerz, enunciated in 1920 by the branch's founder, Eberhard Arnold, grandfather of Christoph: "There must never be talk, either in open remarks or in insinuation, against a brother or a sister, against their individual characteristics -- under no circumstances behind the person's back. Talking in one's own family is no exception."
That rule might turn an average gathering at the office water cooler into one of the infernal rings of Dante, particularly when coupled with Eberhard's prescription that the sinner must candidly confront his or her gossip victim "whose weaknesses cause a negative reaction in us."
"That's the problem wherever there's human flesh," Christoph Arnold, the lean, bearded elder insisted, smiling gently at his group's near-satirical contrast with so much of surrounding America.
"I know, Marcia Clark and the bloody gloves," he said, laughing at one symptom of the buzzing circus of prurience and folly that he hears circling the brethren, not far beyond the sanctuary's wood line. "A few of us have radios, so we know about the O.J. trial."
He said the brethren are modern enough to feel a need to compose their own news summaries, read occasionally at the noontime common meal.
The Hutterites are a disarming mix of homespun and high tech. Owning all resources in common, they are self-supporting through a chain of computerized factories that produce high-quality children's toys and furniture for the handicapped, using members' own designs, tooling and labor and a global mail-order and phone system. The men dress in black peasant work clothes, the women in modest kerchiefs and aprons. But they reject the full horse-and-buggy austerity of the Amish and have a small common motor pool of cars and even their own Gulfstream charter airplane for missionary work in Nigeria.
Hardly withdrawn, they like outsiders to visit and even stake them to free meals or an overnight stay. The dedication to family is obvious among the 350 residents here, but they spare visitors lectures on family values. Far from proselytizing, they go to protest marches against war, the death penalty, urban violence and racial injustice, but carefully distance themselves from the self-righteousness that they find in the political agenda of some other modern Christian fundamentalists.
"That's where we part company with the religious right," Mr. Wiser said. "We are concerned when somebody takes us into politics and tries to push other people around. That's coercion, force."
In short, the Hutterian Brethren heed a different drummer, and never more so than in targeting gossip. Mr. Wiser, the community's archivist, told of one sister who became increasingly involved in creative writing, to the point of wanting to reprogram the brethren's word processing system for her convenience.
"I began thinking about it and spoke to my wife, Mary, and put a whole negative twist to it," he confessed, smiling sheepishly. "We both instantly realized I had to go to the woman and her husband and tell them."
Rather than citing fear of some divine retribution as motive for this heroic behavior, the Hutterites say their way is based on a simple fact, proven daily, that an open word spoken directly to the other person deepens friendship and is not resented.
"Admonishments come with love here," said Ruben Ayala, a 42-year-old convert to the life of common prayer, hard work, simple meals and charity. He visited Rifton and stayed to marry a Hutterite woman after being impressed by brethren at the Bowery Mission in Manhattan, where he worked as a recovering drug addict and ex-convict. "There's no grudges here."
Hutterites smiled at a visitor's observation that such saintly candor could be an awfully risky business in the outside world.
"Well, it's no Utopia here," Mr. Arnold took care to emphasize.
Mr. Winter felt compelled to look him in the eye and add, "But we do have fun living, you know."

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Falter On Fear of Lower Profits

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell yesterday and the Dow Jones industrial average again slipped below the 4,000-point level, hurt by concerns that slower economic growth this year will translate into weaker corporate profits.
Declines in shares of the Chrysler Corporation, Caterpillar Inc., the International Paper Company, the Aluminum Company of America and other so-called cyclical companies, whose performance is closely tied to swings in economic growth, drove the market down, overshadowing a second day of gains in technology issues. 
 "It's late in the earnings cycle, and when earnings momentum peaks, you usually see that reflected in the stock market," said Edward Goldfarb, head of portfolio strategy at Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford.
The Dow closed down 16.25 points, at 3,994.80, after falling as much as 25.94 points. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks declined 1.74 points, to 485.65. And despite gains in technology stocks, the Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.86 points, to 791.87.
The retreat in the blue chips was led by shares of the General Motors Corporation, which reported a sharp decline in car sales. Its stock fell 2 1/8 a share, to 40 1/2. Chrysler, which said sales of light trucks plunged in the month, fell 2 a share, to 41 3/8. The Ford Motor Company, which did not release February sales figures yesterday, eased 1/2, to 25 5/8 a share. Ford said yesterday that it was offering Chrysler owners a $750 rebate on Ford's own mini-vans for two months in an attempt to increase its market share in the segment.
International Paper shares slumped 1 1/8, to 75 1/4. Paper stocks reacted to concern about weaker earnings at the Weyerhaeuser Company and added capacity at an Abitibi-Price Inc. plant in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Weyerhaeuser fell 1 1/4 a share, to 39 1/2.
Alcoa shares dropped 1, to 38. Goldman, Sachs & Company downgraded investment ratings on six metal and mining stocks today, among them Alcoa, Alumax Inc., Falconbridge Ltd., Inco Ltd., the Magma Copper Company and the Phelps Dodge Corporation.
Caterpillar shares fell 1 3/8, to 50 1/4, after Smith Barney downgraded the maker of heavy construction equipment to "outperform" from "buy."
The Maxus Energy Corporation, the most active stock, with almost 22 million shares changing hands, was unchanged at 5 1/2 a share after jumping 1 3/4 late on Tuesday in response to a $740 million takeover offer from YPF S.A. of Argentina. American depository receipts for shares of YPF slumped 1 5/8, to 17 3/8.
Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 362.6 million shares, up from 317.6 million on Tuesday and above this year's daily average of 329.7 million. Declining issues outnumbered advancers, 1,254 to 1,010.
A number of technology stocks gained for a second day, led by Texas Instruments Inc., which climbed 2 1/4 a share, to 81. The semiconductor maker predicted the worldwide market for computer chips would grow 21 percent, to $124 billion, in 1995.
The Hewlett-Packard Company surged 2 a share, to 117; the Computer Sciences Corporation added 5/8, to 49 3/4; Micron Technology Inc. jumped 2 7/8, to 64 7/8; the LSI Logic Corporation rose 7/8, to 55 3/8; Xilinx Inc. rose 3/8, to 67 1/4, and the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation rose 1 1/4, to 29 5/8.
Many investors "think technology has led us through this whole big rally, and think it will continue," said Anthony Conroy, director of equity trading at BT Global Asset Management, a division of Bankers Trust New York.

HEADLINE: Salinas Blames Successor for Peso Crisis

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 1

 BODY:
Speaking publicly for the first time about the nation's severe economic crisis that many Mexicans believe he caused, former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has tried to shift blame to his successor, contending that President Ernesto Zedillo bungled the peso's devaluation in December a few weeks after taking office.
In a telephone call on Tuesday afternoon to a national television news program, "24 Hours," Mr. Salinas said the decisions by President Zedillo and his administration had cost Mexico billions of dollars "in a single day" and led directly to the financial turmoil that now engulfs the country. 
 Mr. Salinas was referring to a decision by the Zedillo administration on Dec. 20 to devalue the peso 15 percent, after Government finance officials conceded to the nation's top bankers and businessmen that Mexico could no longer support a fixed exchange rate. The officials made the remarks at a meeting in which they discussed Mexico's currency problems.
Elaborating on his accusations in a subsequent telephone interview, Mr. Salinas said that Mr. Zedillo's financial team, by disclosing their intentions, caused investors who received the information to withdraw nearly $13 billion within a day, draining Mexico's shrinking international reserves and forcing the Government to float the peso on Dec. 21. Some analysts here and in New York believe the amount actually withdrawn was far less, a little more than $3 billion.
The Finance Minister at the time, Jaime Serra Puche, resigned the following week. The new Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz, rebutted Mr. Salinas's contentions in an appearance today before the Mexican Congress. Mr. Ortiz said the roots of the crisis went back well before Dec. 1, when Mr. Zedillo replaced Mr. Salinas as President.
However, senior officials of Mr. Zedillo's own Government have said privately that its handling of the devaluation was, in the words of one of them, "the worst mistake made by the government in years."
Mr. Salinas's criticism of Mr. Zedillo was made just hours after the former President's older brother, Raul Salinas, had been arrested on charges of arranging the assassination of an important Mexican politician in September. The charges by Mr. Salinas were seen here as not just an attempt to defend his own administration's economic policies but also as evidence of a split between himself and his chosen successor, Mr. Zedillo, who has vowed to pursue the assassination investigation no matter where it leads.
Raul Salinas was arrested on Tuesday afternoon on charges of ordering the assassination Sept. 28 of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the secretary general of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has been in power for almost 66 years. Carlos Salinas has not been implicated in the killing.
But with his own reputation tarnished by the economic and now personal setbacks at home, the former President today withdrew his candidacy to head the World Trade Organization, a move that had been widely expected.
"In recent days I made it known that I had chosen to withdraw my candidacy for the directorship" of the newly created trade organization, Mr. Salinas said in a statement. "Today I am making it formal."
 The political fallout from Raul Salinas's arrest helped push down the Mexican stock exchange, which lost a little more than 2 percent to close at just under 1,518 today.
However, the peso was almost unchanged, closing at 5.945 to the dollar. Interest rates on 28-day treasury certificates fell 9.3 percentage points, to 49.7 percent, suggesting some modest relief from Mexico's soaring interest rates.
Interviews with several Government officials and statements by the Bank of Mexico indicate that the Zedillo administration was persuaded by the nation's business leaders and bankers to drop its original plan to let the peso float freely and instead simply to adjust its rate downward by 15 percent against the dollar.
Before this, the peso was worth nearly 29 cents. The devaluation on the first day of the crisis brought it to just above 25 cents. Today, the peso is worth less than 17 cents.
The Bank of Mexico, the central bank, acknowledged that the Government's Exchange Rate Commission decided on Dec. 19 that Mexico had no choice but to abandon a fixed exchange rate because its international reserves had dropped below $11 billion, which was considered insufficient to fight off an attack by currency speculators. The reserves have since been reinforced by an international rescue package that includes $20 billion in American loans and guarantees.
Members of Mr. Zedillo's Government confirmed that the businessmen opposed any floating exchange rate at the meeting on Dec 20.
"We went to them with the idea of a floating rate and they got absolutely scared," said one Government official, referring to the business leaders and bankers. "But eventually they convinced us that a free float wasn't the right way to go."
Once the Bank of Mexico had disclosed to the bankers and businessmen that it lacked sufficient reserves to protect the peso, many went out after the meeting to convert pesos into dollars. By the evening of Dec. 21, the Government Exchange Rate Commission was forced to let the peso float freely.
Many American investors have complained that the Mexican Government had either wittingly or unwittingly given Mexican investors inside information about currency reserves that allowed them to safeguard their positions before the peso's fixed exchange rate was abandoned. Mr. Salinas's remarks appear to corroborate their suspicions.
Luis R. Luis, head of research for Scudder, Stevens & Clark of Boston, said that so much money left Mexico in those two days of December that it "weakened the last hope the central bank had of having a fixed peso policy."
But Mr. Luis did not believe that the economic crisis, which has cost Mexico hundreds of thousands of jobs and lowered almost everyone's standard of living, was caused solely by the mistakes made in December.
"The seeds for the crisis," Mr. Luis said, "were planted much earlier."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long Bonds Push a Rally For 2d Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The long end of the government securities market rallied yesterday for the second consecutive day, as new economic reports suggesting that growth was slowing and the threat of inflation was easing helped to keep the bullish sentiment intact.
In early trading all maturities came under pressure, as investors sold because of concerns that included a postponement of the Senate's vote on the balanced budget amendment and the weakness of the dollar in the currency markets, though it rebounded in the afternoon. 
 The price of the 30-year bond was up 2/32 , to 1026/32 , for a yield of 7.44 percent, unchanged from Tuesday. But bill rates were mixed, with a three-month issue down a basis point, to 5.73 percent.
Susan Hering, an economist with Salomon Brothers, said the Commerce Department's revision yesterday of the fourth-quarter gross domestic product, to 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent, was in line with the market's expectations and therefore had little impact. The Federal Reserve considers a growth rate of 2.5 percent to be acceptable without causing inflation to accelerate.
"Most of the data is several weeks old," she said. "And while the February National Association of Purchasing Management number had more of a visible effect on the market than the revised G.D.P., none of the numbers left a lasting impression."
The purchasing management association reported that manufacturing grew in February at a much slower rate than in the previous month, and fewer companies paid higher prices for raw materials.
"The N.A.P.M. data suggest that the manufacturing sector is moving from a hectic to healthy rate of growth," Ms. Hering said. Components like new orders and production both slowed measurably, and prices moderated a bit, but remained at higher levels.
Ms. Hering added that the market expected the Fed to raise short-term rates again, but not right away. For the remainder of the week, she said, traders will be studying the January new-home sales, which are scheduled to be released today, and the report on initial jobless claims. "If it continues to move up," as it has during the last few weeks, she said, "the market may conclude the economy is continuing to weaken."
Today the Treasury will auction $17.25 billion of new one-year notes; yesterday it auctioned $8 billion of nine-day cash management bills at an average rate of 5.81 percent. Cash management bills are used to meet the Treasury's short-term borrowing needs beyond the money raised through the Government's regularly scheduled auctions.
By late in the day the rate for an outstanding one-year bill was 6.03 percent, up a basis point from the previous day.
In the municipal bond market, yields fell as investors snapped up the $500 million bond offering by New York State. There has been a drought of new tax-exempt issues, with new sales down about 60 percent from this time last year, forcing investors to pay higher premiums for issues.
The New York State 10-year maturity general obligation debt was priced yesterday to yield 5.57 percent.
Lehman Brothers, the senior manager on the pricing yesterday, sold bonds to yield from 4.40 percent for an issue due in 1996, with a 5.50 percent coupon, to 6.05 percent for a bond due in 2014.
The bonds are rated A by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The following are the results of the nine-day cash management bill auction yesterday:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 99.855

Prudential's Capital Base Declined 11% Last Year

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Putting the final point on a horrible year, the Prudential Insurance Company of America said yesterday that losses in a number of businesses, primarily its securities and mortgage subsidiaries, caused its capital base to decline in 1994 by $1.2 billion, or 11 percent, to $9.5 billion.
Prudential, one of the world's largest financial services companies, also said that after dividends and taxes it lost $907 million last year, compared with net income of $645 million in 1993. 
 For all of 1994, the company said its revenues fell almost 5 percent, to $43.6 billion.
Because it is a mutual insurance company owned by policyholders, Prudential prefers to emphasize yearly changes in its capital position.
"Capital is the bottom line; it is the net worth of the company," said Gene O'Hara, Prudential's chief financial officer. "We are disappointed in this setback, but $9.5 billion in capital is still a very, very strong position."
By far the biggest contributor to what one analyst referred to as Prudential's "annus horriblis" was the drain on capital created by settlements related to improper and illegal sales of limited partnerships at Prudential Securities, the brokerage subsidiary.
To cover the costs of settling those claims, which relate to partnerships that date from the 1980's, Prudential incurred $1.4 billion in costs last year.
In its financial report, Prudential said that while Prudential Securities' continuing operations were profitable, the firm reported an after-tax loss of $811 million for 1994.
The sharp rise in interest rates that bedeviled many on Wall Street last year hit Prudential's residential mortgage business hard.
The three units that make up the Prudential Residential Services Company had 1994 after-tax losses of $119.1 million.
In addition, Prudential's property and casualty business was hit early in 1994 by the California earthquake and the severe winter storms in the Northeast, which generated more than $200 million in unanticipated losses, according to David A. Havens, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
Because so many of Prudential's problems have been well documented, analysts had been expecting the company would report a big loss when it finally released its 1994 results.
As a consequence, the results released yesterday came as no surprise, they said.
"We knew it was going to be an ugly year," said Robert L. Riegel, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service. "These numbers are in line with what we thought would happen."
In a statement that accompanied the financial report, Arthur P. Ryan, who became Prudential's chairman and chief executive in December, said, "We faced up to substantial challenges in 1994, and we will be taking steps in 1995 to dramatically improve earnings and capital for this and subsequent years."
Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president at the A. M. Best Company, an insurance rating agency, said: "The loss of capital is very important. But looking forward, the key to Prudential will be its ability to rebound quickly, and bring its overall risk profile in line with its capital. That is a very significant challenge Mr. Ryan is facing."
In December, A. M. Best indicated that it might downgrade its rating on Prudential, placing it under review with negative implications.

Negotiating Teams Move To Night Round of Talks

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 1

 BODY:
For a sport that hasn't had a game for 202 days, baseball experienced a flurry of activity today. There were developments in several cities in two countries, but most attention was focused on possible developments in this city.
Nothing concrete was reported after a six-hour meeting between five-person negotiating teams at the golf club on Gainey Ranch, but from the comments made by the leaders for both sides, they seemed to be telegraphing grudging willingness to change what have been inflexible positions on the central economic issues. 
 Discussing the change in tone and effort, Donald Fehr, the union chief, attributed it to the fact that the season is approaching. "Hopefully," he said, "everybody wants to try and see if there's a deal that can be cut in time for that to happen in the ordinary course."
The negotiators were eager enough to find out that they decided to have another session, with even smaller groups, tonight.
"It's an indication that the parties believe there's some chance for a better dialogue in a smaller group," Fehr said of the meeting size, adding, "There's a mutual interest in continuing the discussions."
The negotiators, in effect, had a day-night doubleheader. In a night game in neighboring Tempe, the California Angels defeated the Arizona State University baseball team, 13-5, in the first spring training exhibition game, which also represented the first game using replacement players in major league uniforms. The first games between replacement teams are scheduled for Thursday in Florida.
In another development involving exhibition games, the Baltimore Orioles' first 12 games were officially canceled. The teams that were supposed to play the Orioles canceled them because the Orioles had said they would play the games only if those teams agreed not to use replacement players.
If the strike continues through the rest of spring training, the Orioles' other games also will be canceled.
"In essence, most teams plan not to play them and in essence they are canceled," Phyllis Merhige, an American League vice president, said by telephone from New York. "But we are taking them two weeks at a time. If there's a settlement, those games probably would be reinstated."
The Orioles' opponents acted at the direction of the commissioner's office and the operations committee, a 10-man unit that has been overseeing matters relating to the playing of the season without the striking players.
In a development related to the regular season, the Canadian Immigration Department also acted today, allowing the Expos to play games with replacement players in Montreal.
In exempting the Expos from a Canadian law that prohibits the use of foreign replacement workers during a work stoppage, the immigration department explained that the law is intended to protect Canadian workers from replacement by foreign workers. In the Expos' case, however, a spokeswoman said that the striking workers already were foreign nationals. The Expos, in seeking the exemption, argued that if the team couldn't play in Montreal, its Canadian employees would suffer.
Four of the teams that canceled games with the Orioles immediately scheduled games with other teams. The other teams will use split squads because they already had games scheduled for those days.
Other split-squad games have disappeared from the exhibition schedule. The American and National Leagues announced the cancellation of 12 split-squad games.
"Teams are worrying about the pitching more than anything," Merhige said. "We have been advised of some planned cancellations for the rest of the month, but it seemed counterproductive to cancel games that you might not have to cancel."
Some teams also could encounter problems with numbers of players generally. The union has made a concerted effort to induce minor leaguers not to play in exhibition games on the grounds that they would be considered strikebreakers.
Union officials held their third and final meeting tonight in Phoenix to explain their views to minor leaguers. Earlier in the day, the union's executive board voted to pay traveling expenses for minor leaguers who refuse to play and are sent home until the regular minor camps open later this month.
At the bargaining table, the players' and owners' representatives discussed in depth the issue of a payroll tax and revenue sharing among the clubs.
"We delved into the issues in a much deeper sense than we have before," Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said. "We got right to the heart of the matter on a number of subjects."
Selig said it would not be accurate to say either side had changed its position significantly, but he added, "I do think that developing a better understanding could lead to that if we understand maybe to some degree what bothers them more on certain issues and they about us about some of the things they've done."
When Fehr was asked if the day session showed signs of a willingness to change, he hesitated, then said: "Yes, but the discussions were not being conducted in a way in which one could say all right, on this issue what's your range of flexibility, or on that issue. We're talking about things generally and there were, from time to time, some assumptions being thrown around."

Concern on Japan Recovery Depresses Platinum Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Platinum prices tumbled yesterday, hurt by concerns that the failure of Barings P.L.C. would hamper Japan's recovery. Silver and gold prices also fell sharply.
Japan's car and jewelry industries use large amounts of platinum and palladium. Silver, another industrial metal, followed those metals lower, analysts said. The collapse of Barings has helped to drag down stocks sharply in Tokyo, undermining investors' confidence in the Japanese recovery. 
 "Japan's expectations of an economic recovery have been defused a bit by the decline in their stock markets," said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc.
In other commodity activity, lumber prices steepened their slide while cotton and coffee futures rose sharply. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 0.78 point, to 233.47.
On the Commodity Exchange of New York, silver for May delivery fell 14.3 cents, to $4.422 an ounce. The April gold contract dropped $2.10, to $376.20 an ounce, after hitting a contract low of $374.50.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum for April delivery plummeted $7.90, to $403.70 a troy ounce, the lowest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since June 29. March palladium dropped $2.20, to $151.75 a troy ounce.
"Platinum is tied fundamentally to the Japanese demand situation," said David Rinehimer of Smith Barney Inc. "Certainly, there is a big question mark if the level of platinum demand in Japan can be maintained at last year's level."
Lumber prices steepened their slide on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in reaction to Tuesday's report of a sharp decline in January sales of existing homes.
Spruce 2-by-4's for March delivery plunged $13.80, to $287.30 for 1,000 board feet.
Cotton futures roared to another record high on the New York Cotton Exchange, powered by speculative buying and signs of continued strong demand.
"From the point of view that high-quality U.S. cotton is the main reservoir of cotton now, the mills are just willing to bid up for it," said Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc.
March cotton shot up 5.17 cents, to $1.1092 a pound.
Coffee rose sharply on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York on largely speculative buying. March coffee rose 5.35 cents, to $1.8635 a pound.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Supply-side recipe: restore Mexico's old exchange rate.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WITH the wounded Mexican peso trading at roughly six to the dollar, why are influential Congressional Republicans still talking about a return to the pre-crisis exchange rate of 3.5 pesos to the dollar?
A plausible explanation is that the talk is a political freebie, a way to capitalize on the White House's embarrassment over the collapse of the peso without appearing to sabotage efforts to cope with Mexico's financial meltdown. But like many ideas from "supply side" conservatives, there is just enough common sense to give a life of its own to the notion that currency devaluation only worsens badly managed economies. 
 Mexico apparently got into trouble because its Government did not respond to investors' loss of confidence in the economy last year after the Chiapas revolt. Indeed, the Salinas administration concealed the fact that Mexico's central bank was spending billions of dollars a month last fall to prop up the peso while failing to prevent the surging growth of the domestic money supply.
The dam burst when the central bank ran out of foreign currency to buy back the pesos it had been busily pumping into the economy to keep interest rates down and business booming. The exchange value of the peso has since fallen by almost half, reducing living standards in an economy accustomed to cheap imports and leaving businesses that owed money in dollars near ruin.
Mainstream economists, including many with impeccable conservative credentials, view depreciation of the peso as part of the solution. If inflation can be kept in check -- a big "if" -- they argue that the new exchange rate will make Mexican exports more competitive, as well as making Mexican securities more attractive to foreigners. The supply-siders' alternative, using Mexico's new line of credit from the United States Treasury and the International Monetary Fund to restore the old exchange rate, is seen by Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University as "complete madness" -- and the very opposite of prudent policy.
But that has not stopped prominent Republicans including Jack Kemp and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, from wondering out loud why Mexico cannot be held to its old promises never to devalue. Nor has it stopped Jude Wanniski, the doyen of supply-side ideologues, from labeling devaluation as "a nitwit idea that comes deep from the heart of Keynesian philosophy."
Mr. Wanniski argues that devaluation is a breach of trust with the Mexican middle class, undermining both their savings and confidence in free markets. And he dismisses efforts to make exports cheaper by depreciating the currency as a failed nostrum that leads to inflation and more depreciation. His solution for Mexico (and other countries bullied by "the evil death star known as the International Monetary Fund") is to let it claw its way back to the pre-crisis exchange rate.
In theory that is possible if Mexico would be allowed to use its newly borrowed currency reserves to buy back all the pesos it is offered at 3.5 pesos to the dollar. But nonbelievers view revaluation as a recipe for disaster. For unless foreign investors are miraculously inspired to flood Mexico with dollars, the crunch on the supply of money as pesos are exchanged at the central bank for foreign currency would cut deep into consumption and investment.
Wages and prices would eventually fall, easing the cash crunch, making Mexican exports competitive and putting Mexicans back to work. Or maybe not: A long, bitter recession would surely tempt the ruling party's old guard to play the nationalism card, jettisoning the economic and political reforms that have given Mexico a shot at joining the affluent industrial world.
While mainstream economists are thus united in the opposition to revaluation of the peso, they don't agree on much else. Mr. Hanke argues that the most plausible way to restore the peso's credibility is to put monetary policy on automatic pilot. He favors the creation of a "currency board" that would exchange the peso for dollars at a fixed rate to all comers -- and lack the power to bail out either the Government budget or the banking system.
This approach worked in Europe's colonies in the 19th century, he says. And it is now working in Argentina, allowing that nation to shed a century-old reputation for currency mismanagement. Why not try the same in Mexico?
Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Harvard, concedes that currency boards are a plausible last resort, but argues that the idea of putting the peso in a "straitjacket" is premature. Carefully modulated austerity combined with a new honesty and transparency in currency matters, he says, could do the job with less pain.
He had better be right. For that is plainly the direction the White House is pushing Mexico, and Congress is not about to provide the cash for yet another rescue attempt.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Steadies as the Mark Slips vs. the Pound and Lira

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against most leading currencies yesterday as a respite from political turmoil in Europe diminished the German mark's appeal as a haven.
The mark slipped against the British pound and Italian lira after rising to record highs against those currencies on Monday. The pound benefited from an improved outlook for Prime Minister John Major's Government, while the lira was bolstered by better prospects for the Government's budget. 
 "The mark's benefited from a flight to quality recently, but it seems a little overstated," said Steve Timcke, chief currency trader at the Bank of Montreal in London.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.4622 marks from 1.4625 marks on Tuesday. The dollar edged up to 96.76 Japanese yen from 96.75 yen, and to 1.2380 Swiss francs from 1.2375 francs. The British pound rose to $1.5865 from $1.5835.
The mark's weakness against the pound and the lira weighed it down against the dollar as well, currency dealers said. "The crosses are driving the market," said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at Chase Manhattan Bank. Crosses are trades in two nondollar currencies.
Earlier this week, the rush to marks from other European currencies prompted many investors to sell dollars for marks as well, dealers and analysts said. The mark is considered a safe haven because the Bundesbank is seen as a more tenacious defender of its currency than other central banks.
Demand for marks ebbed yesterday as political crises in Europe eased. In Italy, expectations that Prime Minister Lamberto Dini would be able to pass his deficit-reduction package led dealers to believe the lira's fall this week was overdone.
The mark slipped to 1,132.39 lire from 1,135.39 lire late yesterday in New York. The mark set a record high of 1,165.92 lire on Monday.
The pound gained in anticipation of a victory by the Government in Parliament yesterday. The Government later won the vote on a motion criticizing its approach to European economic integration.
The pound rose to 2.3213 marks from 2.3164 marks, where it was quoted late yesterday in New York. On Monday, the pound fell to a record low of 2.2954 marks.

HEADLINE: Late '94 Growth Revised Upward to 4.6%, Showing Wind Is Still in Sails

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The economy closed out 1994 with a bigger head of steam than previously estimated, suggesting it might take longer than expected to moderate the momentum.
But analysts insist that a slowdown has begun as consumers curtail spending in the face of higher interest rates and the damper put on United States exports by Mexico's peso crisis. 
 The Commerce Department said today that the economy expanded at a 4.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, propelling 1994 to the strongest full year of growth in a decade. The quarterly advance was slightly more robust than the Government's earlier estimate of 4.5 percent.
One reason it may take longer than expected to slow the economy's galloping pace, analysts said, is that inventory buildup was much less than reported by the Commerce Department a month ago. Smaller stockpiles on store shelves could mean higher production to replenish supplies, analysts said.
But they predicted that growth in the current quarter would be around 3 percent as the economy heads down to a level the Federal Reserve believes can be sustained without inflation.
"The overall picture hasn't changed," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist for the Norwest Corporation, a Minneapolis bank. "The economy is slowing down. Today's figures only shift the timing."
The Commerce Department also reported that a drop in building single-family homes caused a dip of two-tenths of a percent in construction spending in January, the first decline in six months. Housing activity, which is particularly sensitive to interest rates, is considered an early sign of the economy's direction.
Also, the National Association of Purchasing Management said manufacturing grew in February at a much slower rate than the previous month, and fewer companies were paying higher prices for raw materials.
"The slowdown will be mostly in the second half of this year," said David Wyss of DRI McGraw-Hill, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. "We still have mixed signals for the economy."
Gross domestic product, which measures the total goods and services produced in the United States, rose 4 percent for all of last year. That is the best showing since 1984, when the economy surged 6.2 percent.
The economy increased 3.1 percent in 1993.
Despite the fourth-quarter surge, inflation remained tame, with one price gauge tied to G.D.P. revised downward to show only a 1.3 percent advance instead of a previous 1.6 percent estimate. The index rose 1.9 percent in the third quarter.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, hinted in Congressional testimony last week that the central bank might actually lower interest rates at some point if signs of a slower economy accumulated. The Fed has doubled a benchmark short-term interest rate, from 3 percent to 6 percent, in seven stages since February 1994.
The smaller inventory buildup in the revised fourth-quarter G.D.P. report was more than offset by gains in net exports and sales, which surged 5.3 percent compared with 4.3 percent in the July-September quarter.
The Commerce Department said the economy's annual rate of growth over all was $60.2 billion in the fourth quarter compared with $52.9 billion -- or 4 percent -- in the third quarter.
Consumer spending accounted for most of the gain, led by big-ticket goods such as cars, computers and home appliances that are often purchased with credit.
Analysts said the spending spree was ending as rising interest rates sent borrowing costs upward.

Singapore Sling

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In Singapore last year, 27-year-old Nick Leeson was fined $140 for indecently exposing himself before a group of women in a discotheque. But when he was running up $27 billion in financial-derivative trades that bankrupted a venerable merchant bank, what did the see-no-evil regulators of Simex, Singapore's swinging stock exchange, do? They shyly looked the other way.
"It would be much harder, nearly impossible, to work that kind of conspiracy in New York than in Singapore," says David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. Like Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, he cautions against making the new form of gambling -- the casino-style bets that are made on the movement of real securities and commodities -- the scapegoat for recent huge losses. 
 I have had my ear bent with how wonderful derivatives can be in sharing risk, and how swaps and hedges now bestraddling the financial world insure global traders against currency swings. Wall Streeters pass along dire warnings about "disturbing the cosmic rhythms of the universe"; about regulation driving up the cost of hedging's insurance. And there's quavering in the Quadriad about triggering fearsome credit contraction by slowing the derivatives' merry-go-round.
But it strikes me, after the sudden ruination of London's Barings bank by its Singapore slinger in a simple index-option gamble, that our financial sages are being a little too cool and comfortable.
Gerald Corrigan, former head of the New York Fed now with Goldman, Sachs, has a neat way of accepting Establishment soothing syrup and then pouring it down the drain: "Derivatives reduce the statistical probability of a systemic financial disruption," he tells me, "but with the complexity, speed, interdependence and leverage growing out of financial derivatives -- if you do have a systemic disruption, they would make it far more damaging than it otherwise would have been."
Translation: Although the new gambling may reduce the odds on a bust, it would turn any bust that does come into a global debacle. His Derivatives Policy Group, a suggestion of S.E.C. Chairman Arthur Levitt, issues a report next week.
But too many old guys don't know what the young guys are doing, or how to stop them before one huge loss gets computer-driven into a chain reaction that wipes out wealth, reputation and jobs.
What to do about a danger we can sense but do not comprehend?
First, investment bankers owe it to customers, owners and trainees to do a thorough "values check."
Their economic purpose is to assemble capital and provide it wisely for business development, an honorable service in which they can take pride and make profit.
Their purpose is not to use inside expertise gained from companies they underwrite to trade for their own accounts, while advising investment clients to follow them along and enhance their early positions.
Such "proprietary activity," as this dog-wagging by the trading tail is euphemized, is legal but dishonorable -- the banking equivalent of "honest graft" in politics. If the me-first, corporate-cultural sleaziness of high leverage and lightning-fast shuffling continues to grow, the business of investment banking will gain a stigma that will shame its practitioners and turn away its customers.
Next, in overseeing banking and securities, global exchanges and national regulators need to draw a line between legitimate risk and reckless endangerment.
That means getting the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland (central bank for the G-10), to sit down with the International Organization of Securities Commissions in Montreal to plan now to avert a world financial crisis.
Working with the exchanges and reporting services, these too-sleepy bureaucracies could help set standards for managerial monitoring, public disclosure, leverage and firewalls in the interconnected marketplace. They could stimulate the creation of regulatory software to counter trading software, making transparent to accountants and regulators who is trading how much on whose account and on what margin.
My sources in the bourses say that's how to defeat secrecy in Singapore and combat rogue traders everywhere.

HEADLINE: Think of School Lunch Program as Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The attempt to dismantle the national school lunch program flies in the face of goals usually attributed to the Republican leadership. By any definition, the 40,000 lunch programs around the country are really 40,000 small local businesses. They produce a product, provide a service and operate in a most entrepreneurial manner. Dismantling, or reducing, school lunch financing will cause enormous economic damage and small-business dislocation:
* More than 200,000 school lunch employees will be laid off or disenfranchised. These are hard-working people who also pay local, state and Federal income taxes, contribute 7 percent of their wages to Social Security and pay for their health care. 
 * State and Federal govenments will lose these payroll and income taxes.
* All taxpayers will incur additional expense to cover the resultant unemployment compensation.
* Health benefit expenses previously covered by the employees will now have to be paid for by Medicaid.
* Local businesses, including bakers, meat wholesalers, produce suppliers and dairies will suffer and have to face laying off drivers, warehouse people and other employees.
* Manufacturers and distributors will lose sales of their food service equipment, supplies and foodstuffs, almost all domestically produced.
* Farmers, who have counted on this business for more than 40 years, stand to lose tens of billions.
The proposed $4 billion increase in defense spending would have a more beneficial impact on the economy if spent on the school lunch program.
I urge our representatives to keep the program intact and insure the viability and productivity of these 40,000 businesses and employees and the national economic benefits they generate.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Michael Murphy;
Divine Reinvention

BYLINE: By BOB MORRIS 

DATELINE: SAN RAFAEL, Calif.

 BODY:
ONE of the first things that Michael Murphy did after he bought his Victorian house in San Rafael in Marin County, Calif., seven years ago, was to destroy the hot tub in the garden. That may seem rash for a founding father of the Esalen Institute, which is almost as renowned for its clothing-optional mineral baths as it is for being the birthplace of the human-potential movement that gave rise to the New Age.
But that hot tub had to go. 
 "I took it out because it was so divisive," Mr. Murphy says. "A lot of friends have hot-tub parties, and it always seems like there's an ideological necessity to jump in. But everybody changes in the hot tub. They become different beings."
Depending on your world view, you can either blame or thank Mr. Murphy for all the different beings who are now immersed in the New Age psycho-culture. After all, the Esalen Institute, which he co-founded in 1962 on his family's 165-acre ocean-front property in Big Sur, was a sort of cyclotron for gestalt and encounter therapy, where anthropologists, gurus and teachers of ancient Eastern religion and brand-new instant-enlightenment programs helped to get a generation of Americans into the all-consuming process of self-actualization.
Mr. Murphy, now 64 and a somewhat marginalized figure in a movement hungry for charismatic leaders and best-selling authors, continues to write about human potential. His "Future of the Body: Explorations Into the Further Evolution of Human Nature" (Tarcher/ Perigee Books, 1993) is a scholarly tome that promotes the concept of "self-transcendence" through cognitive, spiritual and physical avenues. "Transformative Practice," a how-to-evolve guidebook written with his longtime collaborator, George Leonard, is to be published in September by Tarcher, and "In the Zone," an updated version of "The Psychic Side of Sports," published by Viking in 1978, is scheduled for July.
In addition, Clint Eastwood is planning to direct the movie version of "Golf in the Kingdom" (Viking), Mr. Murphy's metaphysical novel about a golf coach who views the sport as a door into the higher self.
On this Saturday, Mr. Murphy had got up at dawn to meditate. Sometimes after meditating for eight-hour sessions, he finds himself, he says, talking to God in the manner of Tev ye in "Fiddler on the Roof." Today, after meditating two hours, he had become so emotionally raw that he had broken into tears of joy. Now, he's sitting it the kitchen drinking coffee, trying to avoid looking at an article in New York magazine about New Age New Yorkers, featuring a picture of Marla Maples Trump getting an aromatherapy massage.
"At one level, I cannot judge this," Mr. Murphy says with the thunderhead eyebrows of a sea captain and the enthusiasm of a young Jimmy Stewart. "If people are opened up by these things, great. There's always been a hunger for transcendence in this country. But when I see this," he adds, looking at a picture of Faith Popcorn meditating, "it's like the difference between Mozart and Mantovani. If you've read the Upanishads, it's a long way from 'The Celestine Prohecy.' "
Mr. Murphy is a combination intellectual, mystic and sports nut so fanatical he has had to lie down in the stadium during close San Francisco 49ers' games to keep from passing out. A well-connected good-old boy with a raging curiosity and the natural effervescence of a Northern Californian, he cross-references terms from Hindu, Buddhist, Christian and Jewish mystical traditions.
Call him in denial, call him terminally positive; he's a man obsessed with getting everyone to the sunny side of the street. Zohar, a concept from the cabala (the system of Jewish mysticism), is a word he uses all the time. It refers to the splendor of everyday life. "In this culture of veils and quick fixes, we have a genius for avoiding the Zohar," he says. "So I would say about all this New Age stuff, to the extent that it's grounded and sophisticated, great. But some of it's just yuck! I remember there was a book called, 'Winning Through Enlightenment.' Talk about getting things backwards. To get enlightened so you can make money?"
Mr. Murphy grew up the son of a lawyer in Salinas, Calif., where he was an Episcopal altar boy and later a golfer and "raging extrovert." His paternal grandfather had delivered John Steinbeck, who is said to have modeled the brothers in "East of Eden" on Mr. Murphy and his brother, Dennis, now a writer. At Stanford University in the mid-1950's, Mr. Murphy accidentally walked into a lecture by an Asian-studies scholar, Frederic Spiegelberg. "He said the word 'Brahman,' which means the ultimate reality, the divine, and I was his," Mr. Murphy says. "I took vows to myself and God that this is what I'd do for the rest of my life."
Money can sometimes make enlightenment a little easier. In 1956, after a stint in the United States Army, a check arrived from home ("a great love message from my father," he says), and he went to India to the ashram of Sri Aurobindo, a guru whose belief in ascending consciousness through the integration of mind and body still inspires Mr. Murphy's fixation on the divine.
Back in San Francisco a few years later, he hooked up with Richard Price, a Zen Buddhist. They leased the property owned by Mr. Murphy's grandmother in Big Sur and, in 1962, announced a series of academic seminars on "the human potentialities," a phrase coined by Aldous Huxley.
Esalen, named for the tribe of Indians that once inhabited the ruggedly beautiful cliffs of Big Sur, quickly attracted leaders of what Mr. Murphy calls "the consciousness revolution." Huxley, Gregory Bateson, Alan Watts, Fritz Perls and Abraham Maslow (he coined the terms "self-actualizing" and "peak experience") tested their theories there. Their workshops pushed people to break down emotional and sexual barriers more aggressively than in traditional therapy. Referring to total self-involvement as work was a notion whose time had come.
By the 1970's, with Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, Jerry Brown and Joan Baez, Esalen's reputation became such that corporations sent employees for workshops. Mr. Murphy never imposed himself or any one dogma on the place, discouraging the cult atmosphere associated with other charismatic leaders of the day, like Werner Erhard, the EST founder, and the Rev. Jim Jones, who led followers to mass suicide in 1978.
In the 1980's, long after he had moved away to concentrate on writing, Mr. Murphy set up the Soviet-American Exchange Program at Esalen to help "demystify the Soviets." He assembled leading thinkers for seminars, like Boris Yeltsin on his first United States visit, in 1989.
But from a distance as a trustee who collects a salary, Mr. Murphy now views Esalen, which attracts 10,000 paying seminarians a year, as a place "for beginnings," not for the "transformative" practice he believes will help the human race in its further evolution. "The New Age literature is about beginnings," he says. "But the great task of the New Age is to create a comprehensive vision and adequate practices."
To that end, he and Mr. Leonard, his colleague, have arranged the financing for a "transformative-practice center" in Marin County. With backing from a chain of San Francisco Bay-area health clubs, it would be a kind of maintenance center for the metaphysically prone. Mr. Murphy describes it as a cross between a health club, a community center and an ashram, where no Walkmans would be allowed and everyone would be required to meditate before using the Nautilus equipment.
"I look around and see a wilderness of broken hearts out there," says Mr. Murphy, recently separated from his wife of 23 years, with whom he has a 10-year-old son. "But if we knew the joy we could find by living fully in our minds and bodies, and if we had a culture that encouraged us in contemplative practices, we wouldn't need Prozac. The Ramakrishna said that the winds of grace are always blowing, but you've got to raise the sail."
Later in the day, a fierce wind is blowing, and the sail of a 40-foot sloop is raised. Mr. Murphy is out with some friends on the San Francisco Bay. "We're natural voyagers of body and spirit," says Mr. Murphy, who raises his head to the sky, yells a thank you to God for the beauty of the day. He's big on the value of howling into the wind.
It's one of his typically exuberant gatherings, and the spiritual-socio-political wheels are spinning. A. Lawrence Chickering, an economist, is on board, as is James Ogilvy, whose Global Business Network helps develop "alternative scenarios" for profit-making. There's talk of alternative education; of the strong entrepreneurial impulses of the poor in third-world countries, and of banks that loan money to women in those countries rather than men (men spend the money on themselves, they say; women, on their children).
A flag whips in the wind, and the group sails on, a little Good Ship America of high-minded optimists. As the ship comes about through a puff of fog under a sunlit Mount Tamalpais, a seagull glides past Mr. Murphy's head.
"Michael Murphy and Jonathan Livingston Seagull," Mr. Ogilvy says.
"Oh, please," Mr. Murphy moans.

HEADLINE: Is New York Ready for Nice?

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN 

 BODY:
CRATE AND BARREL, the home furnishings chain that is known for wholesome-looking stores that are filled to the rafters with nice merchandise and pleasant salespeople, is opening in New York on Wednesday.
So how will New Yorkers take to the Crate's brand of small-town ambiance, straightforward attitude and good values? Will a store that sets its tone with acres of knotty pine, goods packed with biodegradable cornstarch pellets and a "don't worry if you break something" approach be too . . . well . . . earnest for denizens of this attitudinal town? 
 After all, even with stores like the palpably pleasant Starbucks coffee bars that have sprouted on every corner, New Yorkers are famously unused to coping with well-trained and helpful employees, pristine displays, stores where customers are occasionally asked to wait outside so it won't be too crowded inside, and so much stock that when salespeople are asked to run to get an extra six-dozen glasses from a subterranean stockroom, they are thrilled. (There will be 15 employees in New York doing nothing but stocking shelves and straightening displays.)
The new 54,000-square-foot store, at the northwest corner of Madison Avenue and 59th Street, will have 95 smiling employees, on any given day, who have been trained to be out-of-town helpful. Thirty-five were hand-picked because of the communication skills they displayed a few weeks ago when they responded to advertisements that ran in Backstage, The Village Voice and New York Casting. Some lines heard at the auditions:
* "Hi, I'm Fleur. I do comedy and drama."
* "Hello, I'm Ivan. I'm an actor and in a ballet. I moved here from California three years ago."
The time seems right for Crate and Barrel. Conran's is no longer in business. The much smaller-scale Pottery Barn stores are busy championing all things well patinated or of iron wrought. ABC Carpet and Home is a completely different mind-set, with its eclectic and fancifully cluttered displays of old and new. Ikea is a destination in itself, a huge warehouse for bargain-seekers more than a cab ride away. And Bed Bath and Beyond is more of a warehouse than a style statement.
But the Crate, as the privately held company is known to habitues, should fit right in on the section of Madison Avenue between 59th and 61st streets: it will be cheek by jowl with the new high-style fashion and design superstores like Barneys New York, which is already established, and the Ann Taylor and Calvin Klein stores that will open this year.
For one thing, it has 33,000 square feet of selling space on two floors stacked with glasses, pitchers, platters, towels, potholders, napkins, straw mats, private-label peppers, chip and dip bowls, mugs, rugs, clocks, lamps, chairs and sofas -- the kind of easy-to-look-at merchandise you either can't live without or at least think you shouldn't have to.
Last year, more than two million glasses and more than 10,000 sofas were sold at the 55 Crate and Barrels that dot the United States. More than 75,000 brides drew up wish lists there. All of that resulted in gross sales of $274 million ($30 million through the catalogues that were sent, in five editions, to 20 million households.)
But can the chain -- described in the Dec. 12 issue of Business Week magazine as having acceptance "on the scale of Santa Claus" -- capture New York and the people that Gordon Segal, the affable owner and president, said the other day were "the most demanding and critical customers in America"?
Since Mr. Segal and his wife, Carole, opened their first store on Dec. 7, 1962, in the Old Town section of Chicago, displaying the merchandise on packing crates, he has fine-tuned, obsessed about and expanded on the selection of products and the way they are displayed.
The Manhattan store, which is to be followed this year on the East Coast by a 23,000-square-foot store in White Plains and a 18,000-square-foot store in Short Hills, N.J., has been four years and $10 million in the making.
"I'm a little nervous: New York is pretty overwhelming," said Barbara Turf, the executive vice president of Crate and Barrel, who for 20 years has been in charge of merchandising and marketing. That may be because although the Crate is considered on the cutting edge in many areas outside New York, some New Yorkers might perceive it as being a purveyor of more basic wares.
Yet, its greatest appeal for New Yorkers will be its irresistibly charming products: all the things one desperately needs when they are within hand's reach and reasonably priced. For example, a glass platter splashed with brightly colored flowers, a black iron Windsor chair, a shapely terra-cotta basket, khaki and white striped towels, a plain wood-handled toothbrush and big sofas and chairs in floppy white upholstery.
The overall mix of merchandise has become softer and -- sshh! -- trendier. There are some thick-wire vases with blown glass, distressed wood boxes in the shape of ducks, even some celadon-hued dinner plates and platters in frosted glass. Mr. Segal termed them "very avant."
"We're going toward a warmer feeling," he added. "If you had said five years ago that we would have tapestry runners, I wouldn't have believed it."
Or fake house plants. So many customers asked about the ones the store used as backdrops that the Crate decided to sell them as well.
Last week, as dozens of construction workers charged about getting ready for an onslaught of fixtures and merchandise, Mr. Segal and some visitors made their way through the subterranean stockrooms.
"Our motivation has always been to bring good taste to the table," said Mr. Segal, 55, as he took a long-stemmed wineglass from a shelf, then showed off a square Italian bowl decorated with fruit, a stack of pudding bowls, a three-compartment relish tray.
"That's $24.95," he said of the heavy glass dish. "Inexpensive we're not, but unusual quality for this value."
Many corner locations were considered:on Union Square, the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side and lower Broadway. The one at 59th and Madison clinched the deal, partly because it was visible from Fifth Avenue and within sight of the Plaza Hotel and could therefore be a tourist destination.
So did the economics, Mr. Segal said. The front footage at 59th and Madison, he said, is "prime and expensive and about $275 a square foot."
"But as you proceed back away from the corner," he continued, "then it's in the $120-a-square-foot range."
"And," he added with a gleam in his eye, "up on the second floor, we're talking about $40 a square foot. All of a sudden that blended rate is affordable. Not inexpensive, but affordable."
While the fancy location might deter bargain hunters, it will certainly attract people who can't resist a striped pitcher; a big cup decorated with blue knives, forks and spoons; a scalloped serving plate in sherbet hues; a lamp with a base in the shape of a lighthouse, or salad plates printed with leafy herbs. They will also be bowled over by the sheer scale of the store as they make their way past mountains of china and down alleyways lined with glasses.
But how does the store prevent people from knocking into the tantalizingly close-at-hand displays? "We don't," said Bette Kahn, the director of public relations, in Chicago. "We want to make it all accessible, to let you see how a glass feels and for you to imagine how it will look in your home."
Mr. Segal is counting on an onslaught of customers. "They change their car, their clothes, but they want their dinnerware to last forever," he said. "We are of the belief that every few years, people should change their dinnerware." And it is hoped, their furniture as well.
Mr. Segal looked around the huge store and said, "Now what we'll need is a lot of happy people."
In New York?

Budgetary Posturing;
Substance Losing Ground to Politics

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The impasse in the Senate over the balanced-budget amendment can be explained by this finding in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll: 79 percent of Americans said they favored a constitutional amendment that would require the Federal Government to balance its books by 2002; but only 32 percent said they were in favor if it would require cuts in Social Security.
With an eye toward those numbers, the proponents of the amendment portray themselves as the champions of fiscal responsibility and their opponents as spendthrifts. Those against the amendment accuse the proponents of planning to raid Social Security and picture themselves as the guardians of retirement benefits. 
 Senators Kent Conrad and Byron L. Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrats who seem to hold the decisive votes, say they cannot vote for any constitutional amendment that threatens future Social Security benefits. The Republican leaders are desperately trying to find something they can offer to satisfy the North Dakotans. Whether they succeed or not, it will have nothing to do with actually balancing the budget.
If this sounds like the triumph of politics over substance, it is. The debate over the balanced-budget amendment is now and always has been almost entirely a question of political positioning.
Republicans and Democrats alike genuinely believe that the Federal deficit threatens the economic future of the next generation and that the budget should be put on a direct path toward balance. But that is not their highest priority.
For most Republicans, low taxes are more important. This is why every Republican in the Senate and House voted in 1993 against President Clinton's five-year plan to lower the deficit by $500 billion by reducing spending and raising taxes. And it is why Republicans in the House of Representatives are determined to push through the tax cuts that are part of their Contract With America before they address the question of how to balance the budget. 
For most Democrats, deficit reduction is not so crucial as maintaining the social welfare state. That is why so many of them are determined to keep Social Security out of the deficit calculations.
Much of what was said today on both sides bore no relationship to reality. Explaining his position, Senator Conrad declared this morning: "It's just fundamentally wrong to take Social Security trust fund surpluses to balance an operating budget."
In fact, the Social Security trust fund is nothing but an accounting device. These surpluses have been spent for the general purposes of government for years. That has made the deficit appear far smaller than it would have otherwise.
Other Democrats chimed in that they, too, were all in favor of balancing the budget as long as Social Security was excluded from the calculations. That is nonsensical, both as an economics and a practical matter.
In terms of economics, the budget runs a deficit whenever spending exceeds revenue. The Government must issue bonds to borrow the same amount of money to finance the deficit whether the spending is for pensions or battleships or food stamps or whether the revenue comes from taxes on incomes or payrolls or cigarettes.
It may be good policy to have money set aside to finance future Social Security benefits. But that has nothing to do with balancing the budget in this fiscal year or any other. When it comes to figuring the deficit, the money in the Social Security account is the same as any other.
As a practical matter, if the Social Security surplus is disregarded, balancing the budget by 2002, as the constitutional amendment would theoretically require, would be near impossible.
Including the surplus, the Congressional Budget Office has calculated, it would require some combination of spending reductions and tax increases totaling $1.2 trillion to bring Federal expenditures in line with Federal receipts in seven years. The advocates of the constitutional amendment have not offered a clue as to how they intend to bridge that gap.
The current surplus of Social Security revenue over payments is so large that if this money were excluded from the calculations, another $636 billion would be needed to balance the budget by 2002, an amount far beyond what even the most ardent budget slashers can find.
To entice Senators Conrad and Dorgan, the Republicans have suggested that they could agree to exclude Social Security from the deficit calculations required by the constitutional amendment sometime early in the next century.
That is what the Democrats fear most. According to current reckoning, the Social Security system will begin running a deficit in 2013. Presumably some steps will be taken between now and then to rectify the problem. But if not, there are only two possibilities: Social Security retirement payments will have to be abandoned, or the Government will have to borrow to finance them.
As for the Republicans, they continue to maintain that they have no intention of reducing Social Security benefits. Maybe not. But they also say they will balance the budget without raising taxes or cutting military spending. Hardly anyone who has run the numbers believes all those promises can be kept.
As if all this were not confusing enough, the balanced-budget amendment was further complicated on Tuesday when, in an effort to peel off a couple of Democratic votes, Republicans agreed to the stipulation that Federal courts would have no jurisdiction to enforce the amendment.
So what would happen if the time for balancing the budget arrived and the ledger was still out of whack? Well, said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican floor leader, the political pressure would be such that Congress would act to close the gap.
That was as close as anyone in the Senate has come this week to acknowledging that politics is what the whole debate is about.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: WELFARE;
House Leaders and Republican Governors Agree on an Alternative to Food Stamps

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
Under intense pressure from Republican governors, House Republican leaders partly reversed themselves today and agreed to let some states use Federal food stamp money to feed poor people in any way that state officials wanted.
Under the agreement, these states could set their own eligibility criteria and benefit levels, replacing the uniform national standards in the food stamp program. Low-income people now entitled to food stamps would not necessarily be entitled to food assistance under the new programs. 
 The agreement is the second major change on this issue by the Republican leaders in less than a week. It illustrates how they have been tugged back and forth by various constituencies as they try to pare social welfare programs established over the last half-century.
In the Contract With America, Republicans said they would replace nutrition programs, including food stamps, with a lump-sum payment of Federal money that states could use as they pleased for the general purpose of food assistance.
On Friday, the Republicans bowed to pressure from farm-state lawmakers and agreed to keep food stamps as a Federal entitlement program, paying benefits to anyone who meets certain eligibility criteria. Farm-state lawmakers like the food stamp program because it pumps more than $25 billion a year into the farm economy. Representative Pat Roberts of Kansas, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said on Friday that it was "the ultimate social safety net."
Then on Tuesday night, two Republican Governors, John Engler of Michigan and William F. Weld of Massachusetts, persuaded Speaker Newt Gingrich to let states take control of the food stamp program if they met certain requirements intended to prevent the misuse of Federal money. To qualify for this option, states would have to dispense food assistance with plastic cards like those used in automated teller machines at banks.
Federal officials have been concerned about trafficking in food stamps, which are now sold in books of coupons that can be traded almost as easily as cash. The plastic cards, which are already being used in pilot programs, create electronic records of transactions, and Federal officials say such records help them detect fraud.
The sudden reversal by House Republicans illustrates two important points about the new Congress. In the current political climate, no entitlement program guaranteeing benefits to low-income people is secure. And House Republican leaders seek to placate Republican governors whenever possible, paying more attention to their views than to the concerns of Democratic members of Congress.
Governor Engler hailed the new agreement. "I was concerned last week to hear that the proposal for a food stamp block grant would not go forward," he said in an interview today. "What was worked out in our meeting last night, while not going as far or as fast as we would like, is extraordinarily helpful to the states. I'm now very comfortable with the progress being made by the House on welfare reform." Mr. Engler said that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey supported the agreement.
But Robert J. Fersh, president of the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit anti-hunger group, said: "This could be the beginning of the end of the food stamp program. There's no guarantee that benefits will be available for needy people, especially in tough economic times."
The Mayor of Detroit, Dennis W. Archer, also opposed the idea of a block grant for food assistance, saying it "represents a fixed sum of money that will not expand as the need expands."
The number of people getting food stamps increased to 27.5 million last year, up from 20 million in 1990. More than half the people receiving assistance are children. When unemployment increases, more people qualify for food stamps, and the payment of such benefits automatically injects Federal money into states experiencing economic difficulties.
The compromise reached by Mr. Gingrich and the governors encourages the use of plastic cards in place of food stamps. Such cards are used to transfer money from a food stamp account to the account of a grocery store or other retailer. Under the Republican plan, if a state had a statewide system of "electronic benefits transfer," it could receive its food stamp money in a lump sum and could set its own eligibility criteria and benefit levels.
Under the new agreement, welfare recipients who find jobs in private industry and earn at least $350 a month could get food assistance in the form of cash rather than food stamp coupons.
"This would allow states to provide cash to food stamp recipients who are working in private-sector employment," Governor Engler said. "That's an important way to reward work. We would not ask them to spend that money on food." But Mr. Engler said experience suggested that people would use the cash for food.
Under the agreement with House Republicans, state officials could cut or eliminate food assistance and cash welfare benefits for adults who refused to work.
Under current law, states can penalize welfare recipients who refuse to work. But Mr. Engler said such penalties were often meaningless because food stamp benefits and rent subsidies automatically increased when a person's cash welfare benefits were reduced.
Neal H. Flieger, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department, said the new proposal was better than the block grant proposed last year in the Contract With America. But he said, "The Administration still opposes block grants for nutrition programs, including food stamps."
In an effort to fend off criticism of the program, Richard Rominger, the Acting Secretary of Agriculture, today proposed legislation to curtail food stamp fraud. He recommended tougher penalties for people who traffic in food stamps and stricter scrutiny of retailers.
Food stamps have been used to buy drugs, guns, alcohol and tobacco, with phony stores serving as fronts for laundering operations.
In a typical case, a food stamp recipient sells the coupons to a grocer for less than the face value, generally 50 to 70 cents on the dollar. The retailer is then reimbursed by the Government for the full amount of the coupons.

HEADLINE: Abortion Clinic Faces Eviction With Eight Years Left on Lease

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., March 1

 BODY:
An abortion clinic here that was the target of death threats in January is now facing eviction, though it still has 8 years left on its 11-year lease.
The clinic's landlord issued "new rules and regulations" on Jan. 11 for the three-story building at 1103 Stewart Avenue, stating that tenants could no longer perform "any abortions or other medical services in any way related to pregnancy terminations." The notice came within days of a wave of anti-abortion violence at clinics around the nation, including the murders of two people at a Brookline, Mass., clinic. 
 A month later, the Garden City landlord sent the clinic, Long Island Gynecological Services, a notice of eviction.
The landlord, 1103 Stewart Avenue Associates, has declined to comment, but abortion rights advocates fear that the Garden City case may be part of a pattern they are seeing nationwide: as the anti-abortion protest movement has taken an increasingly violent bent, a growing number of businesses, hospitals and towns do not want the risk of being associated with abortion providers. These advocates say the Garden City landlord's action may violate a 1994 Federal law guaranteeing access to abortion clinics.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a sponsor of the law, said he had written to Attorney General Janet Reno asking her to monitor the eviction effort, warning that similar measures of economic harassment elsewhere could undermine the law.
"I'm afraid this is a pattern not unique to Nassau County," Mr. Schumer said. "Those who are against the pro-choice movement have not been able to win with their old tactics, so they have decided to try to close down clinics by using new economic weapons. We're seeing landlords, suppliers and even plumbers facing veiled threats and not-so-veiled threats."
At the clinic here, signs were posted on the outside walls on the night of Jan. 7 reading: "Danger. This is a war zone. People are being killed here -- like Boston. You risk injury or death if you are caught on or near these premises."
The clinic has also been the site of anti-abortion demonstrations and the target of bomb threats.
In a letter dated Feb. 13, the landlord gave the clinic 10 days' notice of termination of its lease, citing "the continued performance of abortion procedures."
Clinic officials, fearful that the landlord would seize the clinic, have obtained a stay in State Supreme Court. Judge John Di Noto is scheduled to hear arguments on March 9.
The director of the clinic, Irene Sylvor, who has expressed fear for her own safety, declined to comment on the dispute. Ronald J. Morey, the president of 1103 Stewart Avenue Associates and the owner of radio station WDRE in Westbury, also declined comment. Mr. Morey's lawyer, Gary C. Hisiger, said he had advised his client not to discuss his reasons for trying to evict the clinic. "We are trying to keep this a simple landlord-tenant matter," Mr. Hisiger said.
But Donna Liberman, a lawyer with the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the effort to evict the clinic was "not just another landlord-tenant dispute."
"We are concerned that a lockout would cause irreparable harm to the patients who rely on the clinic for safe, legal and timely abortions, as well as the other reproductive health services the clinic provides," she said. The Federal law, she said, was enacted to prevent conduct that might interfere with people seeking to provide or obtain an abortion.
"A lockout or other interference would constitute such proscribed conduct," she said.
David Rosenberg, a lawyer for the clinic, said he remained hopeful that the matter could be resolved before March 9. "If not, the court will have to decide," he said.
Roger Evans, director of litigation for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the eviction was "an example of the ripple effects that overt acts of terror have on contractors, property owners and everyday businessmen who come in contact with abortion clinics."
"Some may not care about abortion one way or the other but don't want their property harmed," Mr. Evans said. "Others may be opposed to abortion or may be pressured by others to take such action.
"Up until now, we have considered this a sort of sub-form of harassment," he said. "But typically, such as in Wisconsin last year, state courts have held that landlords cannot terminate a clinic's lease in midstream."
The Wisconsin case involved a clinic in Milwaukee threatened with eviction in 1993.

HEADLINE: Singapore Defends Itself Over Barings

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, March 1

 BODY:
Breaking silence for the first time since the collapse of the British investment bank Barings P.L.C. -- a result of catastrophic losses by a Barings trader here -- the Singapore Government defended the integrity of its trading markets today. But it also announced a sweeping review of the futures exchange and promised to enact tight new rules over trading companies.
Singapore's Finance Minister, Richard Hu, told this city-state's Parliament that the Singapore International Monetary Exchange Ltd., where the trading originated, was not at risk because of the Barings losses, which now exceed $1 billion. 
 But Mr. Hu acknowledged that the exchange had borrowed $300 million to cover any shortfall in meeting the remaining open futures contracts of Barings. He did not say how many such contracts there were.
Mr. Hu's statement came in response to a rising chorus of concern in Asia and elsewhere over the regulatory rigor and financial integrity of the Singapore exchange, which is widely known as Simex.
"Our futures exchange is not at risk as a result of the massive losses of the Barings Group," he said. "This is because Simex has a comprehensive set of checks and controls to safeguard the financial integrity of the exchange and those of its futures-broking members."
Other Asian exchanges have expressed concern about the failure of Simex to detect and prevent the Barings losses.
Leslie V. Hosking, the chief executive of the Sydney Futures Exchange in Australia, said in a telephone conversation that "there must have been an element of concealment and fraud that has gotten around the system," adding, "We're as intrigued as anybody to learn what happened."
Because the Simex was modeled on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Mr. Hosking said, he was unclear how such uncontrolled losses could have occurred. But he said he inferred that "there was a clear lack of head office control by Barings."
"They don't have adequate controls that stretch from the Northern Hemisphere down to this region," he said of the firm. "It's happened before; it's not a new story. And as the derivatives market gets bigger, it will be of more concern."
In his statement to Parliament, Mr. Hu did not explain how the 28-year-old trader for Barings, Nicholas W. Leeson, managed to circumvent the exchange's system of safeguards. But he suggested that Mr. Leeson exercised control over both his trading and the back-office accounting operations.
Throughout the 24-day period beginning Feb. 1, during which Mr. Leeson was amassing immense positions in stock index futures and interest rate futures in the Japanese markets, Barings continued to meet each of Simex's increasing margin calls, Mr. Hu said. Margin calls are demands for additional funds to be used as security. The total involved amounted to $128 million, the Finance Minister said.
Some traders here said, however, that margin calls in February would result from deterioration of positions that Mr. Leeson had acquired in January.
Even while noting that Barings met the margin requirements, Mr. Hu contended that Mr. Leeson's "speculative positions were also concealed," because Simex was given to understand that the firm's "open positions were undertaken for arbitrage trading purposes, which involve less risks."
Mr. Hu said that the investigation into Mr. Leeson's activities was not complete and that he was unable to explain how the trader managed to circumvent exchange regulators. Mr. Hu did, however, acknowledge that the exchange had been influenced by the stellar reputation of Barings as a trading house and had not deemed it necessary to limit Mr. Leeson's swiftly accumulating open positions. And because Barings continued to meet margin calls, he said, there were no signs that the firm was in financial difficulty.
A spokesman for the monetary exchange, Charles P. K. Sng, echoed Mr. Hu's comments. "Barings has always been very respectable and up until February they always maintained sufficient margins," he said. "Barings has always had large positions. Their reputation is always taken into account."
Whether Mr. Hu's comments are enough to reassure investors and trading houses remains to be seen. Singapore's major financial daily, The Business Times, has sought to blame almost everyone but the local exchange. "No regulator could have such breadth of surveillance to detect such malpractice," the newspaper said in an editorial Tuesday, "nor would the financial markets wish for one."
But some bankers and traders here said that while Barings itself demonstrated a catastrophic failure of management, the regulatory mechanisms of the Singapore International Monetary Exchange proved woefully inadequate as well.
"How on earth did Simex not know what was going on?" asked a senior foreign banker who insisted on anonymity. "It is rather incredible that a firm like Barings could not know the position it is building up. And it is also incredible that this is not recognized by Simex."
Timothy Moe, the director of research for Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong, said that it remained unclear how Mr. Leeson was able to keep placing contracts even as he continued to lose money.
"It seems that there was some failure either in terms of position limits, monitoring, fraud or whatever," Mr. Moe said. "It is staggering that positions of that magnitude could be accumulated."
Regardless of what Mr. Leeson did, Mr. Moe cautioned, there is no guarantee that other trading houses will not sustain devastating losses just as easily.
"No one is immune from this kind of thing," he said. "You have some very hot instruments that can cut very quickly both ways. What is surprising is that Barings is meant to be this longstanding, stable and successful bank, very much the epitome of British merchant banking. That's what's shocking."

HEADLINE: Think of School Lunch Program as Business;
More Money, Not Less

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Return of Ketchup" (editorial, Feb. 24), on Republican efforts to reform Federal food and nutrition programs as part of our welfare reform proposal, is so inaccurate I can only conclude that it was written without reading the legislation. 
 I take a back seat to no one in my commitment to child nutrition. When past Republican administrations attempted to dismantle it, I worked to defeat those efforts, while many of my Democratic colleagues stood by and made trivial political statements about ketchup, behavior that has been recently repeated.
Speaking of ketchup, I note that the Administration's nutrient standard concept includes nutrients in ketchup when determining compliance with dietary requirements for children. I guess ketchup isn't all bad.
You state that the Republican proposal would give the school lunch program to the states "with a sharply reduced budget," but you fail to note the sharp reduction in paperwork and regulatory requirements, which school districts have complained about on numerous occasions before my committee.
The proposal would replace the volumes of detailed regulations by which the Federal Government micromanages every aspect of how school nutrition programs must operate. In place of those regulations, this proposal sets general guidelines and goals, and minimum requirements, leaving to states and local school districts some discretion in how best to meet the needs of individual and local circumstances.
States and local school districts can make these determinations without Washington's dictating every detail. We also believe that states and local school districts can make these determinations better.
The Republican proposal would increase spending on school nutrition programs by more than 4 percent a year over the next five years. Outside of Washington not many people would consider a 4 percent increase a "sharply reduced budget."
You also repeat the erroneous assertion made by some predictable opponents of anything Republicans would propose that we are "slashing funding" for the special supplemental food program for women, infants and children.
In 1995 the WIC program -- which I strongly support -- received an appropriation of $3.4 billion. The Republican proposal assumes that spending on the same program under the block grant will increase to $3.6 billion in 1996, with additional increases each year. These scarcely qualify as reductions.
The proposal also saves the Federal Government money. It does so by limiting the availability of funds to those children from economically disadvantaged families who are enrolled in family day care homes.
That is the same change the Clinton Administration proposed to help pay for its welfare reform program a little less than a year ago. Frankly, it is political hypocrisy and opportunism for President Clinton to suggest that these same cuts will mean that children will go hungry.

HEADLINE: Dole Hammers on Yeltsin As U.S. Frustration Grows

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, lashed out against Boris N. Yeltsin today, likening the Clinton Administration's embrace of the Russian leader to the Bush Administration's refusal to abandon his predecessor, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The remarks by Mr. Dole, a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination, reflect a growing frustration with Mr. Yeltsin by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and even by the Administration. 
With no prospect for an end to the war in the Chechnya, the secessionist republic, the debate within the Administration about how closely the United States should align itself with Mr. Yeltsin has grown sharper and more acrimonious, with Secretary of State Warren Christopher even suggesting in a meeting Monday with Italy's Foreign Minister, Susanna Agnelli, that perhaps the West should be looking for an alternative.
But Mr. Dole's remarks elicited an almost immediate rebuttal from the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, who said the United States must try to bring Mr. Yeltsin and the reformers in Russia back together. Still, Mr. Lake did not attempt to defend the Russian leader.
Of all the recent criticisms of Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Dole's was perhaps the most surprising. The Kansas Republican was one of the first members of Congress to support Mr. Yeltsin when the Bush Administration was clinging to the hope that the former Soviet President, Mr. Gorbachev, would survive.
"Let me be clear in saying that no one has been more supportive of President Yeltsin than I," Mr. Dole said today at the opening of a two-day conference at the Nixon Center for Peace and Justice here in Washington. "In June 1991, I went to Andrews Air Force base to meet President Yeltsin virtually alone, since the United States State Department believed Gorbachev was 'the only game in town.'"
Mr. Dole said: "The Clinton Administration's misguided devotion to a 'Russia first' policy -- which has turned into a 'Yeltsin first' policy -- resulted in the loss of a tremendous opportunity to state American concerns forcefully before thousands were slaughtered in Chechnya.
"Just as it was wrong to place too much focus on Gorbachev in 1991, it is wrong in 1995 to ignore the fact that President Yeltsin has made serious errors, has moved toward authoritarian rule and has lost the political support of virtually all reform-minded Russians."
Mr. Dole declared that United States policy toward Russia should be based on a "new realism" that the two nations are rivals, with conflicting national interests.
Despite his strong words about Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Dole characteristically avoided any discussion of what the practical political effect in Congress should be.
He did not address the volatile issue of aid to Russia, although other leading Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, and Senator Mitch McConnell, the head of the subcommittee in charge of foreign aid, have called for withholding aid unless Mr. Yeltsin cancels a $ 1 billion deal to build nuclear reactors in Iran.
Similarly, Mr. Dole criticized the Administration's handling of the crisis in the Balkans, but did not mention a bill he introduced in January to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government.
And he omitted any discussion of the United Nations and peacekeeping, the most contentious foreign policy issue of this Congress, despite the fact that he himself has introduced a bill similar to one passed last month by the House to give Congress more control over peacekeeping.
After Mr. Dole's remarks, in which he also criticized the Administration for mistakes in dealing with North Korea and Iraq, the Administration struck back.
Briefing reporters in advance of Mr. Clinton's speech before the same forum tonight, Mr. Lake said, "To state that this is a Russia-first policy or that we have somehow failed to make known our concerns on Chechnya is simply wrong." But he acknowledged that the crisis in Chechnya "has started to drive a wedge between President Yeltsin and some of the reformers," and that it is crucial that the United States try to help "Yeltsin and the reformers to come together again."
In an earlier breakfast meeting with newspaper reporters, Mr. Lake cited Mr. Yeltsin's handling of the war in Chechnya as one of the reasons President Clinton has not decided whether to attend 50th anniversary celebrations for V-E day in Moscow in May.
Explaining why the decision was so difficult, Mr. Lake cited Mr. Clinton's busy domestic schedule, adding, "We are also looking at it in the context of events there -- and I don't just mean Chechnya -- and what our allies are going to do, who is going, who isn't, et cetera. It is a complicated decision."
As for Mr. Dole's charge that the Administration was timid because it had not threatened to veto any United Nations Security Council campaign to lift economic sanctions against Iraq, Mr. Lake told reporters in his afternoon briefing that Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American representative to the United Nations, had informed other Governments that Mr. Clinton was prepared to veto such a resolution.
"We do not need lectures on how to stand up to the Iraqis," Mr. Lake said.
Like Mr. Dole, Mr. Gingrich also criticized the Administration's handling of the crisis in the Balkans.
In free-flowing extemporaneous remarks this afternoon at the conference, he said it would be "juvenile" to believe the United States could have stopped the crisis in Rwanda, praised the Administration for "a pretty good job" in curbing pirating of American goods in China and predicted that it was "possible" that the accord to end North Korea's nuclear build-up would succeed.

HEADLINE: Demands of Simpson Case Land Prosecutor in Custody Fight

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
The long hours that Marcia Clark has worked on the O. J. Simpson murder trial have made her a famous prosecutor, but they have also sparked a custody fight.
In court papers filed last week in Los Angeles Superior Court, Ms. Clark's estranged husband, Gordon Clark, argued that he should have primary custody of their two sons, because her grueling workload was harming the boys, ages 3 and 5. 
 Mr. Clark's filing said that while he commended his wife's "brilliance, her legal ability and her tremendous competence as an attorney, I do not want our children to continue to suffer because she is never home, and never has any time to spend with them."
"I have personal knowledge that on most nights she does not arrive home until 10 P.M. and even when she is home she is working," it said.
With more two-career couples and more fathers fighting for custody, the question of how a woman balances the tugs of profession and family has become a subject of court scrutiny in many divorces.
The Clarks married in 1980 and separated in January 1994. Ms. Clark filed for divorce on June 9, just three days before the slaying of Nicole Brown Simpson, and was granted primary custody.
Mr. Clark, a 36-year-old computer engineer, said in his filing that his children were so starved for affection that when he was with them -- two evenings a week and on alternate weekends -- they did not want to let him go.
When Ms. Clark sought an increase in child support last December, she told the court she was working "a six- or seven-day week for as many as 16 hours per day" during the trial, which could last for months more.
Mr. Clark said she worked similar hours whenever she was on a trial. "There is absolutely no reason why the children should not be with me instead of continually being with baby sitters," his court papers said.
In a prepared statement issued yesterday, Ms. Clark said, "I am devoted to my two children, who are far and away more important to me than anything."
Yesterday, her boss, District Attorney Gil Garcetti of Los Angeles County, expressed outrage at news reports on "one side of a very sensitive and very private issue involving very small children" and suggested that the Simpson defense team had disclosed the custody battle to keep Ms. Clark from focusing on the murder trial.
Much of Mr. Clark's filing concerns his objections to Ms. Clark's December request for increased support payments, based on her need for more child care, and more expensive clothing and hair styling during the Simpson trial. Ms. Clark earns $96,829 a year; Mr. Clark earned $54,586 last year, according to court papers.
The California Supreme Court, like courts elsewhere, has specifically rejected the idea that working mothers are inherently bad parents. Still, divorce lawyers said that the work schedules of both mothers and fathers were often raised in custody fights and that many professional women contemplating divorce feared that their careers will count against them.
Some lawyers, and even some groups that support fathers' rights, expressed concern about Mr. Clark's filing for custody, if it is based on a temporary change in his wife's schedule.
"There shouldn't be a new battle every time there's a shift in the wind," said David L. Levy, president of the Children's Rights Council, an advocacy group in Washington. "Maybe during the trial, the parents, or a mediator, should work out that the father gets more time. But court battles are not good for kids."
Mr. Levy said that generally the recent trend toward shared custody -- the kind of arrangement the Clarks have, with both parents spending large chunks of time with the children -- has allowed many fathers to maintain an active role in their youngsters' lives.
"Fathers used to lose custody because they worked," Mr. Levy said, "but when both parents are working, who gets the kids, the baby sitter?
"In states like California, where there is joint custody, both parents can remain actively involved, which is what's best."
In September, Capitol Hill was rocked by a court decision ordering Sharon Prost, a counsel to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, to surrender her two sons to her former husband. The judge portrayed Ms. Prost as a workaholic, while her former husband was described as a doting father who put the children first.
Father's rights groups hailed that decision as a breakthrough. But many family lawyers and feminist groups maintained that the Prost case -- coming soon after a Michigan case in which a mother lost custody of her daughter because she put the child in day care while she attended college classes -- illustrated how courts hold women to a tougher standard than men.
"In the Prost case, the husband was unemployed for a substantial period, and the kids were still in day care full time," said Nancy Polikoff, who teaches family law at American University in Washington. "If a woman did that, it would count against her. But in that case it was treated as a neutral fact.
"There is a double standard. When I began going through the cases, years ago, I saw decisions where women were penalized for their work, even where the hours were not extraordinary, and their husbands were treated very differently."
Ms. Polikoff said judges should not base custody decisions simply on the number of hours a parent spends with the children.
"Many women who hold full-time or full-time-plus jobs still do most of the work of parenting," she said. "They're the ones who know what the child needs, even if they send the baby sitter to buy it.
"I'd like to know how many men have told the judge they can't stay late for a hearing because they have to get home to their kids, as Marcia Clark did last week."
On Friday, Ms. Clark told the Simpson trial judge, Lance A. Ito, that she could not stay for a proposed evening session because of her child-care needs. And when Mr. Simpson's lead trial counsel, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., said this week that she had done so to delay the testimony of Rosa Lopez, an important defense witness, Ms. Clark angrily responded that she was "offended as a woman, as a single parent, as a prosecutor."

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
Suing dictators (and similar types) here for violations committed elsewhere.

BYLINE: By Neil A. Lewis 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Just as he was about to be handed a degree from the Kennedy School at Harvard University in 1991, Gen. Hector Gramajo was served with papers charging him in a Federal civil suit for his role in torturing people in his homeland, Guatemala.
Clad in his academic gown, General Gramajo regarded what was happening to him as a foolish affront. The next day, when he was served with a second set of papers in connection with the rape of a nun by soldiers under his command, he spat on the process server. 
 A year later, a Federal court ruled in favor of the eight Kanjobal Indians and the nun who sued with the help of human rights lawyers.
The action against General Gramajo was but one recent episode in a remarkable development in American law that has accelerated this year: the use of United States courts to enforce international human rights standards. Federal courts are being used to bring torturers and dictators in uniform to account.
In recent months there has been a series of developments in cases against a former Philippine dictator, a former Argentine police general, a former Ethiopian military commander, a former Haitian President and the leader of the Bosnian Serbs.
The phenomenon dates to 1980, when the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York won a suit on behalf of Dr. Joel Filartiga and his daughter, Dolly, who charged that a police inspector-general of Paraguay, who was then living in Brooklyn, had tortured their son and brother Joelito to death. A Federal trial judge ruled that while torture was indeed horrible, United States courts had no business getting involved when it happened elsewhere. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, in a landmark ruling, said such victims could seek redress in Federal courts if the torturer had taken refuge in the United States.
The principal legal basis for that case and many subsequent ones has been the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789, enacted by the first Congress to punish piracy on the high seas.
If it seems a stretch to sue people in the United States for violations committed elsewhere, consider a scenario in which you are visiting England and are hit by a car; the driver visits the United States and you sue him here for the accident.
Perhaps you could have brought suit in England, but you choose to serve the driver while he is here on vacation. In the human rights cases, the plaintiffs are rarely able to bring suit in their home countries.
The trick is that today's global economy and the attractiveness of the United States means that many human rights defendants come here, or move some assets here.
Last month, for example, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, heard arguments on whether to uphold a suit brought by Edgegayehu Taye and two other Ethiopian immigrants. While working as a waitress at an Atlanta hotel, Ms. Taye saw a former Ethiopian Government official working as a bellman. The former official, she said, had supervised hours of interrogation and torture while she hung upside down from a pole in a prison in Addis Ababa.
The former official, Kelbesso Negewo, was held liable for $1.5 million in damages.
Former President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, who died in 1989, brought himself and much of his fortune to the United States. Ralph G. Steinhardt of the George Washington University Law School has been both an author of an important law review article detailing how to use the Filartiga precedent, and a lawyer in one of several successful suits against Mr. Marcos for human rights violations. The suits against the Marcos estate have yielded damage awards nearing $2 billion.
Professor Steinhardt said settlement talks would be held later this month in Hong Kong among representatives for the Marcos estate, the victims and the Philippine Government, which has taken custody of many Marcos family's assets.
The main criticism of the practice of suing a dictator or torturer in the United States is that even if the lawsuit is successful, getting any money out of the defendants is rare.
But Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights, who has been involved in many of the major lawsuits, said there are other benefits: victims feel better, and defendants suffer consequences. More important, he said, such defendants are branded as outlaws, and "can never come back to the United States or go to any country where we might collect their assets."

INDICTED OFFICER 'SYMPATHETIC FIGURE'
 Even as he announced an assault indictment charging a police officer with recklessly shooting a black undercover transit officer on a subway platform last August, the Manhattan District Attorney called the indicted officer "a sympathetic figure" who had acted after finding himself in a frightening and "very difficult situation." The unusual scene of a prosecutor offering sympathy for the very man he was to prosecute for having shot another officer four times in the back, was one more complicated moment in a case that provoked an emotional debate about race, police procedure and the use of deadly force. A1. 
 Seven months after their paths crossed during a shootout at a Manhattan subway station, Officer Desmond Robinson of the transit police and Officer Peter Del-Debbio of the city police force have lived a nightmare. B3.

HEADLINE: Report From Giuliani Shows an Erosion in Some City Services

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani issued New York City's latest statistical report card on itself yesterday, and it showed an erosion of municipal services ranging from dirtier parks to bridges needing repairs, and fewer inspections for housing, recycling and drinking water.
In releasing the report, Mr. Giuliani highlighted other statistics, however, saying the survey proved his budget policies were working, making the government leaner and less expensive. And indeed the report showed improvements ranging from cleaner streets to more welfare recipients finding jobs. 
 But throughout the Mayor's Management Report there were indications that Mr. Giuliani's budget cuts over the last year -- including the reduction of 14,000 employees in the city's work force of 216,000 and the first round of a budgeted $2 billion in spending reductions -- had begun to strain the delivery of services in agency after agency.
The number of parks and playgrounds rated acceptably maintained dropped to 35 percent, from 42 percent a year ago and 52 percent under Mayor David N. Dinkins. In the Bronx, only 21 percent received a rating of acceptable. The Department of Parks and Recreation, whose staff of 2,900 was cut nearly 20 percent this year by Mr. Giuliani, also fell behind in pruning trees and removing stumps.
The number of fire hydrants broken on any given day skyrocketed to 1,237, from an average of 981 last year, while the time it takes the Department of Environmental Protection to repair major water main leaks has grown to 26 days, from 5 days, and backlogs on sewer and catch basin complaints also increased.
While one of the biggest successes of the Giuliani Administration has been the steep drop in crime, the increase in arrests has strained the legal system, the report showed. The average time between a suspect's arrest and arraignment in court has risen to 29.4 hours from 25.8 hours. By law, suspects are supposed to be arraigned within 24 hours.
Nonetheless, Mr. Giuliani, the first Republican mayor in a generation, used the report to back up his contention that his effort to slash spending and reduce the work force had not affected services as much as many elected officials and advocates had warned it would.
"I think the most remarkable thing about this report is how little effect that all had on services -- not at all the level in which people opposed to those reductions claimed, suggested or argued," Mr. Giuliani said as he unveiled the report in the old Board of Estimate chamber in City Hall.
"To the extent that there are some things that require readjustment, we'll do that," he added. "Some of the readjustments have already been made."
The report, which is required by law and has been issued twice yearly since the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970's, is the first to quantify fully the budget policies under the Administration. The last report, issued in September, covered the 1994 fiscal year, which straddled Mr. Dinkins's last year in office and Mr. Giuliani's first.
The report does not, however, reflect the second and third rounds of spending cuts -- totaling $1 billion -- that the Mayor imposed halfway through the current fiscal year. Nor does it take into account the cuts that Mr. Giuliani has proposed in his budget for the fiscal year that begins in July, which includes the deepest reduction in spending since the Great Depression.
The City Council responded by saying that the report showed the negative impact the cuts have had in many areas and underscored the need for still more careful negotiations between the Mayor and the Democrat-controlled Council as new cuts are debated.
"The statement that the Administration makes that you can cut funds and maintain services is no longer valid," said John H. Banks, the deputy director of the Council's finance division. In the budget ahead, he added, "we hope the Administration will recognize there is an impact."
The report also offered a view of the economic trends in the city. Employment in the city grew by 24,000 jobs between July and December 1994, compared with the same period a year before. The delinquency rate on property taxes, however, rose to 7.24 percent in the first four months of the fiscal year, from 5 percent, suggesting that a growing number of homeowners are struggling to make ends meet.
The city faced still more serious social burdens. The number of people receiving welfare benefits rose 11,000, to 1.15 million, while those receiving food stamps increased 21,000, to 1.44 million. The number of families seeking emergency shelter also grew.
Mr. Giuliani said the Administration was continuing to develop strategies that would streamline services and agency bureaucracies, maintaining or improving services even as he continued to cut spending.
In the report, he noted that the contract made with the sanitation workers last fall allowed the city to increase the average amount of garbage collected to 9.1 tons, from 8.3 to 8.6 tons. He also cited planned consolidations of revenue collections and the permit and licensing process in agencies like the Department of Buildings.
There was, in fact, good news in the report.
The percentage of streets rated acceptably clean, for example, rose to 74.4 percent -- to the level under Mr. Dinkins in 1993 -- after dropping to 71.6 percent last year. The Department of Transportation found that 82 percent of the city's streets were in good repair, but it also has completed far fewer repairs so far this fiscal year. The number of parking meters in working order has also declined, from 99 percent under the last year of Mr. Dinkins to 89 percent now.
The report made it clear that the reduction of workers -- planned to reach 18,000 by June -- has taken a particular toll on agencies.
The Department of Buildings, which lost 8 percent of its 654 workers a year ago, now takes an average of 21 days to examine a new building, compared with 18 days in the previous fiscal year.
A reduction of positions at the Department of Consumer Affairs has resulted in a decline in new investigations into licensing and consumer protection. Similarly, lower staffing levels have resulted in longer backlogs of complaints at the Civilian Complaint Review Board and at the Human Rights Commission.
The staff cuts in the Department of Social Services have also resulted in delays in processing new claims for public assistance, as well as the final approval of adoption of foster children.
One of the changes in the latest report is the inclusion of specific goals and objectives for each agency, providing a sort of benchmark for services in the year ahead. The report, for example, calls on the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to decrease the number of buildings under city control from 30,358 to 27,955 by the end of the fiscal year, by selling or turning them over to private hands.
Chris Meyer, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said the inclusion of such goals would make it easier to evaluate a mayor's policies in the future. In the meantime, he said, the latest report card played down the negative impact of cuts, in part by leaving out some indicators that reports in the past included.
"This report is business as usual: Bury the bad news," he said.

HEADLINE: A G.O.P. Attack Hits Bit Too Close to Home

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 2

 BODY:
Sacred cows, it has been said, make the tastiest hamburger. But Representative Scott L. Klug of Wisconsin may have given his fellow Republicans in Congress more than they can chew with his crusade to eliminate subsidies that have gone untouched for nearly half a century.
From helium reserves in Texas to dairy price supports in his own state, Mr. Klug has taken literally his assignment by Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia to come up with a list of things that Government should not be doing. 
 Nowhere has he stirred up more trouble than in the Northwest, where nine new Republicans were swept into Congress last fall on a unified promise to reduce government. They abruptly lost their enthusiasm for the task when Mr. Klug proposed to get rid of the ultimate sacred cow in their region: low-cost electric power furnished by Federal dams.
In proposing to sell off the Bonneville Power Administration, which provides some of the nation's cheapest electricity to more than half of the 10 million residents of the Pacific Northwest, Mr. Klug argues that the Federal Government should not be in the utility business. Selling Bonneville, and the four agencies in other regions that market and transmit electricity, could bring in about $5 billion, he says.
Mr. Klug has also introduced a separate bill to sell the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest utility. Both proposals, some Democrats say, have exposed a vein of hypocrisy among Republicans who are zealous for every form of Federal reduction except as it relates to their own districts.
"This is a fundamentally Republican argument," said Mr. Klug, who was a television investigative reporter in Seattle before returning to his native Wisconsin more than 10 years ago. "And anyone who is intellectually honest about this has to question programs in their own backyard, like subsidies to the dairy industry in my own state."
The test for Mr. Klug on this issue will be when the farm programs, which make up about $12 billion in subsidies, come up for renewal in Congress this year.
Last fall, Idaho, Oregon and Washington sent nine new Republicans to Congress, all saying it was time to eliminate some of the major functions of the Government. Representative Linda Smith, for example, who defeated a liberal Democrat to take a seat in southwest Washington, has called for the elimination of four Cabinet-level departments and for deep cuts in welfare and support for the arts.
But last month, Mrs. Smith and the other freshmen Republicans from the Northwest put up a solid wall of opposition to Mr. Klug's suggestion that the power agency be sold. Aluminum factories in Mrs. Smith's district, which rely on the Federal dams for low-cost electricity, and residents would be severely hurt by higher rates that would likely follow a sale, she said.
"I've always supported privatization," Mrs. Smith said, "but not if it's going to destroy the economy of our region." She said two-thirds of the basic industries and 80 percent of the residents of her district would be affected by the sale.
Electricity in the Northwest, most of it generated by Federal dams along the Columbia River, costs residents about $1 a day, less than half the national rate, according to Federal figures.
"From a national perspective," Mr. Klug said, "many more people will win if we privatize these agencies. What you've done is given certain corners of the country a permanent advantage. Maybe selling Bonneville would raise rates in the Northwest, but it might reduce rates in California."
By law, Bonneville, the nation's largest power marketing agency, cannot raise electric rates beyond what it needs to cover its costs. It owns about 15,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and acts as the wholesale marketer of power from 30 Federal dams and a nuclear plant.
"The Pacific Northwest is very much a creation of the Federal Government," said Steve Forrester, an editor of a political newsletter about the Northwest based in Astoria, Ore. "Without the dams, which in turn brought aluminum factories, and Boeing, and big-time farms, we wouldn't be where we are. What you had before the dams was basically an agrarian economy."
The dams also led to the decimation of Pacific salmon, which die in the dam's turbines. In trying to restore those salmon runs, as required by Federal law, Bonneville is spending more money per year -- an average of nearly $300 million -- than the entire budget of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
In an incidental way, the fight over saving Bonneville has made Republicans allies of the Endangered Species Act. Northwest Republicans are working hard to weaken the law. But they also argue that no private company would want to buy Bonneville because of the headache of having to restore the salmon. In essence, they say, the law is protecting Bonneville from being sold.
"I don't think you could find a buyer," said Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington. "There are so many complications."
Ms. Dunn has picked one of her first philosophical fights with fellow Republicans in the battle over Bonneville. "I normally agree with Scott Klug on 9 out of 10 of his suggestions," Ms. Dunn said.
She said taxpayers would get a better deal if the debt left over from the half-century of building the dams -- nearly $7 billion, owed by Bonneville to the Treasury -- were refinanced from its low interest rates to a higher market rate. That would bring new payments to the Treasury of nearly $45 million a year, she said.
Two months ago, the Clinton Administration floated the idea of selling the agency but has since changed its mind.
Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, said: "We had a rather angry meeting with members of the Administration. When logic failed, we used the political argument that if they wanted to alienate the few remaining Democrats in Congress from the Northwest, fine, sell Bonneville."
Mr. DeFazio, backed by Republicans from this region, has challenged Mr. Klug to a debate on the merits of selling Bonneville. Mr. Klug has accepted.
"There are certain things that the Government does well and are unique functions of Government," Mr. DeFazio said. "And, it's a myth that people up here are getting all this cheap electric power and they aren't paying for it. We do pay for it. The Government is getting paid back every penny."
Mr. Klug says that, thus far, he has not been persuaded to back down. "All these things are said to be sacrosanct," he said. "But we've got to send a clear signal that the climate has changed."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls to New Low and Fed Intervenes

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve stepped in to prop up the dollar on international currency markets today, in a partly successful effort to halt the dollar's monthlong slide against the Japanese yen and the German mark.
The dollar touched a record low of 94.90 yen today, before the Fed began spending foreign currencies to buy dollars on currency markets in the afternoon. 
 Traders and analysts, seeking to explain today's sharp drop, cited rumors about the investment policies of a Japanese savings institution, large "sell" orders by an unidentified large bank and comments by a senior Fed official, Lawrence B. Lindsey.
Mr. Lindsey told Jiji Press, a Japanese news agency, in an interview late Wednesday afternoon that he did not believe the dollar had fallen to crucial levels against the yen. Electronic news services began reporting on the interview early this morning.
Some traders interpreted Mr. Lindsey's comment as a crucial signal that the Fed would not intervene to support the dollar. But other traders dismissed the impact of the remark, noting that it came many hours before the dollar began to sink quickly.
The dollar partly recovered when the Fed began buying dollars, but then it drifted lower again. In late afternoon trading in New York, it stood at 95.22 yen, down from 96.76 yen on Wednesday. The dollar also fell against the mark, to 1.4435 marks from 1.4622 marks.
David DeRosa, director of foreign exchange trading in New York for the Swiss Bank Corporation, said the dollar remained weak after the intervention by the Fed. "It still doesn't look so good," he said.
Currency traders said the intervention was conducted on a fairly modest scale by the Fed's standards, with one currency dealer estimating that the Fed bought $250 million to $300 million of dollars. The dealer, who insisted on anonymity, said that with the possible exception of the Bank of Japan, foreign central banks did not participate in the intervention today.
By contrast, the Fed spent $2.6 billion the last time it intervened, on Nov. 2, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently disclosed. Today the Fed followed its policy of declining to comment on currency movements in progress.
Some analysts said the broader trend of a falling dollar reflected a growing view among investors that the Fed would not raise interest rates again soon as the American economy slowed. That has made the higher interest rates in Europe seem more attractive.
The Treasury Department asked the Fed to intervene, said a Treasury official who declined to discuss the scale of the intervention.
The intervention today is politically awkward for the Clinton Administration, because the United States is partly using money from the Exchange Stabilization Fund -- the same fund from which the Administration plans to make up to $20 billion in loans to prop up the Mexican peso. The Treasury Department has been trying to reassure Democratic and Republican members of Congress in the last month that there is plenty of money in the $36 billion fund to help Mexico and still support the dollar when necessary.
The expectations of traders for little change in American interest rates were based in large part on comments made last week by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, to the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed might reduce interest rates if the economy ran into trouble. While Mr. Greenspan did not rule out further increases in interest rates if the economy remained strong, his comments were interpreted as a signal that the Fed would not act to do so again soon.
The main effect that economists fear from a falling currency is higher inflation, as imports become more expensive. But economists played down the possibility that the drop of the dollar today against the German and Japanese currencies would lead to rising prices in the United States.
They pointed out that the dollar remained strong against the currencies of some of the nation's biggest trading partners, like Canada and Mexico.
"It's much more accurate and revealing to portray this as the German mark and the yen being strong -- just ask a Mexican if the dollar is weak, or ask a Canadian," said Neal M. Soss, an economic consultant in New York.

HEADLINE: Fred J. Borch, 84, Chairman Of General Electric in 1960's

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Fred J. Borch, who was chairman of the General Electric Company for 10 years in the 1960's and early 1970's, died on Wednesday at age 84 in the Moorings Park Health Center near Naples, Fla.
The cause of death was heart disease, Joyce Hergenhan, a spokeswoman for the company, said. 
 Mr. Borch was chief executive of the diversified products company from 1963 to 1972, when he stepped down at age 62.
During his tenure, G.E.'s sales doubled, from less than $5 billion to more than $10 billion, and its earnings increased to $530 million, from $272 million. In achieving these increases, he chose to make big investments in computers, nuclear power and commercial jet engines.
Not all of them were successful. G.E. has become the largest supplier of jet engines to airlines, but the company abandoned the computer business and greatly scaled back its nuclear power operations.
Mr. Borch was born on April 28, 1910, in Brooklyn, where his father was an electrical engineer with Brooklyn Edison, a company that was later absorbed into the Consolidated Edison Company. In 1918, The family moved to Ohio, and most of his education took place in the Cleveland area.
He joined General Electric's light bulb business in 1931 after graduating from what is now Case Western Reserve University with a bachelor's degree in economics. In 1954, he was named vice president for marketing services. He was named vice president of the company's consumer products group in 1959, and executive vice president for worldwide operations in 1962.
He became president and chief executive in 1963 and moved up to chairman in 1968.
During the time he was chief executive, G.E.'s headquarters were in Manhattan, and Mr. Borch was active in civic affairs as a member of the Committee for Economic Development, the Industry Council of New York and the Center for Inter-American Relations. He was chairman of the Business Council in 1969 and 1970.
Mr. Borch married Martha Kananen in 1934; she died in 1969. In 1970, he married the former Lucia McNutt Lowles, who died in 1992.
He is survived by a daughter, Kay B. Otterstrum of Brentwood, Tenn., and a son, Richard F. Borch of Pittsford, N.Y.; four grandchildren, and three stepsons, David Lowles of San Jose, Calif, Thomas Lowles of Lake Oswego, Ore., and Alan Lowles of Canandaigua, N.Y.

HEADLINE: Accuser in the Muni Bond Industry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
In 14 years at Smith Barney, Michael R. Lissack earned millions of dollars. He advised local governments on bond issues worth tens of billions. And, he contends, he helped Wall Street line its pockets at the expense of taxpayers.
Last month, according to Mr. Lissack, he told his bosses at Smith Barney that he would no longer remain silent in grand jury testimony about what he considered the firm's misdeeds. He was dismissed. 
 Mr. Lissack contends that Smith Barney -- along with other securities firms -- often charged artificially high and potentially illegal prices for securities that they sold to local governments in complex bond deals. The extra markups were a big profit generator for many firms' municipal bond departments in the early 1990's, he says. But, he adds, those profits resulted in losses to the Treasury of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Mr. Lissack said he called officials in the Justice Department at the end of 1993 to alert them to some little-known practices in the municipal bond market.
Since then, he said, his personal life has been turned upside down. His talks with the department were interrupted by a bout of severe depression, a suicide attempt and a divorce. He took a six-month leave of absence from his firm.
In the meantime, Mr. Lissack has received four Federal subpoenas to present testimony and has been granted immunity from prosecution for anything he may disclose.
"I'm ratting on the industry," Mr. Lissack said earlier this week before he testified to a grand jury in Boston looking into bond deals in that state.
Smith Barney denied all allegations of wrongdoing by Mr. Lissack. Robert Conner, a Smith Barney spokesman, described Mr. Lissack as a once "brilliant" banker with personal problems who became disgruntled with reductions in his pay and responsibilities.
Government regulators have not made any formal accusations against investment firms for their role in operations described by Mr. Lissack. But they are clearly interested in Mr. Lissack's testimony about an arcane side of the bond business that they acknowledge they had long neglected.
In contrast, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are aggressively pursuing charges that Wall Street firms made improper payments to local government officials or others to gain preference in issuing new bonds. Last week, Joseph C. Salema, who was chief of staff to Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey in 1990, pleaded guilty to securities fraud for sharing in $200,000 in kickbacks from a large New Jersey bank.
The story Mr. Lissack has to tell is more complicated than straightforward bribery. But it involves far more money than the sums Wall Street showered on politicians.
The handling of the special accounts "has been one of the most lucrative parts of the municipal bond business for years," said Christopher A. Taylor, executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.
According to experts in municipal finance, the way in which Smith Barney and other prominent firms on Wall Street invested the proceeds of many new bond issues accounted for half or more of all their profit in the municipal bond market.
Essentially, the securities firms are exploiting Federal tax laws aimed at preventing local governments from earning too much interest on the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds they have sold. In the process of refunding old, high-interest bonds, local governments put the proceeds of new, lower-rate issues into temporary escrow accounts. Those accounts consist of securities that cannot reap a higher return than the new bonds' interest rates.
Commonly, the issuers buy a mix of ordinary Treasury securities and special zero-interest or very-low-interest Treasury paper issued specifically for escrow accounts. But the securities firms sometimes sold Treasuries to the accounts at artificially high prices, creating a profit for themselves that would otherwise have gone to the Federal Government.
The practice -- known in the industry as "burning yield" -- is illegal only if the prices charged for Treasury notes and bills are unfair. It is Mr. Lissack's contention that securities firms often do charge unfair prices but get opinions from outside firms that they are, in fact, reasonable.
"Securities firms would write the opinions for each other," Mr. Lissack said in an interview. "We even kept track of who we did opinions for and who owed us." He contended that, when he wrote opinions, he insisted on limiting the markup to a single "point," or $10 per $1,000 bond.
While the written opinions were required to satisfy lawyers, Mr. Lissack said, few of them would stand up to close scrutiny. "Few people would look at the numbers to see what was really going on," he said. If they did, he said, they would see that providing securities for the escrow account was a more profitable activity than the underwriting and selling of the new bonds.
For underwriting new issues, securities firms earn roughly $8 for every $1,000 bond. But that fee has to be divided among different firms, which must share their cut with brokers who sell the bonds to investors. By contrast, when a firm marks up the prices of escrow securities, also typically by around $8 per $1,000, it keeps the entire amount.
In defense of the marked-up prices dealers say that the higher prices are needed to protect themselves from the risk that for some reason, the new bond issue might be canceled and they would have to buy back the escrow securities.
Mr. Lissack contended that this risk was grossly overstated. As proof, he pointed to the willingness of dealers to keep their markups below $1 per $1,000 bond for larger, more astute borrowers such as New York City that insist on playing by the rules.
In one case where local government officials did pay attention, they did not like what they saw. A memo on Oct. 21, 1992, by the staff of the Kentucky State Office of Financial Management and Economic Analysis said that the investment firm Lazard Freres refused state officials' request for bids from at least three underwriters and insisted that it be the sole provider of securities for an escrow account. Then, the memo states, when Lazard proposed a price list, a Kentucky official got quotes from another firm that were as much as $6 cheaper per $1,000 bond. In response, Lazard said the National Association of Securities Dealers had investigated the bond deal and had given the firm a clean bill of health.
Federal regulators, intrigued by Mr. Lissack's accusations, say they are increasing their scrutiny of the way money from municipal and state escrow accounts is invested. Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission recently asked the staff at the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board to start making proposals that would require the public disclosure of who is handling escrow accounts and how much they are being paid.
Richard A. Walker, regional administrator of the S.E.C.'s New York office, said the commission wanted to know more about the handling of the escrow accounts. Another regulator, who requested anonymity, said fuller disclosure would make it harder for Wall Street firms to make improper payments to public officials. "When there is so much money sloshing around and being poured from one bucket to another, some of it is sure to spill," he said.
Mr. Lissack said his motivation was a mixture of revenge and a desire to help correct some improper practices.
"I'm doing a Samson -- blowing out of the industry and pulling down the walls as I leave," he said, mocking his baldness and imagining the turmoil his actions could cause. He readily admits that he feels wronged by Smith Barney, which reduced his bonus last year to $60,000 from $465,000 in 1993 and cut back on his duties "so that there would be no way I could perform and maintain my earnings."
"I might as well help clean up the industry on my way out the door," he said, adding that he hoped the publicity he generated would attract a publisher to a book of social criticism he has written and a novel he has in the works.
Even greater riches are possible if Mr. Lissack's information about escrow arrangements in refunding bond deals enables the Federal Government to collect fines against various securities firms. When asked if he has filed a lawsuit under the Federal False Claims Act, which rewards informants who help the Government recover funds owed it, Mr. Lissack declined to comment.
That law pays whistle-blowers 15 to 30 percent of the money the Government recovers as a result of their information. Whistle-blower lawsuits are sealed by the courts and claimants forbidden to discuss them.

Chart: "Turning Bond Escrow Into Big Profits"
 
1. NEW BONDS FOR OLD
 New municipal bonds are often issued to refinance old ones. Usually there are restrictions on when the old bonds can be "called" or retired early, so the issuer may have to wait a while before using the new bond proceeds to retire the old bonds. During that time the money remains in escrow, earning interest.
 
2. AIMING LOW
 Under Federal law, the escrow account cannot be allowed to earn a higher return than the interest rate paid by the new bonds. Municipal bonds generally pay lower interest rates than most other kinds of investments, so the underwriters are faced with the unusual job of making sure the escrow money earns a below-market return.
 
3. MIXING IN SLUGS
 To keep the escrow account's return low, the funds are invested in a portfolio combining ordinary Treasury bonds with special Treasury bonds called slugs that pay little or no interest. Slugs, short for State and Local Government Series, exist only for this purpose, and since they provide money to the government very cheaply, they are a boon for the Treasury. Holdings of the two kinds of securities are mixed so that the yield is no greater than the interest cost of the new bonds.
 
4. BUMP THE BONDS, SKIMP ON THE SLUGS
 The proportion of slugs to ordinary Treasuries needed for a given escrow portfolio depends on the yield of the Treasuries, and that is where the potential trouble lies. A Wall Street firm could sell Treasuries to the escrow account at an artificially high price, keeping the markup as a profit. The higher price makes the yield on the bonds lower, so the escrow portfolio needs fewer slugs to bring its average yield under the legal maximum.
 
5. WHO WINS, WHO LOSES
 Using this tactic, an underwriter might make $8 or $9 on each $1,000 of Treasury bonds sold to the escrow account, instead of the $1 or $2 per $1,000 if the bonds had been priced fairly. The loser is the Treasury, which is denied the benefit of some low-cost money it should have been loaned in the form of slugs. The original issuer of the new municipal bonds neither gains or loses.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Rose 3.8% in January

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
Sales of new homes rose in January despite higher interest rates, while the incomes of Americans posted a solid advance that exceeded increases in spending.
Nevertheless, analysts said the economy was slowing and there was little cause for financial markets to worry that overheating would generate inflation. 
 The Commerce Department said today that sales of new homes rose 3.8 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679,000, the highest in three months.
"It's fairly strong, but it's off the peak," said Cynthia Latta, an economist for DRI-McGraw Hill, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. Adjustable-rate mortgages have helped the market, she said, as has warmer-than-usual weather.
But she noted that another report this week showed that sales of existing homes dropped in January to their lowest level in nearly two years and that housing starts were also down. "We're on a slowing growth track," she said.
Jim Irvine, president of the National Association of Home Builders, agreed. "It's kind of an erratic spike in the numbers," he said. "All the trends indicate there is a loss of momentum."
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.15 percent in January, but have since fallen to less than 9 percent. The rates are still up from less than 7 percent before the Federal Reserve began forcing up interest rates in early 1994.
A jump from 7 percent to 9 percent would add $209 to the monthly payment on a $150,000 mortgage.
In another report, the Labor Department said the number of new claims for jobless benefits fell 13,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 331,000.
The income gain in January, although no surprise, was the biggest in three months. It was more than twice the four-tenths of 1 percent increase in spending.
Analysts pointed to a drop of 1 percent in spending for big-ticket durable goods as a sign that the economy was cooling, even though the durable-goods decline was more than offset by higher spending for services and nondurable goods like food and fuel.
The latest spending data point to "a sharp slowdown in the first quarter," said Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch & Company. "February consumer spending will probably also be roughly flat."
Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the country's economic activity and has been a key to recent robust growth.
Bolstering the new income figures were earnings for overtime and some special factors, including raises for Federal workers and cost-of-living increases that drove up benefits.
The Commerce Department said incomes climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent in December, revised from an earlier estimate of eight-tenths of 1 percent. Spending increased one-tenth of 1 percent in December.
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in January after gaining eight-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans' savings rate climbed to 5 percent of disposable income in December, from 4.7 percent the previous month. The savings rate is the highest in nearly two years.
Income rose to $5.94 trillion in January and spending was at $4.77 trillion.

Bond Prices Drop After Senate Vote

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday, as the market reacted to the falling dollar and the Senate's failure to pass a balanced-budget amendment.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, noted that even if it had been approved, the amendment would face years of consideration by state legislatures before passage. 
 Still, he said, the defeat yesterday sent a message to the market "that the institution that controls the purse strings is not willing to risk its neck to save us from the eight-foot waves of red ink that will be coming in the future." Mr. Chan added, "It is this sobering message to bond market participants that has pushed bond market prices to these lofty levels in recent weeks."
Another negative factor was the dollar's slide against the German mark and the Japanese yen, after Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, told Bloomberg Business News that he was surprised by the dollar's decline in currency markets. Mr. Lindsey rejected the idea that the Fed should intervene in the markets to stabilize the dollar's value, suggesting that the markets should set prices, including exchange rates.
Traders said the only thing that had been protecting the dollar lately had been concern about intervention, and that faded away with Mr. Lindsey's remarks. When the dollar is weak, dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities become less attractive to foreign investors.
Fresh economic data may also have slightly influenced traders. Sales of single-family homes for January rose a stronger-than-expected 3.8 percent, to 679,000, the Commerce Department reported. Analysts said the strong number seemed to contradict speculation about higher interest rates slowing down the housing market.
However, the market largely ignored the weekly jobless claims and the January personal income and expenditure figures, which came in as expected.
The 30-year bond fell 15/32 , to a price of 10123/32 for a yield of 7.48 percent, up from 7.44 percent on Wednesday.
"The economic numbers were strong," Mr. Chan said. "It means we are continuing to get mixed signals from economic indicators, and I think this mix proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the economy will be a little strong in the first half of this year and then slow significantly in the second half."
He said he thought this would reduce the probability of a near-term Fed tightening, though the central bank would still have to tighten at least one more time to insure that the whole process of slowing the economy continues smoothly.
The Treasury yesterday sold $17.25 billion of new one-year bills in auction at an average rate of 6.16 percent, down from 6.59 percent last month and the lowest since November, when it was 6.09 percent.
Elsewhere, municipal bond prices also tracked Treasury securities lower, although few bonds were traded. Investors have apparently begun to question whether the three-month-old rally in the municipal market will last. The short supply of new issues has generally kept municipal bonds from falling less than Treasury securities.
The following are the results of yesterday's one-year Treasury bill auction:

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Deal With Browns? Simms Passes, for Now

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEREA, Ohio, March 2

 BODY:
The white Cleveland Browns banner with the orange helmet was raised to half-staff behind a dais that contained four chairs. The team's owner, Art Modell, vacationing in Florida, had done a dry run on the telephone that was placed on the table in front of the chairs.
Inside a makeshift sound stage complete with klieg lights at the team's practice facility here, the scene was set, literally, for the Browns to announce the signing of Phil Simms, the 39-year-old former Giants quarterback. 
 At 5:10 P.M. today -- 40 minutes after the Browns had scheduled a news conference -- Mike Lombardi, the team's director of player personnel, and David Fishof, Simms's agent, emerged through a back door and took their seats. Bill Belichick, wearing a brown suit -- a rarity for the Browns' head coach -- stood at the door.
Simms was not there.
Then, without fanfare, Fishof and Lombardi sheepishly announced that after two hours of touring the facility and talking numbers, there was no deal. Belichick slipped out the door. After being out of football for a full year, Simms is still an ESPN television analyst. For now.
"I'll take a wild stab at speculating that maybe economics had something to do with it," Modell said.
Apparently, the two sides are hung up over the financial terms and structure of the contract. Modell said the breakdown was on Simms's side.
"It's an honest difference of opinion on both sides," Modell said. "Nothing criminal about what they're doing. They're really good people."
Fishof would not discuss the specific disagreements.
Later, Simms said that while he didn't know if he was going to be announced as a backup to the Browns' starter, Vinny Testaverde, he wanted to meet the news media in Cleveland and tell them that he wanted to join the team.
"Yeah, I am disappointed, absolutely," Simms said, regarding the strange turn of events, after widespread reports and bulletins and talk-show chat about him wearing a Cleveland uniform next season.
It all seemed to indicate that Simms and the Browns had reached a tentative agreement and that his trip here was merely a formality of signing on the dotted line. Simms met with Belichick in New Jersey at a hotel in Hackensack. Belichick, an assistant coach under Bill Parcells during Simms's glory years with the Giants, convinced him to visit the Browns and try to work out a deal.
Simms, who had shoulder surgery last March, thought about it for a day, liked the idea of returning to football and traveled to Cleveland this afternoon on a private jet. Obviously, concrete numbers were not discussed before Fishof and Lombardi met.
Maybe they should have. But the two sides said the visit was nothing more than a feeling-out process, much the same as every free agent is going through right now.
"Phil and I came here to work out an agreement with the Cleveland Browns," Fishof said. "We were here for a couple of hours touring the facility and talking and we couldn't reach an agreement."
Fishof and Lombardi promised to pick up the negotiations on Friday morning by telephone. Simms and Fishof returned to New York.
"Like any deal, some take longer than others," Lombardi said. "We understand the parameters. We have to work some kinks out in terms of salaries."
Lombardi later added: "We wanted to bring Phil in and show him the facilities and talk formally with David. We expected David to go back and think about it."
Fishof would not talk about the financial differences. Early last season, Simms considered playing for Arizona. After a weekend of hot and heavy negotiations, the deal stalled. The Cardinals offered him $1 million a year as a starter. Simms wanted $3 million over two years and he wanted most of it up front.
That kind of money could be stalling the deal for the Browns, especially if Simms wants most of it up front and especially if Cleveland views him as a backup. The Browns signed Mark Rypien as a backup last year and paid him a base of $950,000. Now, Rypien is a free agent.
"Unequivocally our only interest in Phil is as a backup," Modell said. "Just like Mark Rypien was last year. I want to make that crystal clear. Vinny knows that. Bill knows that. Art Modell knows that."
Does Modell, who said he has high regard for Simms, think a deal can be struck within 24 hours?
"I don't think anything will be done within the next 24 hours," he said. "That doesn't mean it can't happen within the next 48 hours."
Fishof said: "We'll work our hardest to try to get it done. There's no sense of there being a deadline."
 
Redskins Sign a Cowboy
 ASHBURN, Va., March 2 (AP) -- James Washington, a safety and one of the stars in the Dallas Super Bowl victory two years ago, signed with the Washington Redskins today.
Washington, a seven-year pro, joins the N.F.L.'s second-worst defense with a three-year contract worth $4.5 million, according to his agent, Ted Updike.

In December, for example, Turner released "The Desperate Trail" on videocassette without a run in movie theaters. The move still angers the movie's director, P. J. Pesce. It also still makes perfect sense to Turner.
Between the two viewpoints lies an interesting case history. A gritty and bloody western, "The Desperate Trail" won Mr. Pesce the award for best director at the Hamptons International Film Festival last fall and earned favorable reviews, if not raves. Some critics said they were reminded of the work of Howard Hawks and Sergio Leone. 
 The movie stars Sam Elliott, who is appreciated by video dealers for his western roles, and Craig Sheffer, another popular actor. What's more, "The Desperate Trail" also stars Linda Fiorentino, who recently won the New York Film Critics Circle award as best actress for her role in "The Last Seduction" and may be the hottest female star in movies today.
In October, "The Last Seduction," directed by John Dahl, opened to acclaim in theaters. Two months later, "The Desperate Trail" appeared in video stores. Mr. Pesce says that film, too, should have opened in theaters. "Turner had no idea who Linda Fiorentino was," he says.
Turner, he adds, was only interested in Mr. Elliott and home video. In 1993 Mr. Pesce was shooting "The Desperate Trail" when the project ran out of money. "I would have dealt with Satan," he says.
Instead, along came Turner Home Entertainment, which bought out the $2.4 million film with, Mr. Pesce says, the stated intention of showing it on TNT, a Turner cable television network. Later, he says, Turner decided the film wasn't heroic or moralistic enough for television and consigned it to video stores.
Turner never pursued a theater release but allowed the film's producers to seek one on their own. Then, Mr. Pesce says, Turner turned down all offers from distributors.
Stuart Snyder, a Turner senior vice president, says the company was well aware of Ms. Fiorentino and other attributes of "The Desperate Trail," but these factors weren't reasons to change plans. In any event, because Ms. Fiorentino's success in "Seduction" and the "Trail" video release came virtually on top of each other, there wouldn't have been time.
"It's great to play Monday morning quarterback, but the planning stage for video comes six months before release," he says.
As a video title, Mr. Snyder adds, the tape ranks No. 4 in number of rentals per cassette.
Allen Sabinson, TNT's senior vice president of programming, says the company's plan for the film was always home video first and television second, with no provision for movie theaters.
"We let P. J. and the producers screen this for possible theatrical distribution," Mr. Sabinson says. "There was some moderate interest, but nothing that made economic sense to us. Whatever possibilities existed, they weren't sufficiently attractive to go off our game plan."
"The Desperate Trail" will be shown on TNT in July, he says.
 
NEW VIDEO RELEASES
 
The Lion King
1994. Disney. $26.99. 88 minutes. Closed-captioned. G.
Without a classic fairy tale to adapt (Snow White's, for example), the Disney team makes up a story of its own about a little lion who grows into his job as king of the jungle. Disney may be no Brothers Grimm, but the vibrant animation more than compensates for the obviously calculating turns of plot. Young Simba (the voice of Jonathan Taylor Thomas) withstands the loss of his father (James Earl Jones) and the schemes of his Uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) to become an adult (Matthew Broderick) and ruler. In the end, this is a film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, "contrived with a spirited, animal-loving prettiness that no child will resist."
 
Sunday's Children
1993. First Run Features. $59.95. 118 minutes. Swedish with English subtitles. No rating.
Daniel Bergman makes fine work of a screenplay by his father, Ingmar, that has strains of other films directed or written by the elder Bergman. Central to this film is the relationship between a boy named Pu (Henrik Linnros) and his loving but remote father (Thommy Berggren), a clergyman and pastor to the Swedish royal family. In rich scenes of country life, Pu and his siblings endure their little wars. Darker are the quarrels between his parents, and darker still is the bond between father and son. What results may not be so novelistic as other Bergman films, but it is "so full of mirrors, so magically placed, that the film manages to reflect the future while also revealing new interpretations of the past" (Vincent Canby).
 
Andre
1994. Paramount. $95.92. Laser disk, $34.98. 94 minutes. Closed-captioned. PG.
With a nod to "Free Willy," this film by George Miller chronicles the adventures of a runaway seal and the hearty Maine folk who love the creature and wait for its return. Little Toni Whitney (Tina Majorino) faithfully stands by with a bucket of fish while her father (Keith Carradine), a hearty harbor master, combs local waters and asks things like "What're you tryin' to tell me, Andre?" Compared to the seal, though, "none of the human actors in this too-too-cute family film has a flipper to stand on" (Maslin).
 
Princess Caraboo
1994. Columbia Tri-Star. $95.92. Laser disk, $34.95. 96 minutes. Closed-captioned. PG.
The year is 1817, and in Bristol, England, a penniless young woman (Phoebe Cates) wearing a turban and calling herself Caraboo is taken into a high-born household on the strength of her claim that she is the daughter of a king. "I know you are an impostor and I spit in your soup," hisses an imperious butler (Kevin Kline). Investigating the case are a dogged reporter named Gutch (Stephen Rea) and an Oxford professor (John Lithgow) who falls in love with Caraboo in a "gentle, charming family comedy, a romp whose strength is in its enchanting cast" (Caryn James).

HEADLINE: More S.& L. Failures Are Seen by Agency

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
The General Accounting Office said today that high deposit insurance costs could lead to the failure of some of the nation's weaker savings institutions, prompting two senior members of Congress to declare that Congress should act to prevent it.
The two, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative John J. LaFalce, a New York Democrat who is a senior member of the House Banking Committee, did not propose any immediate remedies. 
 But Mr. D'Amato said: "I am concerned that another thrift crisis is looming on the horizon. This poses an ominous development for the American taxpayer if Congress is not able to correct this potential problem."
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is preparing to cut bank insurance premiums to 4 cents for every $100 of deposits by the end of this year, but plans to leave savings and loan premiums at 24 cents for every $100 of deposits until at least 2002.
The savings industry's insurance fund has not yet recovered from the collapses of the 1980's, while the banking industry's insurance fund has done so. Officials worry that the disparity between the fees will undermine savings institutions.
In response to the gap, the Great Western Financial Corporation, the nation's second-largest savings and loan, said on Wednesday that it would seek to avoid the higher costs by applying for bank charters and opening bank offices in its savings and loan branches.
Great Western, of Chatsworth, Calif., said that it was seeking national bank charters in California and Florida so as to take advantage of the lower deposit insurance rates available for banks.
While such a move could cut costs for individual financial institutions, it could compound the problem for the remaining savings and loans, since fewer deposits would be assessed premiums for their insurance fund.
All possible solutions to the deposit insurance problem have powerful opponents. The banking industry, for example, strongly opposes any merger of the two deposit insurance funds.
Representative LaFalce said that the solution of merging the funds "might be the best one ideally, but it might be the most difficult one politically."
James Chessen, the chief economist at the American Bankers Association, criticized the idea of a merger. "There's absolutely no justification to asking the banking industry to bail out the obligations of a primary competitor," he said.
The accounting office warned of possible trouble if the F.D.I.C. lowers deposit insurance premiums for banks and not for savings institutions. "The cost increase associated with the premium rate differential would increase the losses of institutions already experiencing losses," the report said. "Prolonged periods of losses deplete institution capital and can lead eventually to failure."
Federal law virtually requires the F.D.I.C. to reduce bank deposit insurance premiums once the bank fund reaches a certain level. The F.D.I.C. estimated in January that the fund would reach this level late this summer.
The savings industry insurance fund has only begun to recover from the financial scars of the 1980's. The industry is shrinking and nearly half of its insurance premiums each year are used to pay interest on bonds that were issued as part of the Government takeover of failed savings institutions. The bank insurance fund has no comparable liability.
Executives at surviving savings institutions say they should have no special responsibility for a problem created by failed institutions.

HEADLINE: A Bad Idea, Buried

 BODY:
The Senate's rejection of the balanced-budget amendment by a narrow margin yesterday provides cheering evidence that Senate Democrats have the capacity to stop the worst excesses of the Republican revolution in the House. The proposed amendment was foolish and fiscally reckless when it emerged from the House; it became a cynical charade through last-minute tinkering designed to secure passage in the Senate.
The amendment was always cursed by a heavy dose of posturing. Many politicians would rather change the Constitution to require that the budget be balanced in the future than to cut popular programs right now. But as it passed through the Senate the posturing became extreme. 
 To win the support of Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and John Breaux of Louisiana, the majority leader, Bob Dole, added a provision early this week that would prohibit the courts from enforcing the amendment. Mr. Nunn demanded the revision to protect the principle that legislators, not justices, raise taxes and cut spending. But stripped of judicial oversight, the amendment became simply a gesture -- an exhortation to Congress to do what it has avoided doing for more than a quarter-century. Tampering with the Constitution simply to play political word games became indefensible.
The amendment, which would have required supermajorities in Congress to approve running a deficit, would have hampered the Government's ability to fight recessions with deficit spending and larded the Constitution with unneeded, ill-defined terms. Rejection was the soundest response.
But voters need not swallow the misleading explanation many Democrats gave for voting no. Instead of acknowledging that they sought to protect programs from mindless cutting, they trumped up a supposed need to protect the integrity of the Social Security trust fund. But the trust fund is not really a fund, rather an accounting device that masks the use of Social Security taxes to pay Government's bills and thereby reduce the deficit. When the baby boomers retire, the Treasury will repay the trust fund from new taxes. The trust fund does not protect retiree benefits or insulate future taxpayers from rate hikes.
Though debate was specious, yesterday's vote made it clear that Senate Democrats can hold together in enough strength to support a Presidential veto should future legislative struggles come to that. The margin needed to sustain a veto is the same that is needed to block the amendment.
Other political ramifications are less clear. Some Republicans savor the opportunity to run in 1996 by blaming Democrats -- especially those who promised to vote otherwise -- for scuttling the seemingly popular amendment. But supporters of Mr. Dole worry that his, and the G.O.P.'s, Presidential ambitions were wounded by his unsuccessful leadership. Meanwhile, Democrats relish posing as champions of Social Security.
With the budget amendment derailed, Congress has no excuse to duck the real work ahead. If it surprises the electorate by controlling the deficit without destroying invaluable programs, then it will make heroes out of those senators who promised to make fiscally prudent decisions without a constitutional gun in their faces.

HEADLINE: House Committee Completes Plan to Overhaul Welfare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
The House Ways and Means Committee today finished work on sweeping legislation to redesign welfare programs that provide cash assistance to more than 15 million people. But last-minute procedural objections by Democrats forced the panel to delay its final vote to next week.
For the last four days, House Republicans have crushed Democratic objections to the bill and voted down Democratic amendments intended to liberalize it. 
 Just as the panel was about to vote, two of its most liberal Democratic members, Representatives Jim McDermott of Washington and Pete Stark of California, raised a point of order, demanding an opportunity to review the actual text of the legislation before voting on it. They cited a House rule that says proposals must be "reduced to writing on the demand of any member."
Until that moment, the committee had been working from a detailed description of the bill, not from the formal legislative language, many details of which are incomprehensible to laymen.
The chairman of the committee, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, banged his gavel in an effort to silence Mr. Stark so the vote could proceed. Another Republican threatened to call the sergeant-at-arms. Mr. Stark said the Republicans were using tactics reminiscent of Nazi Germany to ram the bill through the committee.
Ultimately, by voice vote, the committee instructed staff lawyers to prepare legislative language to carry out the policy decisions made by the panel in the last four days.
Mr. Archer said later that the protest reflected "the dying hysteria of Democrats attempting to defend the welfare state."
In an interview, Mr. Stark said the chairman was thin-skinned and unsure of the rules because he was "a little new at presiding" over the committee. Moreover, Mr. Stark said that Mr. Archer "was in a hurry to ram this through because he has a schedule handed down" by Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Mr. Archer said the committee's vote on the bill next week would be perfunctory because "our work has all been done."
The bill, a major element of the Republicans' Contract With America, would abolish the program of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, under which people are entitled to benefits if they meet certain eligibility criteria. States would get a lump sum of cash, or block grant, which they could use in any way they wanted to assist low-income people. Families now entitled to welfare benefits would not necessarily be entitled to assistance under the bill. The block grant would be set at $15.3 billion a year, the amount spent by the Federal Government for welfare benefits in 1994, with no allowance for changes in population or the economy.
In a rare moment of bipartisan agreement, the committee today endorsed tough new measures to force fathers to meet their child-support obligations. Democrats said they had prodded Republicans to include these measures in the bill. Administration officials and members of Congress said the changes would revolutionize enforcement of child-support orders.
"It's very easy now for the noncustodial parents to avoid child-support obligations, especially if they live in a different state" from the children, said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland. "This bill makes clear that child support is a national priority."
While deploring other parts of the bill, Elisabeth Hirschhorn Donahue, a lawyer at the National Women's Law Center, said the provisions on child support were "an enormous victory for mothers and children."
Under the bill, the Federal Government would establish a nationwide system to match child-support orders with records showing the locations of all people hired by public or private employers after Oct. 1, 1997. Using such information, a state where a mother and child reside could send an order to the father's employer requiring the employer to deduct child-support payments from the father's wages. Some parents now escape child-support obligations when they change jobs because the orders do not follow them.
The same procedures could be used to make women pay child support for youngsters living with their fathers. But more than 80 percent of the children in single-parent households live with their mothers, Ms. Donahue said.
The Ways and Means Committee rejected a Democratic proposal that would have required states to suspend or restrict drivers' licenses and professional licenses of parents who refused to pay child support.
The welfare bill would prohibit the use of Federal money to provide cash assistance to legal immigrants, unmarried mothers under the age of 18 and children born to women already on the welfare rolls. Representative Harold E. Ford, Democrat of Tennessee, said these provisions were "mean and cruel" because they punished youngsters for the parents' behavior.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would save the Government more than $30 billion over five years, mainly by denying cash benefits to immigrants and to several hundred thousand children who were previously found to have mental or physical disabilities.
Republicans say there is overwhelming evidence of abuse in the disability program, known as Supplemental Security Income. Democrats say the proposed remedy goes far beyond any abuse and will cause hardship for children with disabilities like mental retardation and cerebral palsy.
The Senate Finance Committee will begin hearings on welfare next week. Mr. Archer said he had not discussed the House bill with the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon.
The ranking Democrat on the Senate panel, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, has said he will fight the House bill because he regards it as "an attack on Social Security," and he notes that cash assistance for poor children was part of the original Social Security law in 1935.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the President's News Conference

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Following are President Clinton's opening statement at a news conference the President held today at White House and excerpts from his exchanges with reporters, as transcribed by the Federal News Service:
Good afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, now that the vote on the balanced-budget amendment has passed, it is time for Congress to go forward, to write a disciplined budget that brings the deficit down, cuts unnecessary Government spending and continues to invest in our future. 
 Two years ago, 27 days after I became President, I presented such a budget to the Congress. It has succeeded in reducing our deficit by over $600 billion while still increasing our investment in our children, in education and in our economic growth.
As of today, it has been 58 days since the new Republican majority took office. Congress has a deadline for passing a budget resolution of April the 15th. The American people now are entitled to see this work go forward. When the Congress proposes their budget and passes their resolution, of course I will work with them. As I have said repeatedly, we can get more deficit reduction and responsible health care reform, but I learned last year that that is clearly something we must do working together with both parties.
The debate that is going on in Washington today is about more, obviously, than simply the deficit and the budget, it is also about the role of Government, and you can see it running through every issue, from the laws being debated now in the Congress to the question of the rescission legislation before the Congress. The old Washington view, I think it's fair to say, is that the Federal Government could provide solutions to America's problems. The Republican Contract view reflects in many cases an outright hostility to governmental action, although in some cases a curious willingness to increase the Federal Government's control over our daily lives. My view, what has loosely been called the new Democratic view or the New Covenant view, is to be skeptical of Government but to recognize that it has a role in our lives and a partnership role to play.
We have made the Government smaller. We have given more power to states and localities and to private citizens. Our proposals would further accelerate those trends. We have, as you learned here in this room just a few days ago, been working for months on a serious effort to reduce the burden of unnecessary regulation. But we believe Government has important work to do, to expand opportunity, to give people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives, to enhance our security. That's why we support adding 100,000 police. That's why we support more affordable college loans. That's why we supported the family-leave bill. That's why I support the minimum wage legislation now before Congress, and why I do not want to reduce our investment in education in our future.
The Republicans now have proposed to cut education, nutritional help for mothers and school children, anti-drug efforts in our schools, and other things which to me appear to target children in order to pay for tax cuts for upper-income Americans. I do not believe that that is consistent with our interests as we build America into the 21st century and we move into this new global economy.
So my job, it seems to me, is to continue to push my view, what I believe is the essence of the New Covenant: More opportunity. More responsibility. Reform welfare, but don't punish people. Require work. This is the sort of thing we need more of. And I look forward to this debate. I think it's healthy, I think it's good for the American people. And I would like to begin now by answering your questions.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Mr. President, did you try to talk Senator Campbell out of jumping ship? What does it portend for the Democratic Party? And what does it mean in terms of your leadership?
A. Well I talked to him this morning because he called the White House and said he wanted to talk to me, and so I called him. And we had a good conversation. And he pointed out that he had voted with me over 80 percent of the time in the last two years, that he essentially supported our economic policies, our education policies and our social policies, and that he would not change that. It was obvious to me that there were some Colorado-specific factors at work. I wish he hadn't done it. I think it was a mistake. But I hope he will continue to vote in the way he has in the past. . . .
Q. Mr. President, forgive me for pressing you on this, but if I'm not mistaken, you have always been in favor of affirmative action and, in fact, you have practiced it. Why now the hesitation?
A. I'm glad you asked. I have always practiced it, but let's look at how I practiced it. Look at my court -- look at my appointments to the Federal bench, ones for which, I might add, I've been regularly and roundly attacked for trying to achieve diversity here in this community.
I read something in the paper about once a month, people jumping on me because I've appointed more women and more minorities to the Federal bench than my predecessors combined at this point in our terms -- my last three predecessors combined. "And oh, by the way," they sometimes say, "his appointees also have the highest rating from the American Bar Association of the last three Presidents."
I have practiced affirmative action here the way that I perceive the United State military has practiced it. I have made an extra effort to look for qualified candidates who could serve with distinction and make a contribution to this country and make the Federal bench reflective of the American population. I have not done it with any quota system in mind, and I have not guaranteed anybody a job. I have made an extra effort to do that. The military starts before that -- they have made an extra effort to develop the capacities of people who come to them with great raw ability, but maybe a disadvantaged background.
Is that wrong? I don't think it is, and I'm not backing off of that. The question is -- here is the narrow question -- the question is: If we're not for quotas in results, and we are for developing everybody's capacities, what do we do with all those rules and regulations and laws that really are in a gray area. . . . I want to review those. I do not want to see us stop trying to develop the abilities of all Americans. I do not want to see us move away from trying to concentrate our resources in the areas of greatest need. But I would say again I think most minorities have been helped most by the programs in this country that have been targeted toward broad-based needs.
And ironically, if you go back to the beginning of this whole affirmative-action debate, it started in the late 60's and many civil rights leaders at the time argued against affirmative-action programs because they thought we'd wind up in the debate we are now having 25 years later. I think we need to look at the programs, look at the facts, and ask the questions I just asked. How does this work, is it fair, is it necessary, is there an alternative way to achieve the objective?
But in terms of taking aggressive initiatives to develop the capacities of people, should we keep doing that? You bet we should. How should we do it in the law? That's the question.
Q. Mr. President, returning to the issue of Russia, given the continued fighting in Chechnya and the apparent stall in Russian reforms, can you give us some measure of your confidence level in Boris Yeltsin, or your lack of confidence? And how do you read his failure to conclude this situation in Chechnya?
A. I think it's obviously a very difficult problem for him, and I think that -- you know, I hesitate to comment on it in great detail because I'm not sure that I know everything there is to know about it. . . .
Now, I believe that he has made the major policy decisions there. I think that he is in control of the policy there and I have dealt directly with him in urging a change and a moderation of policy there and I will continue to do that. And my confidence level in him is strong. If you ask me, do I think he is still the effective president of Russia and is he making those decisions, yes that's what I believe is the case.
Q. Back on politics, the -- you say it's too early for you to become consumed by re-election? It might not be too early for someone within the Democratic party who might choose to challenge you. Do you expect a challenge from within your own party, and do you think that would be destructive for Democrats?
A. Well, I don't expect it. I don't not expect it. I don't know what will happen. I hope there won't be one, I think it would be a mistake for the Democratic Party. . . .
The country's better off than it was two years ago. I get tickled -- I laugh every time I see one of my Republican -- one of the Republican aspirants -- they have a big fund-raiser and they give them a bunch of money because a lot of them are angry that we raised income taxes on the top 1.2 percent of people to bring the deficit down, but I'll bet you everybody going to those fund-raisers for those Republicans is doing better under our economic policies in the last two years than they were before.
So, my job is just to do the best job I can, reward work, support families and communities, offer opportunity, demand responsibility in these changes and keep moving forward.
That's what I'm going to do. And this is a difficult, tumultuous time, but this country is doing better, and I am determined to keep fighting for the interest and the values of middle class people and I'm going to let the election take care of itself, as I believe it will.

HEADLINE: House Endorses Deep Cutbacks In Regulations

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
The House of Representatives today completed its work on a series of antiregulatory measures, bundled them into a package with enormous implications for the current system of Federal environmental controls, and sent it to an uncertain fate in the Senate.
The package, which passed on a vote of 277 to 141, would temporarily suspend most new regulations; subject proposed rules on health, safety and environmental protection to elaborate scientific reviews; override the health considerations in existing laws with economic calculations of regulatory costs and benefits; compensate private landowners when regulations reduce their property values, and generally honor the Republicans' promise to roll back Federal regulations, a centerpiece of their 1994 campaign manifesto, the Contract With America. 
 Even if only some of those provisions survive the political fight that lies ahead, they would considerably limit the Clinton Administration's powers to enforce many statutes, from the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act to the Endangered Species Act and the Superfund law on cleaning up toxic wastes.
While the bill's sponsors, flanked by representatives of major business groups, celebrated by ceremoniously snipping a ribbon of red tape from a mock-up of the Statue of Liberty, its opponents, nursing the worst wounds the environmental movement has suffered in years, hoped the bleeding could be staunched in the Senate.
There, committees are still reviewing the implications of what the House has done in the last two weeks, and Democrats are still considering whether to continue the tactics of prolonged debate and parliamentary maneuver that they have relied on so far this year.
Even the most ardent supporters of the Republican regulatory program concede that it will probably be moderated in the Senate. And Administration officials said they hoped the moderation would be adequate to stave off a veto of the anti-regulatory package.
The House Speaker, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said, "What you'll find, I think, as we negotiate with the Senate and as this thing goes to hearings in the Senate, is we'll find a common ground which will create more respect for private property while still maintaining the vast bulk of the Government's powers to save the environment and to insure public safety and public health."
The House strengthened its hand by bundling all the major antiregulation measures it has approved into a single package. That way, if the Senate passes only part of the package, the House negotiators will be able to try to restore the missing elements in a conference committee where differences between the two houses would be resolved.
The last of the series, a bill to pay landowners when their property values are reduced because development is blocked to preserve wetlands or endangered species, passed by a vote of 277 to 148. In an amendment, the House raised the threshold for claiming compensation to situations in which land declined in value by at least 20 percent because its use was regulated.
Even so, the measure opens up the prospect of incalculable cost to the Government for compensating landowners unless regulatory agencies decide not to enforce laws like the Clean Water Act or the Endangered Species Act, which are already on the books and under which the courts can demand regulatory actions.
The prospective costs of the legislation, which have not yet been estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, raised the possibility that budget rules could be raised as an objection to such a bill coming before the Senate.
The Budget Act requires that Congress finance new expenditures either by offsetting spending cuts or tax increases. The House Rules Committee waived those provisions but, under Senate rules, they can only be waived with the approval of 60 senators.
For the next week or two, parliamentary maneuvering could well be the only action on the deregulatory bills in the Senate. The decisions by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, will be especially important to the eventual outcome in the case of the risk-assessment and cost-benefit bill, the most comprehensive of the antiregulation measures passed by the House.
There are competing versions of similar legislation working their way through the Senate. One of them, a less sweeping measure sponsored by a Delaware Republican, Senator William V. Roth Jr., would probably be acceptable if enacted, Administration officials said, especially if it could be softened a bit.
But another version, sponsored by Senator Dole, would probably be vetoed; it more closely resembles the bill that passed the House, which the Administration says would effectively roll back the health protections contained in a generation of environmental laws.
With its antiregulation agenda out of the way, the House is moving quickly on other bills to reverse environmental priorities of the past.
On Wednesday, the House Appropriations Committee adopted a measure that would greatly increase logging on Federal land, maintaining that this would be a good way to prevent overgrown forests from being destroyed by fire or pests.
Lawmakers in both the House and the Senate who support the logging industry are pushing the proposal, but environmental groups oppose it because it limits their rights to review and appeal logging plans.
The bill would increase immediately by about three billion board feet a year the amount of timber salvaged from areas deemed unhealthy by the Forest Service, a part of the Department of Agriculture. The Administration favors an increased harvesting of timber on overgrown public lands but opposes the idea of fixing targets for the timber harvest or suspending the application of environmental laws to permit more logging.
Proponents of the bill are trying to increase logging by recalling the catastrophic wildfires of recent years. They contend that the best way to head off future conflagrations is to thin out the forests, especially in areas where many trees are already dead or dying. Opponents say this would open roadless areas to new logging, increasing erosion and stream damage.
 
THE BILL AT A GLANCE
Antiregulation
 
BILL Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act (H.R. 9)
 
HIGHLIGHTS The bill combines antiregulatory measures that would temporarily suspend most new regulations; subject proposed rules on health, safety and environmental protection to elaborate scientific reviews; override the health considerations in existing laws with economic calculations of regulatory costs and benefits; compensate private landowners when regulations reduce their property values, and generally honor the Republican promise to roll back Federal regulations.
 
POLITICS Restricting Government regulation, a favorite measure among business groups, is a cornerstone of the Republicans' Contract With America, and some Democrats endorse the idea as well. But environmentalists -- and many Democrats -- say the legislation goes too far.
 
COST Impossible to calculate, but if the Government continued to issue regulations, could be enormous.
 
STATUS
 
 House: Passed on Friday.
 
 Senate: Comparable measure is under consideration by several committees.
 
 White House: Has threatened a veto, saying the legislation would roll back a generation of environmental progress.

Markets
 
The dollar continued to slide despite a concerted effort by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and European central banks to prop up the value of the currency. Even strong words from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin proved no match for a wave of speculation against the dollar, which tumbled to another record low against the Japanese yen. [Page 33.]
 
Stocks advanced, despite the weak dollar. Technology stocks, including I.B.M., led the rally. The S.& P. 500 rose 0.29 point. [34.]
 
The falling dollar dragged down Treasury prices. The dollar's slide raised fears that the Federal Reserve might be compelled to raise short-term interest rates to support the currency. [44.]
 
Copper prices surged on signs of strong European demand. [43.]
 
 
International
 
Britain began an inquiry into whether the collapse of Barings was a result of fraud that reached into its headquarters. The investigation opened as talks continued between bankruptcy administrators and ING over the sale of the investment firm. [33.]
 
Japan's securities industry is battling its bleakest period in recent history. Indeed, with sharp job cutbacks and slumping stocks, the industry is facing the possibility that it may be hollowing out. [33.]
 
Mexico seized the nation's eighth-largest bank, Banpais, in the first such takeover since its financial crisis began. [45.]
 
 
Companies
 
A Mercedes-Benz executive praised American auto makers as the world's most efficient manufacturers. The chief of Mercedes-Benz's car operations, Jurgen Hubbert, said that he no longer looked to Japan for guidance, as he did in the 1980's. [33.]
 
Intuit disclosed new flaws in some of its tax programs. The company notified users of its Connecticut and Indiana state tax programs of possible errors. The disclosure came after Intuit said some users of its Turbotax and Macintax programs might be affected by minor flaws in the tax preparation software. [33.]
 
National Gypsum rejected a $1.12 billion takeover bid from BPB Industries of Britain. Analysts expect the bidding for National Gypsum to intensify, and its shares rose sharply. [35.]
 
An Italian eyewear maker offered $1.12 billion for U.S. Shoe, the parent of Lenscrafters, the largest American optical chain. [35.]
 
Beneficial National Bank dropped a lawsuit against the I.R.S. [35.]
 
Ford Motor posted strong sales of light trucks in February. Ford said its results showed that the market remained firm. [35.]
 
Losses are seen for the brokerage firms that did business with the bankrupt Adler Coleman & Company. But most of the 60,000 customer accounts are likely to find new homes next week. [45.]

 
The Economy
 
The Government's chief forecasting gauge indicated a slowdown ahead. The index of leading indicators was flat in January. In a separate report, factory orders rose a modest 0.6 percent. [45.]
 
 
Your Money
 
A foreign fund has managed to avoid financial trouble spots like Japan and Mexico. The iconoclastic approach has produced stellar returns for the fund, GAM International. [32.]
 
Rising yields should not tempt investors to put money for retirement into money market accounts and bank deposits. Advisers warn that the yields are still low for long-term growth. [32.]

HEADLINE: Mexican Government Seizes Banking Company

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 3

 BODY:
Mexican authorities today seized the company that owns the country's eighth-largest bank, Banpais, citing "irregularities."
 The Finance Ministry said it took over Grupo Financiero Asemex-Banpais S.A., known as Banpais, after the company's banking and insurance units failed to meet capital and reserves requirements. 
 The takeover is the first of a banking company since Mexico's crisis began on Dec. 20, when the peso was devalued. The intervention also represents the first time the Government has taken over a bank that has shares traded in markets abroad.
 American depository receipts of Banpais have traded on the New York Stock Exchange since last June. Today, the A.D.R.'s fell 6.25 cents, to 68.75 cents. Each A.D.R. represents six shares.
 Mexican banks have faced intense pressures in recent months as the peso tumbles and interest rates soar, making it more difficult for businesses, homeowners and farmers to make loan payments. The size of Mexico's bad loans is expected to grow rapidly in coming months, stretching many banks' already weak financial condition. If weaker banks go under, more Government interventions are likely, worsening the nation's recession and swelling the current-account deficit despite the financial rescue package orchestrated by the United States.
 Banpais's banking unit had been seen by analysts as particularly vulnerable. Indeed, the Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered its crediting rating on Banpais's foreign-currency debt twice in the last two months.
 "The downgrade reflects Banpais's vulnerability to the heightened risk confronting the Mexican banking industry caused by tightened liquidity and the recession," S.&.P said in its most recent revision.
 In announcing today's seizure, the Government said that regulators had "detected that Banpais had irregularities, such as lack of capital and reserves, that put in jeopardy its financial health and operation."
 Regulators also discovered a lack of sufficient technical reserves and capital at the company's two insurance companies. Banpais owns the nation's fourth-largest insurance company, Aseguradora Mexicana S.A
 The Government said its bank insurance fund would protect depositors and creditors.
 The Government also ousted the management of the bank and insurance companies.

HEADLINE: Whitewater Counsel Is Urged to Investigate Hiring of Ex-Justice Official's Wife

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
A Republican Senator has asked the Whitewater independent counsel to investigate the White House's role in a decision by the Interior Department to reinstate the wife of former Associate Attorney General Webster L. Hubbell to a political job.
Last year Mr. Hubbell's wife, Suzanna, took an unpaid leave from her job as special assistant to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt after Mr. Hubbell left the Justice Department to defend himself in the Whitewater investigation. 
 She was reinstated last month to a comparable job, at an annual salary of $59,022, after the department received a telephone call at her request from Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel.
In December, Mr. Hubbell pleaded guilty to two felony counts of mail fraud and tax evasion, and is to be sentenced next month by a Federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., for stealing $396,000 from his Arkansas law firm. As part of a plea agreement, he promised to assist the counsel's office in its investigation of President Clinton's personal and campaign finances.
Last Tuesday one of Mr. Clinton's bankers, Neal R. Ainley, was indicted on charges that he conspired to violate Federal banking laws in a scheme that also involved Mr. Lindsey, who was the treasurer of Mr. Clinton's 1990 re-election campaign as Governor of Arkansas.
Mr. Lindsey, who has said he did nothing improper, has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He and the Hubbells have been friends for many years.
But his role in the re-appointment of Mrs. Hubbell was criticized by Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, who wrote a letter this week to the Whitewater prosecutors asking that the incident be investigated to determine if it suggested witness tampering and obstruction.
Officials at the White House and the Interior Department presented slightly different accounts of how Mrs. Hubbell happened to be re-employed. But by both accounts, Mr. Lindsey played no significant role.
Abner J. Mikva, the White House counsel, said today that there was nothing improper with Mrs. Hubbell's return to the Interior Department. He said that shortly after she applied to return to the department it contacted Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, who then asked the counsel's office to review the appointment. It found no legal or ethics restrictions to her re-hiring.
"It was handled absolutely by the book," Mr. Mikva said.
He said that on Feb. 6, Mr. Lindsey placed a telephone call to B. J. Thornberry, Mr. Babbitt's deputy chief of staff, at the request of Mrs. Hubbell after it appeared to her that the appointment might be delayed. But, Mr. Mikva said, by the time Mr. Lindsey placed the call the re-appointment had already been cleared by the counsel's office.
"Bruce made one phone call, was told it had already been worked out, said, 'Thank you very much' and he hung up," Mr. Mikva said.
Kevin J. Sweeney, a spokesman for the Interior Department, gave a slightly different version of events. He said Mrs. Hubbell had told officials in January that she would like to resume her job on Feb. 6. He said department officials had tried several times to get clearance from the White House, but their calls were not returned.
Mr. Sweeney said that Mrs. Hubbell appeared at the department on Feb. 6 but was told by Mr. Thornberry that she could not sit in a staff meeting because the White House had not cleared her appointment.
At that point, Mr. Sweeney said, Mrs. Hubbell called Mr. Lindsey and Erskine Bowles, a White House deputy chief of staff, to find out what was delaying the clearance. Mr. Sweeney said that after Mrs. Hubbell discussed the matter with Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Thornberry got a call later in the day from Mr. Bowles telling him that the department could re-hire her.
"Suzie Hubbell did a very good job for us last year, and she will do a good job for us this year," Mr. Sweeney said. "To expect her to be pushed into unemployment because of other people's actions is wrong."

Ukraine Accepts Terms For Loan From I.M.F.

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, March 3

 BODY:
Signaling a strong commitment to overhaul its ailing economy, Ukraine agreed today to conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for a $1.8 billion loan.
The aid, expected to be formally approved later this month, would help Ukraine to cover its payments deficit, reduce inflation and mobilize other Western aid for the transition to a free-market economy. 
 In a detailed memorandum, the Government promised to keep the budget deficit low, end price controls and open borders to exports.
After delaying reforms for three years and suffering a deep recession, President Leonid M. Kuchma introduced new economic programs in October when Ukraine received its first I.M.F. loan, $371 million.
Today's agreement will help Ukraine to lobby Western Governments at a meeting March 21 in Paris to provide $900 million in bilateral aid to help cover a $5.5 billion payments deficit this year. The United States has agreed to provide more than $100 million but the European Union and Japan have not committed any aid.

HEADLINE: Two Letters and Excerpts From Book

 BODY:
Following is a statement from Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, to The New York Times yesterday regarding assertions that his book "The New World Order" (Word Publishing, 1991) includes an anti-Semitic message:
"The New World Order" was written at the height of the Gulf War to answer Bush Administration officials who were announcing that America had entered "The New World Order" under the aegis of the United Nations. 
 My book, "The New World Order," does not embrace a conspiracy theory of history, and it certainly is not anti-Semitic. I would never embrace theories that would cast doubt upon the Jewish community. The central thrust of the book is to show the dangers to the sovereignty of the United States of America and the security of the state of Israel that was implicit in a foreign policy under the direction of the United Nations.
I deeply regret that anyone in the Jewish community believes that my description of international bankers and use of the phrase "European bankers" in my book refers to Jews. As chairman of one of the nation's largest and most widely respected cable television companies whose stock is traded daily on the New York Stock Exchange, it has been my experience that the international financial community is very diverse and can hardly be characterized as Jewish. Further, I have never intentionally used what some would describe as code words to portray Jewish business interests. I condemn and repudiate in the strongest terms those who would use such code words as a cover for anti-Semitism.
If my statements were misunderstood, I offer my sincere regrets. I never intended to offend my Jewish colleagues who I consider to be dear friends and allies. However, I do feel that only someone who is desperately attempting to cause mischief would make the unfounded allegations about me or my book that have recently appeared in The New York Times.
All who know me, Jewish and Christian, recognize that I have been one of the strongest friends of Israel anywhere in the world. In 1974, when Israel appeared threatened and alone as a result of a worldwide oil crisis, I made a vow that I have kept to this day: I promised to use my influence, and that of the institutions I founded, to vigorously support Israel and the Jewish people. I have kept my vow. My comments on my daily television program have been pro-Israel. In fact, during the Gulf War, I was one of the few voices in America speaking out regularly in support of Israel.
I have lobbied for Israel, and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Jewish interests and organizations. By every public word and deed, I have kept my promise.
The book, "The New World Order," was carefully researched and contains seven single-spaced pages of bibliography from original historical sources. At the time of its publication, my book rose quickly to No. 4 on The New York Times nonfiction best sellers list, and became the No. 1 best-selling Christian book in America. With that wide a circulation in 1991, no one raised the specious objections to the book that are currently being brought forward by the radical left in America desperately looking for an opportunity to discredit the role of religious conservatives in politics.
Following is a letter from Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, to Pat Robertson regarding the criticisms of Mr. Robertson's book:
Dear Pat:
I write because of the recent attention given your book "The New World Order" and specifically the conspiracy theories contained therein which trouble me. A major national figure can hardly maintain mainstream credibility when he is associated with such discredited notions.
To my knowledge, Pat, you have never responded to critics of the book. It seems to me that it would serve all sides if you clarified the views expressed in it and repudiated its message of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy (chapter eight, for instance, suggests that Jewish bankers funded a "plan for world revolution" that came to include the French and Russian Revolutions and the creation of Communism). It would certainly help relations between our communities.
Please let me know your thoughts about this matter.
Following is an example of a passage from Mr. Robertson's book that critics say reflects anti-Semitism:
PAGE 61 Later, the European economic powers began to see the wealth of North America as a great treasure, and some of them still wanted to get their tentacles into America's economy. They eventually did so not by force but by investing their money here, by sending people, and by buying land. Europe could not defeat the United States by military force, but the European financiers knew that they could control the United States economy if they could saddle us with an American equivalent of the German Bundesbank or the Bank of England. Their efforts failed until 1913, when a German banker, Paul Warburg, succeeded in establishing the Federal Reserve Board, America's privately owned central bank.
Following is an example cited by Mr. Robertson as evidence that the book includes pro-Israel and pro-Jewish sentiments:
PAGE 256 It is also clear that Satan's strategy will include a frontal assault on Israel. Rest assured that the next objective of the presently constituted new world order, under the present United Nations, will be to make Israel its target. The precedent has been set by the action against Iraq.
A recalcitrant nation whose action does not accord with United Nations policy may be disciplined by military force. That is the newest law of world order. The United Nations General Assembly has already voted to brand Zionism as racism. Surely we can expect, sooner or later, an unreasonable demand for Israel to vacate control of the West Bank and the half of her capital city in East Jerusalem.

HEADLINE: A Slowing Economy Is Indicated

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
The Government's economic forecasting gauge is pointing to a slowing economy this year, while shrinking factory orders indicate that the robust manufacturing sector may join the trend.
 The Commerce Department said today that its index of leading indicators, which is intended to forecast conditions six to nine months in advance, was flat in January. 
 And in a separate report, the department said orders to factories rose six-tenths of a percent in January. Although the advance was relatively strong, it was weaker than gains of 2.7 percent in November and 2 percent in December.
 After remaining unchanged in September, the leading indicators fell one-tenth of a percent in October and then edged up just one-tenth of a percent in November and two-tenths in December.
 Mark Zandi, an economist for Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa., said the index "is showing that the slowing in the economy will continue at least through the summer." But he did not foresee a recession.
 The Federal Reserve, in its yearlong effort to curb economic growth and hold down inflation, has made seven increases in short-term interest rates, pushing them up to 6 percent from 3 percent, and the effects of the effort have shown up in slowing retail sales and housing starts.
 Five of the 11 forward-looking economic indicators rose in January, 5 fell and one was unchanged.
 The positive components included higher orders for plants and equipment, a rise in unfilled orders for durable goods, higher stock prices and a gain in the money supply.
 The negative indicators included a decline in building permits, faster delivery times that suggested declining orders, higher weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance and a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence.
 New orders for consumer goods edged up and prices for raw materials dipped slightly, but the report said their contributions to the index rounded to zero. The average workweek was unchanged.
 The Commerce Department said factory orders, considered a crucial gauge of the manufacturing sector, totaled a seasonally adjusted $301.3 billion, up from $299.5 billion in December. The increase was the smallest in three months.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Ford's Sales Rose in February; Nissan's Fell

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 3

 BODY:
Contributing to the cacophony of signals about the condition of the auto market in the United States, the Ford Motor Company reported today that its sales of vehicles rose in February, while the Nissan Motor Company said its sales fell during the month.
 Most auto makers reported their sales on Wednesday. Altogether, sales of cars and light trucks fell 4.1 percent, compared with a strong period a year earlier. Light-truck sales edged up, while car sales fell more than 7 percent. 
 Ford said its results showed that the market remained firm. "There's nothing in these numbers that I can see that supports the Chicken Littles of the world," said Joel Pitcoff, Ford's market analysis manager.
 Ford's car sales declined last month, but its strong truck sales -- a company record for February -- more than compensated for that drop. Ford's Windstar mini-van had its best monthly sales so far while its newly redesigned Explorer sport utility also posted strong gains.
 Those results came in contrast to the Chrysler Corporation's. On Wednesday, Chrysler reported strong car sales but surprisingly weak sales of light trucks, with mini-van sales plummeting by almost a third and sport utility sales falling 14 percent.
 Chrysler attributed its weaker mini-van sales to a rebate program on the Windstar, and it now seems likely that the Windstar did gain at Chrysler's expense. In addition, some die-hard Chrysler buyers may be postponing mini-van purchases because of advance publicity for Chrysler's new models, due out this spring.
 The success of the Ford Explorer is in line with strong sales reported by the General Motors Corporation of its redesigned Chevrolet Blazer sport utility. Those freshened vehicles may be making inroads on Chrysler's older Cherokee and Grand Cherokee models.
 Despite the Windstar's strong February, Ford is planning to close next week the Oakville, Ontario, plant where the Windstar is assembled, saying that dealers were cutting back inventories because of higher interest rates. Many auto industry analysts, however, believe the mini-van is not selling as well as the company hoped.
 Nonetheless, shares of Ford rose 25 cents today, to $25.625. But Chrysler shares fell 75 cents, to $40.75.
 In another sign of softness in the auto market, Chrysler today announced new rebates of up to $1,500 on its LH series of midsize sedans, good through June 30, and extended a rebate program for its Neon subcompact car until the same date.

HEADLINE: Democrats Lose Senate Seat With Switch by Coloradan

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the United States Senate, startled and puzzled the political world today by bolting from the Democratic Party and joining the Republicans.
He suggested that the Democrats no longer represented his views. But in a typically ambiguous statement, he said he would continue to vote as he had in the past, which has been with the Democrats and President Clinton 78 percent of the time, according to tallies by Congressional Quarterly. 
 "I can no longer represent the agenda that is put forth by the party," Mr. Campbell told a packed news conference here this morning, "although I certainly agree with many of the things that Democrats stand for."
Those who know Mr. Campbell, a sartorial maverick who wears bolo ties and his hair in a pony tail, said that his defection had more to do with growing personal antagonisms he had experienced within the Democratic Party in Colorado than with any ideological split.
They said Mr. Campbell had become increasingly estranged from his party since last year, when he got into a bitter public dispute over personal finances with his former chief of staff, Sherrie Wolff, who was running for secretary of state. Party officials blamed Mr. Campbell for costing her the race.
"He has a very, very sharp temper and has a hard time controlling it and he will lash out at real or perceived slights," said Lawrence Dodd, director of the Center for the Study of American Politics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. "When he gets in fights, he tends to settle them publicly."
Mr. Campbell only alluded to his internal party problems today, saying, "I have not been able to live up to the expectations of the Democratic Party, so it's just very clear that we go our separate ways."
The well-kept secret of his defection outraged Democrats in Colorado as well as his staff in Washington, most of whom quit on the spot when they heard the news this morning. "We're Democrats, not Republicans," one said.
Republican leaders in Washington cautiously welcomed Mr. Campbell into the fold, his addition swelling their ranks to 54 and leaving 46 Democrats. But no one seemed under any illusion that Senator Campbell, 60, who roars around town on a highly accessorized Harley-Davidson, would necessarily hew to the Republican line.
Indeed, President Clinton said that when Mr. Campbell called him this morning to report his switch, he told the President "he essentially supported our economic policies, our education policies and our social polices and that he would not change that." Mr. Clinton said that he hoped Mr. Campbell would continue voting as he has since his election to the Senate in 1992.
Mr. Campbell is viewed as a fiscal conservative and a social liberal, a Democrat who supports a balanced budget amendment and a capital gains tax cut but also supports abortion rights. He has sided with developers and the timber and mining industries, earning the enmity of environmentalists.
"I've always been considered a moderate, to the consternation of the left wing of the Democratic Party," he said today. "I imagine my continued moderacy will be now to the consternation of the right wing of the Republican Party."
Partly because of his insistence that he would not change his stance on issues, Mr. Campbell said he had no intention of resigning and standing for re-election as a Republican. But the Colorado Democratic Party, which is meeting this weekend, is sure to call for his resignation, said Howard Gelt, chairman of the party.
There is precedent both ways. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas stepped down and ran again when he switched parties, but Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama did not. Mr. Campbell is up for re-election in 1998. Colorado limits its senators to two terms.
Don Bain, chairman of the Colorado Republican Party, said he saw no reason for Mr. Campbell to quit only to run as a Republican. "The people of Colorado voted more for Campbell as a personality than as a representative of one party or the other," Mr. Bain said.
"His image is one of Western independence, the Lone Ranger kind of Indian image, the guy out there all alone on the Western plains staring into the horizon," Mr. Bain said. "He ran that way, as the rags-to-riches success story who has some kind of Olympic medal and makes jewelry and rides a motorcycle."
There has been speculation in Colorado that Mr. Campbell has already decided not to seek a second Senate term in 1998, partly because he was unhappy in the Senate and might run for governor that year.
"People think he won't run again because he hates the Senate so much, with its prima donnas, and he's such a loner there," said Bob Drake, a Denver pollster.
But these ambitions do not necessarily explain his switching parties, since the governor's race is expected to draw strong Republican contenders. Others said the switch occurred primarily because Mr. Campbell's personal feuds had made staying in the Democratic Party untenable. Most recently, he endorsed an opponent of the Democratic mayor of Denver, Wellington Webb.
In Washington, Mr. Campbell is better known for his unorthodox lifestyle than for any legislative accomplishments. Perhaps his most notable achievement has been to bring about the renaming of the Custer Battlefield National Monument in Montana, a name the Indians found offensive, to the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.
Mr. Campbell spent part of his early years in an orphanage and has attributed his independence to not having a family. "It made me very self-reliant and independent," he told his biographer, who was writing the book at Mr. Campbell's request. "If you have nobody to rely on, then you have got to do it yourself."
His mother, who was Portuguese, died of tuberculosis, and his father, a Northern Cheyenne who was an alcoholic, placed the children in orphanages. The Senator, who was born Ben Marshall Campbell, did not accept his Indian heritage until adulthood, after he learned that his grandmother's half brother, Alex Black Horse, was a leader of the Northern Cheyenne and that some of his ancestors fought at Little Big Horn. He keeps a knife from the battle in his Capitol Hill office. He was given the name Nighthorse by the tribe in 1980.
A high-school dropout who later put himself through San Jose State University by driving a truck, Mr. Campbell was captain of the United States judo team in the 1964 Olympics. He was elected to the Colorado Legislature in 1982 and to the United States House in 1986. Even his jewelry-making is unconventional. While most Indian jewelry is made with turquoise and silver, his includes gold, diamonds, sapphires and rubies.
Mr. Campbell is the eighth American Indian to serve in Congress and the only one at the moment. He once said he wished there were a lot more or none at all "because it's damned tough being the only Indian."

Developments in Washington

 BODY:

HOUSE -- The House completed its work on a series of antiregulatory measures, bundled them into a package with enormous implications for the system of Federal environmental controls and sent it to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain. The package, which passed 277 to 148, would temporarily suspend most new regulations and subject proposed rules on health, safety and environmental protection to new cost-benefit and risk assessments. It would also compensate private landowners when regulations reduced their property values, and it would honor the promise to roll back Federal regulations, a central part of the Republicans' Contract With America. 

Representative David M. McIntosh, Republican of Indiana, accused the head of the Environmental Protection Agency of illegally lobbying against such measures, but agency officials said they believed they had complied with the law.
 
Another important element of the Republicans' agenda moved forward as the Ways and Means Committee approved a bill to eliminate the 60-year-old Federal guarantee of cash assistance for millions of poor people. The measure would abolish Aid to Families With Dependent Children and give the states a lump sum of cash, or block grant, that they could use in any way they wanted to aid low-income people. The block grant would be set at $15.3 billion a year, the amount spent by the Federal Government for welfare benefits in 1994, with no allowance for changes in population or the economy.
 
SENATE -- Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, who voted on Thursday in favor of the unsuccessful effort to amend the Constitution to require a balanced Federal budget, switched to the Republican Party from the Democratic. "I can no longer represent the agenda that is put forth by the party, although I certainly agree with many of the things that Democrats stand for," he said.
 
WHITE HOUSE -- President Clinton said that Republicans appeared intent on cutting children's programs to provide more rewards for upper-income Americans and pressed them to disclose how they would pay for the tax cuts they have promised. His comments came in a press conference a day after the defeat of the Republican-backed balanced-budget amendment, a result the President said made it incumbent on Congressional leaders to show how they would cut spending and reduce the deficit in the coming year.

HEADLINE: Clinton Challenges the G.O.P. To Detail Its Spending Plans

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that the defeat of the balanced-budget amendment meant it was time for Republicans to spell out their spending plans, and warned that they seemed intent on cutting aid to children to benefit the well-to-do.
Mr. Clinton's call for more specificity came a day after the Republicans failed in their quest to pass the balanced-budget amendment. He said that result made it incumbent on Congressional leaders to show how they would cut spending and reduce the deficit in the coming year. 
 But with the attention of the political world already turning to the next Presidential election, Mr. Clinton also used a news conference this afternoon to appeal for reason. Saying he was committed to working even with those already eyeing his office, the President said the American people would be badly served if all-out campaigning began soon.
"We can't have everybody all torn up and upset about playing politics here for the next six, seven months," Mr. Clinton said in an answer to a reporter's question. "We've got a lot of work to do. And I think we should relax and do it."
Mr. Clinton's warning about the Republicans' intentions underscored the central point that the White House hopes to drive home in coming weeks as it scuffles with Congress about the shape of this year's budget proposal.
Seizing on Republican proposals to cut the budgets of some educational and nutritional programs and to shrink anti-drug education efforts in the schools, Mr. Clinton accused his rivals of seeking "to target children in order to pay for tax cuts for upper-income Americans."
But because the Republicans have not yet presented a budget proposal of their own, the President began his first solo news conference of the year by saying that it was time for them to set aside the abstractions of the balanced budget debate and put their specific plans on record.
Some Democrats have urged Mr. Clinton to move forward on his own with recommendations for specific cuts in spending beyond those he proposed in his own budget last month. But the President said today that he believed the next step was for the Republicans to take.
"I am going to wait now until they do their constitutional duty, which is to present a budget, which is something that has not happened," the President said, scoring his own political points even as he appealed for pre-election year gentility. "Then I am going to work with them."
In fact, it is Federal statute, not the Constitution, which sets an April 15 deadline for Congress to produce a budget plan. But because Republicans in the House and the Senate have not yet produced that proposal, Mr. Clinton was able to base his criticisms today on a broad amalgam of ideas spelled out in the Republicans' Contract With America, by individual Republicans and from actions already taken by the Republican-controlled House.
Those Republican proposals have in common a vow to cut taxes for millions more Americans than would benefit under Mr. Clinton's tax-cut plan, whose greatest rewards would be limited to Americans making less than $70,000 a year. But in an argument that he will repeat on Saturday in his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton cited the budget cuts now being pushed by House Republicans as evidence that the effect of the party's efforts would be extremely harmful to the young and the poor.
"I do not believe that that is consistent with our interests as we build America into the 21st century and we move into this new global economy," Mr. Clinton said.
In a year in which his political troubles continue to be compounded by Federal inquiries into the Whitewater affair and the conduct of members of his Cabinet, Mr. Clinton also used the news conference to suggest again that his Administration was being held to an unprecedentedly high standard.
Mr. Clinton did not directly answer when asked by a reporter whether he would demand the resignations of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown or Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena if inquiries into their conduct were expanded with the appointment of a special prosecutor. Already, the Administration is contending with three separate such investigations: one into the Clintons' conduct in the Whitewater matter and unrelated accusations against former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
But Mr. Clinton defended his own conduct and that of his aides, and noted that little more than a specific accusation against a top Government official now set off the appointment of a special prosecutor.
"If you look at the rules and you look at the facts instead of the number of investigations," Mr. Clinton said, "man, there's no way to control that under that new law."
In answer to another question at the 46-minute session, which was held in an auditorium in the Old Executive Office Building, Mr. Clinton said the criticism by several African-American leaders would not deter him from combing through Federal programs to determine whether some affirmative-action initiatives were no longer necessary.
Mr. Clinton dodged a question about whether he favored Federal laws that required that certain contracts to be set aside for minority-owned businesses. But he defended the idea of providing enhanced opportunities for minorities and children, and he pointed out that he had practiced affirmative action himself in filling jobs within his Administration.
After a week in which Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Lamar Alexander formally declared their candidacies for the Republican Presidential nomination while Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana all but did so, Mr. Clinton was most revealing when asked about his own plans for the 1996 race.
He said he hoped he would not face a similar challenge from within his party, and contended that his own record of achievement would make it difficult for a Democrat to run against him. And when reminded that the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, another Republican aspirant, had voiced blunt criticism of him this week, Mr. Clinton replied with a plea against name-calling.
"It's March of 1995," Mr. Clinton said with apparent disbelief. He added: "I can see right now, every day, everybody that wants to run for this job is going to be trying to make some remark or some move that runs everybody else halfway up the flagpole. We've got enough politics in this town on a regular basis without injecting that into it."

HEADLINE: Technology Issues Fuel Stock Market Advance

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks closed higher yesterday as strength in technology issues countered the impact of the dollar's slide to a new low against the Japanese yen.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.68 points, to 3,989.61, but it finished the week down 22.13 points. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks edged up 0.29 point yesterday, to 485.42. 
 The dollar touched a record low of 93.75 yen before settling at 94.14 yen, even as the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and European central banks bought dollars in an unsuccessful effort to prop up the value of the dollar.
 A weaker dollar makes American stocks and bonds less attractive to foreign investors, and yesterday's slide unnerved the bond market. Treasury prices tumbled, sending the yield on the 30-year bond up to 7.54 percent from 7.48 percent on Thursday. But stocks gained despite the weak dollar and rising interest rates, which make corporate borrowing more expensive.
 Given the dollar's drop, stocks held up impressively well, traders said.
 "The market in my opinion is acting like a champion here," said Timothy Straus, manager of institutional sales at Hancock Institutional Services.
 The advance in the Dow was led by I.B.M., which surged 2 5/8, to 79 7/8, its highest price in two and a half years.
 Indeed, buying yesterday was focused on the technology companies, which are viewed by Wall Street as potential leaders as the economy slows.
 "People are paying a premium for the sustainable revenue growth, and that's the techs," said Jay Ferguson, market analyst at Ferguson, Andrews & Associates.
 Along with I.B.M., Compaq Computer rose 1, to 34 5/8, Dell Computer gained 1 3/4, to 42, Intel was up 257/64 , to 81 7/8, and Texas Instruments jumped 3 1/8, to 86 1/2.
 "With the dollar coming down, these companies will continue to do well," Mr. Straus said. "They have unique proprietary technology with positions globally."
The Nasdaq composite index, virtually a barometer of technology stocks, rose 5.11 points, to 798.79, as it approached its record closing of 803.93 set on March 18, 1994.
 Among the biggest gainers on the Nasdaq market was P-Com, a maker of short-haul radio systems, which made an initial public offering at 15 a share and surged 8 5/8, to close at 23 5/8.
 Software Artistry Inc., another initial public offering, climbed to 20 3/4 from its starting price at 14.
 In Tokyo early yesterday, stocks ended slightly higher. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 76.44 points, or half of 1 percent, at 17,039.62, after falling as low as 16,792.30.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Intervention No Help As Dollar Sinks Again

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
The dollar hit another record low against the Japanese yen today as coordinated intervention in currency markets by more than a dozen central banks and strong words from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin proved no match for a wave of speculation against the currency by traders around the globe.
 The Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and a dozen or more European central banks bought dollars and sold other currencies today in an effort to brake the dollar's fall, currency dealers said. It was the first coordinated intervention by central banks to support the dollar since June 24. 
 But the dollar fell anyway, dropping as low as 93.75 yen, passing the previous record low of 94.90 set on Thursday in New York trading. The dollar settled today at 94.14 yen, down from 95.22 yen on Thursday. The dollar's slide prompted a sell-off in the United States bond market, where prices tumbled. [Page 44.]
 Mr. Rubin responded to the dollar's slump with an emphatic statement.
 "A strong dollar is in our national interest," he said. "That is why we have acted in the markets in concert with others. The Administration is continuing its work on strengthening economic fundamentals, including bringing down the budget deficit further."
 Mr. Rubin's comments, particularly his identification of the dollar as a national interest, were more strongly worded than statements on the dollar by his predecessor, Lloyd Bentsen. Before leaving office in December, Mr. Bentsen had given the impression on several occasions that he favored a lower dollar so as to make American goods more competitive in Japan. Mr. Bentsen urged the Fed last summer not to raise interest rates at a time when the dollar was also in trouble.
 But Mr. Rubin's comments did not appease currency traders. Nor did the purchases by the Fed, which appeared to be spending $500 million or more today, currency dealers said, considerably more than its estimated $250 million foray into the markets on Thursday but still less than its broad intervention last November.
 The dollar's fall this week leaves the Administration with an uncomfortable decision to make next week. Its choices are: to continue intervening, which could be expensive; to urge the Fed to raise short-term interest rates, which could send the economy into a recession, or to do nothing, and risk a further drop in the dollar that might eventually feed inflation.
 C. Fred Bergsten, who was a Treasury official in the Carter Administration, played down the seriousness of the dollar's plight. Some weakness in the dollar is understandable when interest rates here are stable or slightly falling, he said.
 "You only need to worry about a decline in your currency when it is juxtaposed with a significant rise in your interest rates," he said. Such a combination means that investors are so unhappy with a country's economy that they do not buy its currency or securities even when the investment returns are improving.
 President Clinton declined to discuss the dollar and interest rates at his internationally televised news conference today. "You know, one of the things I've learned since I've been here is that anything I say on this subject is wrong," he said. "So the Treasury Department is taking appropriate action today, and I don't think I should say anything else."
 The comment disappointed some traders who had hoped for another statement of Administration resolve to defend the dollar.
 Traders and economists generally agreed that the dollar's fall mainly reflected speculation and political issues, like perceptions of the Clinton Administration's weakness, rather than broad problems in the American economy. "There's no question the move reeks of being highly speculative in nature," said Stephen Flanagan, a currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York.
Unlike Wall Street traders, top Fed officials have traditionally been more concerned about the dollar's overall strength against the currencies of all of the United States' trading partners. The Fed has long watched for broad and deep drops in the dollar's value before concluding that imports would become more expensive and might feed inflation.
 The dollar has fallen 5.72 percent in value against the yen in the last month, and 6.71 percent against the mark. But the dollar has risen against the currencies of two of its largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. In the last month, the dollar has risen 19.53 percent against the peso and 0.41 percent against the Canadian dollar.
 In other trading, the dollar fell as low as 1.4232 German marks, its lowest level since October 1992. It settled at 1.4244 marks, down from 1.4435 marks.
 According to the latest quarterly report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fed spent $1.3 billion worth of foreign currencies on Nov. 2 and another $1.3 billion on Nov. 3 to prop up the dollar. Half the money each day came from the Fed's own reserves and half from the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund.
 Mr. Flanagan of Credit Agricole and other traders mentioned a concern that the $36 billion exchange stabilization fund might run short on money to support the dollar because the Clinton Administration had offered to lend as much as $20 billion from the fund to Mexico.
 Lawrence H. Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, sought to address this concern in a speech this morning defending the American assistance. "I can assure you that the Administration would not have contemplated this action if we were not completely confident that the resources of E.S.F. will still be sufficient to engage in any foreign exchange market interventions that may prove to be necessary," he said.
 The Fed also has $33 billion worth of lines of credit from foreign central banks that it can tap when needed for the dollar's defense.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Rises a Third Day On Firm European Demand

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices rose yesterday for the third consecutive session as falling warehouse inventories showed strong demand from European manufacturers.
 "In other parts of the world, outside the U.S., demand has been firming," said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. "In Europe, there has been continued strong demand." 
 On other commodity markets, lumber prices fell while gasoline rose. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities fell 0.56 point, to 232.11.
 Copper inventories in London Metal Exchange warehouses in Europe and Asia plunged 3.4 percent this week to their lowest level since August 1992 as copper in Commodity Exchange warehouses in the United States fell to its lowest level in more than four months.
 Copper prices were also bolstered after Germany's most powerful union, IG Metall, said on Thursday that it would return to the bargaining table on Monday after a weeklong strike. The announcement prompted expectations that demand for copper from German factories might not suffer from prolonged labor disruptions.
 Copper for March delivery jumped 2.4 cents, to $1.367 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange of New York. The contract has risen 5 percent in the last three days. The actively traded May contract gained 1.10 cents, to $1.3275 a pound.
 Lumber prices fell close to a three-month low on signs of a sluggish housing market.
 While the Commerce Department yesterday reported a surprising 3.8 percent gain in sales of new single-family homes during January, traders said the market would be weaker this year than last.
 "We're in a bear market," said Greg Riley, a lumber trader with the Bloch Lumber Company, a distributor in Chicago.
 The May lumber contract fell the exchange-imposed $10 trading limit, to settle at $294.70 for 1,000 board feet, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the lowest for the active contract since Dec. 15.
 Gasoline rose on concern that inventories, already 3.5 percent smaller than last year, may fall further as refiners begin slowing production to perform seasonal maintenance.
 April gasoline rose 0.35 cent, to 55.94 cents a gallon, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while crude oil for April delivery gained 28 cents, to $18.63 a barrel.

HEADLINE: Japan Securities: A Downhill Ride

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 3

 BODY:
Minoru Yoshida laughs nervously about his annual income falling to $40,000 from $180,000 a few years ago, but he points to fellow brokers who have it even worse: they do not get any paychecks at all, and even have to reimburse their employers for insurance contributions.
 "The securities world in general is suffering," he said. "Some people say that the reason the stock market is down is that the industry is kuu-dooka." 
 It is a startling choice of words. Kuu-dooka, or hollowing out, is the Japanese term for dying industries. It used to apply to some Japanese manufacturing sectors, as rising costs forced companies to move their factories abroad, leaving just the shell of the company in Japan.
 Now, times have become so rough for brokers in the securities industry here that they are resorting to the same phrase to describe their plight. For Mr. Yoshida and others, it is a radical change from the heady days of a few years ago, when the Tokyo stock market hit its peak and was perhaps the most active and alluring in the world. Now, the market has fallen to less than half its record high, and the industry is not only battling its bleakest period in recent history, it is facing the possibility that it may be hollowing out.
 Burdened by regulation and years of losses, the securities industry is nudging tens of thousands of people off payrolls and leaving scores of firms wandering fitfully in a market that seems more like an abandoned ghost town than a securities exchange.
 "They should turn them into tennis courts -- it would be much more profitable," Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., said of the Japanese securities companies.
 The pitfalls of the Tokyo stock market became all the more evident in the last few days when a stock trader in Singapore lost more than $1 billion on bets that prices on the Japanese market would rise. Yet many executives in Japan fear that the consequences here of the failed bet -- the collapse of the British investment bank Barings P.L.C. -- will be more regulation of the Tokyo market. That, they argue, would only add to the cost of doing business in Japan -- and thus to the risk of a hollowing out of the stock market.
 Foreign corporations are already fleeing. Of the 127 foreign companies that used to be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, 34 have taken their shares off the exchange since the peak, half of them delisting last year. And Chinese and other Asian companies are angling for listings in New York and London, rather than Tokyo.
 Investors and foreign brokerage firms are taking their Japanese business overseas, and Japanese securities operations are doing brisk business abroad while everything is shrinking at home. Moreover, since Japanese banks are forbidden from engaging in equity trading in Japan, they have gone abroad to set up trading subsidiaries in London, Singapore and elsewhere.
 "This is the beginning of the crisis, not the end," said Tsugio Tajiri, a finance professor at Tokyo International University. Mr. Tajiri said that Government measures in the stock exchange had stifled liquidity in the market. "It means the death of the stock market," he said.
 The funereal orations may be hyperbole, and some experts not only deny that kuu-dooka is taking place but assert that the Japanese market now has nowhere to go but up. Others argue that painful losses and consolidation in Kabutocho, or Tokyo's Wall Street, will only make the Japanese securities industry more formidable.
 But a recent survey of 350 top Japanese corporate executives reflected fear, not confidence, concluding that the securities markets are in a "crisis situation." Some of their comments were blunt: "The securities market is like a sick person." "The market has reached a terminal stage." "The market is paralyzed."
 The news these days echoes the gloom. Japan's largest securities firm, Nomura Securities, surprised the financial community last month by announcing disappointing earnings results for the first 10 months of this fiscal year. And CS First Boston announced recently that it would shut down equity trading operations in Tokyo.
 Foreign brokerage firms have been hurt because of the cost of maintaining expatriates in Tokyo. An apartment for a top executive can cost $20,000 a month or more, and the rent bills come even when the clients do not. Commissions in Japan are essentially fixed and transaction costs are high.
 So some foreign brokerage firms have scaled down their operations in Tokyo, in some cases leaving the market altogether.
 Hardly anyone has been trading. Volume sank to an average of 342 million shares a day last year, compared with levels of more than a billion shares a day in 1988. Many brokerage firms cannot break even at the reduced levels.
 Everyone is hoping that this is just a long bear market, yet many fear that the problem runs deeper than that. "I think this is an industry that has a lot of structural problems," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd.
 In the dark halls of the Finance Ministry, in the same tiny offices where officials once aspired to make the Tokyo market No. 1, much of the talk now is about how to improve market conditions. But deregulation has been slow because it will make it harder for small and medium-sized domestic brokerage firms, which make up most of the stock exchange's membership, to thrive.
 The ministry has helped coddle the industry of 277 brokerage firms for so long that many companies simply do not know how to compete, critics say. Small firms have not yet developed specialties, while larger houses need further diversification of their sources of income, these critics contend.
 Now, many small firms are looking for a bailout, but since the ministry is not going to be able to save everyone, they have had to look elsewhere. Century Securities, a medium-sized brokerage firm that has had losses in the last five years, is essentially being rescued by the Brunei Government, which is acquiring a 20.5 percent stake in the firm.
 Critics also say that the ministry's practice of leaning on large domestic institutional investors to support an artificial floor in the market is counterproductive. Such policies and others discourage the development of new products, Western analysts say, so that the types of securities traded, like equity derivatives, are less sophisticated versions of those traded in New York and London.
 A new agreement between Japan and the United States may help to change that by broadening access to a range of financial services in Japan, and there are hopes that the accord might revive the industry and lead to potentially lucrative new markets, like one in asset-backed securities.
 But ministry officials say change is unlikely to come with the suddenness of the May Day deregulation of the United States stock market in 1975 or the so-called Big Bang deregulation of the London financial markets in 1986.
 "A Big Bang is not suitable for our society," said a Finance Ministry official who insisted on anonymity. "But in the long run, we can see a bang. In a 10-year period, we can say it will be a kind of a bang."
 Some foreign firms are hoping the mini-bang will come sooner and are eyeing the Tokyo stock market now. Smith New Court Securities and Paribas Capital Markets last month announced that they would buy seats on the stock exchange that were vacated by Prudential Securities and Kidder, Peabody. And economists say that a buoyant market could do wonders for the general mood.
 "Why are the capital markets in Japan not good? Because the Japanese economy is not good," said Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute. "If growth comes back to 3 percent, everyone will rush back."

HEADLINE: Helmsley Sells Brokerage In '94 Kickback Scandal

BYLINE: By By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Brown, Harris, Stevens, a real estate brokerage and co-op management company that was engulfed in a kickback scandal last year, has been sold by Harry Helmsley to the heirs to two of New York City's real estate dynasties.
 Two of the four buyers, Arthur Zeckendorf, 36, and Kent Swig, 34, confirmed the sale in an interview yesterday, although they would not disclose the terms. 
 Mr. Zeckendorf, a member of the buying group along with his brother, William Lie, 36, is the son of William Zeckendorf Jr., who was one of the most active builders of New York City office towers and condominiums in the 1980's.
 Mr. Swig's family owns the Fairmont hotel chain and has built several Manhattan office buildings. His business associate David Burris, 40, is the fourth buyer.
 Brown, Harris, Stevens, which had been owned by Mr. Helmsley since 1964, is the management agent for 128 Manhattan buildings, including The Dakota, on Central Park West; the Fifth Avenue co-op building where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis lived until her death last year; and dozens more of the most expensive co-ops on Fifth and Park Avenues.
 Mr. Swig said yesterday that Brown, Harris, Stevens was "very strong financially." But real estate sources have said attorneys and business managers for Mr. Helmsley, who is 85 years old and in ill health, have been trying to sell the company for at least four years, in part because of its recent legal troubles and Mr. Helmsley's.
 Mr. Helmsley was indicted for income tax fraud in 1988 but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial; his wife, Leona, served 30 months in prison for her 1989 conviction on charges she evaded $1.2 million in income taxes.
 Last year, 17 employees or former employees of Brown, Harris, Stevens were among more than 80 New York City co-op management agents who were charged by the Manhattan District Attorney with extorting million of dollars in kickbacks from contractors and suppliers.
 Brown, Harris, Stevens dismissed the agents and settled a civil lawsuit that grew out of the case by making more than $1 million in restitution to the owners of co-ops that it managed.
 Mr. Swig said yesterday he considered last year's kickback scandal to be history that will not be repeated, adding that he saw no threat that the firm would lose any of the exclusive Manhattan co-ops on its client list. The firm's president, Roger Tuckerman, and other top managers will be retained, he said.
 "This a gem, a great firm," Mr. Swig said, adding that he and his partners plan no changes in a business strategy of "focusing on management of upper-end co-ops." But he said his buying group also hoped to expand Brown, Harris, Stevens' business as a broker and manager of commercial office space.
 The sale brings together some of the most prominent members of what has been called the next generation of real estate dynasties. The Zeckendorf brothers and Mr. Swig are among more than a dozen men and a handful of women, from 25 to 40 years old, who have taken control of the city's largest family-owned real estate development companies at a time when the weak economy has slowed construction nearly to a standstill.

HEADLINE: The Shrinking Welfare State

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki announced this week that he wanted to move even faster than planned to dump supposedly able-bodied New York State recipients from the Home Relief rolls. He and New York City's Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, also want to reduce Home Relief and other welfare benefits outright. Their goal of ending welfare as a way of life is laudable. But punitive acts against people who need help to survive won't take them there.
Driving people off the rolls and cutting welfare benefits rest on a popular but false assumption that New York is a welfare free-spender. The Mayor and Governor point out that the total spent in New York State on the main welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (A.F.D.C.), is greater than what is spent by every other state except California. But that is simply because New York has more poor people eligible for welfare than any other state except California. There are now about 1.1 million people on welfare in New York City, of whom 586,000 are children. 
 As the Mayor acknowledges, the maximum monthly benefit of $577 for a family of three in New York makes it the seventh most generous state. The proposed cutbacks in A.F.D.C. payments to $539 would make it tenth. But since rents and other costs are much higher there than in other states, New York is not really out of line.
Besides, adjusted for inflation, welfare payments in New York have been eroding for two decades. The Citizens Budget Commission, a fiscally conservative group, calculates that total spending for A.F.D.C., Home Relief, emergency assistance and aid for the aged, blind and disabled in the city declined in real terms by 17 percent from 1975 to 1992. Two decades ago the goal of welfare was to keep a family at poverty level. Today, even with food stamps, those families are well below it.
The rising cost of Medicaid for poor people, on or off welfare, does pose a threat to the city's solvency. But welfare grants do not. The cost of grant payments for A.F.D.C. and Home Relief in New York City have remained at about 4 percent of city tax revenues for more than a decade.
Governor Pataki is right in looking for ways to stop the system from perpetuating teen-age pregnancies, illegitimacy and dependency. Work requirements have proved effective in many cases, and the Governor and Mayor should be encouraged to expand those efforts. But people with experience in welfare say most adults on welfare cannot work because of mental and physical problems or because there are no jobs. Time limits and benefit cuts for such people will not change those facts.
New York will probably find what other states have found, that moving people from welfare rolls to payrolls requires a mixture of economic incentives and services for people who need help to find and hold down jobs. The city and state should be prepared to bear the cost of those services. Whether that means expanding the government bureaucracy or contracting out to others remains to be decided. But imposing cuts arbitrarily in the allowances for poor families with children is cruel and dangerous. It will almost certainly mean hunger, homelessness and the breakup of families among the poor.

Players Accept Important Part of Owners' Proposal

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 3

 BODY:
In the roller-coaster world of strike-bound baseball, just when talks between the owners and the players appeared to be on the verge of collapse, the players took a stunning step today and laid the groundwork for another possible major step.
 With Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, back in Milwaukee and speaking with fellow owners by telephone, the negotiating team he left behind heard the players' negotiators say they would accept the clubs' revenue-sharing plan in the form the players had long rejected. 
 In another critical economic area, the players proposed a 25 percent luxury tax for three years on portions of payrolls over a certain threshold. The players did not specify a threshold, but suggested it be negotiated.
 That seemed to be a significant step, too. When the players gave their "best" plan to Bill Usery Jr., the Federal mediator, at his request during a round of talks in Washington last month, they suggested a 25 percent tax on payrolls beyond $59 million.
 Donald Fehr, the union chief, said today that the players were prepared to "move off that substantially," but he also cautioned that "any luxury tax would have to start at a threshold substantially above the average payroll," which the union has computed at $40.6 million.
 If the owners should agree to the 25 percent tax rate, the two sides would have to find a compromise threshold somewhere between $40.6 million and $59 million. They almost certainly will have a difficult time finding that compromise.
 Negotiators held three sessions today and will resume talking on Saturday.
 The players' action, which the owners cautiously applauded, revived the talks, changing their status nearly 180 degrees from 24 hours earlier when Selig angrily told the players, in effect, that he was taking his ball and his bat and going home.
 A Wednesday night session had angered the owners because they felt the union was stalling.
 But union officials, according to a person on the players' side, had to re-evaluate their position after learning that evening that they had received conflicting information from the mediator.
 John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, chairman of the owners' negotiating committee, followed Selig out of town early this morning. That left Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies as the reluctant team leader for the owners at today's bargaining sessions, which Fehr did not attend.
 "Accepting the revenue-sharing agreement for five years is no small step," Fehr said at a news conference. "It is not an agreement we like at all, but it's one the owners have made clear is the price of any agreement. They now have it."
 The union, he added, found the plan somewhat easier to accept after the owners acknowledged that it placed a drag on salaries, a view the owners long had rejected.
 McMorris, following Fehr, said the owners "appreciate the fact that we apparently now have put the revenue-sharing plan to rest." He called it a "positive step" but not "earthshaking."
 Under the plan, the clubs would generate $58 million from high-revenue clubs to be given to low-revenue clubs. The players proposed a phase-in period, matching the owners' previous proposal of raising 40 percent of the money the first year, 60 percent the second and 80 percent the third, with the plan taking full effect in the fourth.
 The players' opposition to the revenue-sharing plan had been based on the way the clubs would generate money to be allocated to low-revenue teams. It would come from high-revenue clubs, and the players contend that those clubs therefore would spend less on salaries.
 The players view the payroll tax on a short-term basis because they feel the industry's economic position will change significantly by 1998.
 "When we recognize that in 1998 you should have a rebuilding of central revenues and expansion money," Fehr said, "we should be in position to get through this period of time where the clubs have felt the need to reorder their finances."
 McMorris offered no immediate response to the players' 25 percent tax rate. The owners had disliked the players' most recent tax proposal so much that they never responded to it. Presented Feb. 4 in Washington, the proposal called for a three-tiered tax based on a threshold of $40.6 million, the average 1994 payroll as computed by the union.
 But the clubs were disdainful of the top tier, 25 percent, because that threshold, $65 million, is a level no club ever has reached. As with the players' previous proposals, the owners said that one did not place enough of a drag on salaries.
 Showing what they meant by a drag on salaries, the owners three days earlier had proposed a 75 percent tax on the portion of payrolls over $35 million and a 100 percent tax on everything beyond $42 million.
 Under the owners' plan, the Yankees would have paid $14 million in tax on their 1994 payroll had the season been played in its entirety; they would have paid $1.5 million under the players' proposal.

HEADLINE: New York City Can't Solve Its Budget Crisis by Confronting Albany

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Esther R. Fuchs's advice to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani (Op-Ed, Feb. 22) on how to deal with the budget crisis is based on a series of ill-founded assumptions, irrelevancies and wishful thinking. New York has spent more on services than other cities because, unlike many of them -- Chicago, for example -- it has no separate county government structure on which it can dump some of the costly functions. New York also spent more because it had more. With its economic base eroded, the capacity to spend more has gone. 
 "Spreading the pain" is an attractive slogan but practically it means raising taxes, something no one has suggested. Spreading the pain by cutting programs that benefit the middle class and rich is a dry hole because the bulk of services -- police, fire, sanitation and debt service -- serve all citizens relatively equally. The beneficiaries of almost all of the rest of the budget -- youth services, social services, housing, homeless, welfare, health and hospital care and even education (the rich go to private schools), transportation (the rich take cabs) -- are poor. Cuts must come from these services because, in Willie Sutton's famous words, that is where the money is.
Most of Professor Fuchs's other recommendations -- state takeover of Medicaid, welfare, court maintenance and corrections, and more money for education and transportation -- have been on the city's agenda for years. The Mayor's predecessors, who were political allies of two of the three power centers in Albany, were unable to accomplish them. The assertion that Mayor Giuliani can, in the next four months, achieve what his predecessors couldn't in 20 years is unrealistic, even assuming the Mayor has potentially great power in Albany.
The same is true of the proposed changes in state law concerning the city's relationship with its employees. These proposals have been on the agendas of one or another Democratic mayor, or perhaps all, for 20 years. A budget-cutting program based on these proposals would be derided by the rating agencies, the bond market and the press. Moreover, the Mayor will probably have more success with the collective bargaining process in his own backyard than with the State Senate.
Professor Fuchs urges the Mayor to confront Albany, to go to Albany and fight. Fighting and confronting won't solve this year's budget crisis.

HEADLINE: For Lakehurst, More Bad News

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LAKEHURST, N.J., March 2

 BODY:
Hard luck dogged Lakehurst long before this week's recommendation by the Pentagon to close the Naval Air Warfare Center here. Just when it seemed the town's fortunes were riding high, something would bring it all crashing down.
 That was literally the case in the Hindenburg disaster. 
 The huge German zeppelin, nearly three football fields long, burst into flames and crashed, killing 36 people, as it tried to moor at the Naval Air Station in Lakehurst on May 6, 1937. The crash ended the era of lighter-than-air passenger service and tainted Lakehurst's nickname as Airship Capital of the World, though Navy blimps from Lakehurst continued to patrol the Atlantic until the 1960's.
 Before the dirigibles brought the first trans-Atlantic air passengers, Lakehurst was a bustling railroad town, with the steam locomotive Blue Comet stopping here several times a day to take on water and blast its whistle. For a while the town was a resort, attracting guests to the multiturreted Pine Tree Inn, advertised in New York newspapers as a pine-scented haven, a real tonic for the city dweller's health.
 But the inn was torn down the same year the Hindenburg exploded, and the Blue Comet ran out of steam long ago.
 Still there was always the Navy base to bolster the local economy and keep the town on the map. That, too, now seems just another casualty for Lakehurst. Unless the White House or Congress intervenes, the Navy will transfer the Air Warfare Center and about 600 civilian engineers and 16 military personnel to bases in Maryland and Florida. Some 500 civilians and 50 sailors will remain in Lakehurst to operate four mile-long tracks used to test aircraft carrier catapult and landing arrest systems.
 The jobs of 1,800 other civilian workers now employed at the base will be terminated under the plan.
 Rumors about the shutdown circulated months ago but were hard to believe, workers said, because the center's research, development and testing work on aircraft launching and landing equipment did not exist at any other base. They told each other that since aircraft carrier fleets were at the heart of America's ability to project military power around the globe, it was inconceivable that Lakehurst and its $100 million payroll -- the largest in Ocean County -- would disappear.
 All the logic came crashing down in flames with Secretary of Defense William Perry's recommendation to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.
 "It's a crying shame," said Tom Reidy, a middle-aged technician employed by the Navy, after hearing the news. "It'll affect younger people more than me, and I feel for them. I've had plenty of years on the job."
 The Navy will not close Lakehurst's gates overnight. The base has two years to plan for the move and six to complete it. Capt. Leroy A. Farr, the base commander, said his best guess was that the change would be accomplished by the end of the decade.
 The delay was of small comfort to those who live in Lakehurst, population 3,000, or to those in the area who depend on the daily flow of civilian base workers.
 "Once the base is closed, there'll be nothing left around here but menial work," said Cliff Muliero, 55, a barrel-chested man who fled the Bronx for Lakehurst 20 years ago to work in construction. He sat at the bar in the Airship Tavern, a popular place for Navy workers at the close of a shift, bent over a bottle of beer and dreading the future.
 "If that happens, everyone will leave -- whooosh!" he said, moving his arm along the bar like a scythe through wheat.
 "The stores will close with no customers, and property taxes will go up," Mr. Muliero said, the anger rising in his voice. "If that happens, guys like us will just walk away from our mortgages because our houses won't be worth anything, isn't that right, Eddie?" Mr. Shaw asked, turning to the man on the next stool, Eddie Shaw, now retired from his job in Jersey City. Mr. Shaw nodded in sullen agreement.
 Alton Tilton, the gentle-mannered Mayor of Lakehurst who worked for 23 years at the base as a parachute rigger, is not as pessimistic. "Something new has always come along in Lakehurst to provide jobs," said Mr. Tilton, now 68.
 Ocean County, with nearly 40 miles of coastline, has always had thriving summer tourism. But industry lagged even as the population, spurred by retirement communities and middle-class housing sprouting in the piney woods, jumped from 56,000 in 1950 to nearly 450,000 today.
 The largest employer in the county used to be the Toms River Chemical Company, taken over by the Ciba-Geigy Corporation and eventually shuttered in the late 1980's after a series of clashes with the Government and environmentalists over the dumping of hazardous wastes.
 "When Ciba-Geigy moved away, we thought at least the good old Navy was going to be around as long as we were," said Ray Reiss, another former Bronx resident who owns Lakehurst Photo Center, a camera and film supply shop. Faced with the potential loss of some 1,700 engineers, technicians and workers, Mr. Reiss said he didn't know how long he could stay in business.
 "It looks like it's going to be the seniors or nothing," he said with a smile, referring to the retirement communities ringing the base.
 But Michael Caruso, a former chief aviation machinist at the base who now sells real estate, said he thought the closing would stop the flow of military retirees into the area because they would no longer have the post exchange, commissary and medical services to use.
 Yet there are those who see bright linings, even opportunity.
 Rich Headley, program manager in the base's prototype and manufacturing department, said he was in contact with private investors who might be interested in buying or leasing his operation from the Government. His section works out of a $73 million plant, making flight deck cables used to catch a Navy jet's tailhook as it lands at 150 miles per hour, stopping it in under three seconds.
 "The taxpayer paid for this facility, why just tear it down?" he asked.
 The western half of the boomerang-shaped base will remain active because that is where the jet-powered sleds and long tracks used for testing are. What becomes of the eastern half will be resolved in coming years.

Borough Gets Some Good News

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

DATELINE: CARTERET

 BODY:
Color the future a little rosier for this borough after the Legislature voted to designate it an urban enterprise zone. "This could mean the rebirth of Carteret and the surrounding areas," said Mayor Peter J. Sica. "Carteret is an old industrial area, but many of the industries have moved out. So this is a heck of an attraction to bring new business and industries back here." Among the lures are reduction of the sales tax, from 6 to 3 percent, on all purchases in the community; elimination of sales taxes on materials purchased by new businesses; a $1,500 corporate tax break for new businesses that hire people from Carteret, and a 50 percent reduction in the unemployment insurance rate.

Innumeracy<2>

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
NEWSPAPERS AND newscasts that would never permit reports on "President Bill" and "Mayor Rudy" without their family names seem to have no compunction about regularly omitting the family names of vital news statistics -- the denominators without which most numerical facts are just mush. So Bill has reduced the Federal payroll by 98,000 jobs: yes, but out of how many? Is that an impressive saving or a drop in the bucket? And yes, Rudy has vowed to close a gap of $2.7 billion: in how large a budget? In a whole page about the deficit one day last month, The Times never said.
That gap, by the way, is only a projected deficit -- dependent on estimates of future tax collections, about which Rudy was wrong last year. It is also dependent on future Federal and state subsidies, about which President Bill and Governor George must still bargain with Congress and the New York Legislature. The gap will be further affected by inflation and maybe also by Yankee batting averages (if Owner George and his colleagues permit a proper pennant race that will draw crowds). 
 America needs baseball back, if only because that's the only way it learns to handle rates (batting averages), probabilities (who expects to live long enough to see 61 homers again?) and context (how come the team with the lowest wages had the best record before the strike?).
Deploying numbers skillfully is as important to communication as deploying verbs, but you won't find many media practicing that philosophy. Most schools of journalism give statistics short shrift and some let students graduate without any numbers training at all. How can such reporters write sensibly about trade and welfare and crime, or air fares, health care and nutrition? The media's sloppy use of numbers about the incidence of accidents or disease frightens people and leaves them vulnerable to journalistic hype, political demagoguery and commercial fraud.
THANKS TO NORMA SOSA, A Times editor who often goes on numbers patrol in the paper's columns, I have at hand a few examples of such sloppiness, which, I choose to believe, occurs in this newspaper much less frequently than elsewhere. About a year ago, The Times reported the startling conclusion of a study published by The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry that depression was costing America $43.7 billion a year -- "on a par with heart disease." One element in that total was the alleged loss of "lifetime earnings" by one year's 18,400 suicides -- magically rendered as $7.5 billion ($407,608.69 each?). Days lost from work were more modestly reckoned as worth about $11.7 billion and "impairment of work from symptoms" while people continued on the job was said to have cost $12.1 billion. The rest was the cost of psychiatric care, generously omitting unnecessary medical tests and other "hidden" charges.
I dwell on this example only because it combines adding apples and oranges with false precision and pure guessing in what was surely meant to be a helpful warning about a major health problem. Some other examples in the Sosa file were less complex but equally unhelpful. The Times described a plan to put a 10 percent surcharge on taxable incomes above $1 million as a "10 percent surcharge on millionaires." It reported that Russian miners were demanding a "150 percent pay increase" (in one paragraph) and wanting their salaries "increased by two and a half times" (in the next). It reported that China's clothing sales to the United States might be reduced "by more than $1 billion," without a hint of whether that's a billion paid to the Chinese or charged at retail, and what portion of China's business was at risk.
THE TIMES AND other good papers, I'm sure, are slowly raising the numeric consciousness of their staffs. But the dirty secret about the media's contribution to American "Innumeracy," first examined in a delightful book by that title by John Allen Paulos, is about to be revealed in his sequel, "A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper." Wittily, but also sometimes obscurely, Paulos demonstrates how mathematical thinking might have enhanced the public's understanding of the news or at least avoided egregious error and simplistic conclusion. "Mathematics," he reminds us, "is not primarily a matter of plugging numbers into formulas and performing rote computations. It is a way of thinking and questioning that may be unfamiliar to many of us, but is available to almost all of us."
By far his most elegant example -- relevant to a great number of news articles -- shows how easily unthinking writers or readers will be misled by "conditional probability," as experienced in a test to discover disease:
Suppose that a test for disease D is celebrated as 99 percent accurate -- meaning that if you have the disease the test will be positive 99 times out of 100 and if you don't it will be negative 99 times out of 100. And suppose that 1 of every 1,000 people actually has this disease. Now assume the test for D is given to 100,000 people; 99 of them will both have the disease and test positive. But of the 99,900 healthy people, 1 percent or 999 will also test positive -- falsely. In other words, of the 1,098 (99 plus 999) who tested positive, only 9 percent, a mere 1 out of 11, will actually be sick. And that small number, remember, in a test that was rightly called 99 percent accurate!
How many newspapers reporting such a study could correctly instruct their readers in the meaning of "99 percent accurate" and thus prevent panic among the positives? How many physicians could? How many of us had the wit to question, as Paulos does, the judgment that proportionately more blacks (95 percent) voted for David Dinkins because he is black than whites (75 percent) voted for Mayor Giuliani because he is white? Noting that 80 percent of New York's blacks normally vote Democratic while only 50 percent of whites normally vote Republican, Paulos says it could also be argued that only 15 percent of blacks voted racially as against 25 percent of whites.
Paulos urges that shrewdly chosen numbers would offer healthy context to otherwise alarming news. While "drugs are an undeniable scourge," he notes, the biggest killers are tobacco (400,000 deaths annually) and alcohol (90,000), not cocaine (8,000) or heroin (6,000). Through all the years of anxiety about some 2,000 Americans missing in action in Vietnam, he asks, who remembered that about 8,000 were left missing in Korea and nearly 80,000 in World War II?
More focused instruction, particularly for anyone writing about health, is available in a manual, "News and Numbers," by Victor Cohn. He, too, begins with a lecture on "the certainty of uncertainty," a warning that most scientific information, like the morning weather report, is of a probable nature. And like other students of this subject, Cohn cautions against semantic as well as numerical confusion in the handling of statistics -- between, say, the incidence and prevalence of a disease. ("If incidence is like an entering class" at one period of time, "prevalence is the whole school.")
In one year alone, Sosa found The Times using shortfall ("the quantity or extent by which something falls short") to mean shortage, decline, unpaid bill, difference, unmet budget request, debt, remainder and deficit. And then there was the Broadway critic who observed that bludgeoning the audience into laughter with fast and furious action was one director's response "to the comic shortfall."
Fast and furious action is usually how the media distract from a vast numeric shortfall.

HEADLINE: Pied Piper

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill 

 BODY:
The appeal of a savory pie (on a cold winter night, with a blizzard in the forecast) is not a primitive one. Making pastry crust, after all, is an expression of a settled (and presumably civilized) society, requiring time to confect and a flame to bake.
Nevertheless, the urge to envelop a hearty filling in dough and bake it until it's bubbly hot is almost universal. The British have their steak and kidney pie, the French their quiche Lorraine, the Italians their calzone. Even Americans can lay claim to a crusty morsel, that nostalgic favorite: chicken pot pie. That these pies endure says something about their satisfying, one-dish efficiency. They're also an ode to their tribe. In the medium of a savory pie, the flavors of a culture are layered and baked, then offered up for a communal experience. 
 There is something immensely comforting about seeing a hot tart cooling on the dinner table, its crust waiting to be breached, so that its complex flavors can be revealed. In this regard, the appeal of a savory pie, is extremely sentimental, like seeing a loaf of bread on a cutting board.
Building a pie requires the foresight and patience it takes to build a stew, just more so. While it is usually possible to correct the seasoning and even the balance of ingredients while a stew simmers on the stove, with a pie, the die is cast, so to speak, when you close the oven door.
So the cook must be careful that all the ingredients flatter one another, and that the textures are nicely varied. You must also bear in mind that a pie will be eaten forkful by forkful, so the ingredients must be finely chopped and not unwieldy. Finally, the pie must be properly seasoned before any baking begins. This requires that you know how the flavors will ultimately change and coalesce.
Making a pie, like concocting a stew, takes time -- the kind of time that seems plentiful in winter. But should you begrudge the effort, consider the economies of scale. Proceeded by a peppery green salad like watercress and arugula and followed by a light dessert (never pie or cake but a poached fruit with cookies, ice cream or custard sauce), a winter tart makes a thoroughly delightful meal.
To create the crust, these recipes use a yeasted dough enriched with olive oil. The dough can be made ahead of time and frozen for up to two months but should be defrosted in the refrigerator 24 hours before baking. The dough, of course, is by no means limited to the recipes below. Use it to envelop a panoply of fillings, born serendipitously, from the contents of your refrigerator. You will find the act of creating such a judicious ragout, and then wrapping it in crust, almost as soothing as consuming it. These rustic-looking pies -- not quite pizza, not quite calzone, far removed from pot pie and quiche, in nature and flavor -- are anything but humble.
 
Savory Pie
 
 1 cup warm water
 1 package ( 1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
 2 1/2 to 3 cups all-purpose flour
 1 teaspoon kosher salt
 1 teaspoon olive oil
 1 filling (see recipes)
 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water.
1. Combine water and yeast in a mixing bowl and stir until yeast dissolves. Stir in 1 cup of flour. Stir in salt and a second cup of flour. Sprinkle some of the remaining flour over a work surface and your hands. Scrape dough out of the bowl and onto work surface. Gradually knead in additional flour, until dough no longer feels sticky.
2. Coat large bowl with olive oil. Shape dough into ball and rotate in the bowl to coat with oil. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set in warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch dough down and knead for about 1 minute. Return dough to bowl and let rise until doubled again, about 45 minutes. Punch down dough.
3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly flour back of baking sheet and place dough on it. Roll dough into 12-inch circle, letting dough rest for a few minutes when it becomes too elastic to roll. Place filling in the center of dough and spread out, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold edge of the dough in over filling, making a pleat every 2 inches.
4. Brush rim of pie with egg mixture. Bake until lightly browned and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Let cool slightly, cut into wedges and serve.
Yield: Four servings.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Peter Brook Voyages To Inner Space

BYLINE: By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE; Benedict Nightingale is chief theater critic of The Times of London.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
AFTER THE SUCCESS OF Peter Brook's nine-hour version of "The Mahabharata," the most massive project that has yet emerged from his International Center for Theater Research in Paris, everyone he met seemed to assume he would tackle another mythological epic. "Give us your 'Beowulf,' " he remembers people saying, "Give us 'Mahabharata 2.' "
But Peter Brook wouldn't be Peter Brook if he repeated himself. To keep moving, seeking, changing and growing remains a basic article of his faith as he approaches what will likely be a characteristically unfussy 70th birthday on March 21. Mr. Brook is probably the English-speaking world's most eminent director, with productions as pivotal as the Paul Scofield "King Lear" and books as influential as "The Empty Space" among his legacies. But he is most apt to be found quietly chatting in a Left Bank bistro in Paris, where he lives, than going by limo to a champagne reception at the George V. 
 So his decision back in 1987 was unsurprisingly surprising. He determined that after the "Mahabharata" mountain would come a theatrical molehill or, rather, molehole. After venturing among Hindu gods and archaic space wars, he would go burrowing deep into the human head. After "The Mahabharata," which he brought to the Brooklyn Academy of Music nearly eight years ago, would come his company's adaptation of Oliver Sacks's collection of clinical anecdotes, "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat."
Beginning on Saturday and running through April 9, the production will be staged at what could be called Mr. Brook's American home away from home. Change the audience's language, and BAM's Majestic Theater (remodeled into what looks like a decaying structure) might almost be the shabby old Bouffes du Nord, Mr. Brook's theater in Paris. Indeed, the Brooklyn playhouse was fashioned after the Paris original for the opening of "The Mahabharata."
The delay in bringing "The Man Who," as the piece is now called, to New York tells its own story. The work runs a sixth as long as "The Mahabharata" yet took almost the same amount of time to create. After all, how do you make a coherent evening out of symptoms as diverse as unstoppable nonsense-talk, the inability to register anything to the left of your nose, frantic spasms and outbursts of obscenity, and a fixed belief that it is forever 1945? In his time Mr. Brook has reduced Bizet's "Carmen" to a spare chamberwork in a circle of sand, staged "A Midsummer Night's Dream" on stilts and trapezes, and performed a 12th-century Sufi poem called "The Conference of the Birds" in Australian quarries. But dramatizing Dr. Sacks's bizarre case studies was an awesome challenge even for him.
Dr. Sacks is the British-born, New York-based neurologist who came to notice in 1973 with "Awakenings," his description of patients who made what turned out to be sadly short recoveries from pathological lethargy. The book inspired a missionary fervor in Harold Pinter in particular. Even before the dramatist drew on it for the play "A Kind of Alaska" in 1982, he was excitedly recommending it to the guests at a birthday party for John Gielgud. Mr. Brook, who was among them, read and admired it, met and liked Dr. Sacks; and when "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" appeared in 1986, got what he calls "a hunch, a feeling of 'ahhh,' a sense not even of how, where or when, but just that this was something we had to do."
Why? Well, Mr. Brook has long been fascinated by brain, mind and what, without being pious about it, he is prepared to call spirit or soul. All his recent work, from "La Tragedie de Carmen" to his similarly spare version of Debussy's "Pelleas et Melisande," has attempted to penetrate beneath the surface of things, intuit human mystery, and find ways of embodying life's invisible, inscrutable aspects.
"The worst disease today is reductionism," he said on a recent visit to his native London. The question of the spirit "is simply laughed out of court, and I think many people want it back. Certainly, that sort of materialism sets off a deep wish in me to go in the opposite direction."
He found support for that wish in his reading of the more adventurous mathematicians and scientists, starting with Dr. Sacks, who is as much a philosopher and metaphysician as a neurologist. But "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" has an obvious emotional appeal, too. The feeling it communicated to Mr. Brook was of modern Homeric heroes battling fearsome tricks of destiny.
"So in a totally different way," he said, "I hoped to achieve what Greek tragedy does. These illnesses show you a situation, more intense than normal, where the question 'What is fate?' is no longer an intellectual subject for debate. And the extraordinary thing is that, when they do so, you're strengthened, with this mysterious, cathartic effect. You can simultaneously face the terrors of human existence and its amazingly positive side."
TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF IAN, A Yorkshireman who as a 19-year-old butcher's apprentice cut his finger, developed a fever and emerged with no feeling at all from his neck down. For a time he was a rag doll who lay in bed and let his mother look after him. But then he discovered that by using his eyes and exercising his will he could make his senseless limbs move. Feeling nothing, he learned to stand, walk, build up an entire repertory of movements and gestures. Last year he went to a party at the National Theater in London, where "The Man Who" was playing, telling Mr. Brook afterward that he had taken a big risk in doing so. For the first time he had abandoned his sneakers for black shoes, making it hard to see his feet and monitor them as he walked upstairs. "Well, I couldn't come to a first night in white shoes, could I?" he said.
But that was in 1994, after the French version of "The Man Who" had played in Paris and the English version had successfully toured Europe. The problem in 1987 was doing theatrical justice to the pain and courage of people like Ian. Mr. Brook's aim was not only to combine mystery with clarity but to express extreme complexity with the extreme simplicity for which he is renowned. But how? "We didn't want documentary," he said, "because that hasn't the energy of theater, and we didn't want fiction, with good doctors and grumpy doctors, Scottish doctors and mid-European doctors, because that hasn't truth. We wanted a piece that would have the closeness of reality and the distance of myth, because if there is no distance you aren't amazed, and if there is no closeness you aren't touched."
Mr. Brook's company tried performing bits of Dr. Sacks's book, only to find the material too literary for the theater. They went to hospitals, met patients and doctors, did improvisations, yet still found the results tended to get showy and false. Since showy and false are the rudest words in the International Center's vocabulary, the project repeatedly got shelved, postponed or, as Mr. Brook now says, put in the drawer that blocked writers reserve for their toughest work. Instead, he turned to the relative security of completed scripts: "Woza Albert!" and "The Tempest."
NEVERTHELESS, KEY decisions gradually got made. The somewhat improbable model for the show would be Ta-Da-Da, the evenings of vaudeville sometimes staged at the Bouffes du Nord but this time with clinical sketches substituting for songs. The original 14 actors, each of whom naturally wanted a fair share of the show's 100 minutes, were reduced to a more manageable four, each playing several roles, including an unobtrusive doctor. The humane and authoritative voice of Dr. Sacks was excluded.
"We tried putting in some beautiful passages from the book, and we tried explaining the diseases," Mr. Brook said. "But we found it was going against what we wanted, which was not to provide a lecture for the cultivated mind, not to be didactic or polemical, but to touch spectators with direct, unfiltered experiences and let them ask their own questions."
And not only questions about alien beings with abstruse afflictions. "The Man Who" -- note that odd, unsettling, vaguely interrogative title -- is "not about mad people, but about you and me," said the director. It is an attempt to fulfill "the ultimate aim of theater, which is to put you in front of something out of life which makes you question something about yourself." It also wants its audiences "to look at something they've taken for granted since they were born, which is a mind, as if it were a great dawn or Everest. Everything in life conspires to take away our sense of wonder. The purpose of a work of art at its best is to feed it."
From another person, those claims and hopes might sound pretentious. From Mr. Brook, they come across as an earnest, mild, shy summing-up of almost 50 years of experience and experiment, first in Britain, latterly mainly in Paris. In his open-necked shirt and sweater he seemed a lot less suited to the rococo grandeur of the Hyde Park Hotel in London, where he started this particular conversation, than to the London underground where, stuck among swaying commuters, he finished it.
That lack of affectation is one reason theater people like and respect him. For Paul Scofield, impressed as he was "by the incredible economy, dignity and compassion" of "The Man Who," he remains a director in whose judgment an actor can put complete trust. Adrian Noble, the director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, speaks of "an extraordinary mixture of inspiration, vision and down-to-earth nuts-and-bolts practicality." Richard Eyre, who runs the National Theater, talks with equal admiration of Mr. Brook's "spiritual quest, his determination to find the most expressive way of telling a story, and his refusal ever to be satisfied or to 'finish' a piece of work, his lack of ego."
Certainly, Mr. Brook himself mistrusts directors with concepts or stances to impose on plays. He is equally uneasy with dramatists who substitute fixed points of view for contradiction and complexity, and so seldom himself directs contemporary texts. "I'm more interested in what we can discover as a group," he said. "My job is to try to refine and structure what we create collectively. I'm not for passive directing, but I react very badly against the illusion, which goes back to the early days of the cinema, of the director as a von Stroheim figure in riding boots with everyone else his servants."
MR. BROOK AND THE playwright Jean-Claude Carriere put together the final script of "The Man Who"; but the actors played a full part in its creation. One went to a convention in Houston, Tex., of people with Tourette's disease, that is to say, with unstoppable tics. There he met every grade of sufferer from the terrified and suicidal to the droll and charming, among them the syndrome's hero, an American physician who can fully control his compulsive spasms in the operating theater, a man who appears in Dr. Sacks's new book, "An Anthropologist on Mars."
The other actors, too, draw on direct experience, and that alone. They realized very early that they could not rely on their imaginations to embody, say, Parkinson's disease or an epileptic fit. Rather, it was a case of observing, mimicking and, always with the group's help, trying to deepen the portrait: working from the outside in, from physical imitation to internal feeling, rather than in Method style, from the inside out.
This meant that many of Dr. Sacks's case studies were omitted, among them a hilarious description of a group of aphasiacs, unable to understand speech but hyper-responsive to phony body language, who were found falling around with laughter in front of a television from which then-President Reagan was delivering a smiling speech. But the company was able to dramatize an example of an affliction not descried in the original book, a young Parisian convinced that everyone he meets is part of a long dream he hopes will soon be over, "because I want to be home for Christmas."
In other short, gritty sketches, the company -- the same one in America as toured Europe -- offers glimpses of the white-haired man who thinks he is 27, the young man who believes his own leg is an amputated limb placed in bed as a practical joke, and the musician who really does try to use his wife's head as a hat.
Mr. Brook's job was what it always is: to strip away theatrical ado, to distill and concentrate, to insure that the production was fresh, spontaneous and natural yet not lacking in intensity. "Americans should be prepared for the fact that our aim is anti-histrionic," he said. "They shouldn't expect violent illustrations of suffering and torment. What we're doing goes in the opposite direction. Our view is that the more talented the actor, the more he just is, the more the devices of acting wither away.
"Sometimes people have said to our actors, 'Have you ever acted before?' and they are half-furious but also half-delighted. Because we want to show people straight from life. We're trying to create a different kind of acting, what we call transparent acting as against virtuoso acting."
What next for this septuagenarian pioneer? Not "The Man Who 2," that's for sure. Mr. Brook's career has been a long attempt to get down to theatrical basics, and later this year he plans to do so in the most conscious way possible.
"For some time we have been researching the conflicting influences that have played on the theater in the 20th century," he said. "Stanislavsky, Brecht, Meyerhold, Gordon Craig, the great, great figures. Our theme is the nature and process of theater itself. What is the theater, what are we doing with it, does it matter? Theater reflecting on theater. But I can't tell you any more about the project because I don't know myself. Once again we are starting from zero."

HEADLINE: CHOICE TABLES;
In San Diego, Eating Well Without a Tie

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER; BRYAN MILLER is a reporter for the style department of The Times.

 BODY:
IT is little exaggeration to say that just 10 years ago in the sun-blessed port city of San Diego some of the better dining was found aboard Navy ships based in the expansive harbor. Of course, you had to enlist to join that eating club.
San Diegans explain their mundane food history by pointing to the splendid weather, which encourages outdoor activities (including cookouts) at the expense of fine dining, and a tradition of entertaining at home. 
 Today, however, that is changing. With its renovated Old Town historic district, the waterfront convention center, a more diversified economic base and a population growing at more than 10,000 annually, a small but conspicuous crop of ambitious restaurants has taken root.
From Coronado Island in the south to Rancho Santa Fe in the north, the San Diego area now offers diversified dining opportunities, not only in French, American and Italian, but also in Korean, Thai, Vietnamese and other Asian cuisines (most of these are storefront affairs in the Kearny Mesa neighborhood).
With a few exceptions, one thing is certain about San Diego dining: it is informal. When a restaurant describes itself as semicasual (the word formal is not in the local lexicon), that means men probably should wear shirts with collars. Casual means you can arrive directly from mowing the lawn (just shake off clippings on your shoes); very casual indicates you don't even have to dry off from swimming.
 
Cilantros
Given the surprising paucity of authentic Mexican food in San Diego, many residents opt for rousing, tequila-fueled hybrids like Cilantros, which serves both Mexican and Southwestern fare. Cilantros is among the better of the genre, a hip, loud place with a bar done in bold Aztec colors where you may have to wait for a table. One could easily compose a meal from the "Southwestern tapas" menu at the bar, which includes tamales, soft tacos, spit-fired chicken wings with jalapeno-honey mustard, and duck-and-wild-mushroom quesadillas. On the main menu, posole, the Mexican chicken-and-hominy soup, needed a trip to the seasoning cabinet; Dungeness-crab-and-corn cake was rather lackluster, served with a peppery chipotle aioli and unnecessary citrus salsa.
One of the more vibrant main courses sampled was barbecued pork tenderloin with a zesty tequila-chili relish and garlic mashed potatoes. Pepper-rubbed ahi tuna was well prepared also.
The dessert list reads as if it were devised by 13-year-olds, that is, no-holds-barred rich. The aptly named La Bomba is a softball of chocolate mint chip gelato layered with cookies, draped with chocolate sauce. Dinner for two runs from $70 to $90.
 
George's at the Cove
On a typical resplendent, sunny day, La Jolla, about 20 minutes north of downtown, is the kind of place that tempts visitors to shred their return airline tickets and toss them into the surf. Prospect Street, high above the coastline, is La Jolla's main strolling thoroughfare, crowded with cafes, boutiques and galleries.
One of the more popular spots for lunch is 11-year-old George's at the Cove, a multilevel affair with a casual open-air terrace on the roof, a cafe in the middle and a more ambitious dining room on the bottom. The affable proprietor, George Hauer, is a welcoming host.
Diners in the main restaurant face a giant window that frames the undulating ocean, suggesting the lounge of an ocean liner. It is done in beige wood, with well-separated tables and rattan chairs. Lunch is a relative bargain in this trendy enclave, about $60 for two (dinner is about $90 for two).
A recent lunch began with the chef's signature soup, a creamy black bean with the unlikely but appealing addition of broccoli and smoked chicken; a rabbit punch of Tabasco and peppers came up out of nowhere. Less assertive is the deep bowl of steamed mussels in a saffron-tinted broth. Fettuccine tossed with superbly sweet rock shrimp, tomato concasse and Parmesan was a harmonious combination, too. Main courses, in staggering portions, include everything from meat loaf with horseradish potatoes and jerk chicken to au courant seafood preparations like whitefish encased in a potato crust.
One fish to try is thresher shark, a cousin of mako, which was remarkably sweet and flaky, sauteed and set over white beans and sliced tomatoes. Considering the portions, trim your sails for dessert with superior tropical sorbets or fresh berries poached in red wine.
 
Marius
One of the few formal places in the city is Marius, in the Le Meridien Hotel at Coronado, about a 10-minutedrive from downtown. Marius is a Provencal style restaurant with a Vietnamese-born chef, Rene Herbeck, who trained in France. The dining room, done in soft ocher toneswith Provencal accents, is comfortable and hushed, and service is unremittingly attentive. Mr. Herbeck cooks straightforward Provencal fare with few hints of his Asian background. Recommended starters include the lush wild mushroom ravioli glossed with herb butter, excellent foie gras sweetened with the intensely fruity wine, Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise and grapes.
Seafood entrees were winners: grilled sea bass fillet brightened with fennel and surrounded by a delicate saffron sauce; sauteed John Dory, firm and meaty, on a bed of mashed potatoes with sweet roasted shallots. Duck breast encrusted with rosemary was a nice idea, and it was offset by a lavender honey sauce.
Marius has one of the more comprehensive wine lists in the city, and prices are in line for an establishment of this type.
Desserts are artfully turned out, especially the splendid cookie cornucopia filled with raspberries and light cream, and hazelnut chocolate mousse with a terrific praline custard.
 
Mille Fleurs
About a 40-minute drive from downtown is the bucolic community of Rancho Santa Fe, where well-heeled residents clomp by on horseback under drooping eucalyptus trees. Ensconced in this insular little village is what I found to be far and away the best restaurant sampled in greater San Diego, Mille Fleurs.
Owned by a flamboyant Frenchman, Bertrand Hug, it is a romantic lair of stucco, oak-trimmed windows, brick fireplace, flowers and Portuguese tiles. The chef, Martin Woesle, is a classicist with a contemporary style and an innovative touch. A terrine of rabbit-and-root vegetables in aspic was perfectly seasoned; slices of rare duck breast were fanned over thin potato slices and celery root, moistened with a subtle raspberry-tinted dressing.
Among entrees, a superb dish is the tender roasted rabbit perched on a mound of mashed potatoes and ringed with a luxuriant truffle sauce with cubes of sauteed foie gras. The herb-crusted saddle of lamb swathed in French mustard, with Savoy cabbage, was also excellent.
Mille Fleurs offers an expensive, well-chosen, mostly French and Californian wine selection. Desserts emphasize flavor over flair: fresh apple strudel with raisins, cinnamon and rum sauce; orange creme bruee, and wonderful sorbets. A three-course dinner for two runs from $110 to $130.
 
Sally's
Just a jicama's toss from San Diego harbor is a breezy new American restaurant called Sally's -- part of the Hyatt Regency Hotel a short walk away. It's a terrific place to have lunch on a sunny day, especially if you sit outside at umbrella-shaded tables facing the bobbing pleasure boats. The snazzy restaurant is done in ocher tones with a high black ceiling, high-tech accents and handsome wooden booths.
Crab cakes are a good way to start, meaty, moist, well-browned and garnished with scallions. A gazpacho gussied up with shrimp was one dimensional, tasting only of tomatoes. The caesar salad entree with grilled chicken over it was nicely seasoned and fresh. Another appealing warm weather entree is poached salmon served over fanned cucumber slices in a sweetish vinaigrette that complimented the fish; grilled swordfish seasoned with thyme arrived just a tad overcooked but was otherwise tasty over peppery angel hair pasta with shiitakes and red peppers.
For dessert there are satisfying fruit tarts in almond crust and a surprisingly good creme brulee flavored with Grand Marnier (although the sugar crust was too thick). Lunch for two with a glass of wine runs from $50 to $75.
 
Cerveceria Santa Fe
One might reasonably assume that San Diego, a 30-minute drive from Tijuana, would be teeming with good Mexican restaurants. Curiously, this is not true. Mexican cuisine, by and large, seems to be considered one step up from Taco Bell. One can find superior individual dishes here and there, but, according to avid San Diego diners, no one place stands out.
If you are touring the city's downtown waterfront, Cerveceria Santa Fe, a year-old restaurant near the trolley depot, is worth a stop. The popular lunch spot is housed in a soaring industrial space that has been artfully softened with desert colors and palms.
The open air main dining room is breezy and pleasant about 10 months of the year; plastic flaps help in winter.
One of the house specialties is lobster tacos, in which the buttery lobster chunks are garnished with lettuce, cilantro and a creamy dressing. A spicy ceviche of fish was exceedingly vinegary and soupy; the ceviche of octopus and shrimp would be a better choice.
Garlic fans should head for the yellowtail flounder, well cooked and served with refried beans and yellow rice. Desserts are nondescript.
A three-course meal for two with a glass of beer or wine runs from $50 to $75.
 
Winesellar and Brasserie
You need the persistence of Lewis and Clark to find the Winesellar and Brasserie on the second floor of a building in an office park, above a wine shop. It is a modest, nondescript place with an open kitchen. Based on a recent visit, the contemporary French bistro fare is generally pleasing, although seasonings sometimes fall short. Service can be loopy.
For starters, charred eggplant with oven-dried tomatoes and herbed goat cheese was a nice combination, mitigated only by the ice cold vegetable. Ravioli of potato and leek with shiitakes were lackluster; a better choice would be the basil-cured salmon with sweet mustard sauce.
A good selection of mostly California wines is offered, although with this kind of menu more wines under $25 would be welcome.
Entrees were the best offerings, especially a succulent confit of duck leg presented over well-seasoned braised green lentils with a chicory salad. Grilled black angus filet mignon was exceptional, too, with a truffle-enriched red wine sauce and potatoes gratin.
Two rich but irresistible desserts are the warm caramelized apple clafoutis and a hazelnut cannoli filled with caramelized banana-mascarpone.
A three-course meal for two with a glass of wine costs about $80.

 BODY:

Crater Lake Park
 Q. I would like to visit Crater Lake National Park and have been told that an historic lodge there is being renovated. Can you give me any details? -- Don H. Chin, M.D., Portland, Ore. 
 A. After a $15 million, four-year renovation and reconstruction, the Crater Lake Lodge is scheduled to reopen on May 20. Built in 1915 as part of a larger project that was never finished, the lodge fell victim to high operating costs and a gradual decline in business through the Depression years of the 1920's and 30's.
The harsh climate at Crater Lake -- an average of 530 inches of snow falls there each year -- also took its toll on the buildings, which because of the developer's inexperience were not built to withstand the weight of the 15-foot snow drifts that are common there each winter.
Closed for most of World War II, the lodge reopened in 1946 but gradually deteriorated through the 1950's and 60's. It was acquired in 1967 by the National Park Service, which shut it down in 1989 after it was declared structurally unsafe. After some prodding from the Historic Preservation League of Oregon, renovation work began in 1991.
The lodge, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, stands on the rim of Crater Lake, a 21-square-mile expanse of blue water in the caldera of an extinct volcano on the summit of the Cascade Range.
The lodge, which is run by Crater Lake Lodge Inc., a concessionaire, will be open from May 20 to Oct. 14. Room rates range from $99 to $119 for one or two people and $169 for loft suites, for up to four people.
For reservations and more information write or call Crater Lake Lodge, Post Office Box 2704, White City, Ore. 97604; (503) 830-8700.
Two hundred yards west of the lodge is Rim Village, which is open all year. The Llao Rock Cafe there serves sandwiches, burgers and soft drinks. Gift shops sell postcards and souvenirs. In the winter Rim Village is a cross-country ski center, with skis and snowshoes for rent. There are no overnight accommodations.
Camp sites in the park are available from late May through mid-October, weather permitting, for $11 a night. Other overnight accommodations are available in Medford and Klamath Falls, the two towns nearest to the lake.
More information: Crater Lake National Park, Post Office Box 7, Crater Lake, Ore. 97604; (503) 594-2211.
 
 
Irish Exchanges
 Q. I would like to participate in a house swap with an Irish family this summer. Do you know of an agency I can contact? -- M. A. Hansen, Amagansett, L.I.
A. The two most active house exchange agencies in Ireland report that that they do business with two groups in the United States, one in California and one in Florida. They also say Americans should have no problem finding a swap in Ireland because so many of their clients want to vacation in the United States.
Intervac, based in San Francisco, was founded in 1951 and is therefore the oldest of the groups in the United States. It has 9,400 subscribers.
For a $65 fee, members receive three catalogues a year, published on Dec. 1, March 1 and May 1. Another catalogue is issued in June and costs an extra $19. There is an $11 charge for including a photo of any property you want to advertise. Houses in 36 countries are listed, including the British Isles, North and Central America, western Europe, and Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
More information: Intervac, Box 590504, San Francisco, Calif. 94159; (415) 435-3497 or (800) 756-4663.
The Vacation Exchange Club, which began in 1960, published its 394-page January 1995 book in December. Four others will be published this year.
Karl Costabel, the club's owner, said there were 7,000 entries in the January book, half with pictures. Two-thirds are in Europe, including Ireland; the rest are in North America, Mexico and Hawaii. A listing, plus the five books for 1995, costs $65. The charge for a horizontal photo is $15; a vertical photo is $20.
More information: Vacation Exchange Club, Box 650, Key West, Fla. 33041; (800) 638-3841.
 
Hong Kong to Singapore
 Q. I am planning a trip to the Orient in May or June and am interested in finding out about how to get from Hong Kong to Singapore in as economical a way as possible. -- Michael Meskers, Brooklyn
A. Unless you have unlimited time or a fear of flying the most feasible way of going is by air. When you book a ticket ask for New York to Singapore round trip, with a stopover in Hong Kong. And given a choice, go in May, which is in what airlines call the shoulder season, rather than June, when the high season begins and fares are increased.
Some airlines, including Northwest, Japan Airlines, United and Cathay Pacific, will give you the Hong Kong stopover without extra charge. On others, like Singapore Airlines, it will cost $75.
In economy class the lowest fare quoted in late February on a regular scheduled airline for May was $1,175 round trip plus $35 tax on Northwest. The fare is good for Monday to Thursday ($100 extra for travel on Friday, Saturday or Sunday). You would fly nonstop from New York to Tokyo and then be routed back through Hong Kong and Singapore.
If time is on your side and you would like to look into the possibility of taking a boat from Singapore, the following should be able to help:
Jecking Tours and Travel, Seventh Floor, China Insurance Building, 48 Cameron Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong; (852) 739-1188, fax (852) 721-2748.
Swire Travel, 18th Floor, Devon House, Taikoo Place, 979 King's Road, Quarry Bay, Hong Kong; (852) 579-6699, fax (852) 590-0099.
 
A Swiss Spa
 Q. In 1985 my wife and I spent some time in Chur, Switzerland, and visited Bad Ragaz, which had a thermal spa and a golf course. I would like to go there again but no one seems able to give me any information about it. Can you help? -- Seymour P. Gersten, Lake Worth, Fla.
A. Bad Ragaz, famous for its thermal springs since the Middle Ages, is a year-round resort with everything from luxury hotels to family-run pensions, a tennis center, ski slopes and horse racing in October. It is situated on the Rhine River, some 50 miles southeast of Zurich, with indoor and outdoor thermal pools and a casino.
A 48-page booklet in English and German called "Bad Ragaz," listing hotels and excursions, is available free of charge from the Swiss National Tourist Office, 608 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 757-5944. The office also publishes a 74-page guide to spas that includes a section on Bad Ragaz.

HEADLINE: Live-In Help Is Living In Style

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
HILDA Botero's employers just bought her a one-bedroom apartment on the first floor of their posh Greenwich Village town house co-op.
Adele Woods's employers gave her a choice of an exquisite third-floor suite or the bedroom across the hall from their own bedrooms in a 12,000-square-foot mansion on Albemarle Road near Prospect Park in Brooklyn. 
 A 24-year-old Frenchwoman considers herself luckier than her other au-pair friends because she has her own college-dormitory-sized suite on a floor below her employer's multimillion-dollar apartment in a luxury Fifth Avenue condominium building recently redesigned with separate staff quarters. She said her separate rooms give her "liberty -- and they have their privacy, too."
Live-in maids, gardeners, nannies and housekeepers may seem like characters out of P. G. Wodehouse -- or yet another reprise of "Upstairs, Downstairs" -- but New York City has thousands of them, and, to a certain extent, their happiness, and that of their employers, has played a role in the design, renovation, construction and use of many luxury apartments and buildings in New York City.
"In the old days, maids were into servitude," said Dolly Lenz, Sotheby's International Realty's top-selling agent, "and their employers wanted them underfoot; they got you every little thing you wanted. Now you're dealing with specialized and highly paid staff who want privacy; they're certainly not content with a little room in the back, off the kitchen."
Indeed, several top brokers said that using the existing maids' rooms in prewar apartments may not be possible -- and can be frowned upon -- for a variety of reasons.
Practically, many people who buy apartments with the traditional maid's room next to the kitchen want to knock the wall down and enlarge the kitchen, brokers say, following the trend in suburban houses to make bigger kitchens that supplant the more formal living room as a social center for the family.
Then, many people, while wanting live-in help, feel guilty about housing them in back of the kitchen. "It's perceived as inhumane," one employer said. "In the 90's, having the maid live off the kitchen is like scratching your fingernail across a blackboard," said Christopher Thomas, who manages William B. May's two Brooklyn offices.
Mr. Thomas said that in Brooklyn Heights, where the prices of town houses have soared in the last two years, buyers look for houses that have a ground-floor apartment, with a separate entrance, that they can use for the help, not for rental income. "The economics have changed," he said. "Now the rental income is below the threshold to make it an income-producing investment. They forgo the income to have the convenience of live-in help." Buyers also look for living quarters for staff over a garage or carriage house.
The staff, too, can be very selective about where they live. Far more staff people, of course, live out than live in. But those willing to live in -- either the young au pairs and nannies, sometimes from foreign countries, or the older woman or man whose children have long gone -- want their privacy. The young want to date, and the older staff may want their free time uninterrupted.
"It's not the same feeling, that the staff is a member of the family," said Jack Heller, the developer of a luxury condominium at 1049 Fifth Avenue, a reconstructed 1920's hotel at 86th Street, redesigned with 18 200-square-foot staff rooms on the third floor. "I grew up with live-in help and we had the same housekeeper and cook since I was born until I went to college. But today, there's a lot more turnover."
Mr. Heller sells his maids' rooms for $135,000; and, according to Ms. Lenz of Sotheby's, "people are begging for more." At 955 Fifth, she said, there are separate staff rooms off the lobby level and off some of the upper-floor corridors.
In condominium apartments -- Ms. Lenz's specialty -- there are separate quarters at 40 East 78th Street, a white brick building off Madison Avenue. There are 10 staff rooms behind the mailboxes and down a few steps from the first floor. "They're all spoken for," she said. There are also separate maid's quarters at 860 and 870 United Nations Plaza and 444 East 57th Street. James Heller, who is no relation to Jack Heller, said he had seven 300-square-foot staff rooms in the post-war co-op apartment building he manages, Plaza 400, at 56th Street and First Avenue. They are available for apartment owners on a "first-come, first-served basis," he said; there is a waiting list for the spaces, which rent for $550 a month and contain a living room, full bath, small utility kitchen and closet.
Many of the city's most elegant pre-war buildings -- 825 Fifth, 1111 Park, 840 Park (where Apartment 7B, with maid's room on a separate floor, is currently on the market for $1.35 million), 850 Park, 30 East 71st, 3 East 77th, 781 Fifth, 950 Fifth, 990 Fifth and many more -- still retain separate staff quarters, usually on a lower, and less salable, floor.
At 1 East 66th Street a one-bedroom on the fifth floor with a maid's room on the second floor is being offered for $325,000.
Many of the staff rooms in pre-war buildings, however, have been converted to other uses. At 31 East 79th Street and 260 West End Avenue, series of rooftop rooms have been strung together to create penthouses; lower-floor spaces in other buildings have been transformed into offices, gymnasiums, darkrooms, wine cellars and even a huge walk-in humidor.
One co-op board reportedly told a woman who wanted to use one of these pre-war maid's rooms for her housekeeper that the use was a thing of the past. Others disagree, and say there is a need for much more separate staff space. One well-known real estate broker, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, said that developers had started designing separate staff quarters on lower floors because "they don't want to give them any space in the apartment -- they'd rather sell the space on the lower floors, where nobody wants to buy apartments."
DONALD Trump, the developer, said that when buying a two- or three-bedroom apartment, "it's tough to give up one of the three bedrooms" to the help. "Many people don't really know the maid," he said, "and it feels different to have someone sleeping in the apartment at night." He said that the maids' attitudes also were different these days: "They don't like walking through a back hallway to go to their room."
At Trump Palace, at 200 East 69th Street, Mr. Trump has sold 10 of the least desirable of the building's 100 studio apartments as maid's quarters for $150,000 to $175,000 each. Ms. Lenz labeled them "real nice, with windows," adding that the original asking prices for these apartments had been $300,000 to $500,000, but they had actually sold for the lower figures. "That building was built before the maid's-room era really took off," she said.
Although the studio apartments were not originally designed as staff quarters, Mr. Trump said, their sale for that use "changed my mind." Nevertheless, he had already built seven staff suites on the 29th floor of Trump Tower, where his own housekeeper, Marcela Baudreau, lives. He said that he would incorporate an undetermined number of separate staff apartments on the lower floors of the new Trump International Tower and Hotel at Columbus Circle. "They're really a modern-day necessity," he said.
When rented out by their owners, he said, the staff rooms lease for $50 to $60 per square foot, or $12,500 to $18,000, a year. If sold, they average $400 to $500 per square foot for the 250- to 300-square-foot apartments.
DESPITE the cost, some employers say they feel it is cheaper, safer, and just plain more convenient to have live-in help. Dr. Lawrence Frank, a Brooklyn dermatologist who has employed Adele Woods for two years, points to the fact that Ms. Woods, besides cleaning the house, makes breakfast for him "every morning at 6:30, and you can't do that with outside help." While Ms. Woods lives on the second floor near the Franks' bedroom, her brother, Cyril Baptiste, who helps with the gardening in exchange for rent, lives in a room in the basement.
The live-in maids, nannies and housekeepers generally receive from $200 to $500 a week, according to the employers interviewed. The average salary for a live-in housekeeper among those interviewed is about $350 -- exactly what Ms. Woods makes -- a figure employers say is cheaper than they would pay someone who lives out, because they generally deduct something for room and board.
One employer, an executive in a prominent stock brokerage firm, said she paid her live-in housekeeper/nanny $390 a week, "which I think is pretty reasonable." Her friends who use day nannies pay around $500 a week, she said, "with overtime added on, and if you ask them to stay after dark, you have to pay for a taxi, too."
The separate spaces for live-in help are not easy to find -- especially when one is looking for the perfect apartment to go with them.
"It took me a year -- I saw 160 apartments -- before I saw the one I wanted," said one 33-year-old woman, a South American banker who has taken time off to raise her children. "I wanted three bedrooms and three baths, an eat-in kitchen and separate maid's quarters."
The woman said that the apartment she found on Park Avenue in the summer of 1993 had the traditional maid's room off the kitchen, and that she wanted to rip it out to make a large kitchen. But that wasn't the only reason she wanted separate a staff room.
"I wanted a live-in and I wanted both of us to have some privacy," she explained. "My housekeeper loves it because she has her own little territory." In her search, she said, she saw apartments with separate maid's rooms: "a couple in the 70's off Madison, one on 72d Street between Park and Lexington that had a maid's room off the lobby on the first floor." Most, she said, were on the lower floors.
She was delighted to find that the Park Avenue building had a room allotted to her apartment, but she was surprised when the board balked at letting her use it for its original purpose. "They were using them for storage and offices," she said. Ultimately, she persuaded the board to let her renovate the seedy space for a maid's quarters, "but they did it only as a concession, with the condition that if I want to sell it, it would not be advertised."
The reason for the board's resistance may be security -- people living in a separate apartment in the building who have not passed a board review -- or it may be because of a fear that the staff will bring in forbidden cooking appliances that might constitute a fire hazard. "I check the room all the time," the banker said. "I know what she has in there."
"The board claimed it was the trend not to use these rooms for help," she said, "but I feel it is just the opposite; the demand for these rooms is high."
Deanna Kory, the Halstead Property Company's 's top selling agent, said she was trying to find separate maid's quarters for a client. "They're living in a six-room apartment and they bought a one-bedroom in the same building on the first floor for staff," Ms. Kory said. "Now they want to move to a bigger apartment and they want their housekeeper to live in a separate apartment so they can maintain the same arrangement."
She said her clients want to furnish the separate space because "by doing so, they get the loyalty and commitment they don't get otherwise."
In the Eldorado, a co-op on Central Park West at 90th Street, Ms. Kory sold a previously unsalable unit that had been cut off decades ago from the back of a large apartment.
It was bought by a man who lived on a different floor in the building and who is boarding his housekeeper. Ms. Kory said she occasionally sold first and second floor "regular" apartments to employers for their live-in help.
That is exactly what Larry E. Condon and his sister Diane did for their housekeeper of nine years, Hilda Botero.
When a one-bedroom apartment on the first floor of the wide brownstone in which they live on East 11th Street became available, the Condons considered buying it for Ms. Botero, who had been commuting from her two-bedroom apartment in Queens, where she had lived for 27 years.
"Larry asked me if I would come live here if he bought the apartment," Ms. Botero said. "Before, I had to get up at 6, take a shower, walk to Queens Boulevard and take a subway. Now I can get up at 7, 7:30."
THE first time she saw the 600-square-foot apartment, she was not exactly delighted.
"This wall was brown," she said, gesturing to the 22-foot-long expanse from the front windows, which face on the street, to the back of the new kitchen, with its white formica cabinets and white range. "The furniture was brown, the cabinets were yellow, everything was dirty."
The Condons bought the apartment, which has a wood-burning fireplace and a $470 monthly maintenance, for $95,000 -- and proceeded to invest an additional $60,000 to redo it completely. They painted and wallpapered the whole apartment and brought in some of their own furniture. Ms. Botero moved in three months ago.
"Now, I don't change for nothing; I love it," the housekeeper said. "I was supposed to move to California with my son -- he's an actor -- but I said, 'No, leave me here.' "
For Mr. Condon, who heads the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, the one-bedroom apartment is a good investment. "But it's more of an investment in life," he said. "We go to the farm market together and I took her to ABC Carpet and Bed, Bath and Beyond, and she's found a church here, where she goes to Saturday mass.
"It's been absolutely perfect since the first day."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Prescriptions for Housing Programs

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
NO city comes close to New York in its spending for housing development. Focusing mainly on restoring the tax-foreclosed housing stock for low-income people, the city has spent $3.6 billion over the last eight years.
The results are visible in far-flung neighborhoods, where once-abandoned apartment buildings have been restored. In addition, hundreds of new houses have gone up on vacant city-owned land. 
 A new report called "Building in Partnership: A Blueprint for Urban Housing Programs" says the programs that produced this housing have made the city's neighborhoods the "world's largest and most diverse laboratory for testing innovative strategies in housing development and finance."
The report was written by Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, one of the key participants in city housing programs, and funded by the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation. Extracting from what it finds to be both successes and failures in these strategies, Ms. Wylde makes the case for two basic propositions: Structured programs that bring in competitive development proposals are superior to subsidy packages tailored to individual projects or developers, and nonprofit intermediaries and community-based organizations should take part in designing and implementing housing programs.
Advice abounds: Cut development costs (six ways to do it); speed the development process (nine suggestions); maximize the contribution of nonprofits (four suggestions); attract more private investment (eight suggestions).
One point that comes through loud and clear is that new production for those least able to afford its cost -- very low-income people and the homeless -- is likely to subside drastically once rehabilitations of tax-foreclosed buildings subsides. Very low-income households are the ones that need the most financial assistance per housing unit built, since they have the least capacity to repay the true cost through rent. More private investment is needed to "leverage" public money, the report makes clear. That suggests that the beneficiaries must be people better able to pay back the cost, whether in rental or for-sale housing.
At least one objective advocated in the Housing Partnership report has already been taken up by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He announced it under the acronym "Anchor" in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn in December.
Anchor stands for Alliance for Neighborhood Home Ownership and Revitalization. Its goal is to bring job development and retail facilities to an area that has already had a burst of new city-assisted home development. The Anchor district is bounded by Atlantic and Bushwick Avenues and Malcolm X Boulevard, where Bushwick, Ocean Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant meet. Over the last two years almost 2,000 new housing units have been built within or near it, but the commercial vacancy rate is 40 percent.
The Anchor concept is hardly novel, but it does call attention to the often repeated axiom that new housing cannot stand alone. Supplementary facilities, services and jobs must accompany or soon follow new housing in depopulated areas, or the housing itself ultimately will be threatened.
MORE immediately, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development is focused on its Building Blocks program to transfer to nonprofits, private owners or tenants the 30,000 housing units in mostly occupied tax-foreclosed buildings that are currently under city management. The units would also be rehabilitated with city loans or grants.
The capital cost of rehabilitating the buildings is now estimated by city officials at $50,000 a unit, or $1.5 billion for all 30,000. This projection is much higher than city officials provided for a similar program under the Dinkins administration. At $50,000 a unit, the cost would be far above normal in private-sector buildingwide improvements to mostly occupied buildings. These costs usually range between $25,000 to $30,000 a unit.
The Partnership report says that the most significant housing trend in New York City in the 80's was the rising rate of owner-occupancy. During the decade, the percentage of households who owned their home or apartment rose to 30 percent from 27 percent.
Another trend was occurring at the same time -- the rise of the homelessness issue. Fully 72 percent of the city money for production spent from 1987 to 1993, or $2.3 billion, was for this low-income or no-income population. To operate it the city taps Federal community development block grants, often at a level of about $3,000 an apartment a year. Tenant rent pays the rest of the $5,000-a-year needed.
"Rehabilitations for very-low-income people will be extremely difficult over the next few years," said Carol Parry, who runs the community development group at Chemical Bank, a lender to assisted-housing efforts. "We will still be able to do the home ownership projects, and the rentals that require less subsidy per unit."
One form of indirect subsidy available to the city, not discussed in the Partnership report, is tax relief to private rental buildings with low-income tenants. Those buildings -- often unrehabilitated and burdened by one or more mortgages -- lose tenants to the handsomely rehabilitated low-rent buildings financed by the city, which pay no taxes and often have no mortgage debt either. Overtaxation of low-income private rentals also feeds the tax-foreclosure pipeline.
Another approach that could be given greater emphasis involves low-interest loans for moderate rehabilitation of occupied rental buildings. Such programs have long been in use but in recent years the capital budget has focused instead on major renovation of the city-owned stock.
THE Housing Partnership report shows that different types of new housing will have widely varying costs, depending on site conditions, project design and financing mechanisms. The least expensive on a per-unit basis is the Nehemiah program of small-home construction, operating on large, cleared tracts in East Brooklyn and the South Bronx. This church-sponsored low-overhead operation benefits also from interest-free construction loans from church sources. In the Bronx, the report says, Nehemiah is building 422 single-family and condominium units at an average cost of $77,250 a unit, which includes a city subsidy per-unit of $15,000.
That compares with higher costs when the developer is building on scattered sites, and higher still when the housing type is a multiple dwelling using tax-exempt financing. At one rental development in Queens serving roughly the same income population as the Nehemiah houses, for instance, the development costs were $108,000 a unit, which includes a city subsidy of $59,000 a unit.
Construction costs are critical, since to the extent that they can be reduced, less public assistance is needed. But in New York City economic barriers are built into the development process itself. The Partnership report notes that building and fire code requirements combined with handicapped-access rules "make new construction of four-story, three-family homes almost impossible under existing programs."
Similarly, reviewing agencies are in a position to impose unrealistic conditions on private development. The report cites the Soundview Peninsula development in the Bronx, which had weak sales and defaulted on its loan from a bank. The project is still obliged to build an expensive shorefront esplanade and meet other approval conditions although it was "marginally feasible in the first place," the report says.
Regulatory impediments to private development have been a major concern of the City Planning Commission lately. "We have to clarify and simplify the zoning code," said Joseph B. Rose, the chairman. "We are mapping more areas for mixed-use zoning. The current rate of new housing production is not adequate."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
A Plan for Housing the Homeless, With Counseling

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: STAMFORD

 BODY:
AN application is expected to be filed here this week for a zoning amendment that would pave the way for a comprehensive program to house and counsel homeless single men and women. The proposed zoning change is part of a statewide effort to address the homeless problem. Twelve sites in nine Connecticut towns and cities have been targeted for the creation of a total of 400 apartments, financed and managed cooperatively by 6 state agencies, 21 nonprofit organizations and a variety of philanthropies and corporations.
If the Stamford zoning amendment is granted, it would permit the construction of 41 studio and one-bedroom apartments at 85 Franklin Street, and 25 similar apartments at 44 Ludlow Street. 
 A public hearing on the amendment, which defines supportive housing as a permitted use and calls for a special exception to allow it at the two sites, will be scheduled within 60 days.
The two buildings are to cost a total of $2.5 million. For at least half the tenants, their home will be a halfway house since some of them will be coming out of recovery programs for psychiatric disorders and substance abuse. A few will have AIDS.
The other half will be low-income working people unable to afford decent housing in the city. Stamford's two shelters for the homeless currently accommodate a total of 500 to 600 people a night.
Tenants in the new buildings who earn half or less of the median income of $27,000 for a single person in Stamford will pay 30 percent of their incomes in rent. With Federal subsidies, a tenant could pay as little as $125 a month.
Most importantly, these will be permanent dwellings. As long as the tenant pays rent and behaves responsibly he or she can stay for a lifetime. If incomes rise, so will the rent. The tenant may move out, but no one can be evicted because of higher earnings.
An equally important feature is the built-in support system. Each building will have a live-in counselor with an office equipped to arrange treatment for tenants through cooperating state agencies. According to the Corporation for Supportive Housing, a Manhattan-based nonprofit organization that provides planning and seed money for this type of housing, the program closes the revolving door of temporary shelters, sporadic health care, possible jail terms and hospital stays, and does so at lower cost.
"Institutionalizing a homeless person with a disability can cost upwards of $100,000 a year," said Julie Sandorf, president of the corporation. "A shelter bed costs about $21,000 a year, while supportive housing costs between $10,000 and $15,000 a year. We have 3,000 units occupied or under construction nationwide and 2,000 more in the pipeline."
The corporation was founded in 1991 with $10 million from a coalition of the Pew Charitable Trusts, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and The Ford Foundation. It has since helped to create 2,000 units in New York City, 700 in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1,000 in Chicago, and smaller amounts in Phoenix, Atlanta, and Minneapolis-St. Paul.
THE Connecticut program is the first statewide application. An initial $450,000 was provided by The Melville Foundation, a family philanthropy set up by the owners of the Melville Corporation of Rye, N.Y., whose main business is its 10 department stores.
Unlike the units in Stamford's two new buildings, the others will be installed in existing hotels and apartment houses. Renovation is cheaper than new construction and recycling for the same or similar use is less likely to require zoning amendments.
All of the housing in the program will be a far cry from shoddy single-occupancy hotels with baths down the hall, violently deranged occupants and seedy drunks sleeping in hallways. Prospective tenants must demonstrate their ability to live independently within acceptable parameters of behavior.
Each apartment will be equipped with a kitchen, bathroom and window blinds and partially furnished. Most buildings will have common rooms with kitchens for group functions, laundries and, when possible, landscaped seating areas outdoors.
The focus on single people resulted from research showing that 85 percent of the homeless are single, and that support services were essential for the 75 percent who are identified with chronic disabilities.
"We were invited to Connecticut two years ago by the Weicker administration," said Ms. Sandorf of the Corporation for Supportive Housing, "to see how state housing money might be used more effectively."
Ten of the 12 projects will be eligible for a share of $20 million in bonds authorized under the Weicker administration for supportive housing in fiscal 1995 ending June 30, according to Lynn Aronson, director of housing resources for the Department of Mental Health, one of the participating state agencies. The other two projects will come on line later.
"Each project was selected by the state's Housing Department," she said. The owner-developers are state-designated, nonprofit organizations. "They must apply individually for bonding and pass muster with Connecticut Housing Finance Authority in order to secure a mortgage loan."
A bond application for the Stamford project will be submitted by its sponsor, St. Luke's Community Services, in May or June. Last September, $2.2 million in bonds were issued by the state's Department of Housing for a project in Middletown, sponsored by The Connecticut Fund and St. Vincent de Paul Place, both local philanthropies. The state's Housing Finance Authority provided an additional $500,000 for the project, which calls for the creation of 40 apartments and two stores in the former Arriwani Hotel.
IN Bridgeport, a late 19th-century apartment house listed on the National Register of Historic Places and known as the Edinburgh Crescent Building at 431 Washington Avenue and a vacant apartment house at 2450 Main Street are to be renovated by the Central Connecticut Coast Y.M.C.A. to produce a total of 64 units. The remaining sites are in Hartford, Meriden, Windham, New Haven, Bristol and New Britain.
Underwriters for the mortgage loans are the state's Housing Finance Authority and its Department of Housing. "Based on the figures coming in for development and property acquisition," said Lenward Gatison, vice president for housing development and mortgage financing at the housing-finance agency, "The $20 million in bonds will fall short. The Department of Housing will ask for $5 million more in this session of the General Assembly."
Once the buildings are occupied, the tenants will be served by the state's Departments of Mental Health, Social Services and Public Health & Addiction Services. Rent subsidies will be provided by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development; operating expenses and contingency funds will be supplied by private investors. "Obviously, the tenants cannot generate enough rental income," said Janice Elliott, director of Supportive Housing's Connecticut program, based in New Haven.
"Federal tax credits," she noted, "make it a worthwhile investment for corporations and foundations, guaranteeing a 17 percent return annually over a 10-year period."
Connecticut, according to "Cities Without Suburbs" by David Rusk, published in 1933, ranks first in the nation in the degree of economic separation between its cities and suburbs. Statewide figures on the homeless who used shelters in 1993-94 totaled 17,693 different people, not repeaters.
Regardless of the perceived need, and the work that has gone into the supportive housing program to date, there is concern about its future under the conservative fiscal policy of Gov. John G. Rowland.
Ten of the 12 projects designated by the state for supportive housing, including two each in Stamford and Bridgeport and one in Middletown, have received preconstruction loans of $75,000 to $150,000 from the Corporation for Supportive Housing. But only the Middletown project has secured state bonding.
"The Governor is chairman of the bonding commission," said James A. Sullivan, a section director in the Office of Policy and Management. "He can delay, approve, or not bring this before the commission at all. Authorization is not allocation."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Garages;
As an Investment, Parking's Attractive

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
A DECADE ago, when Rockefeller Center began assembling land at Seventh Avenue and 49th Street, it had in mind a 1.6 million-square-foot office tower. Four months ago, it opened a parking lot instead.
Edison Parking, which has the contract to manage it, agreed to a 30-day cancellation clause. That means that Rockefeller Center can quickly revert to Plan A as soon as it pre-leases enough space in the proposed building to warrant breaking ground. 
 "Sure, we'd rather have a building, but for now a parking lot is nice income," said William J. Maloney, president of the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation.
Parking, the bane of Manhattan drivers, is becoming a boon to all manner of Manhattan business people. Developers, investors and garage operators, many of whom treaded water in the recession, are again pursuing garage properties and contracts.
"When a garage comes on the market these days, it spikes huge interest," said Robert A. Knakal, president of Massey Knakal Realty Services, a sales broker.
"Well-located parking properties definitely command a premium," said Edward S. Gordon, the real estate executive who owns a controlling interest in Myers Parking.
Parking's attraction is understandable. It is a cash business. And it does not require an educated workforce or a lot of computers.
"Parking is commercial real estate in its most simplistic form -- renting space to a car," said Benjamin Fox, a partner in the New Spectrum brokerage.
Of course, that is an oversimplification in itself. Many garage buildings include stores, so their owners must deal with complicated retail leases. Large parking chains do have elaborate accounting systems. And since a bomb exploded in the World Trade Center garage two years ago, many have tightened their security procedures.
(The Trade Center, not surprisingly, has the tightest security of all. The Twin Towers garage is closed to the public. Pictures of tenants and their vehicles are on file. No one else can drive a tenant's car into the garage, and tenants cannot, without prior arrangement, drive another car in themselves.)
But such modern-day wrinkles are not dissuading garage owners or operators. Indeed, unlike in the 80's, when garages and lots were purchased with an eye to building something else on their underlying land, today they are attractive on their own.
"A lot of people outside the business are bidding for properties now," said Saul P. Schwartz, president of Kinney System. "They learned that garages that were built to service a building often yield better cash flow than the building itself."
That is one reason owners of parking properties are rarely in a hurry to sell. According to the Real Estate Board of New York, 11 parking properties changed hands in 1993, for a total of $6.1 million. Even in 1987, when money chased any kind of property, only 28 parking facilities changed hands, for a total of $53.2 million.
"We're seeing a lot more transactions today, considering there were virtually none between 1990 and 1992," said Jonathan S. Miller, executive managing director of Grubb & Ellis New York, who specializes in investment sales.
WOULD-BE buyers, in contrast, are champing at the bit. Rolls-Royce recently closed its dealership at 407 East 61st, and the building is on the market. Mr. Knakal, who is handling the sale, said he had already received several inquiries. He believes that a garage is the "highest and best use" for the building, which is in an area not zoned for residential development. Mr. Miller is not so sure. He said that limousine services and even a large discount retailer had asked him to make inquiries about the building.
Meanwhile, garage operators are starting to buy properties as well as lease them. The Mallah family, one of New York's largest garage managers, is about to buy the garage at 10-20 West 48th Street that Kinney, looking to reduce debt from a leveraged buyout, sold to a developer in 1990. The developer later lost it to his lenders.
Kinney, with a cleaned-up balance sheet, also is back in acquisition mode. "Foreclosed garage properties make for fertile ground," Mr. Schwartz said.
Even speculative investors are warming to the income stream that parking provides. La Salle Partners has raised $76 million for an Income Parking Fund, which has already acquired five garages. One is in New York, on 50th Street near Lexington Avenue.
"Some of our parking properties may turn into development sites some day," said Wade W. Judge, La Salle's managing director. "But in the 90's secure cash returns have more appeal than hope certificates."
Mr. Wade says that the Manhattan garage was by far the fund's most expensive investment. It may also be the most risk-free, in that garage space is virtually certain to remain scarce here. City officials, worried about pollution and congestion, stopped granting permits for free-standing garages more than a decade ago. Parking lots require large land parcels -- not exactly amply available in Manhattan. And they require a cumbersome community board approval process.
"The city fathers are being really stupid," said Abraham Hirschfeld, a garage builder who has dabbled in politics himself. "A well-managed garage can really revitalize a neglected block."
Indeed, ever since the recession squelched development, parking lots and garages represent the only life on some Manhattan stretches. The numerous lots on Avenue of the Americas, from 23d to 32d Streets, were supposed to house office towers long before now. The blocklong enclosed garage at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street was once slated for development.
Conversely, the Silverstein Properties site on 42d Street between 11th and 12th Avenue had an existing parking lot when Larry Silverstein bought it in the 80's. Unlike other would-be Times Square developers, Mr. Silverstein did not put up a "taxpayer" -- a short, stand-alone retail building that's quick and cheap to erect -- while he sought zoning changes to allow him to put up a bigger building there. "A taxpayer would have provided better money, but we always figured we'd be building sooner rather than later," Mr. Silverstein said.
The lot remains there to this day. "It's not a terrific source of income, but it helps to cover the taxes," Mr. Silverstein said.
What is just frosting to developers who still dream of skyscrapers is the entire cake for Edison, Myers, Kinney and the other operators whose entire business revolves around parking. The dearth of new garages means they must find new ways to expand.
One way is to get management contracts for municipal garages, hospital lots, or other parking facilities that are run by the not-for-profit sector. "Privatization is a big goal in this industry," said Marsha Williams, director of membership services for the Washington-based National Parking Association.
Another is to market more extensively. Many garages offer special promotions like "early bird specials" or tie-ins with restaurants and theaters.
BUT the most prevalent way is to go after each other's contracts. And building owners are capitalizing on the fierce competition. "There is no shortage of competitors willing to pay top dollar for a garage lease," said Adam R. Rose, executive vice president of Rose Associates.
Mr. Rose, like many landlords, is cracking down on the operators of his garages. And he is not just arguing over fees.
For example, when the lease at the Rose-managed co-op at 45 East 89th Street came up for renewal, Mr. Rose refused to renew until the operator, who had been there 25 years and was paying about $1 million annually in rent, agreed to put $250,000 into renovations. Rose Associates kicked in $2 million itself. The garage will soon have customer bathrooms, better lighting and signs, and a refurbished waiting area.
The new lease spells out how the garage must be maintained. "We've even specified how many times it must be cleaned and what uniforms the staff must wear," said Mr. Rose, who refers to himself as "garage obsessed."
It is an obsession with a logical underpinning. During the last few years Rose Associates has renovated nine lobbies and countless corridors, built 13 model apartments and paid for numerous newspaper ads, all to woo buyers to the co-ops it manages.
"It was ridiculous to then let people form their first impression of a building from its shabby garage," he said.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Decision Affects Nonpurchasing Rent-Stabilized Tenants;
State Agency Grants Rise In Rent at New York Co-op

 BODY:
Applications for rent increases in co-op apartments occupied by rent-stabilized tenants are expected to increase following the grant, for the first time, of a "comparative hardship" increase by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
The decision, issued late last year in a case filed in 1985, involves a 149-unit building at 203-205 East 72d Street. The applicant for the increase, the sponsor of the building's co-op conversion, had retained unsold shares for 75 rent-stabilized apartments. 
 The hardship application requested a 53 percent rent increase amounting to $73,182 a year. The state agency, which administers rent-regulation laws, awarded $20,160 a year, which comes to $5.54 a room a month, retroactive to June 1, 1987. The retroactive portion has been stayed pending the outcome of a request for reconsideration filed by the tenants. "In my opinion, the die is cast," said Jeffrey Turkel, the Manhattan lawyer who represented the applicant.
Eliot Zuckerman, a Manhattan real-estate lawyer, said that "there are lots of buildings where sponsors still own blocks of apartments, and many may now file an application for an increase." The "comparative hardship" increase, Mr. Zuckerman said, is given when an owner can prove that the profit he or she is making or should be making on a rent-stabilized apartment has been diminished or wiped out by the effects of rent stabilization. To prove the need for such an increase, he said, the owner must compare income and expenses over a three-year "base period," usually the first three years of ownership, with a three-year "test period," typically the three years immediately preceding the filing.
Martin Heistein, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, called the decision "a major plus for the owners." He said he had received a "tremendous number" of inquiries and had "already begun the process of filing a large number of hardship applications."
Tenant advocates denounced the decision. "It allows somebody who is not even the owner of a building to selectively apply for rent increases on top of the regular increases he gets and basically price nonpurchasing tenants out of the building," said Michael McKee, director of development for the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition.

Joseph R. Potenza, planning commissioner for White Plains and executive director of its Urban Renewal Agency, will talk about an updated comprehensive plan for the municipality. The plan includes improvement of the downtown shopping district and completion of the Central Urban Renewal Project.
Offering a view from Stamford -- White Plains's retailing rival -- will be Sandra Goldstein, a director of the Stamford Downtown Consortium, the Chamber of Commerce and the Mayor's Multicultural Council and a former president of the Stamford Board of Legislators. Her subject will be how the redevelopment of Stamford's downtown was accomplished.
The cocktail reception, dinner and two speeches cost $50. The number to call for reservations and information is 328-9703.
 
AUSCHWITZ MEMORIES
 The train ride to Auschwitz, how Joseph Mengele selected his victims and death marches are to be recalled in a talk by Livia Krancberg, a 76-year-old survivor of the concentration camp at Auschwitz.
The program will be held tomorrow at 1:30 P.M. in Reisinger Auditorium of Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers.
Ms. Krancberg's testimony is included in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's Archives and the Yale University Archives, among others, and she is participating in the oral history recording of "Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation," produced by Steven Spielberg.
She has lectured in many colleges and high schools in the New York City area and was honored by her community, Woodbridge, N.J., for her contributions to preserving Holocaust history.
Her lecture is part of Sarah Lawrence's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Admission is free. For information and directions, the number is 395-2411.
 
H-TWO-OH!
 Water, water is everywhere at the "Sea and Shore" exhibition opening today at the Hopper House Art Center in Nyack. The 10-artist invitational show will run through March 26.
Streams, rivers, oceans, ponds and lakes are depicted, "making visual the certainty that spring is just around the corner," said D. Robert Brebbia, the show's curator and one of the exhibiting artists. The other painters are Allan F. Avery, Janet F. Avery, Elwood G. Bengert, Beverly B. Colgan, James Harrington, Martha L. Heatley, Henri Jatho, Sally Spivack and Edward M. Warzala.
The paintings are soothingly traditional, executed in watercolor, oils or acrylics.
The center, at 82 North Broadway in Nyack, was once the boyhood home of the painter Edward Hopper.
A reception will be held today from noon to 5 P.M. Regular hours thereafter are Fridays from 5 to 8 P.M. and Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. Admission is free, or by donation of $1. More information is available by calling 358-0774.
 
SINGING OUT
 The Boys Choir of Harlem, founded in 1968 as a small church group, has become a major musical institution with an infectious, irresistible style. Under the guidance of its director, Dr. Walter J. Turnbull, the choir has toured Europe, the United States and Asia, entertaining at the White House, the United Nations and in Manhattan's concert halls.
The choir will appear in concert on Saturday at 7 P.M. in the Academic Arts Theater of Westchester Community College in Valhalla, performing a wide-ranging repertory of sacred music, gospel, ragtime, jazz and spirituals. Tickets at $15 and $10 for children and people 65 and older can be reserved by calling 785-6567.
 
MUSIC FOR YOUNGER SET
 Joanie Bartels's performances on Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel have earned the approval not only of young viewers but also of Parents magazine and Child magazine.
She will appear today at 1:30 P.M. at the Tarrytown Music Hall, 13 Main Street, in a concert of music that moves from Brahms to the Beatles, her own compositions, rock 'n' roll and Broadway show tunes. Singing and strumming her guitar, she puts on a choreographed show that appeals to many parents. Her audiocassette called "Lullaby" won a gold record.
Tickets are $12 at the door. The number to call for information is 693-7898.
 
THE CREATIVE CHILD
 The College of New Rochelle will begin a five-week program for creative children from 4 to 12 years old on Saturday mornings. The sessions will last an hour and a half, and there will be two sessions each Saturday at 9 A.M. and 10:30 A.M., starting this week.
Children will be divided into three age groups from pre-kindergarten through sixth grade, and they may choose from subjects like science, art, drama, architecture, computers and business. One five-week course costs $80, and children who sign up for both courses will be charged $140. Discounts are available for more than one child in a family.
Dr. Susan Baum, assistant professor of education of gifted and talented children in the college's graduate school, developed the program, she said, because of "budget cuts in many Westchester schools that have done away with gifted and talented programs."
The college is at 29 Castle Place in downtown New Rochelle. The information number is 654-5330.
 
DO-IT-YOURSELF
 If the extent of your home maintenance skills is limited to changing a light bulb, you might want to attend a series of three free workshops aimed at making you handier around the house and saving money on repair bills.
Sol Berkowitz will conduct the workshops, sponsored by the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Westchester, at the downtown New Rochelle Public Library off North Avenue. "Leaky Faucets" will be the program this Wednesday from 2 to 4 P.M., followed by "Simple Home Repairs" on March 22 and "Lamp Repairs" on April 5. The registration number is 632-7878. ELEANOR CHARLES

A Level Playing Field, for Just $121

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
THE degree to which companies have trouble complying with civil rights legislation on behalf of disabled people appears to have more to do with their cultures than with the demands of the law. In an assessment of compliance at Sears, Roebuck & Company, Peter D. Blanck, a psychologist at the University of Iowa who has studied people with disabilities, found that the large retailer had little trouble bringing its own efforts into sync with the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and spent little money doing so. The law bans discrimination and requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations" to employees and job applicants with a range of illnesses and disabilities.
Trade associations and business groups have long complained that the law opened up a potentially infinite horizon of expense, especially burdening small business. Disability rights groups argue that the "reasonable accommodation" clause of the law by definition prevents the Government from imposing ruinous requirements on business. Most accommodations, they contend, can be made with little cost. 
 The report on Sears, which has sponsored a program to match disabled people and jobs since 1972, appears to support that contention.
From 1978 to 1992, according to Mr. Blanck's report, Sears made 436 accommodations, at a total cost of some $53,000. More than two-thirds of them cost nothing; 28 percent cost less than $1,000. Thirteen, or 3 percent, cost more than $1,000. The average cost of an accommodation was $121. The accommodations involving little or no cost included flexible scheduling, training, back-support belts, rest periods and changes in employee work stations. The largest single cost, at $14,500 each, went for special Braille computer displays for visually impaired employees.
Mr. Blanck said employers need to think of the law as "evolutionary, not revolutionary. For companies with a culture of diversity and inclusion, the A.D.A. doesn't change much. They've been doing it all along."
In a related article, published in the Iowa Law Review, Mr. Blanck reported that the incomes and employment opportunities of some mentally ill adults are on the rise. While the majority -- 59 percent -- of the 1,110 people in the study showed no employment movement from 1990 to 1993, a quarter of them improved the quality of their employment. The unemployment level for all participants dropped 3 percentage points, to 33 percent in 1993 from 36 percent in 1990. The unemployment rate in Oklahoma, where Mr. Blanck's subjects live, rose in that period. The gross annual income of all participants went up.
Mr. Blanck also saw good news in the finding that more of the mentally disabled are speaking out for themselves. "There is a ninefold increase in participation in self-help programs," he said. "There's a tremendous growth in awareness of rights." The improvements were greater for women than men and for younger than older people.
The Sears report includes case histories companies may find useful. Copies are available from the Annenberg Washington Program, where Mr. Blanck is a senior fellow, at 202-393-7100; fax: 202-638-2745, T.D.D.: 202-393-4121.
 
Helping Women
 Any woman who feels as if she has to dress her personality in corporate drag to succeed may want to think about attending a summer leadership program in California. Now in its second year at Stanford University and its third year overall, the Summer Executive Institute on Women and Leadership is offering eight-day courses to female executives. The program is sponsored by the Institute for Research on Women and Gender at Stanford.
Leadership is gender-neutral, say the course teachers, Margaret O'Keefe Umanzio and Paola Gianturco, who have experience in advising companies on organizational redesign, the glass ceiling and communications strategies. But many women and people of color, in particular, feel they have to assume an uneasy -- competitive, controlling, confrontational -- identity to make their mark. Corporate change is opening up opportunities, the two teachers say.
"Structure, order, hierarchy: they are all coming apart," Ms. Umanzio said. "You can't hide behind roles, titles, status, position. It no longer works."
Last year the course drew a cross-section of accomplished women, from age 30 to 55, with a range of degrees and credentials. "The managerial skills were all in place," Ms. Gianturco said. "Many were about to assume additional responsibilities and wanted to expand their competencies."
The eight days include lecture/seminars, "homework" in the form of written exercises, creativity exercises in classes and a real-world project to be completed back at work after the course is over.
This summer there will be three sessions: June 15-23, July 13-21 and Aug. 17-25. The first session will be held at a conference center in Monterey, the July and August sessions at Stanford. Tuition is $6,000; participants are typically sponsored by their companies.
For information, call 415-221-4545.
 
A Show of Power
 To encourage companies to put more women on their boards and generally to recognize female talent, a group of women in the financial industry is sponsoring "Women Investors Day" on March 14. The group is organizing a mass mailing to investment companies of letters from investors and stockholders urging companies to consider women for openings on boards and in top management positions. There will be receptions for participants in Washington, San Francisco and New York.
For information, contact the Women Investors Committee, P.O. Box 1783, Murray Hill Station, New York, N.Y. 10156-0611; (703-978-2491); or Dale Grant, vice chairman of the Segal Company in New York, at 212-251-5016. The Internet address is wominv@worldweb.net.

INTERNATIONL
 
Barings P.L.C.: 28-Year-Old Brings Down 233-Year-Old
Robert L. Citron. Joseph Jett. And now, Nicholas W. Leeson. The 28-year-old, a trader in the Singapore office of Barings P.L.C., has joined the gallery of those charged with larger-than-life investment mistakes. By betting $29 billion on derivatives in the Japanese markets and losing more than $1 billion, Mr. Leeson managed last week to sink Barings, a 233-year-old British investment firm that financed the Louisiana Purchase and oversaw royal fortunes. Mr. Leeson, at right, bet that Japanese stocks and interest rates would rise. Both fell, and then the story sped up: the Bank of England tried to rescue Barings and failed, Barings went bankrupt and on the block, Mr. Leeson was on the lam until his arrest in Frankfurt. When the dust settles, one issue will stand out: What has happened to finance that individuals can bring huge institutions to their knees? 

Flamboyant Financier Dies
Bernard Cornfeld, the controversial American financier, died in London last week at age 67. His death, from stroke and pneumonia, sparked the same divided views he inspired in the 1960's and 1970's when he sold mutual funds and other investments to Americans abroad through his company, Investors Overseas Services. "He championed taking a buck from anybody, without scruples," said a securities lawyer. "He was a brilliant, absolutely brilliant, innovator," countered a mutual fund manager. But, with his French castle and retinue of models and celebrities, one fact is indisputable: Bernie, whose empire was worth $2.5 billion at its height, had color.
 
Piracy Accord: Paper Tiger?
The United States and China finally sealed a deal last week over piracy of "The Lion King," Microsoft MS-DOS and other intellectual property, and the terms looked pretty stiff: China would start a six-month crackdown on violators and would bolster its customs officers' powers. But cautious executives said success hinges on strong enforcement. "This is the beginning, not the end," said one. Still, while piracy surely pays, China has strong reasons to mollify America. Of the two nations' $45 billion in trade, $37 billion is Chinese exports. And America can help China get something it dearly wants: entry into the World Trade Organization.
 
Sour Notes, Second Thoughts
The $20 billion Mexican rescue package may be signed, but clouds are gathering fast. On Monday, Banamex, the Mexican bank, announced layoffs of up to 35 percent of its 33,000 employees. On Wednesday, former President Salinas blamed current President Zedillo for the crisis, saying his advisers should have kept mum about their plans to prevent a drain on Mexico's money reserves. And, up north, discontent with the bailout led the House to ask for all the Administration's Mexican files. "Pessimism all around," said one analyst.
 
ECONOMY
 
Gunning for Glass-Steagall
Get ready for the firm of Salomon, Chemical & Aetna, or somesuch. Efforts are growing in Washington to allow mergers among banks, securities companies, insurers and other enterprises, thus discarding the 60-year-old Glass-Steagall Act and other limits on financial institutions. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Rubin sketched out the Administration's plan, with Alan Greenspan generally approving of it the next day. Then come the Republicans' two Congressional bills on the issue. But the proposals' details differ, and critics warn that consumers and small businesses may be hurt by such mergers. "Cross-ownership at the expense of Main Street," one opponent called the idea.
 
Dollar Dives; Fed Buys
No, the peso is not the only currency on the rocks. After sliding lower all year, the dollar hit a record low against the yen last week and, for the first time in four months, the Fed intervened. On Thursday, the central bank bought $250 million to $300 million of dollars with foreign currencies, and, yesterday, it and other central banks tried again. But the dollar sat at only 94.14 yen at Friday's close and, with it also declining greatly against the mark and other currencies, more Fed action may be in the offing.
 
The Taxman Cometh, Sometime
The I.R.S. wants you to blame someone else if your tax refund is delayed. Last week, Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson told Congress that the agency wants to ferret out citizens who fraudulently claim the earned-income tax credit, a benefit that allows many Americans not only to pay no income tax but to get Federal dollars back in the bargain. The I.R.S. initiative will mean that 7 million taxpayers -- guilty or not -- may get their refunds late, the commissioner said. Electronically filed returns raise the agency's biggest suspicions. While such returns make up just 12 percent of all individual returns, they account for 43 percent of all fraudulent claims.
 
Balanced Budget: No Cigar
What a difference one Democrat makes. The long push for a balanced-budget amendment failed in the Senate last week when the Republicans could not sway either Byron L. Dorgan or Kent Conrad, two North Dakota Democrats and potential swing votes, to side with the measure. So, although Senator Bob Dole paved the procedural way for another vote this year or next and House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed vengeance at the polls, Washington can keep its checkbook unbalanced for now. Will it do so? Well, President Clinton's budget proposal last month forecast lots more red than black: namely, annual budget deficits of $200 billion through the end of the decade.
 
COMPANIES
 
Now, That's News!
Well, it's not man bites dog, but some cynics may see a parallel. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued an Atlanta investor last week for fleecing nine big brokerage firms out of $13.5 million. The investor, Michael J. Morse, placed orders to sell stocks that he neither owned nor borrowed. Like all short sellers, he was hoping to profit from a fall in these equities' prices, the S.E.C. said, but when prices rose instead, some Wall Street biggies were left holding the bag. Among the losers: Goldman, Sachs; Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers.
 
Quilting Bees? Hardly
High rollers, take note. Last Sunday, 15 women from homey Beardstown, Ill. -- 6,200 people, one cash machine -- gathered to autograph a book of their advice. The topic, though, was about as big-city as you can get. "The Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide" (Hyperion) chronicles how, in their 11 years as an investment club, the women have earned an average annual return of 23.4 percent. That's about double what the S.& P. 500 earned during the same period -- which explains why the book is now No. 3 on The New York Times "how-to" best-seller list. How'd they do it? As the title says, common sense. When they saw how full the parking lot was at the local Wal-Mart, for instance, they bought the stock. That was back in 1990. The stock has risen nearly 60 percent since then.
 
Will the Planes Be on Time?
At precisely 6 A.M. on Tuesday, as United Flight 1062 pushed back from the gate, Denver International Airport opened -- 16 months late and $2 billion over its $2.9 billion budget. A perennial work-in-progress, the airport often made headlines over accusations of boondoggling and over its troubled baggage system, which initially shredded luggage instead of conveying it. But not all the bad news is past. Many air fares are $20 higher each way at the new airport, to defray landing fees that are three times as high as those at the old one.
 
Movie Chains to Link Up
When you buy popcorn in bulk, it's cheaper. That's one reason behind a merger, announced last week, that will create the world's largest movie chain. Worth $450 million in cash and stock, the deal will join the 1,625 movie screens of the Cineplex Odeon Corporation and the 1,164 screens of Cinemark USA. The new company, Cineplex International, will have theaters stretching from Chile to Canada -- 11 percent of the world's capacity and about 600 more screens than United Artists, the next largest competitor. If the new company's buying clout lowers the costs of candy, film rental and the like, will ticket prices drop, too? That remains to be seen.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Thinking Positive About Paris Stocks

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
MORGAN STANLEY is bullish on France. Very bullish. Last year it took a seat in the vast stone building resembling an ancient Roman temple that houses the Paris bourse and set up in business as a French stockbroker.
Then last week it brought some of its European analysts, officials of the Paris stock market and senior executives from four French blue-chip companies to New York and Boston to tell American institutional investors to buy French equities in 1995. 
 At first sight such enthusiasm for France may seem surprising. The Paris market has been falling the past two years, although in 1994 trading volume reached a new record.
Meanwhile the country is immersed in an increasingly open presidential election campaign in which the two conservative front-runners, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris are pretty much even in the polls with their Socialist opponent, Lionel Jospin.
A Morgan Stanley strategist, Richard Davidson, readily acknowledged that such political uncertainty creates what he called "a predicament" because short-term market sentiment is likely to remain negative until May, after the two ballot contests are over, with equities continuing to under-perform.
But taking 1995 as a whole, he argued that Paris is Europe's most attractive equity market, with the CAC Index expected to rise 16 percent to 2,200 by year-end.
This year France is likely to be the only major industrial country with an economic growth rate of more than 3 percent, inflation below 2 percent and a positive balance of payments.
Meanwhile the market's long slide has left French equities undervalued by European standards, especially banks and cyclically responsive stocks. In 1995, he predicted, French corporate earnings could grow by 23 percent on average.
The approaching presidential election, in his view, is largely irrelevant since the conservative candidates broadly agree on economic policy, while in the unlikely event the Socialists recapture Elysee Palace, Mr. Jospin would still lack a parliamentary majority. Nevertheless this rosy picture has two blemishes, only one of which Morgan Stanley acknowledged.
The unacknowledged blemish is Mr. Balladur's reluctance to push through needed economic reforms against popular opposition, as demonstrated by his recent reversal over plans to streamline Air France, allow AT&T into the telecommunications market and lower the minimum wage to create more jobs.
Mr. Davidson acknowledged, however, that Mr. Balladur's strong franc policy is in difficulty because of Germany's super-strong mark but predicted it will survive with the franc not falling lower than 3.60 to the mark from today's 3.52 level.
But the strong franc policy could still unravel if Germany's central bank raises interest rates again this year to fight wage inflation, leaving France an uncomfortable choice between following suit despite a 12.3 percent unemployment rate, or devaluing.
When it came to stock recommendations, Daniel Valot, head of Total's North American operations, said the giant French oil and natural gas company plans to double production outside the Middle East by 2000 while cutting costs some $400 million.
Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has raised its profits forecasts for Total in 1996 and 1997 and rates it a buy.
Pierre Vaillaud, chief executive of Technip, reported that the engineering and construction group now does 83 percent of its business in the world's fast-growing emerging economies and has an impressive list of new contracts. For Morgan Stanley it is another French buy.
Bruno Lafont, financial director of Lafarge Coppee, the world's second-biggest cement and building material producer, told analysts the firm is continuing to expand in emerging economies like Turkey and China, usually by taking over outdated plants and modernizing them.
Today it is active in 40 countries compared with only 15 five years ago and has divided its business equally between cyclical sectors that grow in step with the economy and others that do not. Also a buy.
Ernest Ferrari, marketing director for the partially privatized but still state-controlled Renault vehicle producer, which owns Mack Trucks in the United States, said the company is trying to spread its reputation as a small-car specialist with a strong position in Southern Europe.
Renault is now building bigger and more profitable cars like its projected X64, due out in September, and is marketing them aggressively in northern European countries like Britain, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. The company also has one of the youngest vehicle fleets of any producer, Mr. Ferrari claimed, and is steadily improving the quality of its vehicles.
Morgan Stanley sees sales of the new X64 car as crucial for future earnings and for the moment gives Renault only a neutral rating.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
1 Win, 1 Loss, in Bear Market Bet

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
SEEKING refuge in a mutual fund designed for bear markets would have made good sense last year -- if you picked the right one.
Your two choices use antipodal approaches to a financial markets meltdown. The Robertson Stephens Contrarian Fund aims to profit, while the Lindner Bulwark Fund seeks to preserve capital. 
 Congratulations if you owned Lindner, which rose 7.2 percent in 1994, when United States diversified domestic funds lost 1.7 percent. Too bad if you picked Contrarian, which lost 5.5 percent, according to the fund researchers at Morningstar Inc.
Now that the Dow Jones industrial average has crossed the 4,000 mark, some investors may be worried about a fall and looking for a fund that will protect them. So let's see what happened with these two bear market funds last year and how they've fared so far in 1995.
Once it got off the ground a year ago, the $87 million Lindner Bulwark Fund tucked 45 percent of its portfolio into common stock, largely small-capitalization value shares.
Most of its run-up last year came from those stocks, all of which the fund still owns and all of which its lead manager, Larry Callahan, still considers undervalued, even given the rise in share prices.
Among the hottest: Gradco Systems, Las Vegas, Nev., an office equipment manufacturer; Tripos, St. Louis, a maker of molecular modeling software, and the National Insurance Group, San Francisco, which offers flood insurance services.
Cash levels averaging 25 percent have helped, and so has a 20 percent short position. The short positions are mostly in leveraged car-leasing companies, medical technology companies and H.M.O.'s.
The biggest single industry group now is gold mining (17 percent), including Placer Dome, Barrick Gold and Freeport McMoran. Computers and electronics hold another 10 percent, and energy, 6 percent, with the rest among various industries.
The allocations are roughly the same in 1995 as the market rose, which accounts for the fund's 6.1 percent drop through Thursday. A 5 percent position in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index put options (which gain value as the S.& P. falls) played a part in the drop; so did the short positions.
That doesn't bother Mr. Callahan, who said his portfolio allocation still makes sense. "The perceived slowing in the economy and stabilization of interest rates helped push the market up," he said, but the rebound "is destined to be short."
Paul Stephens, who manages the $400 million Contrarian fund said of his fund's poor performance, "We're unhappy but not discouraged."
"After the upside blowoff to 4,000, reality will sink in," said Mr. Stephens, adding that he tripled his personal stake in Contrarian the last two months as its share price fell from $11, to below $8. In 1995, through Thursday, the fund was off 2.3 percent.
He said companies that produce gold and other hard assets might become growth stocks through the end of the decade but timing that moment would be rough -- sometime in the next three years.
Why gold? "All the currency problems in Mexico will cause worry about the stability of currencies, and there will be an explosion in gold," Mr. Stephens said.
Among his holdings are Ashanti Gold, which has mining operations in Ghana, and its parent, Lonrho, two London companies.
But his gold bet -- nearly 20 percent of his portfolio -- hurt in 1994. Gold was the worst performer among the 19 equity sectors tracked by Morningstar last year, down 11.7 percent. Mr. Stephens said that while he made money on his 25 percent short position, he lost more on gold and a 4 percent position in S.& P. puts.
But Contrarian's allocation remains roughly similar to last year's, with one exception: Mr. Stephens has built up his holdings in oil-and-gas to 12 percent of the portfolio because "we like the long-term supply-demand situation in the late 1990's." Companies include Anadasko Petroleum, Conwest Exploration and Louisiana Land and Exploration.
He has 17 percent of the portfolio invested in producers of base metals like aluminum, copper and nickel because "we see global economic growth in the next five years as countries that were behind the Iron Curtain embrace capitalism." His picks include Diamond Fields Resources, Maxxam, Alumax and Freeport MacMoran.
Another 6 percent is in real estate stocks, mostly in Florida and California. The biggest: Avatar, Catellus Development, Atlantic Gulf Communities.
Mr. Stephens also sees bad news coming on the inflation front. "We think one surprise is that inflation will rise gradually to 5 percent in the next 18 months," he said. "The seeds have been sown for a gradual inflation rise and global economic growth."
So he remains undaunted. "We are not positioned for a bull market," he said. "We probably have the most defensive mutual fund portfolio that anyone can buy, and that doesn't do well when the market goes up."
Or sometimes when it goes down.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Filling the Del Toro Seat: Litmus of District's Priorities

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
When Assemblyman Angelo Del Toro died of a heart attack in December, many East Harlem residents assumed his brother William would inherit the seat he had held for almost 20 years in a district where almost half the residents receive some form of public assistance.
But with a special election scheduled for March 14, William Del Toro is facing a formidable challenge from Francisco Diaz Jr., the district manager of Community Board 11, whose candidacy is backed by the neighborhood's most powerful unions and political leaders, including Congressman Charles B. Rangel. 
 Mr. Del Toro is the nominee of the Democratic Party -- a position giving him an advantage on top of his family's large web of friends and political allies -- but Mr. Diaz, running as a Liberal and an Independent, has mustered support from all parts of the district, which includes El Barrio, the Hispanic area of East Harlem, and part of West Harlem and the Upper East Side.
Given state budgetary constraints and the new Republican administration, it is unlikely that either front-running candidate will be able to deliver services and programs to the district the way Angelo Del Toro did through his seniority and influence. Most East Harlem leaders believe their best hopes for funding jobs and housing programs lie in the Federal Empowerment Zone program, not the State Assembly.
Even so, some residents believe the outcome of the election will say a lot about their neighborhood's priorities. Mr. Diaz and his supporters say his election would send a message to Albany that East Harlem wants to start with fresh leadership. Mr. Del Toro and his supporters say his longstanding Albany connections would give him an advantage in boosting economic development.
Mr. Del Toro is a convicted felon who served time in 1974 for bribery and perjury in a scheme to bribe a Model Cities program official. The bribery conviction was later overturned.
"If Del Toro lost this, it would be a major upset," said Angelo Falcon, director of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy. "He has always been tainted with the reputation of being a corrupt person, but people may feel more comfortable staying with the devil they know."
But others say William Del Toro lacks his brother's appeal and they give better odds to Mr. Diaz. "Bill represents the old machine that's been in office, in power for the last 20 years," said David Gibbons, a community board member and Diaz supporter, "and Frank represents a new perspective."
Since no more than 5,000 voters are expected at the polls, everyone agrees the election will hinge on which candidate can bring out the vote. .
A Republican candidate, George L. Espada, is pinning his hopes on a high Republican turnout, inspired by the party's success last November. But Democrats in the district outnumber Republicans 12 to 1. A fourth potential candidate, Nelson Antonio Denis, was disqualified by the Board of Elections but is appealing in court.
Mr. Del Toro, a cheerful and portly man who is trained as a minister, characterized his opposition as "outside forces." Mr. Diaz said he is worried about Election Day misconduct; his campaign will post monitors at each poll site. "History is that the poll site inspectors encourage people to vote for Del Toro quietly," Mr. Diaz said. "Our poll watchers will be watching them very closely so that the inspectors are not tampering with the machines that may be getting the most votes for me." JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM

Seaside Twilight Zone
 
Q. When I want to see some ocean, I take a subway to Edgemere, Rockaway. All the land there looks odd. I see curbs, hydrants, street signs, all covered with weeds, yet no buildings, except a spooky-looking school that looks like its from the movie "The Birds." Who owns this land and what are the future plans?
A. If Hitchcock had made a film about city planning, he could have called it "Arverne." 
 That's what you're looking at: Arverne, Queens, one of the most intractable tracts of New York City real estate. It was once, in the words of a 1939 guide to New York, "a superior seaside community," and the location of the Vanderbilt family's summer home.
The area decayed after fluctuations and depressions of the real estate market and has been mostly empty since Mayor John V. Lindsay ordered the demolition of its dilapidated summer cottages in the late 1960's. The property is now the largest tract of vacant city-owned land and has been the focus on a number of urban-renewal projects, including a recent $1.5 billion plan, abandoned in 1991. That plan called for 7,500 apartments, shopping malls, recreation centers and parks.
But hope has not been totally abandoned: the Giuliani administration has proposed a plan to allow private investors to build 180 two-family town houses on three blocks at the western edge of the tract.
 
 
Nonstop at 14th Street

 
Q. Why do the IND B and D express trains bypass 14th Street when all other subway lines make 14th Street an express train stop?
A. It's a case of first come, first served.
The Sixth Avenue station was the last built along 14th Street, opening in 1940 for D and F trains. When the decision was made in the mid 1960's to extend the BB service (as it was known) south from its end point at West 34th Street, planners judged that the station was sufficiently served, said Termaine Garden, a spokesman for the Transit Authority, and already also included a PATH stop. So the new express tunnel, to carry the BB and the D, was laid out underneath the station. B and D express service was inaugurated in November 1967, leaving the Sixth Avenue station sadly local.
 
 
Thanksgiving Begging

 
Q. When I was growing up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, in the 1950's, little was made of Halloween trick-or-treating. Instead, we went out, dressed as Indians or ragamuffins, on Thanksgiving morning, to ask neighbors: "Anything for Thanksgiving?" We were given coins, apples, nuts, candy, etc. This would last till about noon. Can any "old Brooklynite" comment on the custom of Thanksgiving begging? How widespread was it? How did it start? Why did it end?
A. Its exact beginnings are hard to pinpoint, but it probably dates back to at least the early part of the century, says Prof. Jack Santino, an expert on holidays at the Department of Popular Culture at Bowling Green University.
Mr. Santino has spoken to Jewish and Italian Brooklynites who remember such holiday begging in their immigrant communities as far back as the early 1920's, and he believes it may date back even further. The tradition, he says, probably stems from a European tradition of symbolic begging on holidays, a custom still palpable in trick-or-treating on Halloween, begging for pennies on Guy Fawkes Day, and even in Christmas carolling. Mr. Santino says that the booty from Thanksgiving begging was sometimes shared with the less fortunate in communities, but it was never really integrated with the idea of Thanksgiving.
Brooklyn, with a large European immigrant population, was a natural breeding ground for this custom, which probably was practiced on Thanksgiving simply because it was an already established American holiday.
The custom died out as trick-or-treating became more popular after World War II, though a Ragamuffin Parade, established in 1966, is still active in Bay Ridge. The parade, usually held on the last Saturday of September or the first Saturday of October, attracts thousands of children in costumes, and more than a few ragamuffins. This year it will be held Sept. 30. JESSE MCKINLEY

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
The Ladder Man of 14th Street

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
IN the last place where Hassan Bouker ran a retail concern, the Ivory Coast in West Africa, dealing with shoplifters was a simple matter. "If someone is seen doing that there, everyone around the store will run over and start slapping him," he explained. "He gets very scared and never comes back."
But on 14th Street, where he manages Luciano, a low-price clothing store, such corporal methods are frowned upon. So instead, Mr. Bouker chooses to perch atop a large ladder placed strategically outside the store, where he can survey those who pass by to shop, linger, and yes, steal. 
 "The way I look at it," he said, "everyone who walks in here is suspicious."
Every day of the week, from about 9:30 A.M. to 7 P.M., Mr. Bouker works from his ladder to ferret out potential thieves, ready to pounce on those who shove low-cost blue jeans, polyester baby dresses and cotton underwear in their pockets.
He and dozens of other merchants along the carnival-like shopping strip depend on ladder lookouts especially on warmer afternoons -- and on Saturdays and Sundays all year long -- the busiest work days for those who shoplift for a living.
"You lose everyday," said Mr. Hassan, who is originally from Syria. "The ladder helps because when you are over the people, the visibility is better. But the thieves always have a method of distraction."
Even from his perch, Mr. Bouker has little success against the team approach used most often by those who work 14th Street, an area where larceny has actually decreased over the last year, said Sgt. Nick Vreeland, a police spokesman.
Two or three people, usually young men, come into the front of the store, where merchandise is displayed on tables or hangs from the sides of the metal gate. One will start rapid-fire questioning about the merchandise, perhaps even buy something inexpensive, to divert attention from his partners, who are filling their pants and pockets with other goods.
From the ladder, Mr. Bouker often sees this going on, but says that about half the time the thieves take off down the street before he can stop them.
"The thieves are really, really powerful here," he said. "They make a fortune."
Not-so-clever tricks? Mr. Bouker, 40, has seen them all in the six months he has managed Luciano, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. There was the young man who strolled into the store wearing a pair of ratty shoes, put on a new pair and tried to breeze out, undetected.
A woman came in recently, shoved several pieces of clothing under her skirt and tried, nonchalantly, to leave. "She was walking like a duck," Mr. Bouker said, demonstrating the overdressed waddle. A co-worker on the ladder patrol zoomed in.
"The guy outside said, 'You don't walk right, go back in,' and forced her to go back," Mr. Bouker said. She resisted their inquiries until two employees managed to shake loose several items.
More than one fellow has come into the store carrying a large cardboard box with a hole in the bottom through which he pulls clothes as he makes his way around the shop. Once, from the ladder, Mr. Bouker spied a pant leg dangling from the box. That man was nabbed.
What is frustrating, he said, is seeing the same crooks circulate through his store again and again. While he learns to recognize them, he does wonder why the repeat offenders cannot be compelled to spend a a bit more time at Rikers Island.
"There are always the same guys, and they come by time after time," said Mr. Bouker in French, his voice rising. "They go to jail for a few weeks then they are immediately out on the streets again." He broke into English to condemn the penal system: "Go to jail, eating good, sleeping good, what can do?"
He acknowledges that the police deal swiftly with those they catch, but says he is simply overwhelmed on a block that draws fewer police officers than petty criminals. "The police," he says, are "very good for tickets, but not so good for thieves.'
The tickets Mr. Bouker refers to are not actually issued by the police, but by the Department of Sanitation. The city has designated 14th Street a "zero-visibility zone," said Lucian Chalfen, a sanitation spokesman; merchants are forbidden to place anything for sale beyond their store windows. Ladders, too, can be considered illegal obstructions, though Mr. Chalfen said summonses are rarely given for them.
Fines range from $50 to $250, and Mr. Bouker has a fistful of the more expensive variety on a shelf in the back of the store.
Mr. Bouker and other merchants along the block who complain bitterly about the laws do not get much sympathy from the 14th Street/Union Square Business Improvement District, an economic development organization, whose members believe that sales outside the stores attract thieves and create chaos.
A particular menace, they say, are store owners who, unlike Mr. Bouker, rent out the front of their shops to hawkers who sell things like batteries, hats and battery-operated dolls that clang and dance. Such vendors also watch over their goods on top of ladders.
"We are crippled by the fact that on Sundays, there are no peddling or parking laws in effect," said Stephen Caracappa, the director of services for the B.I.D. "It is open season for 14th Street between University Place and Sixth Avenue. Vans full of guys selling neon socks are selling next to a guy selling sunglasses, and it gives the place a feel of an open bazaar. I don't think there should be any of this, or any ladders in the middle of the sidewalk."
But Mr. Bouker is convinced that only his sturdy ladder stands between success and bankruptcy. "How can I do business here, between the tickets and the robbers?" he said. "This street is not 34th Street. People come here for cheap merchandise. I can't raise the prices. I have to have a lot of vigilance on my ladder."

HEADLINE: End Bank Law and Robber Barons Ride Again

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "For Rogue Traders, Yet Another Victim" (Business Day, Feb. 28) and your same-day article on Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's proposal to eliminate the legal barriers that have separated the nation's commercial banks, securities firms and insurance companies for decades: The American Bankers Association, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Representative Jim Leach and Treasury Secretary Rubin are gravely misguided in their quest to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act. 
 Their contention that insurance companies, commercial banks and securities firms should be freed from legislative obstructions is predicated on fallacious, historically inaccurate statements. If the Baring Brothers failure does not give them pause, a history lesson is our only hope before the Administration and bank lobby iron out their differences and set the economy back 90 years.
The argument that American financial intermediaries will become "more efficient and more internationally competitive" is false. The American financial system is the most stable, most profitable and most dynamic in the world.
The notion that Glass-Steagall prevents American financial intermediaries from fulfilling their utmost potential in a global marketplace reflects inadequate understanding of the events that precipitated the act and the similarities between today's financial marketplace and the market nearly a century ago.
Although Glass-Steagall was enacted during the Great Depression, it was put in place because the Aldrich-Vreeland Act of 1908, the blue-sky laws following 1910 and the Federal Reserve System of 1913 failed to keep the concentration of financial power in check. The investment climate that ultimately led to Glass-Steagall was one filled with emerging markets, interlocking control of productive resources and widespread bank ownership of securities.
Ever since railroad securities began driving secondary capital markets in the late 1860's, "emerging markets" have existed for investors looking for high-yield opportunities, and banks have been primary agents in industrial development. In the 19th century, emerging markets were scattered throughout the United States, and capital flowed into them from New York, Boston, Philadelphia and London. In the same way, capital flows from the United States, Japan and England to Latin America and the Pacific rim -- today we just have more terms to define the market mechanisms.
The economy and financial markets were even more interconnected in the 19th century than now. Commercial and investment banks could accept deposits, issue currency, underwrite securities and own industrial enterprises. With Glass-Steagall lifted, we will chart a course returning us to that environment.
J. P. Morgan and Andrew Mellon made their billions through inter
locking directorates and outright ownership of hundreds of nationally prominent enterprises. Glass-Steagall is one crucial piece of a litany of legislation designed to place checks and balances on the concentration of financial resources. To repeal it would be tantamount to bringing back the days of the robber barons.
The unbridled activities of those gifted financiers crumbled under the dynamic forces of the capital marketplace. If you take away the checks, the market forces will eventually knock the system off balance.

HEADLINE: Another Vacuous Plan for a Tax Cut

 BODY:
In "Poor Wont' Suffer, Republicans Assert" [Feb. 5], Representative Peter T. King is quoted as saying that cutting middle-class taxes now is good public policy. He put it this way, "Giving more money to the middle income will help the local economy."
Consider this: The total 1994 debt of the United States is $4.6 trillion, and based on the Congressional Budget Office, this figure will rise, to $4.9 trillion in 1995 and, conservatively, to $6.8 trillion by the year 2000. Against a background of a sharply rising debt, does anybody believe that a middle-income tax cut is sound economic policy? Could it just be that Mr. King is thinking about the political gain to himself when he talks about "giving" money to the middle class. 
 The facts are that the focus of the budget must be on making spending cuts. This is the most effective way to deal with the current serious budget problem while also helping the middle class and everybody else. We cannot allow the politicians to keep on spending wildly and, of all things, reduce taxes when the budget is out of control.
It's important for the people to take control of their own destiny. Now is the time to cut spending, not taxes. Cutting taxes is sound public policy when the economy is in recession. This is not the current situation. Now is the precise time in the economic cycle to cut spending.
With the debt already at $4.6 trillion and rising sharply, Mr. King must not be allowed to hide behind unsound tax cuts and the Contract With America, which is nothing but a political document.

HEADLINE: Are the Hungry Few Their Own Problem?

 BODY:
In "More Elderly Waiting to Join Food Programs" [Feb. 12] you reported a 20 percent increase in the number of elderly in Suffolk County who sought food stamps in 1994. This news came only days after your newspaper quoted local Representative Michael Forbes' saying: "We don't have actual poverty. We have behavioral poverty. Very few people out there go hungry."
Of course Mr. Forbes's comments are ludicrous. Even conservative estimates show a rise in poverty, hungry, and homelessness. Yet his rhetoric is a key element in the Republican Party's ideological campaign to mobilize the public's hostility and paranoia against poor people. 
 In town meetings across his district Mr. Forbes stoked the fires of intolerance and fear by "blasting illegal immigrants, foreign aid and welfare," blaming local and national budgetary problems on poor people, not policy makers. Deflecting attention away from military spending, corporate welfare and other subsidies for the wealthy, Mr. Forbes continues to blame poverty on its victims, not its perpetrators.
We need political leaders who will speak the truth and offer real solutions to the economic pinch that most Americans are feeling. We cannot balance the budget on the backs of the poor, no matter how hard we try. It is the wealthy that must begin paying their fair share.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
In Loss, Republicans Find Seeds of Victory

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN a sense, the Senate's rejection last week of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget was a serious defeat for the insurgent Republicans who are controlling Congress for the first time in their lives.
The amendment was the heart of the Contract With America, the campaign platform of Republicans in the House of Representatives, and the measure sailed through the House in January with considerable Democratic support. 
 In the Senate every Republican save Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon voted for it. But rallying behind the time-honored battle cry of protecting Social Security from Republican looters, 33 Democrats joined Mr. Hatfield, and that was just enough to prevent the amendment from winning the necessary two-thirds majority. (One of the 14 Democrats who voted for the amendment, Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, announced Friday, the day after the vote, that he was switching to the Republican Party.)
But as momentarily discouraging as it may be to have their momentum slowed for the first time this year, the vote could turn out to be a political windfall for Republicans.
Every Democrat who voted against it can now be portrayed as having held the decisive vote that derailed the amendment. With polls showing that four out of five Americans favor the amendment, this could be a heavy political burden to carry. Whether or not their vote was right substantively, many Democrats could spend the rest of the decade trying to defend it the way many Republicans spent much of the 1980's trying to live down votes for cutting cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits.
The Democrats have succeeded for years when they have accused Republicans of tampering with Social Security. Polls nowadays show that only a third of Americans support a balanced budget amendment if it would mean cutting retirement benefits. But Republicans are banking on the prospect that this time the Democrats have gone to the Social Security well one time too often.
On the day the Senate voted, Newt Gingrich, the Republican Speaker of the House, said Democrats had two alternatives. "They can give us a victory today," he said, or "they can give us a victory in November '96."
The defeat of the amendment, which would have required that the Federal budget be balanced within seven years unless three-fifths of the members of both houses of Congress waived the requirement, also gets the Republicans off a potentially dangerous hook. They have pledged to produce a balanced budget without raising taxes and without cutting Social Security or military spending. Many economists believe that is unrealistic. If the economists are right, the Republicans can now try to shift the blame for their failure to the Democrats who voted against the constitutional amendment.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said he would call for another vote on the amendment at once if one of the opponents should die or resign or change his or her mind. Otherwise, he said, he will call another vote shortly before the 1996 election.

HEADLINE: The World;
Arabs, Too, Play the Ethnic Card

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
AS secular Arab regimes tremble under enormous pressures for change, dormant ethnic and religious hatreds threaten to disrupt the Middle East even as they tear apart fragile new nations in Central Asia and the Balkans.
 Despite the best efforts of pan-Arabist dreamers or Islamic militants, the truth is that this part of the world is anything but homogeneous. Each Arab country is a composite of different groups, and in none can it be said that the groups share power happily. This is, after all, a part of the world where rulers are still afraid to seek the consent of the governed by inviting everyone to participate. In the more benevolent regimes, patronage is a more typical tool of control; terror is, of course, also available. 
This means that there are no simple conflicts in the Arab world: splits among the various majorities and minorities are complicating everying, including the fights that get the most attention these days: the battle between secular regimes and Islamic militants.

 
 
What Nation-States?
 The ethnic divisions date to long before the colonial powers drew artificial borders to create nation-states in the area. Now, with economies struggling and Islamic militance rising, Coptic Christians in Egypt, Berbers in Algeria and Kurds and Shiites in Iraq have been drawn into the various struggles.
 And everywhere, the hermetic isolation of ethnic and religious enclaves within the Arab countries continues. The Hashemite rulers of Jordan, a Bedouin clan, still hold sway over -- and are resented by -- the Palestinian majority, while in Egypt a Muslim majority often makes life uncomfortable for Coptic Christians. In Iraq, the Kurdish minority in the north is in revolt against the Sunni Muslim rulers of Baghdad, who also have their hands full controlling a spasmodic rebellion by the Shiite Muslim majority in the south.
 And across North Africa, Berbers recall insults and isolation at the hands of rulers from the larger Arab majority, even as they are recruited into the fight against Islamic revolution.
 The Berbers of Algeria are a case in point: Descendants of tribes who were in North Africa before the Arabs, they live mostly in the interior, are sharply divided among their own tribes and speak a variety of dialects related to ancient Egyptian -- although most, like the general population, are Muslims.
 For many years, the Arab socialist rulers in Algiers denied them equal education, kept their villages poor, even tried to suppress their separate languages and culture.
 But now they find themselves in a curiously Middle Eastern alliance with the Government: It is giving them weapons and allowing them to form their own militias, because the Berbers see Islamic fundamentalism as an even greater threat to their separate way of life than the Government ever presented. Still, nobody expects the Berbers to get full equality if and when the Islamic rebellion ends.
 As with other groups, the relationship between the Berbers and the Algerian regime has its own ancient rules, organization and logic; a principal goal of such groups has been simply to insure their continued survival and well-being. As with the sultans of a different time, a paternalistic relationship has developed with modern governments; tribal and religious leaders go to them and, in exchange for accepting an inferior status, gain a degree of autonomy.
 In other words, neither majority nor minority aspires to an egalitarian, inclusionary society. Both seem trapped in an ancient pattern that is the model for all authoritarian relationships in this part of the world, from the patriarchal rule of the family to the dictatorship of the state.
 When the system works, the local leaders can restrain local resentments that otherwise would fuel rebellion. Even Saddam Hussein has been able to recruit dozens of Kurdish tribal leaders to his side in his efforts to suppress other Kurds, who had revolted.

 
 
Role Models
 It is true, of course, that the Middle East's minority groups have been used (and abandoned) as much by outside powers as by fellow Arabs. The Maronite Christians governed on behalf of the French in Lebanon. The British set up rule by the Hashemites in Jordan and Iraq. The Kurdish rebels were backed, and then abandoned, by the Americans and Iran's Shah, in an effort to destabilize Iraq.
 One reason the groups remain so divided and mistrustful of their rulers is that virtually all have been victimized in the past, and the memories of such victimization are nurtured from generation to generation. There are dozens of rallying cries, from the Shiites' recounting of their ancestors' martyrdom at the hands of Sunni Muslims at Karbala, to the Palestinians' invocation of the massacres by Lebanese Christian militiamen at the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in 1982, to the Kurds' remembrance of the Iraqi poison gas attack on the town of Halabja in 1988. These wrongs -- evoked often by a single word -- are repeated like mantras; it is then easy to think of those outside the clan as subhuman and, when the time is right, to do battle again.
 And increasingly throughout the Arab world, the time is becoming right, because these societies are undergoing profound dislocations. Iraq has been seriously drained by two disastrous wars, so its minority Kurds and majority Shiites can think of defying Saddam Hussein. Many other regimes, like Algeria's, face a rise of Islamic militancy and therefore are lifting constraints on groups they once suppressed. Egypt, for example, is arming its Coptic Christians, who have complained of past mistreatment.
 Of course, a history of mistreatment is no guarantee that a minority group won't match or even outdo the cruelty of those who were oppressors in the past. The two most repressive regimes in the Middle East, for example, are run by minorities -- Syria's Alawites, a tiny sect whose Hafez al-Assad has ruled with an iron fist for 25 years, and Iraq's Sunni Muslim Takriti clan, which is headed by Saddam Hussein.

Down at the Crossroads, There's a Devil of a Debate

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ 

 BODY:
THE question is not so much "Can white boys (and girls) play the blues?" but "What does it matter if they do?" At a time when blues-influenced white artists like Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt and the Rolling Stones are winning Grammy awards, as all of them did last week, an argument continues to fester over whether whites can ever be an authentic part of the painfully born blues tradition.
 The debate (which has its counterpart in jazz) is thrashed out sometimes in the pages of the country's two leading blues journals, Living Blues and Blues Revue. The magazines have contrasting philosophies: Living Blues focuses on blacks and the black blues tradition, while Blues Revue covers blues music by blacks, whites -- whomever. 
 Detractors of Living Blues resent what they view as its implication that blues music by whites is less noteworthy. Editors at Living Blues (whose staff is mainly white) deny sending that message, saying that covering white blues is just not their mission. Let's hear riffs from both sides. TOM KUNTZ
 Living Blues, the country's oldest blues journal (founded 1970), with a circulation of about 20,000, is published every two months by the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi. In a column in the May/June issue of 1993, Paul Garon, a founder, defended its editorial policy:
 In the midst of what has become considerable hostility . . . let me try to articulate why I recognize, promote and analyze the work of black blues artists to the exclusion of white artists, and why Living Blues maintains an editorial focus on African American artists.
 Twenty-three years ago, when Living Blues was first getting under way, most of the editors had a few things in common besides their love of blues. One of these . . . was an involvement and belief in the civil rights movement and the broader issues associated with it. . . . Among these concerns was a profound dismay at the depth of racism in the United States. . . .
 It was quite clear . . . that the very specific forms of torture, beating, lynching, slavery, mistreatment and general discrimination that white Americans had visited upon black Americans had -- combined with the black response to this torment -- produced the blues. Indeed, it was the very resistance to this genocidal tendency of white culture that had brought the blues into existence. That blues was a "good time music" par excellence in no way invalidated this thesis. But let me repeat the point: Only the very specific sociological, cultural, economic, psychological and political forces faced by working-class African Americans -- forces permeated with racism -- produced the blues. Nothing else did!
 For me, and for the current staff of Living Blues, none of this "material base" for the blues has changed. Racism and discrimination are still rampant in the U.S. . . . the undimmed voice of working-class blacks crying out their pain and pleasure still speaks in many voices from the ghettos of America.
 Some things have changed, however. The audience for the blues began to shift from black to white when the "blues revival" began in the early 1960's. At the same time, many white members of this audience began to take up the guitar, the harmonica and, occasionally, the piano, and they began to play the blues themselves. . . . Some even came from poor working class families, and many . . . had known suffering themselves . . . .
 Other things have not changed, and for those of us for whom an interest in documenting and fostering African American culture is paramount, the focus of Living Blues on black artists is consistent with our own position. Indeed, while anyone can play the blues, it is the unique engendering nature of black culture that has always been our prime concern. Only the complex web of racist oppression suffered by blacks at the hands of whites produced the blues, regardless of the many types of suffering with which the blues deals in the manifest content of its songs. The fact that white musicians are now playing the blues . . . is immaterial to a focus on black culture. . . .
 Such arguments brought a response from "Steady Rollin' " Bob Margolin, part-time columnist for Blues Revue, which was founded as a quarterly in 1991 and now claims a bi-monthly circulation of 50,000. Mr. Margolin -- 40-something, Jewish and from a Boston suburb (hardly a great blues pedigree, as he notes) -- is a former sideman to the late Muddy Waters and now fronts his own band. This is from a column titled "Blues and Race -- Funny, You Don't Look Blueish," in the magazine's summer 1994 issue:
 The debate over race and blues has been going on informally for a long time . . . And recently Living Blues has made it clear that black experience is essential to the blues on which they focus.
 It's more than an academic debate too. Some promoters and club owners, especially when their venues are tourist-oriented, will not hire a band unless they at least have a black person out front. . . . I'm told that even in Atlanta, where the clubs hire without color discrimination, some potential patrons call the clubs and ask outright, "What color is the band tonight?"
 Touring overseas with Muddy in the '70's, a major European blues promoter explained to me that he cut pictures of myself and Jerry Portnoy out of the concert programs for the same reason that if he "wanted to hear Swiss folk music, he wouldn't want it played by someone from Kentucky." We invited him to go tell Muddy that he had made a mistake to hire us. Back then that was my standard comeback to a blues police challenge. . . . There's no law that says blues lovers have to be "equal opportunity" fans.
 The subject is particularly relevant to me because I LIVE the situation. I'm the embodiment of the dilemma. I have been a professional blues musician since 1971, and I'm white. I love the blues and I've dedicated my life to playing them. I never picked cotton in Mississippi, but . . . I've had romantic disappointment and tough breaks and the blues moves me. My personal validation, beyond that it feels right, is that Muddy Waters himself trusted me with his music (he used to hand me his slide to play his parts when he would break a guitar string) and paid me to play with him. . . . I would suggest that if there was ever an ultimate authority on the blues, he was it. . . .
 More recently, Jimmy Rogers was talking about a musician he had seen and he said to me, "He's good but he don't play OUR music." I'm very proud, honored and thrilled that Jimmy included me in a category with himself as a traditional Chicago blues guitarist. . . .
 While nobody I've ever heard of denies that the origin and early history of the blues is black and many of us want to learn as much as we can about it, the empirical (not a blues word!) reality is that non-black players have been part of the world's blues scene for decades. . . . In the seven years that I played guitar in the Muddy Waters Blues Band, none of the black players EVER brought up the subject of race. They felt that if you can play, you can play and if you can't, you can't. . . . The older, legendary black players that I know never say, "Pretty good for a white boy."
 Living Blues, the original U.S. blues fan and academic magazine, has been [angering] part of the blues world for years because they choose to focus only on the blues of black people. Certainly, they occasionally praise a non-black musician, but you don't see an article about one. . . .
 I believe that it's absolutely the right of their editorial staff to . . . define blues as they wish, and exclude whom they want. But it's the right of their readers to go for it or not. Many hard-core blues fans who eagerly await each new issue of the world's most established blues magazine wish that Living Blues would cover the ENTIRE blues scene. . . .
 Whose music would YOU rather hear, the best white blues player's or the worst black blues player's? . . . Talent and inspiration are more important than authenticity . . . .
 An opposing view comes from Brewer Phillips, 70, former guitarist with the late Delta slide guitarist Hound Dog Taylor. Mr. Phillips was quoted in the current issue of Living Blues:
 The blues is part of religion for me. . . . For we black people, it's something we really don't actually play. We was born with it. If we can sing or play an instrument, it just bring out the way we feel. If you ain't black and hadn't been through these things, you can't really learn what the blues is about, 'cause you don't know! But if you black, poor, livin' in them huts, just somethin' to keep the rain off you sometimes, you born with it! And then here you gonna get a white guy with a guitar and he's gonna beat you playin' or beat you singin' the blues? Ain't no way! Ain't no way! Oh, they can learn to play, but they can't sing 'cause they don't feel it. The average blues guy, Howlin' Wolf or Lightnin' Hopkins, they ain't never wrote a song. They sing what they feel. And as they open their mouth the words come right then. Well, the Bible say, you open your mouth and I'll fill it.

HEADLINE: U.S. Holds Mexican in Assassination Case

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 4

 BODY:
The former chief investigator into a politically charged assassination in Mexico was arrested Friday night in Newark as he boarded a flight for Madrid, Mexican officials said today.
The federal authorities said the former official, Mario Ruiz Massieu, who was carrying $46,000 in cash, would be charged with having falsely claimed to be carrying only $18,000 in Mexican and American currency. 
 But two senior Mexican officials said the arrest came after the Mexican Government alerted United States officials to Mr. Ruiz Massieu's movements. They said Mexico would file a request for his extradition by Monday, when he is to be arraigned in United States District Court in Newark.
The officials said Mr. Ruiz Massieu, 44, would be formally accused of obstructing his own investigation into the slaying last September of the second-ranking leader of Mexico's governing party, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, who was also his elder brother.
Mario Ruiz Massieu left Mexico on Thursday night, just hours after testifying before federal police officials here who said he appeared to have been responsible for irregularities in the inquiry.
In a statement on Friday, Mr. Ruiz Massieu said he was going to the United States to lecture about "different topics of Mexican society" at "academic and social institutions."
But a senior Mexican official said today that he had instead bought plane tickets to Vancouver, Montreal and Madrid for himself, his wife and his six-year-old daughter in order to confuse the agents tracking him. The official said the Mexican Government had learned that he planned to travel on from Spain to Monaco, with which Mexico has no extradition treaty.
Mr. Ruiz Massieu, who served as Deputy Attorney General at the end of the administration of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has not been charged with any crime in Mexico and has denied any misconduct.
"It will promptly be found that I do not have nor have I had any responsibility for the insufficiencies that may have existed" in the investigation, he said in the statement issued on Friday.
But the case has been a wellspring of surprises since Tuesday, when Mr. Salinas's elder brother, Raul Salinas de Gortari, was arrested on charges of having ordered and financed the slaying of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
Citing information from witnesses, several Government prosecutors and at least one typist involved in the case, Mexican officials said it appeared that Mario Ruiz Massieu worked to keep the name of Raul Salinas out of the investigation.
One official said Mr. Ruiz Massieu was the first person to interrogate the most important witness in the case against Mr. Salinas, Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, a 47-year-old former governing-party aide who was arrested on Oct. 10.
Investigators said Mr. Rodriguez had told them that he learned from his former boss, a governing-party congressman who is accused of having organized the assassination and is a fugitive in the case, that the congressman had acted on the order of Raul Salinas.
In court testimony at the country's maximum-security prison, Raul Salinas has insisted that he is innocent. His brother has supported him.
Several officials said privately that it would have been unusual for Mario Ruiz Massieu not to have told President Salinas if Raul Salinas was implicated in the case.
Carlos Salinas went on a water-only hunger strike on Friday to demand that the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo publicly clear him of responsibility for the country's economic crisis.

HEADLINE: New York's Public Hospitals Fail, and Babies Are the Victims

SERIES: Mismanaged Care: How Public Hospitals Fail. -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET and JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
Each year for the last decade, dozens of newborn babies have died or been left to struggle with brain damage or other lifelong injuries because of mistakes made by inexperienced doctors and poorly supervised midwives and nurses in the teeming delivery rooms of New York City's public hospitals.
Some of the most prestigious medical schools and private hospitals are paid by the city to provide the care in its sprawling hospital system. But an examination by The New York Times shows that many of these private institutions have left life-and-death decisions to overworked nurses and trainee doctors who are ill prepared to make them. 
 The effects can be seen across the system, from the surgical suites to the clinics. But nowhere are the consequences more devastating than in the delivery rooms, where the course of a young life can be changed forever by a few minutes' delay, a malfunctioning monitor or a lapse of attention.
The delivery room disasters affect a broad spectrum of women, from those who do not visit a doctor until their labor pains begin to the healthiest and most conscientious of mothers-to-be.
Vilma Martinez, a 25-year-old Brooklyn factory worker, languished in the delivery room of Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center in Brooklyn for 14 hours in July 1993, as nurses first struggled to deliver her baby, then desperately searched for a doctor. The baby's father watched in horror as a monitor showed the baby's heartbeat fade, then stop. In the end, no doctor came. The baby was stillborn.
Miriam Miranda, 35, was diabetic and H.I.V.-positive when she entered North Central Bronx Hospital in February 1994 to deliver her baby. Her problems would have tested the skills of the most experienced doctor, but a midwife was put in charge. When complications arose, the midwife struggled on by herself. Deprived of oxygen during labor, the baby died after 77 days. In internal documents, the hospital has conceded that the delivery should have been handled by a doctor.
These cases are more than the isolated tragedies that can occur in any hospital. Serious injuries to newborns are frequent in the delivery rooms of some of New York City's public hospitals. And delivery room crises have flared periodically in most of the public hospitals over the last decade.
It is not possible to say precisely how many of the 31,000 deliveries each year are mishandled. Most records detailing medical mistakes are kept secret, even from the parents of the children involved.
But a computer analysis by The Times showed that the death rate for babies of normal weight born at the public hospitals was substantially higher than the rate at private hospitals in New York City. For babies weighing more than 5.5 pounds, the cutoff doctors use as a gauge of general good health, the death rate in the first four weeks after birth at the public hospitals was 80 percent higher than that for babies born at private hospitals: for every 1,000 births of normal-weight babies at a private hospital, there was one death, while at the public hospitals, there were 1.8.
The public hospitals also had higher rates in most categories of serious birth injuries, the study showed. And the rates were higher even after taking into account the differences in the health of mothers at the private and public hospitals. The Times analyzed city and state records of all births in the city in 1993, the latest year available.
Some hospital and city officials have known about the problems for years, and have worked mightily to keep them from the public. They fear a loss of public confidence and a flood of lawsuits.
In a striking 1992 report never made public, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman analyzed the lawsuits of 64 children who had been left brain-damaged or permanently crippled because of negligence in the delivery rooms. Some of the suits were more than a decade old, and all had been settled in the previous three years.
Those lawsuits alone cost the city $78 million, the report said, and another 793 were pending.
"These cases are catastrophic and costly," the report said. "Many of these infants are now grown children, suffering from multiple and severe disabilities, who require lifetime hospitalization or intensive home care."
In a third of the deliveries, no senior physician was present, even though complications were evident before the deliveries began, the report said.
The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the agency that runs the public hospitals, is the nation's biggest urban hospital system. Its network of 11 hospitals, 76 clinics and 5 chronic care centers is used by one in five New Yorkers. One quarter of the 130,000 babies born in the city are delivered in public hospitals.
With 50,000 employees and a $3.8 billion budget, the hospital corporation is a major economic force in some of the poorest communities. It has stood for decades as a testament that New York, more than any American city, is committed to equal health care for all.
But in recent years, events have converged to raise questions about the system's survival. It faces increasing competition from private hospitals, internal problems and a governor and mayor who contend that New York can no longer afford its expensive array of social services.
In a six-month examination of the agency, The Times reviewed confidential hospital documents, court filings and other public records, and interviewed more than 100 physicians, administrators and city officials. Four current and former high-level officials of the hospital agency confirmed that delivery room problems are grave and have plagued the system for years.
Efforts to resolve the crisis over the last decade have been halting and ineffective, even though a quarter of the babies born in New York are delivered at public hospitals, and obstetrics is a major part of the hospitals' business.
Dr. Bruce Siegel, who became president of the hospital agency a year ago, said in a recent interview that he had not seen a pattern of problems in delivery rooms, but acknowledged that in some hospitals, young doctors are poorly supervised.
"I would certainly not be surprised that we had more adverse outcomes" than in private hospitals, he said, "figuring that we treat poor people, sick people, that the concentration of people having drug problems, low socioeconomic status, various infectious diseases and many other things is going to be clustered in our hospitals."
The computer analysis by The Times showed that over all, women who deliver babies in public hospitals are at higher risk for problems than women who use private hospitals, though a vast majority are healthy and get prenatal care. But it also showed that the difference in the women's own risk factors was not large enough to explain the higher rates of newborn deaths and injuries at public hospitals.
Dr. Siegel said the data used in the analysis were not reliable because the public hospitals did not accurately report risk factors to the state. The Times analysis found little evidence, however, that underreporting was greater at public hospitals than at private ones.
New York City has run public hospitals for more than a century, but the system was reorganized three decades ago in an ambitious attempt to raise the quality of medical care for the poor to the standards of the best private hospitals. To shore up the public hospitals, each was paired with a private hospital or medical school that was paid by the city to provide doctors and oversee care.
Last year, the city paid more than $500 million to such prestigious institutions as the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Montefiore Medical Center and the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
But a review of current and historic documents shows that the plan never lived up to expectations.
Nearly 30 years later, there are still two classes of medical care in New York City: one for people who can afford private doctors and hospitals, and another for those who must rely on the public hospitals.
In private hospitals, women are met by their own doctors, who oversee their labor and deliveries. But in public hospitals, babies are delivered by whomever is on duty, and a woman may never see a doctor.
Officials of the private institutions that provide care in the public hospitals acknowledge that many delivery rooms are understaffed, and that midwives and trainees have sometimes been given more responsibility than they can handle. But they contend that the city has not given them money to provide enough experienced doctors to handle every shift adequately in overcrowded hospitals.
 
Inattention
Without a Doctor, A Tiny Beat Fades
 Vilma Martinez remembers the time, 10:04 P.M., and the silence and, most particularly, the wordless message of the nurse, who drew a finger across her throat as if she were slashing it with a knife. The meaning was clear: The baby was dead.
After that, she remembers little. But she can return to the morning of that day, when the labor pains started, and recall with some precision the 14 hours that led up to the stillbirth of her only child. It was a boy -- 6 pounds 13 ounces -- and his heart had been beating steadily and strongly when she entered Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center at 8 A.M. on July 23, 1993.
Officials of the hospital will not discuss what happened to Ms. Martinez or explain why no doctor came to her aid. Ms. Martinez and her boyfriend, Tomas C. Abreu, the baby's father, have filed a lawsuit against Woodhull and the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. They, too, declined to discuss the case, but their recollections are recorded in court depositions that provide searing accounts of a day of joy that dissolved into worry, then panic, then despair.
Their version of what happened is supported in large part by the notes of the nurses who tried, with increasing desperation, to find a doctor, and when they could not, tried to deliver the baby themselves.
Ms. Martinez, an emigrant from the Dominican Republic, was 23 when she learned in December 1992 that she was pregnant. She and Mr. Abreu, who was also from the Dominican Republic, had minimum-wage jobs at a glass and mirror company and had been living together for about two years in the East New York section of Brooklyn.
Her health was good and her pregnancy was uncomplicated. She took her vitamins conscientiously and went to Woodhull for monthly, and later weekly, checkups.
So there was no cause for concern when the labor pains began about 7 A.M. on that Friday morning in July. By 7:45 A.M., she was in the car with Mr. Abreu and her mother, and by 8 A.M., they had arrived at Woodhull, the strikingly modern medical complex that rises above the warehouses, storefronts and working-class homes of Greenpoint and Williamsburg.
After an hour, a nurse on the seventh floor, the maternity floor, motioned for her to climb on a gurney.
Because Ms. Martinez understood little English and the nurses and midwives spoke no Spanish, their communication was limited to gestures and facial expressions. It went that way the entire day. Forty percent of the people in the area around Woodhull speak primarily Spanish, but no one on the staff translated for Ms. Martinez.
Eventually, she was put in a little room where she spent the long day. About noon, a nurse inserted an intravenous line in her arm. The contractions gathered strength as a monitor kept track of the baby's heartbeat, and her mother and Mr. Abreu hovered near her bed.
About 5 P.M. she began bleeding heavily and it seemed to go on and on "like a blood bath," she recalled.
Near 7:30 P.M., she was screaming from pain, and someone who seemed to be a doctor went to the door of the room. He spoke to the nurses, but left almost immediately. "He didn't even touch me or anything," she recalled.
A nurse's note at 7:40 P.M. described another sign of trouble -- "prolonged decelerations" in the fetal heart rate. The rate often drops during contractions, but should rise again. Prolonged drops can mean the baby is not getting enough oxygen.
So the nurse called for the doctor and the midwife, according to the log. The doctor examined Ms. Martinez and gave instructions that she should not push, the log said. Neither Ms. Martinez nor Mr. Abreu recalled the doctor's actually having examined her. The nurse's notes do not explain why the doctor left.
Soon, the baby's head was visible and the nurse and the midwife shooed Ms. Martinez's mother out of the room.
They began struggling to get the baby out, Ms. Martinez said, turning her this way and that, even face down for a while. They tried turning the baby's head, too, but nothing seemed to work. The baby was stuck. She recalls being "crazy, desperate with pain."
The nurse's notes mention that a doctor examined Ms. Martinez at 8:30 P.M. But neither Ms. Martinez nor Mr. Abreu recall seeing a doctor after about 7:30 P.M.
The final two hours were the most harrowing, the couple said. They were left mostly alone in the room, with no idea where the nurses had gone, as the heart monitor bleeped, spewing yards of paper that recorded the baby's struggle for life.
Mr. Abreu recalled watching the glow of the monitor and the tiny heart-shaped light, "like a little heart that seemed to be beating." He kept up a constant patter to reassure her, but she kept asking for a doctor. "She was saying, 'I am going to die.' "
Mr. Abreu left the room in search of a doctor, and was told that the doctors on duty were on the eighth floor performing a Caesarean section. He returned to the room and stood vigil. Then he noticed that the baby's heartbeat was slowing markedly. Ms. Martinez recalled that he left the room again, "just desperate." And she remembered hearing him ask -- beg -- for a doctor.
But all he could find was a nurse, so he took her back to show her the monitor. "I was also looking at the heart, at the little heart," he said. "It had stopped."
An entry in the nurse's log at 9:20 P.M. notes "continuous" fetal heart rate decelerations. At that point, the midwife "said to call in an M.D.," according to the log. But two doctors were busy doing a Caesarean section and a third was occupied in the emergency room, the log said.
"We cannot get an M.D. to see the patient," the nurse wrote.
To Ms. Martinez, the midwife seemed desperate. "She didn't even put on her gloves in order to grab the child," Ms. Martinez said. The midwife shouted for her to push and someone pressed on her abdomen. They got the baby out, and started slapping and pounding, but he did not draw a breath or make a sound.
Finally, a doctor entered the room. The midwife turned to him, and silently drew a finger across her neck.
"I started to scream and scream," Ms. Martinez said. "A mother, while she is giving birth, how can she feel when that is happening? I was desperate."
Others came, and as the doctors and nurses whispered among themselves, Mr. Abreu asked them to explain what had happened. "But they wouldn't tell me a thing," he said. "All they were saying was that the baby was dead."
 
Shortages
Disaster Reports Are Suppressed
 Delivery room disasters became frequent a decade ago, when a wave of new immigrants began crowding into aging hospitals, increasing pressure on medical staffs already overburdened.
As deliveries rose more than 30 percent in the 1980's, even the most diligent staffs were overwhelmed. The overflow fell to nurses, midwives and residents, doctors in their first years after medical school.
Then, at some busy obstetrics wards, including Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the South Bronx and North Central Bronx Hospital, the residents were pulled out. Their training programs had been shut down because the national officials who accredited them feared that the public hospitals were tossing young medical school graduates in over their heads.
The effects of the crowding and staff shortages were felt immediately, with more accidents and mistakes, particularly in the delivery rooms.
For example, Dr. Wayne Cohen, who in 1984 ran North Central Bronx Hospital's obstetrics department, recalled that a number of newborns were injured as the hospital became more reliant on nurse-midwives, who were not trained for the frenetic pace and difficult deliveries. A typical big-city hospital might have five or six serious birth injuries a year, he said. But, at North Central Bronx, he said, "There were twice that number of everything, and I didn't get to hear of everything."
At Metropolitan Hospital Center in East Harlem, officials called in the police in the late 1980's because several newborns mysteriously suffered broken arms or legs. Police officials say they never determined the cause, or when the babies were injured.
About that time, officials of the hospitals corporation grew so alarmed after some serious incidents at Lincoln that they complained to New York Medical College, which provides the medical care at Lincoln.
But in a vast system that bounces from crisis to crisis, from budget shortfalls to political scandals, officials of the Health and Hospitals Corporation were unable to put together all the pieces to perceive what was rapidly becoming a systemwide crisis.
In 1983, alarmed by a rise in malpractice awards, analysts for the city's Office of Management and Budget began a far-reaching, confidential study. After poring over 2,000 lawsuits, they found a disturbing pattern: Many of the worst cases involved residents in the delivery rooms and elsewhere who nervously bumbled through with little guidance from senior doctors.
The 165-page report, completed in 1991, was ignored. Its authors said the patterns had continued, but by the time the study was printed and bound, lawyers for the city said it was based on old information.
A year later, Ms. Holtzman, the City Comptroller, finished her report. "The enormous cost of impaired newborn cases in both human suffering and taxpayer dollars requires the City's attention," it said.
Among its findings were these: In 12 of the 64 cases reviewed, the staff failed to react promptly to signs of fetal distress ; in 5, the staff failed to perform adequate fetal monitoring; in 9, the staff "unreasonably delayed" Caesarean sections; in 11, oxytocin, a drug used to induce labor, was improperly administered.
As Ms. Holtzman prepared to make her report public, the hospitals corporation blocked its release, arguing that it was based on privileged information.
Alan G. Hevesi, her successor, said he was unaware of the report until The Times requested it. He released a copy, saying that it was too important to remain secret.
By the time Ms. Holtzman finished her report, delivery room disasters had become a recurring theme in confidential weekly meetings held by the hospital agency to analyze its most mishandled cases. In these discussions, known as quality assurance meetings, officials speak bluntly, naming doctors and upbraiding administrators with the understanding that by state law, none of what they say leaves the room.
Most delivery rooms in the system have come up for sharp criticism at these sessions, usually because of mistakes by unsupervised trainee-doctors and midwives, said four participants in the weekly meetings, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified. Over the last five years, the delivery rooms of four hospitals have been cited more frequently than the others, said the participants. These hospitals are Woodhull, Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, North Central Bronx and Lincoln.
Over the same five years, the State Health Department, which regulates hospitals, has rebuked the four hospitals and Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn for delivery room mistakes, state records show.
Regulators found instances in which overworked staffs, including residents, misdiagnosed serious conditions and made patients wait perilously long for treatment.
In interviews, officials of most of the hospitals acknowledged delivery room problems, but said that they had made significant improvements in recent years.
At Woodhull, for example, officials said the director of obstetrics was forced out late last year after a series of mistakes by the staff in the delivery room.
"I'm not going to make any apologies for Woodhull," said Dr. Siegel, the head of the hospitals agency, who added that he was replacing the private corporation that runs Woodhull, Woodhull Medical Associates. He said that many of the hospital's patients were going elsewhere because of Woodhull's reputation for poor care.
"That obstetrics department is closing down on its own," Dr. Siegel said.
At Lincoln Hospital, officials said they were working on their problems, which they said were caused by poor supervision of residents and unreasonable waiting times for women seeking prenatal care. "We were asking for trouble," said Roberto Rodriguez, the executive director. "We were taking a risk."
Jean Leon, the executive director of Kings County Hospital, said she has seen no delivery room problems since she arrived in July, 1994.
Howard Cohen, the director of Coney Island Hospital, said any problems at his hospital were caused by the press of high-risk patients.
Officials at North Central Bronx said their problems resulted from poor supervision and understaffing.
 
Midwives
Signs of Trouble, No Sign of M.D.
 By the time Michael Elias Cottes was born on Feb. 11, 1994, his left shoulder and arm were broken. He was so hopelessly stuck after 20 hours of labor that the obstetrician cracked his tiny bones trying to wrest him free.
Still, his birth was a moment of triumph for his mother, Miriam Miranda. She had come to terms with her having the AIDS virus, and had sought out prenatal care with something approaching zeal. At 35, she had beaten back gestational diabetes and even learned to give herself insulin injections.
So, when the doctor at North Central Bronx Hospital finally extracted the silent child and rushed him out of the delivery room, Ms. Miranda allowed herself to rejoice, savoring the minutes as she waited for the doctor to bring her baby back. "I was so happy," she recalled in an interview.
But the doctor returned alone and in tears. "Miriam," she said, "we did what we could. The baby was without oxygen for 10 minutes."
Michael lived for 77 days, probably deaf and blind.
Throughout the torturous hours of labor, Ms. Miranda had been in such pain that she was only vaguely aware of the drama unfolding around her. She did not know that the midwife had seen signs of serious trouble on a monitor. And she did not know that by the time the doctor arrived, it was already too late to do much for the baby.
Last March, officials of North Central Bronx held a private meeting and admitted among themselves that the hospital had made some mistakes in her case. Specifically, they acknowledged, such a complex delivery should have been handled by a doctor from the start, according to an internal report obtained by The Times.
From the time of her first prenatal visit at North Central Bronx, Ms. Miranda was seen almost exclusively by midwives. They did the pelvic exams, weighed and measured her and drew blood for routine tests. "They told me it was a boy," she said in a recent interview, "a boy who was doing good."
As soon as she learned she was pregnant, Ms. Miranda did everything she could think of to have a healthy baby. She quit a steady job as a cafeteria worker in Puerto Rico, and with her two children moved to New York City, where, she believed, she would get the best possible care.
"She wanted to have this baby," said Tracy Stockham, the state case worker who helped Ms. Miranda navigate the complex bureaucracy of services for H.I.V.-positive women. "She said, 'This will be my last child because I'm infected.' "
In her seventh month, when a test showed that she had developed diabetes, her midwife said that she lacked the expertise to continue with the case. But instead of turning Ms. Miranda over to an obstetrician, the midwife referred her to another midwife.
Still, Ms. Miranda did well. At 10 A.M. on Feb. 10, 1994, at the end of her 40th week, she entered the warren of small labor and delivery rooms on the hospital's seventh floor, where a midwife administered Pitocin, a powerful drug that induces labor.
By 3 A.M. the next day, 17 hours later, the baby was still not out. According to hospital records, the fetal monitor, which keeps track of the baby's heartbeat, showed irregularities.
This meant one of two things: Either the baby was not getting enough oxygen through the umbilical cord, or the monitor was not giving an accurate reading, a common occurrence.
So the midwife faced life-and-death choices. She could prick the baby's scalp with an electrode to check its blood for oxygen, possibly exposing him to the AIDS virus. She could let the labor take its course and hope that all was well. Or, she could summon a doctor to perform an emergency Caesarean section.
She let the labor proceed. In the end, a doctor arrived to help deliver the baby, but it was too late. The fetal monitor had been correct. The baby's oxygen had been cut off. The 8-pound 10-ounce boy had to be resuscitated and suffered from seizures.
There is no explanation in the hospital records for why a doctor did not intervene earlier.
The hospital offered to let Michael, who was being fed through a tube, spend his last days there. But Ms. Miranda, ever hopeful, took him home after nine weeks to her Bronx apartment with a nurse to help care for him. She recalled that he cried only once during the final two weeks of his life. As it turned out, he was not infected with H.I.V.
Once, she bundled him up and and proudly brought him to visit Ms. Stockham, the caseworker who had sent her to North Central Bronx.
"The baby was constantly gasping for air," Ms. Stockham recalled. "Miriam said: 'People are saying Michael can't see or hear. But when I sing to him, he turns to me.'
"I had to look inside myself," Ms. Stockham said, "and say, 'Did I do the right thing by sending her to this hospital?' "
 
Residents
Young Trainees Left Unsupervised
 Young doctors just out of medical school are the backbone of New York's public hospitals. There are more than 3,500 of these trainees, or residents, working in the system to get experience and learn specialties.
Because the system depends so heavily on them, it is crucial that the hospitals attract top graduates. A need to improve the quality of residents was one reason the city entered into its partnership with New York's most renowned private medical institutions 30 years ago. The theory was that the private hospitals could use their reputations to attract the best medical school graduates, then rotate them through the public system.
But for a variety of reasons, some of these private institutions have set up separate residency programs for the city hospitals, which have generally attracted graduates with poorer qualifications.
For example, Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons runs two programs -- one for Presbyterian Hospital, the other for the city's Harlem Hospital Center. Virtually all the residents working at Presbyterian are graduates of medical schools in the United States, including some of the most prestigious in the country. But only 34 percent of the residents working at Harlem graduated from schools in this country. The rest were trained at foreign schools, many in developing nations.
Foreign medical school graduates, especially those from developing countries, are generally less desirable to hospitals because they may be unfamiliar with the newest technology and treatments, hospital corporation officials say. Dr. J. Emilio Carrillo, who was president of the corporation from 1990 to 1991, said he frequently complained that some training programs had far too many students educated overseas.
Columbia officials said that Harlem Hospital decided decades ago to have its own residency program in order to attract black graduates who might one day practice in the neighborhood. Dr. Edward B. Healton, associate dean of Columbia and medical director of Harlem Hospital, said that the Harlem program was not as popular as Columbia's, and had difficulty attracting graduates of United States medical schools.
Mount Sinai School of Medicine runs three hospitals, one private and two public. Most of its residents rotate through all three. But in some specialties, there are separate residency programs at each hospital. In these fields, more than 95 percent of the residents working at Mount Sinai are graduates of medical schools in the United States. But that is true of only half the residents at the city-owned Queens Hospital Center. And only 68 percent of the residents in the program set up separately for Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens graduated from schools in this country.
Under their city contracts, the private hospitals are also supposed to supply attending physicians, the senior doctors who supervise residents. But virtually every study has accused the private hospitals of leaving residents largely unsupervised.
The hospital most frequently cited for leaving care to residents is Kings County Hospital Center, one of the nation's busiest and biggest.
In November 1991, the State Health Department concluded in a scathing report that there was "inadequate, and in some cases nonexistent" supervision.
A month later, on Dec. 23, Roxane Murray, a healthy 24-year-old who had just received an honorable discharge from her Army Reserve unit, entered Kings County to deliver her second child. By Christmas Eve, Ms. Murray was in a coma, and 17 days later, she was dead.
Her medical records relate a chaotic 27 hours, during which much of her care was provided by residents. The chain of events that led to her death began when a fetal monitor malfunctioned, making it impossible to determine the baby's condition. So a decision was made to do a Caesarean section, and a first-year resident in obstetrics was allowed to perform the operation. In the recovery room, a first-year resident in anesthesiology supervised Ms. Murray's care.
She hemorrhaged for at least one hour before the attending physician, the senior doctor on duty, checked on her and then left. Because Ms. Murray continued to hemorrhage, the residents ordered intravenous prostaglandin, the drug of choice to stop the bleeding, but the hospital pharmacy did not have any. So they tried a prostaglandin suppository, a less effective treatment.
Later, as Ms. Murray lapsed into unconsciousness, the attending physician and the chief resident performed a hysterectomy to control the bleeding. It didn't work.
Several hours passed and senior doctors in the obstetrics department did exploratory surgery. They found four liters of blood in her abdomen and quickly tried to tie off an artery that was gushing, but accidentally sliced through a nearby vein. She never regained consciousness. The baby, an 8-pound 14-ounce boy, and his brother are being reared by Ms. Murray's mother.
State regulators, called in by the family's lawyer, Michael V. Kaplen, excoriated the hospital for "ineffective, inappropriate treatment." At no point did any doctor or resident call in an expert in hematology, who might have got the bleeding under control, the regulators said.
In addition to residents, there is a little-known class of trainee doctors working in New York hospitals. They are house doctors, medical school graduates who have either failed or not yet taken licensing examinations.
Hospitals turn to them when they have trouble attracting fully qualified doctors, or cannot fill night and weekend shifts. The graduate is granted a two-year "limited permit" by the state to practice only in one hospital under close supervision.
Dr. Siegel, the head of the hospital agency, said he was not happy with the use of house doctors and was moving to phase them out.
Until last December, shortly before his limited permit expired, Narpat S. Panwar was one of them. A native of India and a graduate of the University of Guadalajara Medical School in Mexico, Dr. Panwar had been trying unsuccessfully to pass the national examinations for 14 years when he was hired by Woodhull hospital in 1993 to work as an obstetrician.
Dr. Panwar was on duty over the Fourth of July weekend in 1993 when Paula Toala arrived to deliver her baby. He saw her through an extremely difficult 10-hour labor.
Eventually, he got the baby out, but only then found what the trouble had been: The infant, whose mother was average size, weighed an extraordinary 13 pounds.
Dr. Panwar had twisted and stretched the neck and shoulders severely enough to cause nerve damage, the family's lawyer, Jesse S. Waldinger, said in papers filed in a malpractice suit. The child suffers from Erb's palsy, a nerve injury that has limited movement in her right arm, he said.
"This is a case that was screaming for a Caesarean section," Mr. Waldinger said. In the court papers, he argued that Dr. Panwar should have called for assistance.
Dr. Panwar, 51, is now practicing in West Virginia and has obtained a full license after passing his examinations. He declined to discuss the case. The city is fighting it.
 
Making Changes
Bronx Municipal Takes Giant Steps
 Bronx Municipal Hospital Center, a sprawling complex that has served the east Bronx for 40 years, is one public hospital that has made significant progress toward solving its delivery room problems.
Hospital officials have acknowledged that through the 1980's newborns were injured there because of mistakes by unsupervised residents working in an overcrowded maternity ward.
In June 1992, jolted by major lawsuits, the hospital pushed the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, which oversees care at Bronx Municipal, to revamp the delivery room.
Midwives were instructed to call for help at the first sign of trouble, and residents were told not to perform Caesarean sections without a senior doctor in the room. One nurse was specifically assigned to spot the problem cases and try to make sure that a similar mistake did not occur again.
"The city was spending so much money defending obstetrics suits, they just made a decision that it would be cheaper to hire people who knew what they were doing," said Dr. Wayne Cohen, the medical director of Bronx Municipal Hospital.
The drop in delivery injuries to mothers and infants was swift. The program cost about $750,000.
In 1993, the change was noticed at the hospital agency's headquarters, where Edna Wells Handy, the general counsel, said she had already concluded that injuries to newborns were among the worst problems facing a troubled system.
Ms. Handy said she asked the city for $1.5 million in 1993 to expand the Bronx Municipal program to two other hospitals struggling with delivery room problems. But by the time the proposal made its way through the bureaucracy, there was a new mayor and a new administration at the hospital corporation with little knowledge of the delivery room crisis or her proposal.
"If it really works, I'll do it," Dr. Siegel said in an interview Feb. 15. "I'm disturbed that I hadn't heard about it before."

Chart: "H.H.C. vs. Private: Different Death Rates"
 Death rates of new borns are higher at the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation than for private hospitals. In explaining the difference, H.H.C. officials point out that their maternity patients have more problems before they enter the hospital. But a New York Times analysis of 1993 birth and death records found that H.H.C. death rates were higher even after accounting for difference in the mother's age, sex, income, prior medical conditions, prenatal care and use of drugs or tobacco.

HEADLINE: State Will Run Public Schools In Cleveland

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, March 4

 BODY:
A judge has handed control of Ohio's largest school district over to the state after ruling that money and management problems were standing in the way of education.
The judge, Robert B. Krupansky of Federal District Court, ordered state Superintendent Ted Sanders to assume "immediate supervision and operational, fiscal and personnel management" of the Cleveland school district. 
 The order was issued at the end of Sammie Campbell Parrish's last day as superintendent of the city's nearly broke public schools. Ms. Parrish, hired in 1992 to reform the debt-ridden district, said she could not take the stress any longer.
The takeover ordered on Friday will not affect the 74,000 students or their classes, and all salaries will be paid.
"Hopefully, the board, the district and the entire community is prepared to recognize the existing realities of the crisis confronting the Cleveland school system and the need for immediate, decisive and perhaps unpopular action," Judge Krupansky wrote.
The judge told Mr. Sanders to speed state approval of a $29.5 million loan to see the district through its financial crisis. Judge Krupansky also ordered the state superintendent to fill the management vacancies and submit a reorganization plan for the administration.
In addition, Judge Krupansky gave the school board until May 1 to identify 14 under-used, rundown district buildings that should be closed, and told the district to prepare a campaign to pass a tax.
The board president, Lawrence Lumpkin, said the board would cooperate, although he did not agree with the judge's decision.

HEADLINE: O'Connor Links Cuts in Welfare to More Abortions

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS 

 BODY:
John Cardinal O'Connor said last week that the legislation cutting back welfare proposed in the Republican Party's Contract With America was "immoral in its virtually inevitable consequences."
The strongly worded statement, which came in a column that appeared on Thursday in Catholic New York, the archdiocese weekly, drew attention to the fears of many abortion opponents that the political party that has been their standard-bearer is now championing a measure that could result in tens or even hundreds of thousands of additional abortions. 
 In his column Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, cited the case of Representative Jim Bunn of Oregon, a strong opponent of abortion who is one of the Republicans swept into Congress last November on the conservative tide.
Precisely because of his anti-abortion convictions, Mr. Bunn has refused to sign the Republican contract.
It is an awkward position for a freshman Republican, Mr. Bunn says, but he just cannot approve the welfare cuts that the contract proposes and that the House Ways and Means Committee is now debating.
"As a pro-life member of Congress," Mr. Bunn said at a press conference last month, "I thought it was quite inconsistent to tell someone with a crisis pregnancy to have her babies but refuse to help her."
Mr. Bunn, along with other Republican dissenters, like Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, is currently sending a "Dear Colleague" letter to other House members maintaining that proposed reductions in Federal welfare assistance are "likely to produce dire consequences for innocent unborn children."
Other declared opponents of abortion disagree with this position. The Christian Coalition, for example, continues to lobby actively for the contract. Ralph Reed, the coalition's executive director, says the main goal of welfare cuts is to stop subsidizing "the culture of illegitimacy and dependency." Once unwanted pregnancies and single parenthood are no longer perceived as the Government's responsibility, the theory goes, Americans will voluntarily support a vast network of church and private efforts to help women in need.
Southern Baptist Convention leaders who have challenged the nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr. for Surgeon General of the Public Health Service because he has performed abortions are not taking a position on welfare reductions. But they surmise that even stiff measures could quite likely reduce rather than increase abortions, at least in the long run.
Cardinal O'Connor agreed that there were "some fine ideas" in the contract, but said that the welfare proposal "isn't one of them."
Richard Land, executive director of the Christian Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, does not deny the basis of the Cardinal's fears. "We do not want to see women aborting their babies because they see it is not economically viable to have those babies," Mr. Land said in a telephone interview.
But Mr. Land views the current welfare system as so destructive of marriage and the discipline essential to well-being in a free-market society that he is urging a thorough overhaul of the system without taking a position for or against the proposed cuts.
"There are two competing evils here," he said. "We're going to resist being boxed into a corner where we have to choose one over the other. We are going to do our best to have our cake and eat it too."
The division over abortion and welfare is only partly a matter of different Christian traditions. Mr. Land pointed out that although Roman Catholic bishops had also called for changing the welfare system, their judgments about "how evil it is" were mixed.
But Protestant leaders in the National Right to Life Committee have vocally opposed the proposed welfare reductions, while some Catholic leaders close to the Republican Party have either kept silent or, like the Rev. Robert A. Sirico, a leader in the growing school of Catholic free-market theorists, strongly backed them.
"I would go further than the contract," said Father Sirico, who is president of the Acton Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Grand Rapids, Mich., and devoted to making a moral case for the market economy.
The likelihood of more abortions as an outgrowth of welfare reductions is not clear, he said, noting that the number of abortions had dropped in some states after welfare benefits were cut.
Cardinal O'Connor, in his column, also discussed thinkers who admit that welfare cuts will probably increase abortions in the short term but insist that eventually those reductions will change sexual behavior and yield fewer abortions. He said he was "unaware of any hard evidence" supporting their analyses.
And in a sentence reflecting the anguish this issue is stirring in the anti-abortion ranks, he asked whether even a long-term benefit could offset "a programmed 'short-term' increase in abortions, if we believe that every abortion destroys a human life?"

HEADLINE: Fishing Fleets Are Battling Over Territory Along Coast

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NARRAGANSETT, R.I., March 4

 BODY:
In the 1970's, New England fishermen banded together to keep Russian and Japanese fishing vessels out of their territory, but the camaraderie has frayed now that some fishermen are barred from their traditional fishing grounds and are moving elsewhere.
For several years after the Federal Government barred foreign fleets from coastal waters, fish were plentiful. 
 The number of boats increased and the hauls got larger, depleting the populations of cod, haddock and flounder. Then disaster struck, leading fishing regulators in October to close the Georges Bank, a rich fishing ground 150 miles off New England.
The ban, put into effect so fish schools could rejuvenate, expires in June, but Government officials say it will be extended.
Now, those northern New England fleets are looking elsewhere to fill their nets, with some setting their sites on Rhode Island, where fishermen have been pulling in monkfish, butterfish and squid, species that bring less money, but remain plentiful.
"We've put a lot of time into learning how to catch these fish and where to sell them," said James McCauley, president of the fishermen's cooperative association in Point Judith, R.I. "There's only so much fish down here, and there's not much room left for others. We'll just be cutting up the pie in smaller pieces."
Those left with empty nets say they have no choice.
"We've got to go somewhere," said Howard Nickerson, who heads the Offshore Mariner's Association of New Bedford, Mass. "We could be closed off from our traditional catch for years."
Recognizing the problem, the Commerce Department said on Friday that it would spend $2 million in a pilot program to buy back boats from struggling New England fishermen.
For generations, the big boats out of New Bedford and Gloucester, Mass., fished Georges Bank, where the frigid Labrador current meets the warm waters coming up from the south Atlantic, creating a optimal environment for the fish to live and breed.
Loaded with ice, boats as big as 250 feet spent a week to 10 days filling their holds with thousands of pounds of flounder, haddock and other species before putting back to shore.
While Georges Bank fishermen happily fished the North Atlantic, their counterparts in places like Point Judith and Cape May, N.J., and along the Virginia coast fished closer to shore.
Using smaller boats and nets that skip along the bottom rather than drag across, they hauled up butterfish, monkfish, mackerel and squid. Those fish always brought less money, but fishermen eventually developed lucrative foreign markets.
The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has been asked by Rhode Island fishermen and others elsewhere to ban new boats from fishing for monkfish and squid.
Georges Bank fishermen want anyone who has hauled up and sold as little as five pounds monkfish, squid and the other less-expensive types in the past two years to be allowed access to southern New England waters.
A University of Rhode Island professor, John Gates, said that the debate was predictable and that the fault lay with Government, which he said allowed overfishing in Georges Bank for years, causing certain fish populations to be decimated.
"The fish-management system has been a total failure," said Professor Gates, who teaches resource economics. "You can't get a bunch of individual states or people to agree on anything."

HEADLINE: President Yeltsin, in Perspective

 BODY:
When the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev found Communist Party member Boris Yeltsin too mercurial for his taste, he bounced him from the ruling Politburo. Though some in Washington seem to wish otherwise, President Clinton does not have that kind of option available as he tries to keep relations with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia on an even track. But there is more the Clinton Administration can and should do to talk bluntly with Mr. Yeltsin about misguided policies that are turning Russia away from reform.
Mr. Yeltsin has not looked so attractive lately. His brutish offensive in Chechnya is a political and military disaster. He has cut loose reformist advisers and embraced a clique of military and internal-security aides pushing repressive policies at home and a Soviet-style agenda abroad. His health is deteriorating or his drinking increasing. 
 The temptation to turn sharply away from Mr. Yeltsin and deal with other Russians is understandable, but mistaken. The United States worked with far less appealing Soviet leaders when American vital interests were at stake, as they are today in the preservation of political and economic reform in Russia, and the dismantling of Moscow's nuclear arsenal.
Washington needs to find a formula that keeps Mr. Yeltsin at the center of relations, where he must remain as the democratically elected leader of Russia, while not making the United States his cheerleader. That means engaging Mr. Yeltsin in an honest dialogue about his leadership, not disengaging from his presidency. It is a difficult balancing act. The partisan heat of the American Presidential campaign will not make it any easier.
Mr. Clinton got the balance right in his news conference on Friday, saying he would freely criticize but not shun Mr. Yeltsin. His Administration has not always done so. While criticizing the Chechen war, it has stuck doggedly by Mr. Yeltsin in recent weeks, cheering him on as the guardian angel of reform despite his increasingly tarnished record. This is no time to canonize Mr. Yeltsin or to suggest he holds exclusive title to reform in Russia. That makes the Clinton team look credulous, and undermines its defense of indispensable programs like the American aid that helps Russia deactivate and destroy its nuclear weapons.
Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader and Presidential candidate, may lean too far the other way. He called last week for distancing the United States from Mr. Yeltsin, without specifying how to accomplish that or describing the potential consequences.
Like Mr. Dole, this page has argued that Washington must not lock itself in a bear hug with Mr. Yeltsin the way it did with Mr. Gorbachev when his leadership was increasingly ephemeral. But keeping Mr. Yeltsin in perspective, and keeping lines open to reform leaders, is different from cutting Mr. Yeltsin out of the picture. Mr. Clinton does not have the luxury of bypassing Mr. Yeltsin to deal with others he might prefer.
Another generation of reformers is waiting to pick up the work Mr. Yeltsin started, like former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and the economist Grigory Yavlinsky. There are also politicians like Vladimir Zhirinovsky and generals like Aleksandr Lebed eager to turn back the changes already transforming Russia.
Writing off Mr. Yeltsin can only be taken as an effort by Washington to tinker with volatile political dynamics in Moscow, and is sure to backfire. If Russians are as unhappy with Mr. Yeltsin as opinion polls show, they will elect another president next year. That is their choice, not Washington's.

Bit by Bit

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
As a media celebrity, the Internet is now seriously overexposed. Were it a person, we might be as sick of it as we are of Lance Ito.
In recent weeks, it has made magazine covers from Newsweek to The Economist. Kevin Mitnick, the hacker who devoured the Internet, and Tsutomu Shimomura, the white hat who brought him to justice, have become national fixations, not to mention the subjects of an intense bidding war for book and movie rights ("Smart and Smarter"?). 
 Then there are the politicians. Along with Newt Gingrich, who has turned the Tofflers' third wave into a crashing cyberbore, and Al Gore, who can make the "information superhighway" sound like the New Jersey Turnpike, there is now Lamar Alexander. Last week Mr. Alexander became the first Presidential candidate to politick on the net by taking questions on-line. Given that his campaign shtick also includes donning a down-home populist's flannel shirt, is it too cynical to ask if his Powerbook is merely a prop, the cyber equivalent of a pre-digital politician's photogenic puppy?
None of this, however, has stopped me from getting sucked in. After fooling around within the circumscribed net of America Online -- until you have technical problems, when it becomes "America On Hold" -- I finally crossed into the vast, minimally charted cyberspace beyond, where Congressional bills, games and naughty pictures can be downloaded for the asking.
Still, that's not what made me an enthusiast. The happy surprise about the Internet is its unpredictable domestic political implications. No matter what the Speaker thinks, all those bits have not surrendered to his ideological program.
But first: the digital revolution's downside. Unless you're searching for specific information or documents, the net can seem no more miraculous than cable television. You leap from site to site hoping to click into a scintillating show but too often land instead in reruns or cryptic foreign-language fare or public-access amateur hours on a par with "Wayne's World." Yet you keep surfing anyway -- with so many choices, something must be happening -- until your attention span is shot, the night is lost and your eyeballs roll around like marbles.
As net-surfing can be as addictive as channel-surfing, so computer discussion groups can be as numbing as talk radio, albeit about a wider variety of subjects. Though the possibilities for actual contact with a stranger are far greater -- indeed, given E-mail, infinite -- the contact is human only in the sense that a 900 phone conversation is.
Sure, traveling within the Internet can be like visiting an enormous city, full of exotic neighborhoods, high-powered intellectual institutions, clubs and singles bars, but it's still a virtual city, with virtual life. For all its hubbub, it feels airless. And since interactivity is achieved with a click, those who live in cyberspace rather than merely visit there may develop the self-ostracizing habit of turning people on and off as if they were any other appliance that can be commanded with a remote control.
Yet these drawbacks are also pluses, insuring that the Internet will never supplant the real world for most users. While books and periodicals may well be increasingly disseminated by computer networks, they are simply too long to be read conveniently or pleasurably on screen; love cannot be consummated with a mouse, either.
The best news, though, is the Internet's uninhibited intellectual freedom. The net's sheer size and variety defy regulation and invite democracy far more than Mr. Gingrich seems to realize. Ideas that his supporters would like to drum out of classrooms are omnipresent on the net. Even now, the student who can click on to the Christian Coalition is just clicks away from a safe-sex manual, or, soon, the controversial National History Standards.
If, as the Speaker preaches, young Americans must click into the "third-wave information age" to get ahead, so they will inevitably click into, and perhaps buy into, every alternative life style, post-modern art form and political heresy that he and William Bennett have vowed to destroy. Has anyone noticed that the Internet is not only the revenge of the nerds, but a whopping stealth victory for the counterculture?

Get a Job? Strike Isn't So Bad at Low End of Pay Scale

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

 BODY:
Lou Piniella and Ron Davis, marquee players with the Yankees, waited on tables at a midtown restaurant in Manhattan. Other players worked, too, some counting their pennies while contemplating the sale of their homes as they scrambled to survive what was then the unthinkable: the 50-day baseball strike of 1981.
The 14 years since then have brought inflation to major league baseball. Star players who felt the crunch in 1981, even in an era when $400,000 annual salaries were not uncommon, have given way to $7 million-a-year players who routinely see $400,000 paychecks twice a month. 
 Players such as Barry Bonds, who makes $43,000 each day of a regular season, and Ken Griffey Jr., who is in the $30,000-plus bracket, have not had to find other employment during the current work stoppage, which began last August and threatens to spill into the 1995 season.
But what of life at the other end of the pay scale, where you find the minimum-wage players who made the mandated $109,000 last season?
"We're doing all right," Woody Williams, a 29-year-old right-hander with the Toronto Blue Jays, said from his home in Alvin, Tex. "We've been on strike for over 200 days but, in essence, most of that has been the off season, so it hasn't been hard in that way."
What Williams referred to was that major league work is seasonal, with paychecks dispersed twice a month during the season. Even if the strike had long been settled, players would not be drawing their salaries until the regular season started.
Williams, of course, would miss those checks. He and his wife, the parents of a daughter who will turn 2 next month, expect a second child in May. Still, the pitcher said, he and his family are not panicking. One reason is a $127,000 World Series bonus share voted him by teammates after he had pitched well for the Blue Jays from May through September of 1993 in what turned out to be Toronto's second straight championship season.
"Nobody really suggested or hinted that we should necessarily put that away because of a possible strike," said Williams, who went 3-1 for the Blue Jays in 30 games in 1993 and 1-3 in 38 games last season, including getting Don Mattingly for the final out in Toronto's final game. "But from the first of the year on, we pretty much knew. And it was a blessing that they voted me a full share."
Minimum-wage players are also receiving money from the union's strike fund, a war chest made up of money from licensing fees paid to the players and union since 1990. There was an estimated $200 million in the fund when the strike started.
Since the strike began, $10,000 strike-fund payments have reportedly been given to players on three occasions, along with one $5,000 payment. Only players with at least one full season in the majors qualify for the full payment. The union, which is believed to have at least $150 million left in the fund, is expected to issue more checks April 15 if the strike is still on.
Because of service time, Williams has received nearly a full allotment. But David Veres, a pitcher with the Houston Astros who was first called to the majors last May and had one save in 31 games, has only received about three-quarters of the payouts from the fund.
For Veres, that and other sources of income have been enough for now. "I pitched in the Dominican Republic until January," Veres said of the winter leagues, which pay $2,500 to $3,000 a month. That salary is comparable to minor league baseball.
"I made a little bit of money down there for three months and that made it easier," said the pitcher, who lives in the Pacific Northwest. "It wasn't the big leagues, but at least I was playing in nice weather."
Veres said that if he had had his way, he wouldn't have gone to winter ball as early as he did, or at all. But like Williams, who has pitched in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela this winter, Veres also knows that winter ball, the strike fund and last season's paychecks have, together, tided him over. And kept him and his wife, Robin, from having to find other work.
"I didn't prepare for the strike," Veres said. "I only had four months up there, not two or three years to stockpile some money. Still, I made more last year in five months than I did in the minor leagues in three years. And I was still living like I was in Triple A.
"It was weird, but the more I was making, the more conscious I was about saving for the future. I wasn't living from check to check anymore and I became a little more cautious. That's helped."
So, Williams and Veres are getting by. But what of the life of striking players even less financially secure than the ones making the major league minimum wage? What of the minor leaguers who made little more than $2,500 a month in 1994, but whose presence on their clubs' 40-man major league rosters has made them full-fledged members of the players association and put them on strike in 1995 along with their wealthier brethren?
One such player, Ron Coomer of the Dodgers, knows life could be easier right now if he were, instead, the 41st or 52d best player in the Los Angeles organization.
If that were the case, he would probably be in the Dodgers' minor league camp, drawing a minor league salary, at least, and perhaps a lucrative stipend as a replacement player, if he chose to.
Because Coomer has yet to play in the major leagues, he does not qualify for strike funds. He is on his own.
But, said the 28-year-old third baseman, "I think as long as the union stands behind me, I'll stand behind the union."
As for longing to be on the payroll with lower-level minor leaguers, Coomer was equally adamant. "I don't see myself playing in the minor leagues ever again," said Coomer, who drove in 246 runs his past two seasons in the minors. "So, I'm happy to be on the major league roster. I expect to be in a Dodgers uniform. I'm not happy with my situation right now, but I'm as happy as you can get in this situation that we're in."
It might be said that Coomer can afford to be happier than most. He had the foresight two years ago to become co-owner of a baseball academy called Swingtown in his hometown of Crest Hill, Ill. That facility "is doing well, to say the least," Coomer said happily. "It easily brings me more than I ever made in salary playing in the minor leagues."
That financial well-being has not caused Coomer to forget about other 40-man-roster players, like him, who were also caught between the majors and minors without a strike-fund nickel to their names. It is why Coomer attended a union meeting in Phoenix last month to speak on their behalf.
"I just said that if this goes into April, into the season, things have to be evaluated on a financial level as far as some kind of funds allocated for the guys who don't have service time in," Coomer said. "Not for myself. Financially, my business is strong. But a guy who's working at Foot Locker, it's going to be very tough for him to make ends meet if he has a young family. How do you tell your family, 'I'm going to make money, I'm not going to play, I'm just going to sit home?'
"For me, I have absolutely no problem in staying here, but there are guys that I've talked to who are teammates or ex-teammates who are going to be scrapping if this thing goes that far."
Both Williams and Veres believe major leaguers, especially rich major leaguers, would respond to such a call.
"At the meetings, some of the guys who do have the money have asked, 'How are you doing?' and they meant financially," Williams said. "I told them, 'I'm fine.' But I also told them that heck, if I needed to, I'm not going to be too ashamed to come borrow."

Tougher Adversaries Might Face the Union

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 4

 BODY:
 Like a parent raising the specter of a bogeyman to a disobedient child, the owners have threatened the players with Jerry Reinsdorf and Robert Ballow.
If ya don't like what we've offered ya, they told the players, wait till ya see what ya get with Jerry and Ballow. 
 For the negotiating moment, Reinsdorf said he had no plans to step in and the owners don't plan to unleash this terrible trauma on the players, but if they don't come around soon, well, they'll have only themselves to blame.
Jerry Reinsdorf is the owner of the Chicago White Sox, the man viewed by the players' side and even some members of management as the Evil Emperor. Robert Ballow (pronounced Ballou, as in Cat) is a Nashville lawyer, who is notorious for his work in emasculating newspaper unions, among others.
Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies, who recently has been the owners' chief negotiator, raised the suggestion with reporters on Thursday that it might be time to bring in Reinsdorf as the lead negotiator and Ballow as the chief lawyer at the table.
Later that same day, Bud Selig, in an angry address to the players' negotiating committee, brought the threat closer to them. Explaining that he had appointed moderates like McMorris and John Harrington to conduct the negotiations, the acting commissioner said he could turn the talks over to Reinsdorf and Ballow and "let them blow the whole thing up."
"If, as Bud suggested yesterday, they want to bring somebody else in to beat up on the players from Tennessee, they'll bring somebody else in," Donald Fehr, the union leader, said when asked about the threat.
Chuck O'Connor, who has served as management's chief labor lawyer for five years, was asked how he would feel about being replaced.
"If you can't get the job done, at a certain point in time, people have a right to say they want to switch tacks," he said. But he added, "I don't know how much of that was hyperbole and how much of that was real."
If Reinsdorf were to lead the bargaining, O'Connor said, the owners probably would be wise to bring in Ballow, too.
"With Reinsdorf, that probably would be the right combination," said O'Connor, who is with Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in Washington. "Ballow and he are friendly. I have a lot of respect for Bob Ballow. His practice is a lot different than ours. That doesn't mean he's any better or worse. He represents a different mode of labor-management relations. It's not one that I have practiced."
Fehr has called Ballow "the Tribune union-buster," referring to his work for the Tribune Company, owner of the Chicago Cubs and The Chicago Tribune and former owner of The New York Daily News. Ballow is the Tribune lawyer who set labor strategy for those two papers.
"Bob's had an aggressive practice in the newspaper industry where he had to deal with entrenched unions in terms of automation," O'Connor said. "That's where he's really made his reputation. He's done an extraordinary job in terms of keeping employers running with replacement workers. Those, almost in the main, have been television, radio and newspapers. Those really have been what his practice has been. He's very good at it.
"But that is a sort of a different style than my firm has been noted for in terms of labor-management relations. We have been regarded as more friendly to organized labor and as people who negotiate for long periods of time for a lot of different parties with some very difficult unions.
"But we try and approach it from the standpoint of trying to put yourself in the other fellow's shoes and trying to figure out how to make a deal that he can live with. That's how we were all brought up in our firm. Bob, in fairness, has been confronted with unions that simply said, 'We don't want the automatic typesetters' -- or whatever these machines are -- 'and if you're going to get us out of here, you're going to have to blow us out of here.' He's responded to that challenge."
Ballow has not responded to telephone calls from reporters to discuss his involvement in baseball. As Tribune counsel, he has had input in the bargaining strategy, as have a few other club lawyers, O'Connor said.
"Bob has been more involved through Jerry and the Tribune Company," O'Connor related. "He's been one of the group of lawyers we've talked to about the N.L.R.B. cases, about where we are in negotiations, etc."
Union officials suspect that Ballow was behind the alterations the clubs made in the old work rules after they withdrew their salary cap and supposedly restored the status quo. The changes became the subject of the union's third unfair labor practice charge, which is expected to produce a complaint from the National Labor Relations Board soon.
"I can't tag Bob with responsibility for that," O'Connor said. "I mean the legal question. He concurred in it, but he wasn't the origin. I was, or we were. We had to bring back to the Player Relations Committee the ability to negotiate or otherwise forfeit the '95 economics in the context of an overall agreement. That was ours, not his."
O'Connor said he was compatible with Selig and McMorris in their approach to getting an agreement. "We're not looking for a fight," he said.
"I think Jerry Reinsdorf wants an agreement," the lawyer added. "The guy gets a bad rap in a sense that he wants an agreement perhaps on more aggressive terms."
Despite claims to the contrary, Selig insists that Reinsdorf does not dictate strategy as a back-room Machiavelli or Svengali. Reinsdorf scoffs at the idea, too.
"The union has invoked my name for the last five years as the bogeyman," Reinsdorf said. "I understand the strategy. When you have a large group of people you're trying to rally behind you, the best way of doing it is to have a common enemy. They chose five years ago to make me the common enemy. I wish they hadn't chosen me, but that's a reasonable strategy."
Reinsdorf said he "would love to wield the power they say I do," adding: "The only one who has power in baseball is Selig. He has the power to say 'I'll deliver X number of votes.' I can't deliver anyone's vote but my own. If I make persuasive arguments in meetings, I'd like to think some people would agree with me."
A high-ranking person on management's side recently said he had heard that Reinsdorf was claiming to have nine owners prepared to block any settlement they didn't like. Ratification of an agreement requires 21 votes from the 28 clubs.
"Of course not," he said when asked if he had made that claim or if it were true. "If the negotiators come back with a proposal I think is a bad deal," he added, "I'll certainly vote against it and lobby against it. But if Bud Selig is lobbying on the other side, I'll lose."
Reinsdorf, who serves on the owners' 12-person negotiating committee but not with the team that goes to the table, said that despite being waved over the players' heads in tandem with Ballow, he has no plans to enter the talks. "I doubt very much I will," he said.
Speaking before it was disclosed that movement had erupted in the talks Friday, Reinsdorf said he didn't want to join the talks because he didn't want to waste his time waiting for Fehr to want to make a deal.
"Don Fehr has done something that no one in baseball history has been able to do -- unify the owners," Reinsdorf said. "We put on our negotiating team mild-mannered, reasonable people who weren't looking for a whole loaf, who always have been able to make deals, and they have just thrown up their hands in frustration."
And thrown out the names of Reinsdorf and Ballow.

HEADLINE: The $4.25-an-Hour Question

 BODY:
To the Editor:
When discussing labor-management disputes, newspaper numbers somehow always become the Sunday-holiday-midnight-overtime rate, grossed-up with payroll taxes and benefits. But in your vision of contented, grateful, plantation workers, "A City Built on $4.25 an Hour" (Feb. 12), there seems to be no benefits at all. That's possible when you're young and healthy (and lucky). But it's easy to imagine one of Jacksonville, N.C.'s $8,840-a-year workers making the mistake of believing that Social Security is a pension plan. Does Newt Gingrich know that we're all partners with Jacksonville's clever employers? It takes a lot of Medicare to make up for 65 years of no health care at all. It's ironic that the advice given in a town where restaurants are the major employers is, "Don't go out to eat. Don't use credit cards." Where would the United States economy be today if everyone had been forced to follow those recommendations since World War II?

HEADLINE: When Wal-Mart Pulls Out, What's Left?

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: NOWATA, Okla.

 BODY:
THIS is a city that Wal-Mart ditched.
Hundreds of communities have wrestled with Wal-Mart coming to town as it raced across rural America to become the nation's biggest retailer. For years, the script has been familiar. Wal-Mart arrives in a city creating both excitement and trepidation, a sign of a community's stature but a threat to its local shopkeepers. Small stores often shut down, unable to match the big chain's prices. Across the country, town after town has struck the same bargain by embracing the retailing juggernaut: the downtown is Wal-Mart. 
 For Nowata, like three other communities in northeastern Oklahoma and a small but growing number of towns elsewhere, it has proved a risky bargain. When Wal-Mart pulls up and departs, it leaves both a hole in the old downtown and a gash across the entire local economy.
Wal-Mart has outraged and hobbled this struggling city of barbed wire, comatose oil fields and 3,900 people since shutting its store here a year ago. Public services have been cut, taxes have risen, and jobs are scarcer. Wal-Mart bank deposits and wages that helped sustain the economy have shrunk. People now have to take to the highways to shop for clothes and household goods.
Businesses jolt and jilt communities all the time, of course. Stores, like factories, come and go. No one complains when businesses bring booms and jobs to town. And Wal-Mart, to be sure, is a thriving, growing corporation that is opening new stores far more often than it abandons places like this.
 
Not Keeping Its Bargain?
 But when Wal-Mart does leave a city like Nowata, the local reaction is so sharp partly because people tend to expect more of the colossus from Bentonville, Ark. Its culture is plain-folks, and its success is rooted in small-town America, wooing consumers other retailers ignored by offering them low prices and national brands. So citizens of the Oklahoma towns that Wal-Mart has abandoned -- even rock-ribbed conservative business executives -- attack the company for its behavior here. They say Wal-Mart failed to keep its side of the bargain.
"They were not playing fair," said Bryan L. Lee, president of the First National Bank of Nowata, who keeps copies of National Review, the conservative monthly, on the waiting-room coffee table. "They came in and ravaged all the small businesses. And when it came to the point where they were not satisfied, they left."
Armel Richardson, who owns a propane business and the town's only new-car dealership, was the mayor when Wal-Mart arrived. "They said, 'We're here,' and we welcomed them," he recalled recently.
Yet now that Wal-Mart has gone, Mr. Richardson leaves little doubt how Nowata's feelings have changed. "Wal-Mart has proven this: They're big and greedy," he said. "They have no compassion for the community or the individual."
The Nowata experience could add grist to the debate over Wal-Mart's current advance into the Northeast. Ken Murnan, who owns a printing business here and publishes the weekly Nowata County People, said its foes would find ammunition here. "I don't see any way that Wal-Mart's coming in is a benefit to a small community," he said. "Not if you want to keep the life style you have now."
Wal-Mart shut the store here so it could lure shoppers to a vastly bigger "supercenter" 30 miles away in Bartlesville. But the company might be disappointed: many people say they won't go near the place. And their animosity has been passed to the children. A schoolyard chant these days: "Wal-Mart Fall-Apart."
Wal-Mart's retreat has stung this community in dozens of ways. It was Nowata's biggest business and, with a payroll of 70, the city's No. 2 employer, after a nursing home. Nowata's disproportionately large population of the poor and the old, many without cars, have lost a place where they could walk to work and to shop.
The biggest measurable impact, though, is the hole in the city's finances. The city manager, Nancy Shipley, said the loss of Nowata's 3 percent tax on its biggest business's sales has driven this year's $ 1.2 million municipal budget into the red by some $ 80,000.
To cope, Ms. Shipley is closing the city hall an hour early each day. She has called off plans to resurface crumbling roads and to put a new roof on the city park's leaky shelter. She has laid off her office receptionist, the street foreman and the dump's part-time supervisor. Water and sewer taxes have been raised 32 percent. Ms. Shipley says she expects to ask the five city commissioners for a $ 5 monthly tax on homeowners for fire protection.
Last month, she wrote to David D. Glass, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores in Bentonville, "to BEG you to do something to help our city." As of late last week, she said, Mr. Glass had not replied.
 
It Was Doing Just Fine
 The stores Wal-Mart keeps building in towns like Nowata still deliver the bulk of company revenues. And past performance of smaller stores seems unrelated to decisions to fold them.
Wal-Mart's famously secretive management says that for competitive reasons it cannot discuss such matters. But Mr. Lee, the bank president, said the receipts that the Nowata Wal-Mart left each day at his bank were as strong before the closing as they were 5 and 10 years ago.
The store's sales tax payments showed no erosion either. Tax authorities' reports of payments by department stores in Nowata -- there was only one -- averaged about $ 12,000 a month. Based on the city tax of 3 percent, the store's monthly sales would have been $ 400,000. That's a respectable $ 103 a month, or $ 1,236 a year, for each Nowata resident.
Instead, the closings have more to do with Wal-Mart's strategy. In the company's growth plans, there was no longer a role for stores built in the early 1980's in four small cities in north-central Oklahoma -- Nowata, Pawhuska, 55 miles to its west, Bixby and Jenks.
In the centers of regions spotted with Nowatas, the company now builds multiacre supercenters with much wider selections of goods, along with services like tire changes and tax preparation. Typically, the supercenters must draw on consumers throughout a region, and they can't have the hinterland stores holding them back. Nowata and Pawhuska lie to the east and west of a new supercenter in Bartlesville, while Jenks and Bixby are near giant Wal-Marts in Tulsa.
Still, after deserting a town, Wal-Mart can return -- in a way. When it can't find new tenants for the old stores' carcasses, it installs a Bud's Warehouse Outlet. It put one in the Nowata store three months after the closing, and another in Bixby after it closed the store there. But a Bud's, short on brands and variety, just helps pay the rent. It threatens a supercenter no more than a Salvation Army thrift shop does.
Don E. Shinkle, Wal-Mart's vice president for corporate affairs, said, "We regret very much" Nowata's anger. But while the Nowata townspeople feel abandoned, Mr. Shinkle insists that isn't the case. And, he added, "Wal-Mart is doing as much as it can to regain their confidence."
The conflicting perceptions are tangled in the semantic distinctions the company makes about "closings" and "consolidations." In a barbed reference to Kmart, which in September announced its plan to eliminate 110 stores, Mr. Shinkle said, "Closings are what our chief competitor is doing at the moment and is likely to be doing more of."
By Wal-Mart's reckoning, the company has closed only 8 or 10 stores since it opened its first one 33 years ago. But that, Mr. Shinkle said, does not include the stores in Nowata, Pawhuska, Bixby and Jenks.
"Those were consolidations," Mr. Shinkle said. He said the supercenters, with the jobs they offer and the wider selection of goods generating more sales and taxes, help everyone more than the smaller stores. "This is just a win-win-win situation for everybody," he said.
If so, few folks in Nowata talk like winners. The 80-year-old Mr. Richardson, the former mayor and car dealer, said he, his family and friends are resigned to shopping in Bartlesville. But there, he said, they have plenty of choices -- a Kmart, a Dillard's, a Sears, a J. C. Penney, a Montgomery Ward. "We won't set foot in that supercenter," he said.
These sympathies are not unique to Nowata. "They're just businessmen making money," said Sue Ann Ryan, director of the Bixby Chamber of Commerce. After Bixby lost its store five years ago, Micky Webb, the City Manager, chopped 19 people from a payroll of 71, and he said the budget is only now returning to the 1990 level. "Culturally it really hurts," Ms. Ryan said. "Economically it really hurts. We're at their mercy. We were dependent on them."
 
Store Opened in 1982
 The late Sam Walton, Wal-Mart Stores' aw-shucks founder in a baseball cap, opened his outpost here in 1982, just as sinking world oil prices were knocking the profit out of wells in aged oil fields around Nowata.
Hurt by both the oil collapse and the arrival of Wal-Mart, about half the local shopkeepers closed as their customers flocked to the new store for its low prices and rich selection of soap and hubcaps, frocks and socks. The Wal-Mart became Nowata's economic and cultural hub. Earl Duvall, the blue-smocked greeter, welcomed shoppers into the store, and if you waited a bit on the benches in the vestibule, you saw everyone in town.
By the end of January, the company reported that it owned 2,133 Wal-Marts, 143 much larger, fast-spreading supercenters, 438 Sam's Clubs, where businesses and consumers, too, pay a $ 25 annual membership fee to shop for wholesale goods, and 75 deepest-discount Bud's. And last week, Wal-Mart reported yet another good year. Sales grew 23 percent for the year ended Jan. 21, to $ 82.5 billion, and earnings grew 15 percent, to $ 2.7 billion.
But in the face of slipping profit margins and reawakened competition from chains like Kmart, Sears, Target and others, Wal-Mart is relying more and more on its immense supercenters for growth. They offer food and services as well as merchandise, letting Wal-Mart reach for bigger bites of the consumer dollar. With the supercenters, the company also seeks ever more efficiency, by reducing the costs of servicing smaller stores and by amassing even greater purchasing power to help it cajole rock-bottom prices from suppliers.
The strategy all comes together at the supercenter in Bartlesville, the successor of a smaller Wal-Mart there. Shoppers come upon a festive, one-store mall under a single endless roof, an heir to old downtowns. There's a 14-aisle supermarket, an automobile service shop, a pharmacy, a McDonald's, a one-hour photo lab, a shoe repair shop, a dry cleaner, a beauty parlor, a tax preparer, a video rental shop and a branch of the Bank of Oklahoma.
In an apparent departure from Wal-Mart's old emphasis on American goods, this is a United Nations of merchandise. There are men's Gitano sport shirts made in Bangladesh, Western Frontier cowboy shirts from Qatar, $ 7 Gitano suede skirts from China, as well as Wrangler jeans from the United States. The cornucopia of merchandise ranges from a wall of aquariums of tropical fish to a well-stocked section of 12 models of Apple, Compaq, I.B.M. and Packard Bell computers.
To draw customers, though, Wal-Mart cannot compete with itself. So last March, it closed the Nowata and Pawhuska stores, just after erecting signs out front promising to stay put. The one in Nowata announced, "The rumors are false: Wal-Mart will be here always," said Ken Murnan, the newspaper publisher. Mr. Shinkle said the decision to put up the signs "was based on market research at the time, and the later decision" to vacate the stores "was based on market research later."
Both buildings have reopened. Last May, an Aldo store, part of a small discount chain based in Abilene, Kan., took over the Pawhuska space, and a Bud's -- the division is named for Mr. Walton's brother James -- moved into Nowata's. They employ about half as many people as the Wal-Marts.
Bud's, in particular, is a depot of merchandising's mistakes -- production-damaged, refurbished and discontinued goods. Red and yellow signs inside cry, "Close outs. Over runs. Name brands at the lowest prices!" Many brands, however, are not the stuff of instant recognition.
There are Good Sense toothpaste, shampoo, plastic trash bags and over-the-counter drugs, AmeriCo T-shirts from Pakistan, and Fruit of the Loom's Bloopers! line of irregular socks and underwear. Bud's advertises computers. But in contrast to the supercenter, it was offering only one model last month, an aged Grid laptop, and a sales clerk said only one was in stock.
On Presidents' Day last month, the store was doing so little business that only one checkout clerk was working, and the parking lot, once regularly packed with about 100 cars, never had more than 20. Low-budget Bud's doesn't use greeters, so Mr. Duvall, 74, is unemployed. These days, he said, he comes in only for food for his 12 cats. "Bud's," he said, "ain't got nothing. Wal-Mart had everything."
It is hard to find anyone leaving the store who disagrees. Kay McKee, 36, climbs back into her van with her son Michael, 16, and her daughter, Sarah, 16 months. "I came here for a picture frame and shoes for her," Mrs. McKee said. "I wanted a 20-by-17 frame. But the frames only went to 11-by-14. Shoes, they had just boys'. No little girls'. It makes me angry. Move all the little stores out, then leave. We're stuck."
Yet in downtown Nowata, spirits are rising a bit. A large Bill's Dollar Store is opening later this month on the premises of a department store that closed after Wal-Mart came to town. A fabric shop has opened, replacing one that closed then.
Surviving merchants see business recovering with consumers who won't make the 30-mile trek to Bartlesville and are turned off by Bud's. The two Cherokee Avenue pharmacies of Wayne Clark and Bruce Campbell survived, they say, because the Nowata Wal-Mart, unlike many, did not have a pharmacy. Still, Mr. Clark said, "they took my total personal-care business -- blow driers, curling irons, make-up mirrors." Yet, he added, "I'm a better merchant because of them."
Richard Clark (no relation to Wayne) owns Clark's Sentry Hardware, opened by his father in 1938 and, at 7,000 square feet, one of the town's biggest stores. Mr. Clark had two employees when Wal-Mart arrived, and now he has none. He survived, he said, because Wal-Mart could not match his personal service or his grasp of residents' needs.
Clark's stocks 5- and 10-gallon crocks for pickling, four types of mouse poison, two sizes of spittoons and a wide range of bolts. "I carry a lot of merchandise that is higher-priced than theirs," Mr. Clark said. "But I do a lot of special ordering that they don't."
For the first time in years, he said, he's looking for a helper.
 
Patching Things Up
 Something -- perhaps the prospect of reawakened competition from local merchants or discomfort with the anger in town -- may be stirring Wal-Mart to try to patch things up. Mr. Murnan said Rick Dinkle, the Bud's manager, called early last month to ask him to put together a small group of citizens to discuss complaints with Wal-Mart.
So on Feb. 15, Mr. Murnan took over the chamber's conference room and brought in a handful of community leaders. Mr. Dinkle declined to be interviewed, but according to people at the meeting, he made an unexpected observation.
"He stated, in so many words, that Wal-Mart had come to the realization that they made a mistake in closing some of the stores in small towns," Mr. Murnan recalled. "He said they knew Bud's did not fill the void." Mr. Dinkle asked what people needed. For starters, school supplies and panty hose, he was told.
What the meeting means for Wal-Mart and the merchants in town no one yet knows. But Mr. Murnan doubts that all the mistakes were Wal-Mart's. "I could argue that Wal-Mart came in and raped the community," he said. "By the same token, I could argue that we did this to ourselves. We didn't change with the times. Wal-Mart is business at its finest or its worst, however you want to look at it."

HEADLINE: THE NATION: A Leg Up;
My Equal Opportunity, Your Free Lunch

BYLINE: By DAVID K. SHIPLER; David K. Shipler, a former New York Times reporter, is writing a book about race in America.

 BODY:
TORMENTED by their white classmates, Hispanic students at a leading law school needed reassurance. They were being told that they didn't deserve to be there because they had scored lower than whites on the Law School Admission Test. And they wanted this smear refuted.
 "I tried to be very candid with them," the law school's dean later recalled. It was true, he told them: their scores on the L.S.A.T., the standard benchmark for admission, were somewhat lower. But if they worked extremely hard, he said, they could make up for "differences in past credentials." 
 An awful silence descended. "I just looked into their eyes as I was talking," the dean remembers, "and I thought, 'I can't bear this; it's too painful.' Their hopes and expectations about what would be said were defeated. There was just a feeling of betrayal."
 The incident illustrates the discomfort and denial affirmative action arouses in a society that champions the boundless potential of individual merit. Neither benefactors nor beneficiaries like to reveal the compromises that sometimes are made to bring more minorities into universities and workplaces. But the defenders had better start talking plainly if they want to save the system, in one form or another, from the gathering storm of outrage that is about to be harnessed by conservative Republicans.
 Some rough political choices lie ahead. Should affirmative action be retained? Should preference be given to people on the basis of income rather than race? Should the system be -- and can it be -- scrapped altogether?

 
 
How It All Began
 Three decades ago, the phrase affirmative action was coined as a catch-all for racial preference programs and goals -- but not rigid quotas, which courts rarely permit. The efforts have produced a legacy of tangible successes and poisonous resentments, a revolution in recruiting and hiring alongside the deepening decay of poverty.
 Affirmative action has never sat well with most white Americans. Last year, only 16 percent endorsed preferences for blacks in hiring and promotion, according to a survey by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. To the majority, affirmative action has gone too far for too long. It is ideologically repulsive, because it vitiates the myth that this country's bounty is open to anyone who has brains and works hard. How much more satisfying it would be to decide that remedial measures are no longer needed.
 That appeal has already emerged as the Republicans' approach during the build-up to the 1996 elections. What looms is likely to be a coarse campaign of sloganeering that could heighten tensions along the lines of class and race. Its outcome will shape a vital dimension of the country's future by maintaining, revising or eventually eliminating institutional preferences for minorities and women.
 Since affirmative action programs are supposed to be temporary remedies, the question is how much longer the country will have to take this unpleasant medicine. To anyone who wants to see women and minorities participate fully in this society, the answer seems to be that more patience is required.
 Habits of interaction between sexes and races die with difficulty. Patterns of discrimination and economic disadvantage can leave deep and lasting scars on a person's "credentials." These sometimes fade after a generation, and often they do not; it is still too early to see how well the children of those who were first helped less than a generation ago will do in adulthood.
 That is why the most perceptive companies and colleges look past test scores for qualities missed by conventional measurements -- a fact they often fudge to avoid labeling ethnic or racial groups in a way that would undermine self-esteem and reinforce the majority's resentments.
 They have a point. But self-doubts among minorities, and prejudices against them, did not begin with affirmative action. Nor are they abated by euphemism and evasion.

 
 
Making Allowances
 Every statistic that is ferreted out can be turned into a weapon. Universities, well aware of this, do not publicize their students' test scores by race. But some admissions officers acknowledge that they make allowances for lower scores among blacks and Hispanic students and, at some colleges, for low-income whites.
 "It would be naive to have a single standard to apply to all groups if, on a national level, you know that the test operates differently," said Karl M. Furstenberg, Dean of Admissions at Dartmouth. "We make decisions on individuals, not on groups. But we know about these national patterns, so when you read individual applications you recalibrate the criteria."
 The rationale of affirmative action lies in the recognition that even if discrimination is eliminated, the handicaps of poor schooling and impoverished family life remain severe obstacles; color-blindness in choosing applicants is not enough. So, in the words of one Federal regulation, the institution "must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination." This means seeking the best candidates from excluded groups even if their qualifications on paper don't always match those of white men.
 White males have long benefited from unstated preferences as fraternity brothers, golfing buddies, children of alumni and the like -- unconscious biases that go largely unrecognized until affirmative action forces recruiters to think about how they gravitate to people like themselves. Changing or eliminating those preferences breeds backlash. Polls show most Americans believe less qualified blacks get hired or promoted over whites, though few seem to know whites who are victims of reverse discrimination.
 "Blacks are such a small fraction of the population that the lost opportunities to white men are really minuscule," said Barbara R. Bergmann, an economics professor at the American University in Washington.
 One strategy that may gain ground would shift affirmative action to target class, or, more precisely, income.
 The most critical gateway at which racial preferences can make a difference may be entry to college, where many blacks realize middle-class aspirations. Even while most low-income blacks have been left untouched by affirmative action, the small percentage who are attractive to good colleges are wooed and financed, and later sought by graduate schools and corporations.
 For years, such elite colleges as Dartmouth, Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have mixed race and class to give low-income white youngsters admission preferences similar to those for minorities. But with Federal scholarships cut, some other schools are taking the opposite tack, satisfying affirmative-action goals with middle-class blacks and selecting other students who can pay. Fewer than 10 percent of last fall's college freshmen came from families with incomes under $ 20,000.
 If income replaced race entirely as a qualifier for preferences, whites would be the major beneficiaries, and racial integration would probably decline.
 Of the 14.6 million poor Americans under the age of 18, fully 61 percent are white. And since whites tend to outscore blacks and Hispanic students on the standard admissions test even where their family incomes are the same, many middle-class black and Hispanic students would continue to need preferential treatment to make up the gap.
 Within each racial and ethnic group, average Scholastic Aptitude Test scores increase as income rises, from a mean total of 766 out of 1,600 for those from families earning under $ 10,000 a year, to a score of 1000 in the bracket over $ 70,000. Consequently, economic disadvantage becomes a factor in assessing scores. If two applicants have the same grades and scores, but one is wealthy and the other poor, "I would argue that they're not performing equally," said Mr. Furstenberg, the Dartmouth dean. The low-income student's scores may "represent a greater achievement,"he said.
 Marlyn McGrath Lewis, director of admissions for Harvard and Radcliffe, said: "We have particular interest in students from a modest background. Coupled with high achievement and a high ambition level and energy, a background that's modest can really be a help. We know that's the best investment we can make: a kid who's hungry."
 Although College Board achievement and S.A.T. scores are good predictors of freshman grades, she said, they become less reliable later. Furthermore, a study of three classes of Harvard alumni over three decades found a high correlation between "success" -- defined by income, community involvement and professional satisfaction -- and two criteria that might not ordinarily be associated with Harvard freshmen: low S.A.T. scores and a blue-collar background.

 
 
Doing Without
 Without affirmative action, many institutions would resegregate. A Federal judge in Texas ruled as much last August in upholding the University of Texas Law School's program. The mean L.S.A.T. score of all 500 students entering the school in 1992 was 162 (on a scale from 120 to 200), putting them at the 89th percentile; the mean for blacks was 158, at the 78th percentile.
 The law school argued that if only grades and test scores had been considered, the class would have had only 9 blacks instead of 41, and 18 Mexican-Americans instead of 55, which Judge Sam Sparks ruled would have been tokenism.
 "Until society sufficiently overcomes the effects of pervasive racism," he wrote, "affirmative action is necessary."
 The four rejected white applicants who brought the suit have appealed.
 The structure of affirmative action has been built by decisions of all three branches of government. Therefore, not all preferences for minorities and women are susceptible to change by Presidential order or even by Congress. They are supported not only by intricate Federal laws and regulations, but also by court interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause and by institutional self-interest that has gone beyond original legal mandates.
 In some quarters, affirmative action has been driven by pragmatism. Without a draft, for example, the military wants to tap the full reservoir of a work force in which the percentage of whites is declining. Colleges often want diverse student bodies not only to forestall discrimination lawsuits but also to enrich the educational experience.
 "The curriculum has been forced to respond in a way that's more truthful and inclusive," said Mary M. Childers, Dartmouth's Director of Affirmative Action. "The social life of students is richer and more heterogeneous and conflict-ridden in a way that prepares them for the actual world out there."
 The gap between mean S.A.T. scores for blacks and whites is narrowing, but it is still large. Last year, the mean totaled 938 for whites and 740 for blacks. This reinforces the determination of many admissions officers to avoid reducing people to test score results.
 "Intellectual talent and other forms of human talent exist in all segments of the population," said Mr. Furstenberg of Dartmouth. "What we're trying to do is find the greatest talent."
 Designing that search is also the nation's task.
 The paragraph that began at the bottom of the next column should have read: "The law school argued that if only grades and test scores had been considered, the class would have had only 9 blacks instead of 41, and 18 Mexican-Americans instead of 55, which Judge Sam Sparks ruled would have been tokenism."

 The article also referred incorrectly to the standardized test given college-bound students. It is now called the Scholastic Assessment Test, not the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
 The article also misstated the range of scores on a standardized test for law school applicants. It is 120 to 180, not 120 to 200.

HEADLINE: COMPLEX COWBOY;
Bruce Nauman

BYLINE: By Andrew Solomon; Andrew Solomon is a contributing writer for the Magazine and author of the novel "A Stone Boat."

 BODY:
ATTEMPTS TO SUM UP THE work of Bruce Nauman don't work. Most artists of the late 20th century have "signature styles," repeating formal devices that make their art instantly recognizable. The guy who does paintings of comic strips. The guy who puts cinder blocks on the floor. Nauman is the guy who makes you feel incredibly upset and existentially nervous, but he can accomplish that end with a neon sign, animal casts, a video of himself, a shadow puppet, a chair hanging from the ceiling, or a constructed triangular room lighted in a hideous shade of yellow. You can recognize a Nauman by the way it makes you want to go home. "They're night thoughts, the things that keep you awake and panicked at 3 A.M. with the gritty clarity of the irresolvable," says Robert Storr, a curator in the department of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, where a retrospective of Nauman's work opens today (to remain on view through May 23). It is Nauman's first American retrospective in 20 years, covering nearly 30 years' worth of art.
In Nauman's own words, his work is "like getting hit in the face with a baseball bat. Or better, like getting hit in the back of the neck. You never see it coming; it just knocks you down." Looking at a Nauman retrospective is like walking through someone else's psychoanalysis: it's full of patterns and recurring wishes, anxieties and obsessions; it's sometimes rather comical and often quite hostile; it keeps turning out to be about something other than what's apparently being said. Like someone else's psychoanalysis, Nauman's work is often boring and repetitive. Some of it doesn't make much sense and some of it is so highly personal as to exclude the viewer. It constantly circles its most unresolved issues. "When I was at art school," he explains, "everyone else would make art and find the best parts and then try to cover up everything else so that was all you saw. I would always become fascinated by the part that didn't appear to be working and I'd keep working on that part until it took over and became the whole piece of art."
Nauman's reach is enormous: "He may be the most influential American artist around," Michael Kimmelman wrote in this newspaper last year. Matthew Barney, Kiki Smith, Jenny Holzer, Mike Kelley, Robert Gober, Tony Oursler: none of these catch-names in contemporary art could have arrived without Nauman, but their reinterpretations do not diminish the original. "He was a powerful example for the rest of us, and introduced a possibility into consciousness that has entered the general domain," says Smith. "His chairs hanging in triangles made me crazy -- there was so much strange resonance in them, I couldn't understand how they were made. His 'corridor' pieces, when I first saw them, stretched my vision of what constituted art." While the minimalists and others of Nauman's generation have tended to repeat themselves, he has pressed on relentlessly into his own future, his art never indulging itself in its own success.
I had seen Nauman's work for years and had never wanted to meet him. I had thought he was probably sadistic and controlling and brilliant and unforgiving and
 
cold. When I once asked someone what Bruce Nauman was like, he said, "Oh, he's a cowboy," and I took this as metaphor, imagining Nauman as gruff and outside civilized rules. But it wasn't a metaphor. Bruce Nauman lives on a 600-acre ranch near Galisteo, N.M., and he raises and breaks horses and uses them to herd cattle. His manners are impeccable and he is gentle and serious and kind, a bit shy, very decent. When I had first telephoned, the textual part of his work was playing in my mind, so I half-expected him to say, "PEOPLE DIE OF EXPOSURE" or "I CAN SUCK YOU DRY" or "SPIT AND DIE/SPIT AND LIVE." But in fact he gave me rather straightforward directions and suggested a restaurant in Santa Fe where we could have dinner. Nauman can explain his work quite lucidly, but he comes much more to life for cowboy talk, especially about Ray Hunt, the trainer who taught him to break horses. "Ray makes you let go of your ego," Nauman says, explaining what it's like to watch a real master. He claims that he is just an amateur, that a real master like Hunt does in five minutes what takes Nauman years of experimentation.
I had seen the Nauman retrospective a week earlier at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. Matisse once said he intended his paintings to give pleasure to tired businessmen, and Nauman's work does just the opposite -- it gives acute anxiety and discomfort to those relaxed art lovers who enter museums especially to see it. Even if you understand nothing else about Nauman, the sheer intensity of his work penetrates your defenses. He's feeling something and he's feeling it very strongly and you'd just better watch out. Nauman explains that he is not interested in the gradual, repetitive process of much modern art: "I try to go immediately to the last step. The variations get worked through in a single work."
It is critically dubious but pragmatically convenient to group Nauman's work by media. Some early casts are quite humorous: the wax mouth and a bit of neck and arm and hand called "From Hand to Mouth" and which literalizes the cliche, and the solid concrete block called "A Cast of the Space Under My Chair." There are many videos: My favorite is "Art Make-Up," in which Nauman slowly covers himself with white, then pink, then green, then black makeup, until by the end he looks like a negative image. The earliest neon is "The True Artist Helps the World by Revealing Mystic Truths," from 1967 -- half ironic, half authentic, made to go in the window of Nauman's storefront studio in San Francisco, where a neon beer sign had previously hung. Later, Nauman would do the famous "One Hundred Live and Die" -- "LIVE AND DIE/LIVE AND LIVE/DIE AND DIE/DIE AND LIVE -- the hundred sentences flashing on and off like a depraved marquee.
Other pieces are mostly aural. In one small empty white room, a paranoiac voice crescendos, "Get out of my mind, get out of this room, get out of my mind, get out of this room" (if you stand in the middle of the room, the voice seems to come from inside your head). Nauman once designed a series of underground tunnels that were never intended to be built, but for which he did make enormous gangly models. There is also a series of "corridor pieces." In the one included in this retrospective, from 1970, you walk down a very narrow and oppressive hallway; video monitors show you what is going on in another piece of the installation, and you know that you are being observed by surveillance cameras, but it's hard to figure out where people are seeing you or where the people are whom you're seeing. The experience induces severe panic. Nauman's mobiles are about torture: the hanging steel constructions, welded triangles with empty chairs hanging inside, were inspired by the politics of South America, and the pathos of the chair, the rigidity of the steel, how it isolates and imprisons -- it'll scare you to death. More recent mobilelike work includes "Carousel," in which casts of taxidermists' models hang like butchers' carcasses from a revolving frame, scraping the ground.
The later video installations are alarmingly complicated. In "Clown Torture," videotapes are projected on the walls and playing on monitors, some of which are sideways or upside down. There are five different tapes, among them a clown trying to defecate in a public lavatory, a clown endlessly repeating a cyclical joke and a clown shrieking, "No, no, no, no!" to an invisible torturer; all the clowns are at once terrified and terrifying. In "Learned Helplessness in Rats (Rock and Roll Drummer)" -- the title comes from a Scientific American article -- a yellow Plexiglas maze sits in the middle of the room; the video alternates between scenes of rats struggling through the maze and footage of a drummer playing loudly and furiously and badly. In the video "Shadow Puppets and Instructed Mime," an androgynous-looking mime struggles to follow harsh and humiliating instructions from an invisible commander. In the more recent installations, video monitors sit on packing boxes, as though this maze of impossible technology had just been set up, on the spot.
The noise at the Nauman retrospective is horrendous. You have the buzzing of neon tubes; the spoken part of video pieces; grating voices saying: "I am a good boy. You are a good boy. We are good boys" or "Get out of this room"; the rock drummer, the horrible shrieking grating sound of the metal animals of the carousel dragging along the floor (it's far worse than squeaking chalk on a blackboard). There's a video piece in which Nauman plays tunelessly a violin tuned to the notes D, E, A and D. Lights are flashing on and off all over the place. It's a fun house pushed way past fun. "I don't like it here," a little girl was wailing to her mother when I went through, and when she started crying, you hardly noticed an increase in the noisy disagreeable emotion in the room.
If you haven't encountered the work, it's hard to extrapolate from what's described here the extent of the queasiness it engenders. "Nauman's dread seems to float, suspended, above any particular anxiety," Adam Gopnik wrote in The New Yorker. Peter Schjeldahl, Nauman's longest-term champion, has written in Art in America, "In this art there is abundant communication but no communion. . . . The question of 'liking' Nauman or not seems impertinent. Confronted with his work, the rational mind is extraordinarily clarified, and emotional responsiveness, stricken, falls in a hole." At the Hirshhorn exhibition, I felt like I was being split open by the relentless, repetitive drive of a jackhammer. But the work is not entirely negative, either in its content or its impact. As Nauman points out: "I wouldn't work if I were a pessimist. You don't work if you don't have hope."
 
N AUMAN WAS BORN IN Fort Wayne, Ind., in 1941, but his father's work as an engineer for General Electric meant that the family moved regularly. Nauman went to the University of Wisconsin, where he began by studying science and mathematics. After he changed his major to art, he headed off to the University of California at Davis where he studied with Robert Arneson and William T. Wiley. Classmates from Davis recall that Nauman's artistic intensity was striking even then; a young Nicholas Wilder, already an influential Los Angeles dealer, came by the school one hot day in 1966, took one look at Nauman's work, and said, "I really need a Dr Pepper." Between sips, he offered Nauman a show.
For a while, Nauman was in the funk circle of art -- a world of ironic, playful West Coast artists. In 1968, he was taken on by the dealer Konrad Fischer, who elevated Nauman to the upper echelon of contemporary art (Fischer still represents Nauman in Europe). That same year, he began his long relationship to Leo Castelli, and in 1972 had a retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which traveled to, among other places, the Whitney in New York. Still, Nauman has always enjoyed greater popularity abroad than at home; in Europe, he is almost as well-known as Warhol, and Jan Hoet asked him to be the centerpiece of the last Documenta, an honor that he politely declined. (He also declined, also politely, to participate in this year's Whitney Biennial, which opens next month.)
Nauman has never lived in New York. Since 1979, he has been in New Mexico, self-consciously distant from an art world whose complex social dynamics do not suit his severe view of himself. He has none of the performative, worldly, self-promoting charm of an Eric Fischl or Jeff Koons. Time alone in his studio is what he wants and gets. His work is sold to museums, or to such big collectors of conceptual work as Ydeffa Hendeles, Susan and Lewis Manilow and Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo.
He manages to tell you a great deal without giving up his air of privacy ("Self-exposure does not make good art," he remarks). His strongest influences are Man Ray, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Alain Robbe-Grillet and Samuel Beckett. The structure of the work, he says, comes very directly from Wittgenstein: "I pursue an argument to the point where I give up on it." In mathematics, he explains, "you lay out a proposition and then attempt to prove it. My work uses that structure, but from Wittgenstein I learned that it is also valuable to look at the process of examining something that doesn't lead to a proof or even a real conclusion." Much of his work looks Duchampian, but most of the Duchamp influence came through Jasper Johns; Nauman's work has an unforgiving Americanness to it, a stripped-back, deliberate quality that owes as much to the puritan work ethic as to the game-playing of French Dada. "You have to mistrust your own skills," Nauman says, "and avoid whatever is too easy." Much has been made by critics of the visible casting marks on his animal sculptures and the indifferent picture quality of his videos (Nauman is an excellent draftsman and does beautiful, detailed drawings; it's a shame that none of these are in the exhibition). "As soon as the idea or meaning is clear, you can stop," he says. The rough finishes are economy, not slovenliness.
 
N AUMAN'S STUDIO, AN enormous shed that lies between the house and the animal pens, is very, very cluttered. There are old pieces of furniture, chunks of steel, some casts of animals, a lot of books, a cup half-full of tea, some scraps of paper with sketches on them. There's a typescript tacked to the wall, which Nauman says is for his next installation. The title is "World Peace." It begins: "I'll talk to you/You'll listen to me/ You'll talk to me/I'll listen to you/ I'll talk to them/They'll listen to me," and goes on through countless variations. "It sounds so convivial," I say, and Nauman explains that he will have two actors working on it. If each actor reads two lines, then it's a friendly dialogue. If each actor reads one line, then it's a hostile confrontation. Nauman hasn't decided yet quite how he'll do it; he's got the actors coming tomorrow. "World Peace" may end up being an ironic title, or it may end up being entirely in earnest. Or -- more likely -- both.
Nauman is now married to the figurative painter Susan Rothenberg, whom he met at a dinner party in New York in 1988. After two years of commuting, she gave up the New York scene, which she had never particularly relished, and moved out to Nauman's ranch. Nauman does everything but paint, and she does virtually nothing but paint, so they suit each other perfectly. If you're interviewing him, she keeps her distance from the professional conversation, although she occasionally wanders in to say something smart and funny or to show you the arrowheads she found when she was out walking the dogs. They seem very much in love with each other in a quiet way. There is nothing self-conscious in their house; the only art on the walls was made by a neighbor friend, and shows the local landscape with an endearing lack of formal skill. There are a lot of dogs and a cat in addition to the horses and cows and the two Tibetan yaks Rothenberg bought last year; the delineation between outside and inside is vague.
Rothenberg and Nauman make dinner together and it is really good, and when I mention the long drive back to my hotel, Rothenberg tells me just to stay over, and I do. I am in the late stages of a particularly disgusting flu, and they are very nice about it. Lots of tea, lots and lots of alcohol, lots of warm blankets on the bed. If you have questions, they get answered. If you don't have questions, silence is no problem. We can talk about Wittgenstein or about the pueblo village that used to be on the ranch site or about what we're eating -- it's all fine.
Late at night, drinks in our hands, we watch videotapes of Ray Hunt, the master, breaking horses. Rothenberg goes to bed, but Nauman and I watch on, exchanging occasional comments, and then he turns off the sound and narrates. "See how he's doing that?" Nauman asks. "He's going back to that rough spot. In order for that mare to get better, she has to get more confused and afraid first. Watch, you'll see, she's getting used to him. See how he's approaching her now? He couldn't have done that a minute ago. There she goes. He's letting her figure it out. She's O.K. now." Later he explains, "If you have a horse who's afraid of having someone come up to her near flank, you can't just avoid it. You can't have her buck when you're out and something comes up to her near flank. That's what breaking horses is. You don't beat them up, but you can't be too soft. You establish that you're in control and then you're gentle and firm and you keep going back to that near flank over and over again until she gets used to it and she's not afraid any more. When you ask for something from a horse, you have to do it in a way so that she understands you. That's how you break a horse."
There's a master at MOMA this month -- maybe not yet Ray Hunt, but close. He figures out which are his viewers' vulnerable spots, where they are frightened or anxious. And then he goes and he vexes those spots. It seems sadistic, how he won't leave them alone, how he won't give up on whatever it is that people want to shy away from. He's not exactly brutal because he's not that direct, but he does keep poking you where you're weakest. At the beginning, he's gentle, but if that doesn't work, he can be rougher. Then he'll be gentle again for a minute. It's all instinct. "Understanding takes the power away from terrible things," says Nauman. An early print reads, "PLEASE/PAY/ATTENTION/ PLEASE." Nauman is always paying attention and he demands that his audience pay attention all the time as well. You can't get away with anything here.
My last morning in Galisteo, the weather is postcard-perfect. Nauman saddles up a couple of horses and we head across the ranch. I am on Janie, Rothenberg's favorite, whom Nauman broke a few years ago. The horses have hackamores hung loosely around their heads so there are no real reins to pull on, and my leg pressure is slight, but Janie somehow knows exactly what I want and she does it. By one set of standards it is abject; by another it is a divine sympathy or empathy. That verb, after all, is "break." Nauman's work is unpleasant and mortifying and upsetting, but when you give in to it and let him be the one in charge, then you'll be able to do things in the world that you couldn't do before. You'll be more useful, worth more, maybe better off, once he's broken you.

TOMORROW IS ANOTHER COUNTRY
The Inside Story of South Africa's Road to Change.
By Allister Sparks.
254 pp. New York:
Hill & Wang. $22. 
WHEN Nelson Mandela was sworn in as President of South Africa last May, with F. W. de Klerk as a Deputy President, it seemed like one of those biblical moments when the heavens open and God smiles. Former prisoner and former jailer stood together; a bloody civil war, as deeply rooted and intractable as any on earth, was over. Did this really happen? It is still hard to believe.
With "Tomorrow Is Another Country," the journalist Allister Sparks has written a gripping, fast-paced, authoritative account of the long and mostly secret negotiations that brought South Africa's bitter conflict to its near-miraculous end. Like John Reed's classic "Ten Days That Shook the World," Mr. Sparks's book is the work of a fine reporter who was in the right place at the right time. There are differences, however: in South Africa's case, the places were many, for its political sea change took not 10 days but some eight years. And the outcome, one hopes, will be far happier than that of the events in Petrograd in 1917. So far the signs are good.
For the first five years of secret talks, South African Government officials were desperately afraid to be seen negotiating with the African National Congress, which they had publicly demonized for so long. The expanding circle of clandestine talks took place everywhere from the hospital room where a Cabinet minister first responded to Mr. Mandela's invitation for a meeting in 1985, to a basement garage, to a game-park lodge to the Palace Hotel in Lucerne, Switzerland. Mr. Sparks had coaxed everyone into giving him the details, both political and human. Leaders of the paramilitary white right, for example, say they got along much better with A.N.C. negotiators than they did with Mr. de Klerk's ministers, whom they considered traitors to the Afrikaner cause.
Like watching Mr. Mandela's inauguration last spring, Mr. Sparks's description of these talks sometimes brings a lump to one's throat. He shows how the participants' deep mutual suspicion was gradually replaced by excitement at the prospect of making a momentous agreement -- and also by the dawning realization that the people on the other side were human beings, perhaps even decent human beings. An unexpected rapport, born on a fishing trip, between the black labor leader Cyril Ramaphosa and the white Cabinet member Roelf Meyer saved the day on several occasions.
The editor of South Africa's crusading Rand Daily Mail before it was shut down by its corporate owners some years ago, Mr. Sparks has reported from South Africa for American and European newspapers and written an eloquent history, "The Mind of South Africa." But even this knowledgeable observer half-confesses himself unable to penetrate the heart of one of his central characters, F. W. de Klerk. For negotiating himself out of power, Mr. de Klerk deservedly shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mr. Mandela in 1993. Yet, as the evidence in Mr. Sparks's book shows, he is also a man of great duplicity. His Government, for example, secretly trained, armed and financed the deadly militia of Chief Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi's conservative Zulu Inkatha movement. Inkatha was slaughtering thousands of A.N.C. supporters at the same time that Mr. de Klerk was winning the world's praise for talking with A.N.C. leaders. When news of the under-the-table financing leaked out, it almost derailed the negotiations.
Furthermore, in late 1989, a mere few months before Mr. de Klerk startled his country by releasing Mr. Mandela from jail and un-banning the A.N.C., he won an all-white election by making vague promises that nothing would change. His campaign even smeared the officials of a rival white party as traitors for meeting with A.N.C. leaders abroad -- at a time when Mr. de Klerk's own people were furtively doing the same thing. Ironically, if Mr. de Klerk had been remotely honest about his plans during the campaign, fearful white voters would have rejected him, and South Africa would still be locked in a stalemate. We will never know everything that went on inside the mind of this shrewd and complex man.
Mr. Sparks is sometimes too generous, voicing none of the skepticism he must feel about what people tell him. Today everybody in South Africa is eager to prove that he or she was a behind-the-scenes enemy of apartheid all along. But can we really believe that Neil Barnard, the National Intelligence Service chief, was "troubled by the ethics" of clandestinely tape-recording a meeting with Mr. Mandela? Come on now: for years South Africa's spy agencies sent letter bombs, booby-trapped cars and murdered people by the hundreds; bugging was the least of it. And can we really believe the head of the Broederbond, a powerful Afrikaner secret society, when he maintains that "by early 1986 a majority of the brotherhood's 20,000 members voted to accept the principle of full citizenship rights for blacks"? In 1986 the Broederbond included almost all of the top officials running South Africa's most brutal reign of state terror in modern times -- a regime of torture and death squads that did not begin to soften until four years later.
ANOTHER flaw is one Mr. Sparks shares with most journalists who reported on South Africa's historic negotiations. They rarely mention that the final agreement was as much economic as it was political. Basically the Grand Bargain in South Africa was: blacks get the vote, whites keep the money. Whites in South Africa, now some 13 percent of the population, own roughly 85 percent of the country's land and, along with foreign investors, at least 90 percent of commerce and industry.
Freezing this great gap was the price of having democratic elections. This yawning difference in wealth is partly locked in place by the property rights clauses of the country's interim Constitution, which will make even the most modest land reform painfully difficult. And partly it is locked in place by pressures outside the agreement, which make any other bargain impossible. Any real redistribution of wealth would mean economically catastrophic white flight and a cold shoulder from aid donors like the United States, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the foreign investors Mr. Mandela is wooing. South Africa will be struggling to reduce these vast economic disparities for many decades to come. But today all those grappling with such problems can vote, can speak, write and organize freely, and are fully equal before the law. In a world filled with bad news, that is still cause for celebration.
 
 
 
A Verwoerd in the A.M.C.
 "Viva Verwoerd!" Of all the ironies one encounters in the changing value system of the new South Africa, none is more startling than that chant of praise at an A.N.C. rally for a name which more than any other is identified with apartheid. Hendrik Verwoerd, Prime Minister from 1958 until he was struck down by an assassin's hand in 1966, was both chief architect and the most ruthless implementer of the doctrine that turned South Africa into the world symbol of racial oppression. He was apartheid's Karl Marx and Stalin rolled into one.
Yet in mid-1993 his grandson, Wilhelm, joined the A.N.C. together with his wife, Melanie, and at a rally in Cape Town soon afterward that astonishing chant was raised in praise of them. Long live Verwoerd! . . .
Wilhelm did not stand for Parliament on the A.N.C. ticket in the April election because he wanted to continue his academic career. But his wife did -- and she won. So now there is a Verwoerd on the A.N.C. benches in that place where the Ver woerdian doctrine was enacted in all its evil thoroughness and where Hendrik banned the A.N.C. in 1960. The irony is complete.
 From "Tomorrow Is Another Country."

HEADLINE: Uncle Bob

BYLINE: By Ruth Shalit; Ruth Shalit is associate editor of The New Republic.

 BODY:
"COFFEE, COFFEE, COFFEE," SENATOR BOB DOLE says, peering into a muddy cup of instant espresso. "One more sip of that good stuff. Ahhh. That's good." It's 6:20 A.M. on the opening day of the 104th Congress, and the soon-to-be Senate majority leader is relaxing in the Capitol Building's television anteroom, cracking jokes and gulping the foul brew from gold-rimmed china cups. Up close, he looks tired. There are bluish shadows under his eyes, and his striped silk necktie is slightly askew. But as he barnstorms through the morning news programs, explaining in his rumbling bass voice his plans for the new Congress, Dole is on a roll.
In less than six hours, he will be transformed from minority leader to majority leader, from the Senate's critic to its commander; already the tightly coiled, slightly menacing figure of years past seems a changed man: jaunty, self-possessed, aglow with power. "Hope you sleep better this year," he tells the crew of the "Today" show, fixing his tie with a few energetic tugs. "Ought to, with Republicans in charge." Not even the news of Kathleen Gingrich's indiscreet disclosure to Connie Chung fazes him. "Too bad about the Connie Chung thing," he muses in the elevator. "That's going to be the big news today." He knits his eyebrows. "Agghh, my mother would have said, 'Off the record.' " 
 The day's solemn ceremonies won't begin until noon, and as yellowish daylight begins to seep through the windows of the Capitol dome, Dole zigzags across his domain, greeting well-wishers, touching bases. A tall, sharp-featured man, he strides down the columned hallways, head thrust forward, body rigidly erect. Ear-piercing victory shrieks echo all the way down the corridors. "Go get 'em, Senator!" "Congratulations, Senator!" "Go, Dole! We're with you!" Dole basks in the warmth. To the crowds on the sidelines, he warbles, "Happy New Year. . . . It's a great day for the country." To reporters: "Unhhh, I could whisper to you about '96!"
At 8:30 A.M., Dole eases into the pleated upholstery of his chauffeured Lincoln Town Car and heads over to the Washington Court Hotel for a "Friends of Connie Mack Breakfast Buffet." At the breakfast, the Republican leader shakes dozens of hands, poses for photographs -- "Heh, heh. I'm on the far right here" -- and signs countless autographs in his large, widely tilted script.
"We did it, huh?" gushes Priscilla Mack, the wife of the Florida Senator. "We put it together. You ought to come down and see us again." Dole drops an eyebrow. "I'll be down there, don't worry," he says. "Something happening in '96."
Back in Dole's office, the mood is languid. The snug sitting room is bathed in the soft light of crystal chandeliers. Carved walnut chairs upholstered in red damask stand along the walls. As Dole sips his skim milk and picks at his cranberry muffin, friends creep in to warm themselves by the fire, which is already suffusing the room with a pleasant, smoky smell.
Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island stops by, saying he wants to discuss the order of business for the day. "It's a hard life," he muses, waiting to be escorted into the inner sanctum. "I don't begrudge him the extra pay he gets." Dole, meanwhile, squeezes in a couple of calls, the first to George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader. "I just wanted to thank you for all your courtesies." As the conversation turns to the coming Presidential campaign, he chuckles and bounces happily in his swivel chair. "Yeah, well, Cheney dropped out. Kemp's getting nervous. Ain't anybody left but me and Filbert," he says, referring to Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. He takes a call from Ernest Gallo. ("Better talk to him. Guy sent me some wine.") Then it's over to the Rayburn room for a quickie TV interview with WMUR of Manchester, N.H. "New Hampshire's been ahead of the game for a decade!" he tells viewers. "It's Washington that's finally caught up!"
Later, over a light lunch of bean soup, corn bread and more skim milk, Dole meets with his Senate leadership team to hash out committee assignments. "Santorum to Rules. Would that make him happy? . . ." "How many Budget slots we got? Who wants Budget? Really wants it bad? . . ." "We got a spot on Indian Affairs. . . . " Dole listens impassively, his head tipped to one side. "Take out Warner," he declares in a flat, cutting voice. "Coverdell's not going to get it. Take him off. Take Ashcroft off. Bond's on Small Business. I'd like to get Grams in there. He pleads with me, the poor guy, every time I go up there." Told that one Senator is refusing to give up his slot on the Small Business Committee for one on the Committee on Foreign Relations, Dole barks: "Doesn't he want to travel?"
Heading over to the Senate floor to read his elegantly scripted opening statement, Dole notices that the plaque on his door has been changed from "Office of the Republican Leader" to "Office of the Majority Leader." He scowls. "I wanted Republican leader," he says. "I told 'em not to change it. People don't know what majority leader means. They know what Republican leader means."
The title means many things to Dole: listener, arbiter, deal maker and party conscience, to name a few. But this year, more than anything else, it means one more shot at the Presidency. Without having even formally declared his candidacy, he has arrived with amazing speed at what looks like the verge of the nomination. At age 71, he now sees everything breaking his way. Dan Quayle and Jack Kemp have dropped out, leaving -- for now -- only Senator Gramm and Lamar Alexander, the former Education Secretary, as serious rivals. In the most recent Times-Mirror poll, taken in mid-February, 49 percent of those asked said Dole was their first choice, followed by Gramm at 13 percent and Alexander at 4 percent.
"In a certain sense, the campaign is Dole's to lose," says William Kristol, chairman of the Project for the Republican Future. "You can argue that his support is soft. But you can't totally discount the brute facts of public opinion. Elections are basically popularity contests. He could front-run all the way to the Presidency."
Colleagues attribute much of Dole's resurrection as a Presidential contender to the advent of Newt. Dole, once seen as too old, too nasty and too much a creature of Congress, now seems a kindly elder statesman compared with Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker. "Bob Dole's time has uniquely come," says Senator Robert Bennett of Utah. "Only two years ago, I would have said -- and was saying -- he's too old, he's too old-fashioned, he's too tied to the processes of the Senate; that the country wanted someone fresh and new and vigorous. After 1994, I think we want somebody with a little gray in his hair; somebody who's not so manic, not solving everything immediately. Frankly, among the people I talk to, Newt scares them a little bit. Isn't there some wise old uncle who can put his arm around him and calm him down a bit? And the obvious candidate to take that role is Bob Dole."
But Dole is also a three-time loser in national campaigns, and there's no guarantee he'll succeed this time, either. As Linda DiVall, a G.O.P. pollster, points out, Republican primary voters seem to like Dole but aren't particularly drawn to him. "One hundred percent of Republicans know Bob Dole," she says. "He's been in Congress for 34 years. He's obviously the front-runner. He has terrific name ID. He's on the national news every night. Yet only 40 percent are for him. Why is that?" Says a Dole strategist: "He's got to change perception, which is tough. He's got to provide new information about himself."
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the new majority whip, concurs. "It will be very interesting to see how he packages himself. This is something Bob really needs to think about. It is absolutely essential that he have a theme. One of the worst things George Bush ever did was to make fun of the 'vision thing.' Bob needs to think . . . about why he'd like to be President, and what he would do once he got there. And he needs to tell the American people."
Dole has thought about the "vision thing," but what he has to say is rather circular. He says he wants to be the kind of leader who leads; his battle cry, as leader, will be leadership at all costs. And when it comes to outlining a theme, he is vague and elliptical.
"There does have to be a message," he says. "And I think, you know, message is fine. . . . It just seems to me it all boils down to leadership. Not that I'm such a great leader. But I think I'm at least an inch or two above the others. And that's going to be our message. That, reining in Government and all that other stuff.
"The country, in 1996, as it gets ready to go into the next century, may be looking for some calm, studied, reasoned, seasoned, tested leadership. Not radical, but conservative and willing to work with Congress. Bob Dole has been there, he's been on the firing line, he's been tested, he's provided leadership. . . . Others may raise the age factor, but I don't think that's going to be a problem."
For now, Dole is offering himself more or less as he is -- the quintessential Washington insider, absorbed less with the poetry of politics than with the plumbing. His agenda, simply stated, is the ethic of the deal: tackling problems as they land on his desk, cobbling together solutions. "Takes a lot of time, a lot of patience, a lot of listening," he says with satisfaction. "Lotta meetings. Lotta sitting around with people. Sometimes you have to compromise."
He allows a frown to settle on his brow. "I knowthat's a bad word to some people," he says. " 'Oh, Bob Dole, he'll compromise. He'll make a deal.' Well, in my view, that's not a fault. You retain your principles and try to work something out. That doesn't mean when you get into the leadership position you suddenly start compromising. But you do understand that you've lost a little bit."
Dole admits readily, even happily, that he can't compete with Gingrich as a big-picture communicator. "Sometimes I kind of wonder: 'Well, jiminy, why can't I think like this guy? Is there something wrong with me?' Then I think, 'Well, maybe not.' " Like a British Tory rather than an American conservative, Dole distrusts visions and visionaries. He views Gingrich's effusions with amused skepticism. "You can go out there and say, 'I've got nine ideas.' Well, maybe one of them is good. We're the party of ideas, but that doesn't mean every idea is a good idea." Dole drops an eyebrow. "You hear Gingrich's staff has these five file cabinets, four big ones and one little tiny one. No. 1 is 'Newt's Ideas.' No. 2, 'Newt's Ideas.' No. 3, No. 4, 'Newt's Ideas.' The little one is 'Newt's Good Ideas.' "
Indeed, Dole's model for the Presidency is far removed from the third-wave, futurist fantasies that Gingrich has come to represent. "I've always thought about Eisenhower as my hero," Dole says. "He was a Republican, but sort of above it all. Not always, but most of the time."
In the absence of an ideological message, Dole bases his claim to leadership almost solely on his personal conviction, bordering on obsession, that he is the best qualified to run the country. "It's very difficult for him," says Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a close friend in the Senate. "Again and again, he sees people not nearly as well prepared, not nearly as knowledgeable, go into that high office. Now, finally, his time has come. And he's ready to serve and to lead."
But Dole's brand of leadership begs several questions. Can this caustic Washington insider proffer any theme more galvanizing than his mastery of the Senate's intricate folkways? More important, will his pledges of competent leadership please both the suspicious right-wing ideologues he needs to win the Republican nomination and the more moderate voters whose support could sweep him into the White House?
Dole is certain he is up to the challenge. "I wouldn't do this unless I thought I could win," he says. "A lot of this '96 stuff is momentum, perception. And if we can put this thing together, I think we really are going to be the dominant player." He bounces forward on his toes, gripping his right hand with his left. "People are saying, 'It's your turn,' " he says. "Didn't know people took turns in this business. But there's a strong feeling in the Republican Party of when your time has come."
POSSESSING A VIBRANT VOICE AND HANDSOME face, Dole the elder statesman is in person a surprisingly elegant presence. Over the years, his sharp features have grown more defined: his eyes lie deeper in their sockets and his nose juts forward in a strong curve. In public appearances, he clutches a pen in his clawlike right hand to warn off eager handshakers who have not noticed his withered arm as they crowd around him, clamoring for autographs. He responds patiently -- "M'a little left-handed!" -- and awkwardly signs with his left hand, a trick he learned after coming home to Russell, Kan., a badly wounded veteran of World War II. His recovery took three years, including seven operations and months in a neck-to-waist cast.
Dole is never more laconic than when he talks about the grenade explosion in the Po Valley in 1945 that broke his neck, paralyzed him for a year and and left him reluctant to this day to look in the mirror. When asked about it, he gazes out a picture window, watching snowflakes coat the jumbled roofs and domes of Capitol Hill. "During the '88 campaign, people kept saying, you gotta talk about yourself," he says, finally. " 'Cause everybody out there in the audience has had a tough time. Well, that's hard for me to do. I don't know if it's generational. You don't want to get up and talk about yourself, how tough it was, how you had all these problems in the hospital. You can be too self-serving in this business. There's a balance there that I still haven't found."
The nation got its first look at Robert Joseph Dole in his 1976 Vice Presidential debate with Walter F. Mondale, during which he ranted about the "Democratic wars" of this century. In his 1988 Presidential campaign, he further reinforced that truculent impression by telling George Bush to "stop lying about my record" on the night he lost the New Hampshire primary. Today, Dole is working hard to shed the hatchet-man image: offering up his Senate conference room for use during the baseball strike negotiations, swapping wisecracks with David Letterman ("Thought it went pretty good. Guy's easy, though"), helping to raise more than $6 million for the disabled through the Dole Foundation.
"He's a very tender, loving man," says Elizabeth Dole. "He always has been. But that's not what people see." She is sitting in her tidy, chintz-covered office at the American Red Cross, wringing her manicured hands in wifely dismay. Now 58, Liddy Dole is an attractive, engaging woman with bright brown eyes and sharp chin. Perched in a stiff armchair, she defends her husband's often-dour demeanor.
"I guess the phrase I'm looking for is frontier spirit, or pioneer spirit," she says. "Does that say something to you in terms of his ability to take the hard knocks of life without cringing?" The real Bob Dole, she continues, has not been captured. "Why, just last month, Bob invited our whole apartment building for a party in his office. Then he was unhappy, because none of the employees of the building showed up. Well, it turned out they hadn't gotten invitations! So we had to have another party inviting all the employees. Now, these things are going on all the time, but people don't know them. He never talks about them. He's just a private guy."
When Dole finally announces his candidacy, she will quit her job as president of the American Red Cross and work full time on the campaign. "I look at the way he's doing things, quietly and effectively, whether it's his public service career or whether it's privately, and I realize, this is Bob Dole," she says. "This is the part of him that needs to be told."
She learns forward in her chair. "Did you see the '60 Minutes' tape, where he teared up? Or at former President Nixon's funeral? He teared up there too. And there have been other little glimpses. He's letting his guard down a little bit. Maybe he's mellowed a little bit." Part of the strategy, she says, has been to persuade him to shed his reluctance to talk about his war wound. "You look at the three years he spent in the hospital, fighting his way back from total paralysis. It affects your whole life, in terms of the way you approach things. Sometimes, I forget he has this disability, and I may ask him to hang a picture. And he says, 'Now, Elizabeth, how do I hold the nail and hammer it with one hand?' "
His packagers are presenting him as an improved if not quite a new Bob Dole. "You really do mellow with age," insists David Keene, a G.O.P. consultant and close Dole adviser. "But it's not just age. He's different than he used to be. Maybe it's just sort of a long conversation with himself. He really does seem more comfortable in his own skin than he has in the past."
Displaying on this day no grand new talent for introspection -- or no new willingness to share the results of his introspection -- Dole merely says he is working to keep the sting out of his shafts. "I'm much more relaxed now," he says. "I've learned about the sharpness. Part of it, I think, is that it's just a more pleasant time for me."
Can a softer Bob Dole find the national base of support that has eluded him in the past? "Everything at the moment is going in his direction," says Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. "In mid-1993, he was seen as being overly partisan, unnecessarily divisive and a dark spirit. Today, all three of those attributes no longer exist. He is now seen as being an effective leader and someone who is very stable and secure. In the eyes of the American people, this is not the same Bob Dole they saw 18 months ago or six years ago."
Dole claims to see no deep meaning in the rehabilitation of his image. "If I had to say what it was caused by, it's people watching Clinton and Gingrich, and I sort of got a weekend pass," he muses. "People are saying, Bob Dole's sure looking good. But compared to what? There's a sense that this or that person may be too partisan, too strident, too acerbic, whatever. . . . If you go back to the morgue and look at the old stories, I was called the sheriff of the Senate. I was the tough guy, I was Nixon's point man, I was this, I was that. Everything's one day at a time around here. Sort of like A.A."
Mike Murphy is a 30-something republican adman who produced spots for Dole in the '88 campaign. This year, he has signed on with Lamar Alexander. "I wish Dole weren't running," sighs Murphy, between bites of a soft chicken taco. "I do hate being against him. And in fact, I told Lamar that I will never make an untrue, vicious, negative ad about Bob Dole. Gramm is another thing. And I will gut him like a catfish. But I will not do a cheap shot on Dole. Because Dole's weakness in politics is that he tells the truth. And you just can't be punished for that." Delicately, Murphy wipes his mouth with a napkin.
"Nonetheless," he says, "there are things in a campaign that are fundamentally true. And what's fundamentally true is there is an ongoing distrust of Washington. Lamar has spent most of his career doing stuff outside of Washington. And Bob Dole's been in Washington since I've been born." Murphy orders fried ice cream for dessert. "There's just been this fabulous new revolution in Republican politics," he says. "There's this whole new debate going on. I love Bob Dole, but this just isn't his moment."
Back in Dole '96 headquarters, the campaign manager, Scott Reed, begs to differ. Today is his first day on the job, and his sleek corner office is piled high with boxes. His desk is bare except for a yellow legal pad and a copy of Dole's daily schedule. "The '94 election was a revolutionary election," he says. "The Republican Party gained so much up and down the ticket. And the question is, Is Bob Dole positioned to fulfill that revolution? I think he is."
Reed elaborates. "There are three qualities that people are going to be looking at. Leadership, trust and good strong conservative values. Dole has all three of these." This perception is backed up by the polls, says William Lacy, deputy campaign chairman. "When you look across the board a large number of primary voters say that Bob Dole is their second choice. What that tells us is that he's someone everyone is comfortable with."
Asked if Dole is too much a creature of Washington, Reed stresses his candidate's outside-the-Beltway bona fides. "Washington isn't where he came from," he says. "He came from real, grass-roots America. He came to Washington to try to change things. It's been a long, hard struggle. And now, finally, we have change."
Jo-Anne Coe, Dole's campaign finance director, is comfortably ensconced in the next office. A thick-set woman with bowl-cut dark hair and hexagonal glasses, Coe has been with Dole for 27 years. "If you look back in history, you see that nominations are won consistently by the front-runners," she says. "This worked against us in '88. It works for us today. All these other candidates are very well qualified. But they're up against the same kind of problems we had with George Bush." Coe leans forward, genuine emotion in her voice and face. "We're not yet in the mode of picking curtains for the White House," she says. "But this is his time. He's worked hard for this. He deserves it. He's earned it. It's his turn."
But is it? As flame-throwing Newtoids turn Washington upside down, Dole remains unreconstructed, an old-stripe Republican moderate with little interest in ideological revolutions. He disdains Reaganomics: "If you're looking for ideology -- well, there's Ronald Reagan. Then you see how the debt went up during those years." He seems equally unenthusiastic about the Contract With America. "If you look back at 1994, people say it was won because of the Contract With America. Well, surveys show, what, 10, 12 percent of voters knew what it was all about." He sees no vast ideological meaning in the Republicans' recent electoral landslide. "The American people were voting for change," he says. "Just as I assume they were voting for change in 1992. If anybody could tell me precisely what the message was, I'll eat their hat."
He knows his insider's reputation is unlikely to play well in a nation fed up with the Capitol elite. Nevertheless, he thinks the problem is surmountable. "I guess you have a series of 30-second spots," he says. "Who is this person? Why would you want to vote for this him? Otherwise, it's just Bob Dole, the guy who's been here forever." Anger slips out around the edges of his voice. "It's Bob Dole, the insider, you know, the insider, the insider. Or the partisan, the partisan, the partisan. Or the deal maker, the deal maker, the deal maker." He sputters out the final word, wrinkling up his nose and raising his left hand with his fingers cramped in horror. "They think: 'Bob Dole. He's out there just cutting up everybody.' "
With Senator Phil Gramm, a hard-core conservative, raising millions in campaign funds and Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana lurking in the wings, the Republican contest is certain to heat up. For Dole, the temptation to veer hard right will be strong. Can he resist it and still be elected President? Dole insists he can. "You have to put your stamp on the party," he says. "You've got to be able to stand up and look people in the eye and say: This is America. Otherwise, your party's going to be going one way. And you'll be going another."
First and foremost, advisers say, he must not allow himself to be sidetracked by the demands of his Congressional leadership post. "His biggest problem as a candidate has been and is that he's a Senator," says Keene. "The more he fits into one category, the more difficult he finds it to operate in the other."
Dole's legislative outlook eats into his time and attention, and tends to define his candidacy. "Bob Dole's problem is that he does not come across as a conviction politician," says Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. "He acts and talks as if he's giving color commentary in a football game, rather than being a participant and quarterback. When you ask him, 'What about health care?' he doesn't say, 'We're fighting to stop government-run health care and move to a market-based system.' He says things like, 'The Democrats don't have the votes.' He gives you the play-by-play, totally detached from any sense that he is rooting for one team or another."
Even supporters suggest that Dole's immersion in legislative detail has narrowed his vision. "He has to break through 30 years of training and thinking to be able to talk about what he wants, rather than how to do it and mechanics," says a Dole campaign strategist. "He was up in New Hampshire recently, and someone asked him about something, and his response was: 'We have a bill about that. We can handle it. We'll work it all out in conference.' The voter was thinking, 'What is this guy talking about?' Getting him to change from legislative tactics to strategic thoughts about where he wants to take things is clearly going to be our biggest challenge."
Dole will have to walk a thin line in the primaries. If he moves too far right, he risks alienating moderate suburban Republicans and -- should he get that far -- swing voters in the general election. Equally dangerous, his advisers say, is his tendency to backslide into an all-too-comfortable moderate mode that is anathema to movement conservatives, who vote heavily in Republican primaries.
Dole's Jan. 21 speech to the Republican National Committee was sprinkled with right-wing crowd pleasers. "Let me repeat what Ronald Reagan said a few years ago, because it fits the day: 'In this present crisis, Government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem.' . . . It's called the message. Limited government. Rein in the Federal Government. Give more power to the people." He promised to cut taxes and asked the audience to keep in mind that President Clinton "passed the single biggest tax increase in the history of America."
Alas, the speech drew unkind reviews from the party faithful. "He's communicating as a candidate of 1988," lamented Tony Fabrizio of the G.O.P. polling firm of Fabrizio & McLaughlin & Associates. "This is not the anti-government rhetoric of the 1990's. When Gingrich talks about dismantling government, he talks in terms of Washington being destructive. He describes the whole system and what it's doing to ruin the country. It is very direct, very stark and very moving. Bob Dole's rhetoric comes across more like George Bush. There's no emotion, no passion there." He continues: "The politics of the 1990's on the conservative side involves passion, emotion; it involves people who are taking their country back. These are the people who are voting in primaries. I don't see that passion in Bob Dole."
It will take more than speeches to endear Dole to the movement conservatives. "It's interesting to watch Bob Dole try to intuit his way into this new political arena," says Jeff Eisenach, head of Newt Gingrich's Progress and Freedom Foundation and a close adviser to the Speaker. "I don't know how you persuade anybody that he's a plausible leader of the revolution, given his role in creating the current system." Frank Luntz agrees: "If I want to understand the institution of Congress, I'll sit down with Bob Dole. If I want to change America, I'm going with Newt Gingrich."
Conservatives still remember Dole's role -- with Senator George McGovern -- in strengthening the food stamp program and in his heading up the Senate fight for a holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. They are still angry that Dole, as Senate finance chairman, pushed a $98.3 billion tax increase in 1982 and a $50 billion hike in 1984.
In fact, it seems inevitable that the moderate core of Bob Dole will emerge in the campaign despite the best efforts of his handlers. While Dole may be as tongue-tied as George Bush in trying to describe the American future under his stewardship, he is a man with settled principles. On issues ranging from welfare reform to dismantling government, he is at odds with his more conservative Congressional brethren.
Though his crusty streak has earned him a reputation for mean-spiritedness, his support for the less fortunate is genuine. He opposes efforts by House conservatives to slash anti-poverty programs to help finance tax cuts. "I don't care what kind of welfare program you have," he says. "Somebody's out there with no mother, no father, whatever. Something's gonna happen. We're not going to let kids starve. This is America." He is uncomfortable with the conservative attempt to link welfare dependency to frayed morals. "You can't wrap all these things up in neat little packages," he says. "Every family's different."
Indeed, as a county attorney Dole found himself authorizing his own grandfather's welfare payments. "My grandmother passed away at age 47," he says. "My grandfather was a tenant farmer. He couldn't find work. Times were tough. You don't forget those things. Now that doesn't mean you ought to support everybody. But there are some people who can't find work. Maybe as a last resort there ought to be some government job or some subsidized private sector job." Dole's eyes are clouding over. "It's really sad," he says slowly. "You drive home. You see the people on the street, the homeless people. Well, you can't let your emotions dictate everything. But you have to be at least a little bit sensitive."
Dole also remains eager to dispel his party's reputation for social intolerance. "There oughtn't to be discrimination," he says. "Everything ought to be based on potential. Everyone should be treated alike, whether they're black or brown or disabled or homosexual."
On other Republican red-meat issues, Dole makes all the wrong noises. Slashing government? "The government does a lot of good things. I mean, lookit, I'm a product of the G.I. bill." Gay rights? "Well, you watch some of these programs. You read some of the material. And you say, well, they don't have any choice. Something else happens. Somewhere in the genes, or whatever. . . . I don't know whether it's involuntary or choice. But either way they have, obviously, civil rights. No discrimination. This is America." Gays in the military? "I haven't made a judgment on that. The big mistake there, whatever the answer is, was that Clinton brought it up so early."
Dole, who is anti-abortion, has countered religious conservatives who say they will bolt the party if a member of the '96 ticket supports abortion rights. While emphasizing that he opposes abortion, he has said that to reject a running mate who might favor abortion rights would be like "saying you are not going to have anybody who is right-handed or left-handed. My view is that we are all Republicans, good Republicans."
More interesting is Dole's response on the totemic issue of tax increases. During the 1988 New Hampshire primary, a frantic George Bush sought to spear Dole where he was most vulnerable. Dole "just won't promise not to raise taxes," proclaimed a mournful announcer in the now-famous "Senator Straddle" ad. "And you know what that means." The ads, which chastised Dole for refusing to sign a pledge not to raise taxes, arguably cost him the primary in the taxophobic state.
"I got in trouble, I remember, when I wouldn't sign that pledge," Dole says, still fuming seven years later. "What they tried to get me to do was to abandon principle. I said, 'If you'll just let me amend it, so I can put in that you can close loopholes.' . . . They said, 'Nope, that would be a tax increase for a company.' I said, 'Well, that's crazy.' But oh, no, you gotta be simon-pure, you can't raise anybody's taxes. Well, I'm not gonna do it!"
With his good hand, Dole grips the velvet armrest of his chair. "Then, Pete du Pont violates the debate rules. Pulls the pledge out of his pocket! Mighta cost me the whole ball of wax, I don't know." Would he sign the pledge this year? Dole barks a rueful little laugh. "Well, I did get killed on it. I guess you don't commit suicide twice." Then, stubbornly, he continues to straddle. "I guess I'd want to read it," he says. "If Bill Archer or Bob Packwood takes a look at the budget and finds some stuff in there that's an unintended benefit for someone who doesn't deserve it -- well, they ought to fix it. Somebody's paying taxes so somebody else can get a windfall."
It's principled statements like these that keep Dole's advisers up nights. "He cannot run as a conservative and say he's unwilling to foreclose the possibility of a tax increase," wails one Dole adviser. "Doesn't he know the New Hampshire primary is run by anti-tax activists? How can he stand there in the face of what George Bush did to him and say he's not sure about a tax pledge; that he'd have to look at it? That's the insider talking, not the ideologue."
On the campaign trail, Dole may escape such quandaries by retreating into his life story, stressing his background as a son of the plain-spoken Midwest. Says Dole: "A Democratic pollster not unfriendly to me said: 'You know what Bob Dole needs? He doesn't need all these "issues." He needs a little spot on his bio, so that people really understand who this guy is. He's not gonna be able to get to the right of Phil Gramm on anything. The man's always going to be one step further to the right.' Well, that seemed like a pretty good suggestion to me." In the Congress, however, such intraparty spats can't be finessed so easily.
He may also stress foreign policy, the one area where he enjoys an undisputed advantage over his all his potential rivals save Lugar. "If you ask people about foreign policy, their eyes glaze over," he says. "They don't really care. But if something happens where we play some critical role, then the American people care. That's why it's an asset to have somebody who basically understands it, who's been engaged in it for a long time, who's met all these foreign leaders, as I have."
On first look, his proposals seem disconnected. He wants a "peace powers" act to curb the commitment of troops and dollars to U.N. peace-keeping operations. "Haiti, Rwanda, Somalia," he says scornfully. "Add them all up, it's over a half billion a year." This January, Dole introduced legislation to end U.S. participation in the U.N. arms embargo on Bosnia, and also pledged that Congress would examine the Administration's pledge of economic aid to North Korea.
The connective thread, Dole says, is a pragmatic assessment of American interests. "In the Clinton years, there's been all this multilateralism. Gonna turn it over to the U.N. Not enough U.S. leadership. Clinton didn't really want to spend any time on foreign policy, and said so." In Dole's more muscular view, multilateralism is a myth. "We don't need that anymore."
In addition, Dole's military service could be extraordinarily helpful in the general election. "I thought, at first, I feel sorry for this guy," he says of President Clinton. "Veterans are very -- I don't want to say selfish, but they're very proud of what they did. Then when you have someone who just sort of actively tries to avoid the draft -- I mean, that's a no-no. I will assume that if I'm the candidate, I will have a lot of support from veterans groups. Got some lined up already."
The most immediate threat to Dole is the Contract With America, which will pose an early test of his loyalty to the Republican revolution. "Here's what worries me a little," he says wearily. "Let's say the House passes all these things and they get dumped in the Senate. Well, what's going to happen is we're not going to get everything. Democrats in the Senate are going to kill some of it. And the larger question is, do I get blamed for that? I mean, most people don't understand how the Senate works. Some people are going to say, Bob Dole couldn't get the contract through the Senate. It's all Bob Dole's fault. He couldn't get it passed. That's just sorta hanging out there."
Focusing, in typical Dole fashion, more on mechanics than outcome, he suggests that it ought to be enough merely to bring the contract items to the floor. "Say we pass the balanced-budget amendment. Or say we try and fail. Line-item veto. Try and fail. The House will pass all these things, of course. As long as we get a vote one way or the other, we'll still be in pretty good shape with the American people."
Such nonchalance may not satisfy the Senate's new generation of Republicans, a younger crowd who model themselves more on Gingrich and Gramm than Dole. In December, the Senate's new 53-seat G.O.P. majority voted out Dole's longtime deputy, Alan Simpson of Wyoming, and installed a Newtonian (and former House member), Trent Lott of Mississippi, in his place. Already there are other rumblings of revolt -- particularly among the 11 freshman Senators, most of whom are staunchly conservative. And if Dole can't handle his own members, his claims of leadership skill will ring hollow.
"Among those of us who came over from the House, there is frustration with the pace and the rules of the Senate," says Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma. "The question is, has the leader been entrenched so long in the old ways of doing things that it's difficult or impossible for him to conform with the revolution? Well, that's still an open question."
As an example, more symbolic than substantive, Inhofe cites a recent scuffle over the Senate's procedure for office selection. "We had a system in place where you had to wait 24 hours between selections," he says. "In the House, it's 20 minutes. That's a disparity that had to be investigated. So we took that to the leader. He brought it down to six hours. Well, that's not far enough."
Inhofe seems to speak for many in the Congress when he says that, in his view: "Newt has been a little too strident, and has turned off people who ought to have been supporters. Dole has not been strident enough. The solution might be to take Dole and Gingrich and put them in a Waring blender."
Generational tensions were very much in evidence at a breakfast meeting with the freshmen in Dole's leadership office the day after the Senate opened. Things went smoothly enough at first. Seated at the head of the table, Dole reigned over his charges with paternal solicitude. With a glance, he shamed Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee out of appropriating all the fresh raspberries for himself. Then the discussion got under way.
"In the early days, we have to demonstrate that we run this place," Dole explained. "There are going to be a number of motions made by the Democratic leadership. They're going to try to tack a gift ban onto the Congressional coverage bill. They're going to try to tack on lobbying reform. They're going to bombard us. And we're going to need your support. We need to demonstrate here that we do have authority, that we're willing to exercise authority, that we're willing to exercise leadership. We're not going to address the gift ban, and lobbying reform. Have the principle to stick with us in the early stages. Why get in a big debate with Paul Wellstone? Why give him any ink?"
The freshmen cooed in veneration. Dole was speaking their language. Then things got a little dicey. "Unnhh, I know some of you have committees on your mind," he said, spooning Rice Krispies into his mouth. "How many here want to be on the Budget Committee?" Eleven eager hands went up. "How many for Appropriations?" The flock of hands flew up again. "Indian Affairs?" Silence. No volunteers. Finally, Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania spoke up. "Well," he said, "why not abolish it?" Another moment of silence. "Pardon?" Dole said finally. Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota cleared his throat. "If no one wants on the commmittee, I mean, can't we abolish it? Can we do that?" A cheer went up around the table. "Yeah!" "Abolish it!"
Dole looked exasperated. "Well, it's not quite that simple," he told the group. "We can't just abolish committees. . . . Certain members have large populations. . . . Thereare staff questions. We might be able to make some recommendations." The freshmen, let down, clinked their spoons against their coffee cups.
Meanwhile, Dole has bigger problems. At any moment, he and Gramm are likely to crash through their present veneer of Republican brotherhood and turn into snarling adversaries. Dole has enraged his rival by maneuvering to keep him off the powerful Senate Finance Committee. Fumes a Gramm aide: "The insider's view in Congress has always been that you deal with the problem of Phil Gramm by pushing him outside, so he has no inherent power base from which to operate. That's a terrible, terrible mistake. Go ahead and throw Phil into that brier patch. He has always been underestimated."
Privately, Dole staff members fret that Gramm is the one person who could cause their boss to violate the new be-nice rule. "I don't think Dole respects Gramm at all," says one Republican Senate staff member. "Gramm is the kind of guy who's always cutting to the front of the line, always big-footing. Dole has some respect for the process and the system. And there's just no decorum in Gramm."
Indeed, it is only when discussing his Republican rival that Dole's legendary testiness surfaces. "Everybody says the most dangerous place in the Capitol is between Phil and a TV camera," Dole grouses. "He's very aggressive. You know, he comes to me now and then, and says, 'If I go too far, I want you to tell me.' Well, I'm not going to tell him! He oughtta know when he goes too far." Dole shakes his head, perplexed. "I remember a couple, maybe three years ago, he started introducing me as the best legislator he'd ever known. As if he had nothing else in mind for me, other than being a legislator. Well, I'm not naive about this. All this fulsome praise about Bob Dole, the greatest Senator in the world. In other words, he oughtta stay there. I thought, 'This guy is running for President!' Three years ago! I couldn't believe it."
But Dole's greatest worry seems to have been removed, at least for now -- Gingrich has declared that he will not seek the nomination in '96. But that doesn't completely relieve Dole of his Gingrich problem, nor rule out a Gingrich reversal. The Speaker, as Jeff Eisenach of Gingrich's foundation observes, "is at the moment more than any other single person, defining the Republican Party. And there does come a point at which if there is no one who shares his definition of the party who's plausible as a Presidential candidate, and the Republican Party has redefinied himself in terms of him. . . . " Eisenach's voice trails off. "Then does it become almost inevitable? Does he have an obligation? Is the party going to say, Look, being Speaker is fine. But the truth is that our leader is going to be in the White House -- and you're our leader."
Gingrich's leadership would be the antithesis of Dole's. Compared with the dignified Kansan, Gingrich seems to lack maturity, Presidential stature. "There has to be a little mystery about the President," muses Dole. "The American people, when they think about the President -- and again, I'll find out after the election if I'm anywhere near accurate -- don't want to see you popping up everywhere with 15 different programs. There has to be this sort of mystique, or mystery."
Suddenly, we are talking not about Gingrich but about President Clinton. "He'll go out and have a press conference at 10," Dole frets. "Then he'll go out and step on his story all day long with four or five other things. Well, Reagan had a message, and he stayed right on his message and never wavered from it, win or lose. Clinton has the line of the day -- and then he goes around stepping on it."
The Clintonites claim they couldn't care less what Dole thinks of the President. They have written him off as a negative obstructionist, temperamentally unsuited for the nation's highest office. "I don't sense that people here are quaking about Dole," says an Administration official. "Winning Presidential candidates tend to be sunny, and upbeat, and hopeful and forward-looking. Dole is going to have a much harder time getting through."
In fact, in this age of empty third-wave optimism, it is precisely Dole's brooding, almost Nixonian opacity -- his wound, his dark side, his aversion to self-display -- that give him a kind of dignity. Compared with the loquacious emotionalism of Clinton and Gingrich, Dole's reserve gives him an appealing mystery -- not only to reporters but to many Democrats. "He's like the mean old guy in the murder movie who everybody thinks is a killer," says one admiring Washington Democrat, "until five minutes before the end when the plot twists, and you find out he's not that bad after all."
Dole, for his part, makes it clear he has revealed as much of himself as he cares to. "Bill Clinton said, 'I feel your pain,' " he says. "Then we all felt the pain." The fire in the fireplace sputters and flickers out, and Dole gives a gentle, perplexed shake of his head. "I've watched the backslappers. I've seen people who've pushed the envelope too far," he says. "They're trying to curry favor with this group or that group. I think: I don't want to be like this person.

HEADLINE: The End Of Dignity

BYLINE: By David Gelernter; David Gelernter, author of the forthcoming "1939: The Lost World of the Fair," teaches computer science at Yale.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
The American Museum of Natural History in New York City plans to tear down the old Hayden Planetarium and replace it with something snazzier: an 80-foot sphere in a glass box. The outside of the sphere will function as a giant projection screen, capable of flashing thousands of images simultaneously.
The museum wants to become interactive; it has already remade one of its galleries into what The New York Times described as a "miniature theme park." It's about time, too, according to The Times, which reported that the museum is "dogged by a reputation for stodginess" and known for its "musty corridors and dreary dioramas." 
 After all, the planetarium is a relic of the 1930's -- and what can you say about an era that gloried in the measured, earnest educational tones of the old museum? (Straight ahead for the Hall of Stodginess. Dreariness upstairs to your right.) Peter L. Rothholz, a former chairman of the Queens Museum, described one aspect of the 1939 New York World's Fair as "characteristic of the naivete of that time." Most of us would agree. We are sophisticated; they were naive. Right?
Exactly wrong. The society of the planetarium's youth was the more sophisticated one, and the old building's impending death is part of a trend that has damaged American life.
In the 1930's, after all, you could please the public and command an audience without turning your museum into an amusement park, miniature or otherwise. When the planetarium opened in 1935, The Times was "enchanted" and declared that watching the sky show was "like seeing the splendors of the universe for the first time." The New York Herald Tribune agreed: "For popular interest, it seems certain to surpass any other new arrival in the city's history."
Behind these comments lies an now-discarded idea of a museum's function. Back then, a museum was for enjoyment and reflection, not thrills. "At last," The Times announced in evident relief when the planetarium opened, "the spectators understand what is meant by 'precession of the equinoxes.' "
According to a 1938 guidebook, the museum "is filled with the wonders of natural science from every known section of the globe." That was enough to make it noteworthy. The museum was a serious institution, and it addressed its audience with calm dignity.
Calm dignity (a concept that is unlikely to fetch 10 cents in any contemporary PBS auction) used to be a valued commodity in public discourse. Listen to the 1930's holding forth on the advent of TV, which began its American career in 1939: "Television will contribute to the enjoyment of millions," read an RCA print advertisement. "When it becomes a nationwide service it should provide new opportunities for workers." David Sarnoff, the company's president, was only slightly more effusive. "It is with a feeling of humbleness," he said, "that I come to this moment of announcing the birth in this country of a new art so important in its implications that it is bound to affect all society."
Contrast modern journalism's fevered reaction to new technologies. The Economist announced that the advent of the information superhighway would be "a revolution in communications that is going to change the world." Business Week called it "a revolution in home entertainment and information." Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of the California software company Oracle, said it "is going to forever change our lives."
The slow death of dignified public discourse echoes through our culture. In politics, it has meant the triumph of negative campaigning. In art, nuance and beauty are drowned out by the acid blare of the message. The public has become increasingly cynical about politics and art. It will become cynical about technology, too, when the actuality fails to live up to the advance billing.
Our preference for the excessive in public discourse reflects one of the deepest trends in modern American life: the death of authority. The old American Museum of Natural History commanded a respectful audience without turning somersaults because it was an authoritative institution. David Sarnoff didn't need to proclaim a revolution in order to be heard; he was an authority, and people were predisposed to listen to him. Because authorities didn't need to shout, they had a calming (and often uplifting) influence on society.
Of course, authorities spoke nonsense sometimes -- an anti-Semite like Henry Ford had more credibility then than he would have today. But in democratic America, authority was an outstandingly democratic institution. For every institution like the Museum of Natural History, ennobled by its long association with bluebloods like President Theodore Roosevelt, there was a David Sarnoff, who came to the U.S. as a 9-year-old Russian immigrant and worked as a self-taught telegrapher on his way to the top.
In itself, the proposed new planetarium does no harm. I'll miss the old building, but not because it is an architectural masterpiece. In a larger sense, though, those bulldozers will be plowing calm dignity under and replacing it with glitz, hype and somersaults, and we will all be worse off for it.
The democratic authority culture is gone, and we can't bring it back. But we can make sure that our children, as they stroll through the new glass box and the miniature theme park, interacting as they go, are aware that things used to be different. As an antidote to smugness, if nothing else.
Before tearing down the Hayden Planetarium, the museum might stage one last exhibit in there. Call it "On the wisdom of the society that built this condemned planetarium." Forgo just this once (as a special favor to children) the tendentious recitation of American sins that has turned so many contemporary history books, articles and exhibits into sanctimonious rot. Tell us instead what our grandparents did right, which of their accomplishments we ought to treasure, what aspects of the society they built were noble -- and are gone.

HEADLINE: Summer Renters, Some From Coast, Buoy the Hamptons

BYLINE: By MARY CUMMINGS 

 BODY:
IT is house-hunting time in the Hamptons, and brokers say business is brisk.
From Westhampton to Montauk, real-estate brokers and salespeople credit mild winter weather and encouraging economic news for a summer rental season that they say is shaping up as a strong one. But people in the industry cite other factors, too. 
 Marylynn Novak of Braverman Newbold Brennan in Bridgehampton spoke of "a tremendous influx of Californians" that has swelled the ranks of renters. Peter Hallock, president of Allan M. Schneider Associates, which handles rentals between Southampton and Montauk, also said that "more West Coast people" seeking summer rentals had been entering the six offices of his company on the East End.
Elise Prado of Martha Greene Real Estate in Montauk said that because skiing this year "was not the best," house hunting in the Hamptons had become a weekend activity of choice. Couples who might have been on the slopes have been scouting summer houses, she said.
Norma Reynolds, a broker in Westhampton Beach for 30 years, said the swift pace was not unusual. "We have always had good rental seasons," she said. Ms. Reynolds estimated that 60 percent of her rental inventory had been spoken for by the end of February, an indication, she said, that the early birds were arriving earlier than ever.
Mr. Hallock said Schneider had reached about the same point in the season. "Five years ago," he said, "it started in March. Then it was February. Then January. And now it's Thanksgiving. The best things go first."
Ms. Prado said it all turned out the same on Memorial Day. "Every year the end result is about the same," she said. "Only the timing changes."
Simon Harrison, a broker at Harbor Cove Realty in Sag Harbor, agreed, adding that despite the disruptions from the snowstorms last winter the year turned out to be good in the end.
"Last year we were renting houses through the mail," he said, recalling the long days when brokers twiddled their thumbs while prospective tenants waited for a break in the weather to travel to the Hamptons.
Mr. Harrison said he believed that when the final tallies were in for the 1995 summer season they would reflect real growth, not just shifts in the peaks and valleys. "It's very strong," Mr. Harrison said. "Last year was strong, but if this past two months is any indication, 1995 will be the strongest season I've seen."
The president of the Real Estate Store, Rocco Oliverio, citing an upturn in the economy, said he intended to add 30 associates in the spring to the 30 already employed in the four offices on the South Fork. He said his goal was to hire 20 additional associates after that for a total of "50 for the year."
Summer rentals that Mr. Oliverio is offering range from $8,000 to $150,000 for the season, which runs from Memorial Day to Labor Day. The houses most in demand, Mr. Oliverio said -- and many brokers concurred -- are those with pools and tennis courts, which rent in the $35,000-to-$40,000 range.
Mr. Hallock said the rental inventory at Schneider included everything from "a funky fisherman's cottage for $7,500" to a $400,000 contemporary on the ocean with six bedrooms, six and a half baths, pool, tennis and Jacuzzi.
The rental roster at Schneider features three or four mansions a year, he said. The oceanfront contemporary found a renter last year, Mr. Hallock recalled, and brought something close to the asking price.
Brokers said there had not been much change in the number of rentals or of asking prices in five years or so, but Mr. Hallock said he expected annual increases of 5 to 10 percent. "Five percent is fair," he added. "I think you see that every year."
Exceptions are usually made if a reliable tenant wants to return to the same house. "When someone renews," he added, "if you are happy with your tenants, you give it to them for the same price."
Brokers said renewals were particularly strong this year. Some speculated that the last-minute rush last year might have soured a few people on recreational house hunting.
The price break for renewals is apparently one of the few concessions that renters can hope for in a market that relies increasingly on second-home owners who are willing to rent out their houses but also want to enjoy them.
Tenants may try to haggle, but with few exceptions "rentals are not negotiable," Mr. Hallock said, certainly not when Memorial Day is three months away. As for wangling extra time -- a week or two in September, for example, or perhaps a year-round rental -- that is usually not an option, either. Renters try, Mr. Oliverio said, "but there's nothing available." Even if the owner is not ready to move back in himself, "if you can get $40,000 for the summer, it's almost better to leave it vacant," he said.
Monthly rentals are more common than they used to be, when men traditionally sent their wives and children out for the season and joined them on weekends. Two-career families have added to the demand for the shorter-term rentals, which suits many owners who like to use their houses in June and September. "They're getting the same amount of money from renting in July and August," said Ms. Prado.
The trend appears to be strongest in the Montauk area. Mr. Hallock said full-season rentals were still dominant in his business, and Jack Hangen at Agawam Realty in Southampton concurred. "The bulk is still Memorial Day to Labor Day," Mr. Hangen said.
Swimming pools, once regarded as a premium feature, now tend to be considered a bare-bones item. "Now people want heated pools," said David Porter, who operates David Porter Real Estate in Wainscott. In a new wrinkle, Mr. Porter said, tenants sometimes strike bargains to pay half the cost of heating the pool, probably about $2,500, if the owner will pay the other half.
Mr. Harrison said one listing in Sag Harbor, "a Main Street mansion that rents for the season for $20,000," would probably more than double in value and bring $45,000 if the owner were to put in a pool. "In two years a pool usually pays for itself," he said.
Waterfront property is always worth more money. An oceanfront rental almost automatically puts a house in the top bracket. Several brokers mentioned that people were increasingly asking for central air-conditioning, a sign that the demand for amenities is escalating. In Mr. Oliverio's territory, "the big attraction this year is basketball courts."
There were two basketball hoops at a "very private walk-to-the-ocean, traditional house" in Bridgehampton that Ms. Novak planned to show a music executive from Manhattan on the last weekend of February. It was one of two houses in the $60,000-to-$65,000 range that she planned to show a client. The other, a meticulously renovated barn-style house on a creek with five bedrooms, a pool, a tennis court, billiard room, dock and canoe, had none.
In Bridgehampton the basketball arrangement was almost certainly irrelevant. Likewise the tennis court, the billiard table and the canoe. The client did not even care whether the house had two bedrooms or five, Ms. Novak said. "He wants something charming and quaint," she said. "It has to be near the ocean, a pool is a must, and money is no object."

HEADLINE: In Atlantic City Airport's Growing

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY 

 BODY:
THE residents of Atlantic City are all too familiar with grand schemes that eventually turn out to be something less.
Item: Since the announcement last summer of the Uptown Renewal Tract, a proposal to spend $200 million on a hotel, amusement park, casino and new housing in a blighted neighborhood, the price tag has dwindled to $50 million, and the casino and housing have been cut. 
 Item: A three-block-long corridor to link a new convention center with the Boardwalk was to have included Disney-like fountains and statuary and a 900-room hotel. Now the glitz is out, and the hotel will be 400 rooms.
What counts, though, the city fathers say, is that these projects to reinvigorate the city, however diminished, are going through. And they are equally confident about a far-reaching $211.4 million plan by the South Jersey Transportation Authority to double the size of Atlantic City International Airport.
"We view the airport expansion as a catalyst for the growth of the whole South Jersey economy," said Richard M. Woolston, the authority's director of marketing and government affairs.
The authority owns the 83-acre airport in Pomona. It is completely encircled by the 5,200-acre Federal Aviation Administration Technical Center, with which it shares runways. And both are within the 1.1-million-acre Pinelands National Preserve.
In fact, the only shadow over the expansion project has been cast by the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, an environmental watchdog group. The group says that nearby communities are already seeking to move their growth areas away from the airport's noise and pollution and toward ecologically sensitive parts of the Pinelands.
The first phase of the airport project has been under way for two years, and $26 million has been spent on expansion of the parking lot and the apron, on new access roads and on improvements to the terminal. The second phase, scheduled to start at year's end, will include expansion of the terminal. Sections of the Atlantic City Expressway and the Garden State Parkway adjacent to the airport will be widened from four to six lanes within the next two to three years.
The airport has had its ups and downs in recent years, the passenger volume dropping by more than 60 percent between 1983 and 1985, in part because of the departure of American International Airways, a budget carrier. The 1994 volume was 816,000, down from 903,000 in 1993 because, officials said, of bad weather and flight cancellations. By 1998, the authority expects the volume to reach 1.3 million.
Money for the various phases of the expansion will, to some degree, be dependent on a growth in passenger volume. But Jay O'Donnell, chief of economic development for the authority, said that $35 million in funds had already been pledged to the airport -- $17 million from the New Jersey Economic Development Fund and $18 million from the Federal Aviation Administration.
Officials of the authority are hopeful that the expansion project will enable Atlantic City's airport to draw passengers away from Philadelphia International Airport, which is about an hour's drive away.
"About three million people live within a 45-minute drive of Atlantic City International Airport," Mr. Woolston said. "An estimated 21 percent of the 17 million passengers a year who pass through the Philadelphia airport come from southern New Jersey, and we would like to tap into that market."
To help things along, the authority has asked the United States Customs and Immigration Service to designate the airport a duty-free port. It has also asked the Federal agency for permission to accept international charter flights that would be sponsored by the casinos.
In January, the full master plan for the expansion was presented for the first time at public hearings, which have considered its economic and environmental impact. The authority's environmental assessment is expected to be issued this month.
The airport is in a designated growth region of the Pinelands and is also along the Atlantic Flyway, a major migration route for birds. It is also only two miles from the Brigantine unit of the Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, a 22,000-acre bayside preserve that is teeming with migrating and breeding waterfowl, as well as numerous species of amphibians and mammals.
Endangered species like the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon live in Brigantine. The airport property itself supports a population of endangered upland sandpipers, a breeding pair of Cooper's hawks and 100 breeding pairs of threatened grasshopper sparrows.
The Pinelands Preservation Alliance, based in Pemberton, has recently completed its own study on the secondary effects of the airport expansion. Sally F. Price, director of the alliance, said that new residential development and increased demands for water, sewage and other infrastructure and municipal services could cause communities on the periphery of the airport to "back up" into the environmentaly sensitive areas of the Pinelands as the airport grows.
The authority has not paid sufficient concern to the secondary effects of the airport expansion, Ms. Price said, and as a result the the alliance has produced a slide show to present its views to local and county planning boards. "We're taking our show on the road," she said.
Of special concern, Ms. Price said, is possible intrusion on the ecologically sensitive Elwood Corridor, the center of which is situated between the Atlantic City Expressway and Route 30 in Elwood.
William F. Harrison, an assistant commissioner of the state's Pinelands Commission, which regulates growth in the region, said the commission has been working with the transportation authority to help it ameliorate the future impact of the airport expansion on endangered species and the wetlands habitat. He said that the proposed expansion is viewed as a gradual one and that the authority has expressed a willingness to protect the environment as much as possible.
With a $254 million convention center scheduled to open in 1996, and other casino projects in the works, the airport expansion is seen by financial experts and local officials as an essential part of transforming the city into a tourist destination, rather than the gambling mecca for day-trippers it has become since the first casino opened in 1978.
According to the authority's airport master plan, the small terminal that was built in 1989 will double in size by the year 2000. The number of gates is expected to rise from 3 to 13, which would accommodate wide-bodied jumbo jets, by 2000. By 2013, the master plan predicts, the number of gates will have increased to 33 and the passengers to 2.6 million or as many as 3.5 million.
Airport development, Mr. Woolston said, will have a "ripple effect" as related industries like aviation manufacturers and service companies spring up in and around the airport.
Continental Express and U.S. Air Express now operate 19 flights a day on planes that accommodate up to 46 r passengers. The flights are to Newark, Philadelphia, Boston, Cleveland and Dallas. There are also several flights a week to Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Fort Myers in Florida on the somewhat larger Spirit Airlines. Also, two dozen or so charter airlines run flights in and out of the airport, officials said. This is all in addition to military aircraft like F-16's and C-130's that use the F.A.A. center along with the Air National Guard.
The success of the expanded airport may hinge in part on how many hotel rooms Atlantic City contains. A 1994 research report on the gaming industry by Lehman Brothers, the New York investment firm, said: "Most airlines will not establish regularly scheduled flights into the city until it has a room base of 10,000 to 12,000." The casinos now have about 9,200 hotel rooms, but the report says the city should have 14,300 rooms by 1996.
Two weeks ago, officials of the Aztar Corporation, the owner of the Trop World Casino and Entertainment Resort, announced plans to expand its hotel by building a 21-story addition on top of its present parking garage. The expansion would bring to 1,650 the total number of rooms, making Trop World the largest hotel in the state, the officials said.
The Lehman Brothers report is generally optimistic about the city's prospects for growth and the airport expansion. In light of all the growth that is being planned, the report said, the city's odds of overcoming potential out-of-state competition and becoming a thriving resort destination are very good.

HEADLINE: Europeans Oppose American as Next Director of Unicef

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
In a bitter behind-the-scenes diplomatic battle, the 15 nations of the European Union have frustrated the Clinton Administration's efforts to have an American public health specialist selected as executive director of Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund.
The agency has been headed by an American since it was founded in 1946, and until recently the Administration was confident that its candidate, Dr. William H. Foege, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, would become the agency's new executive director. 
 But American officials acknowledge that the European Union has at least for now prevailed on Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali not to choose Dr. Foege.
The fight is the latest in a long-running trans-Atlantic battle over who should run different international organizations, a struggle involving prestige and the major powers' sense that they deserve to run their fair share of United Nations agencies.
"I said to Boutros-Ghali on behalf of the European Union, it is a post that has since the beginning been held by an American," said Jean-Bernard Merimee, France's chief delegate to the United Nations. "We think it's time for a change."
But Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate, is using Washington's diplomatic muscle to press Mr. Boutros-Ghali to select Dr. Foege (FAY-ghee) instead of a European.
James P. Rubin, chief spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations, said, "In light of the fact that the United States is the largest contributor to Unicef, we strongly believe an American should have this job."
One argument the Europeans are making is that while the United States contributes more to Unicef than any other country -- one-quarter of the agency's $1 billion budget -- European countries together contribute about half of its budget and thus deserve the executive director's post.
Despite the stalemate, Clinton Administration officials say they still hope Mr. Boutros-Ghali will choose Dr. Foege after consulting with Unicef's executive board late this month.
From the European perspective, Dr. Foege should not head Unicef because Americans already run the United Nations Development Program and the World Food Program. The Americans counter that Europeans run the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
"It's a very touchy issue," said Ahmad Fawzi, a spokesman for Mr. Boutros-Ghali. "He wants to take his time."
United Nations officials acknowledge that Unicef faces a difficult period, after the death in January of James P. Grant, the highly respected executive director for 14 years. Unicef, which provides assistance to children in 138 countries, needs to shore up its fund-raising while population and poverty are growing rapidly in the third world.
In addition, it is coping with a corruption scandal in which it suspended 10 staff members in Kenya last week.
American officials insist that Dr. Foege is the most qualified individual for the job. An epidemiologist, he ran the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control from 1977 to 1983 and is considered instrumental in helping to eradicate smallpox worldwide. From 1986 to 1992 he headed the Carter Center in Atlanta, where he did extensive work fighting polio and promoting immunizations.
"Bill Foege is one of the most outstanding public servants I have ever known," said former President Jimmy Carter. "It would be in the best interest of the world and its children to have him appointed to head Unicef."
The Europeans say Dr. Foege is qualified, but they assert that management and fund-raising skills are as important as public health expertise. The Americans argue that Dr. Foege has plenty of management experience from running at least two institutions.
While the Europeans have agreed on blocking the American candidate, they have not agreed on their own candidate.
Britain is backing Richard Jolly, a British economist and the longtime No. 2 official at Unicef, who is now serving as acting director. The British say he is ideal because of his long experience at Unicef and his years of development work in Africa.
Belgium supports Anne-Marie Lizin, a member of the Belgian and European Parliaments and vice president of the Socialist International, a world organization that promotes the social democratic political viewpoint. Gunther Sleeuwagen, first secretary at the Belgian Mission to the United Nations, said she deserved the job because Unicef needs someone "who is at home in political circles and who can make sure there is money coming in to Unicef."
The Nordic countries are backing Elisabeth Rehn, a former Finnish Defense Minister who narrowly lost a presidential race in Finland last year. She has long been a leader in Unicef's association of national committees.
American officials acknowledge that one strike against Dr. Foege is that Mr. Boutros-Ghali is said to be looking for a woman to head Unicef.

HEADLINE: Triple Murder Causes Alarm About Hate Groups' Growth

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

DATELINE: SEISHOLTZVILLE, Pa., March 5

 BODY:
Along Walker Road here, Mark Thomas's compound of hate is easy to find.
Amid the trash, mud, rusted vehicles and sagging buildings a little more than a mile off the main road, the 44-year-old Mr. Thomas operates a ministry for racists where he teaches weapons skills on a rifle range and where, last April, he played host to a weekend Hitler Youth Festival that attracted 200 neo-Nazi skinheads and other white supremacists. Mr. Thomas also publishes The Watchman, a monthly newsletter that in one issue last year preached, "It is the trademark of the Jew to make us feel dirty and unworthy." 
 Although well known to the police and state authorities in the Lehigh Valley, Mr. Thomas is now attracting more intense scrutiny as the result of a gruesome triple murder that the police say was committed by two brothers, both neo-Nazi skinheads who were said to have visited the compound many times. The religious doctrine taught there, known as Christian Identity, says anyone who disagrees with white supremacy is a traitor who must be destroyed.
The murders and the existence of Mr. Thomas's camp are focusing state officials' attention on the swift growth of white-supremacy groups in Pennsylvania. The number of hate crimes more than doubled in five years in Pennsylvania, to 417 in 1993 from 181 in 1988, according to the State Human Relations Commission.
The brothers, 18-year-old Bryan and 16-year-old David Freeman, are charged with beating and stabbing to death their father, Dennis Freeman, 54, their mother, Brenda, 48, and their youngest brother, Eric, 11. The police have also charged Nelson Birdwell 3d, an 18-year-old cousin who was in the Freeman home at the time of the attack but denied taking part, with a lesser offense.
The brothers' home in Salisbury Township, outside Allentown, is a 20-minute ride from Seisholtzville. Brenda Freeman had told officials at the human relations commission, Allentown city officials and a former organizer for the Aryan Nation, a racist group in Idaho, that her sons were frequent visitors to Mr. Thomas's compound.
In an interview over the weekend, Mr. Thomas acknowledged that Bryan Freeman visited once, last October, for an Oktoberfest celebration. "There was a bonfire," Mr. Thomas said. "There were marshmallows. It was a family kind of thing."
But he said he never met the muscular teen-ager, who is over 6 feet tall, sported a swastika tattoo on his neck, wore high black boots and fatigues, and shaved his head. Mr. Thomas denied teaching a philosophy of hate and said he was "on sabbatical" from white-supremacy organizing. The crimes the Freeman brothers are accused of cannot be laid at his door, he said.
"I never heard of either of them until this happened," Mr. Thomas said.
But a teen-ager who spent a lot of time at the compound and was interviewed in January by the human relations commission, described an atmosphere of paranoia and intimidation there. A Nazi flag hangs in a makeshift chapel inside an old trailer on the grounds, according to a transcript of the interview. Food is stockpiled in the basement of the main wood-and-stone house in preparation for a "racial holy war," and Mr. Thomas built a bomb shelter out of a bus he buried on his land, the teen-ager said. Skinheads were welcome at the compound, the teen-ager said, and Mr. Thomas spent hours teaching Christian Identity.
"Their whole religion is based mostly on the first chapter in the Bible," the teen-ager said. "Thomas claims that Jewish people are descended from Cain who was a descendant of the devil snake and Eve. He claims white people are descendants of Abel who was a descendant of Adam and Eve. He claims there are two main races, Jews and white people. Everyone else is classified under beasts of the field. They say we need the help of the beasts of the field people to overcome the evil Jewish race."
That such extreme teachings are finding a growing audience in Pennsylvania is a source of alarm, but not surprising, state officials said. Ann M. Van Dyke, an investigator with the human relations commission, said Mr. Thomas, who once earned a living as a trucker, is now tilling the fertile fields of racial tension and economic dislocation in the Lehigh Valley and Pennsylvania generally.
The state's dominant industries -- coal mining, steel production, heavy equipment manufacturing -- collapsed in the 1980's, Ms. Van Dyke explained, throwing thousands of blue-collar workers out of work. The new high-tech engineering, medical and information industries, based mainly in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, demand a different set of skills and education.
Ms. Van Dyke also said that turmoil in the big cities of the Northeast, including New York, is causing members of minority groups to flee to places like Allentown, where the once white-majority school population is now more than half Hispanic and black.
Five months ago, in a move that city officials said seemed to encourage race divisions, the Allentown City Council approved a law directing municipal documents to be published only in English.
"In this state there is wage stagnation," Ms. Van Dyke said. "There is resentment of affirmative action and an across-the-board fear that their job is going to be taken by somebody who didn't work as hard or deserve it. The kids feel that fear, and known racists are exploiting it."
The neo-Nazi skinhead culture, which glorifies violence, made its way to the United States from England in the early 1980's, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil-rights group in Alabama. Sixty-four white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups are active in Pennsylvania, according to the state, more than any state in the East and perhaps the largest number in the country.
Hate-group literature and recruiting fliers for white-supremacy groups are now common in schools through the state, said Richard B. Anliot, the director of Education and Community Services at the human relations commission.
Barry Morrison, the Philadelphia regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said the increase in hate crimes -- defined as assaults, violence, threats and other incidents motivated by racial tension -- in the last few years in Pennsylvania reflected a national trend of intolerance and violence. His group counted more than 2,000 incidents against Jews nationally last year, the most since 1978. Last month, in the latest incident in Pennsylvania, a pig's head was stuck on the door of a synagogue in York, south of Harrisburg.
In the Allentown area, the hate-related incidents have been more vicious. In January, two Asian teen-agers, honor students from nearby Quakertown, made Molotov cocktails, dressed in military fatigues and firebombed the home of a white teen-ager who had insulted one of them. The mother of the white teen-ager was seriously injured when she leaped from the second floor of her home to escape the flames.
Even more worrisome to the authorities has been the growing number of skinheads who have been involved in especially brutal crimes. Before the Freeman killings, skinheads had been convicted of three murders in Pennsylvania and 30 others nationwide since 1987.
Last year, Mr. Morrison said, skinheads in Shamokin captured and buried up to its neck the dog of a white family that had opposed skinhead activity in the town. They filled the dog's mouth with firecrackers and blew its head off.
The motive for the killing of the Freeman family has perplexed the police. Before her slaying a week ago, Mrs. Freeman was desperately searching for help. Family members said the boys once tried to smother their mother with a pillow and another time pinned her down while one stood over her with a hatchet. Several students said this week that they heard the boys say they hated their parents and wanted to kill them. About two weeks ago, both had their foreheads tattooed. Bryan's tattoo said "Berzerker" after a skinhead rock group, and David's said "Seig Heil."
"Brenda Freeman called and said she was losing control of her boys and her household," Floyd Cochran, a former Aryan Nation spokesman and organizer in Idaho, said in an interview. "She said they went numerous times to Mark Thomas's compound with their cousin. These were emotionally disturbed kids. They were the kind of kids I used to recruit."

HEADLINE: Markets Are Holding Up Despite Dollar's Drops

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Unless the value of the dollar goes into a free fall against major currencies, economists and portfolio managers say they do not expect its latest bout of weakness to have much impact on prices in American financial markets.
That assessment would have been unthinkable during the latter 1980's, when Japanese investors financed a large chunk of the United States' soaring trade and budget deficits through purchases of everything from financial assets to real estate. In those days, bond traders looked at any prolonged period of dollar weakness against the yen with genuine alarm. 
"The slightest possibility of a tumble in the dollar would have caused a problem for financial markets" back then, said Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Lehman Brothers.
But times have changed, and the American stock and bond markets have not only withstood the downward pressure on the dollar, but flourished, to the amazement of some analysts.
"I don't understand how two-year Treasury notes can possibly be yielding 6.87 percent with the dollar collapsing," said David Buchen, a managing director at Citibank who is in charge of the bank's foreign exchange operations. "And I don't understand why, if people like marks so much, that 10-year German bonds are yielding about 7.35 percent while 10-year Treasuries are yielding just about the same thing. Asset markets and currency markets have been delinked."
Since December, when the latest round of dollar-selling began, bond yields have fallen and stocks have risen to new peaks in the United States. Meanwhile, markets in Germany and Japan, the big countries with the world's strongest currencies, have either languished or slumped.
Mr. Buchen and other analysts pin the dollar's recent slide on a number of developments.
"The currency markets didn't like Alan Greenspan suggesting last month that the Fed might be done raising rates," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Securities. "It doesn't like the deal the United States did to rescue Mexico. And political problems elsewhere in Europe have been pushing a lot of money into German marks."
But analysts say that a number of factors seem likely to protect American markets from feeling the sting of the dollar's slide.
Most important, the analysts say, is that the United States has become less dependent on one main source of foreign capital to finance its deficits. Over the last few years, Japan has been replaced by central banks from a range of newly industrialized countries, many of them Asian, whose currencies are linked to the dollar.
"In the 1980's, we needed the Japanese to finance the deficit; that is no longer the case," said Neal M. Soss of Soss & Cotton Enterprises, a New York money management firm. "We have different bankers now, who for a range of reasons seem pretty content to stay tied to the dollar. I would be much more concerned if the dollar were much weaker against emerging-market currencies."
Then, too, because of shifting trading patterns, Mr. Soss and other analysts said market fears of the inflationary effects of a weaker dollar were much less real now than before. The inflationary effect of a lower dollar would be much more profound if countries with strong currencies like Germany, Japan and Switzerland, were America's most important trading partners. They are not.
Indeed, Canada and Mexico, which last year ranked first and third, respectively, in terms of bilateral trade with the United States, have currencies far weaker than the dollar. Moreover, to maintain market share, foreign companies based in strong-currency countries have either squeezed profit margins drastically or moved operations to the United States.
All these factors, coupled with signs that the pace of economic expansion in the United States is slowing, make it very unlikely that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates to support the dollar.
"In a slowing economy, a falling dollar is a good thing," Mr. Sinai said, "because it helps boost exports and damps import demand."
And William H. Gross, a managing director at the Pacific Investment Management Company, a Newport Beach, Calif., money management firm with $60 billion in fixed-income assets under management, said the recent weakness in the dollar was a "negative for holders of long-term Treasuries, but not a negative for the overall level of interest rates."
Dollar-related jitters may rattle in the credit markets for a short while, said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. Despite near-term caution, Mr. Resler said he remained a fan of dollar-denominated financial assets.
"We were moving toward another month of improving prices and falling yields," he said. "But if I am a dollar-based investor, I want to keep my money invested in the U.S. stock and bond markets this year. Earnings look good, and interest rates will continue to come down as the economy continues to slow."

HEADLINE: The Clamor in Mexico: Sullied Name Stirs Salinas

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 5

 BODY:
Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is assured of a place in Mexican history, but the baffling events of the past week make it almost certain that it will not be the place he so desperately tried to attain.
Close friends of Mr. Salinas are puzzled by his recent actions, but they say that he has long been driven by a sense of destiny. That helps explain why he would take such unusual measures to defend his name, including breaking a long tradition of silence by former Presidents and undertaking a hunger strike. 
 In a brief interview inside the chilly cinder-block house in the northern city of Monterrey where he staged his 44-hour-fast, Mr. Salinas said he had stopped eating in order to defend his honor, just days after his brother was accused of having plotted a major political assassination.
"My decision is above all a moral one," he said, denying his action was intended to provoke his successor, President Ernesto Zedillo. Asked if he had confidence in Mr. Zedillo, he answered, "I have confidence in Mexico."
Specifically, he demanded that the federal Attorney General recognize that the Salinas administration had not tried to stand in the way of the investigation into the assassination last March of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the governing party's candidate who had been handpicked by Mr. Salinas. He also wanted to be publicly absolved of responsibility for having caused the economic crisis that now engulfs Mexico.
Mr. Salinas's threats deeply embarrassed Mr. Zedillo, who after just two days agreed to the conditions his predecessor had laid down. On Saturday night Mr. Salinas had a bowl of soup and ended his strike.
The bleak rooms in Monterrey were a world away from the imposing Legislative Palace in Mexico City where just over three months ago Mr. Salinas handed the red, white and green presidential sash and all the power it represents to President Zedillo.
At that time, Mr. Salinas seemed destined to accomplish his dream of being recognized as one of the most successful Mexican presidents, a bold reformer who had signed a free-trade agreement with the United States and Canada, who had restored Mexico's long-suspended relations with the Roman Catholic Church and who had undertaken significant reforms to make authoritarian Mexico more democratic.
The success of his anti-poverty program, Solidarity, was acknowledged around the world and he had the strong backing of the United States to become the first secretary general of the World Trade Organization. As he prepared to leave office, his staff delivered to reporters piles of books documenting his achievements.
"You have to understand that in the career of President Salinas there was not a single mistake or failure, almost from the beginning," said one Government official who worked with Mr. Salinas and who asked not to be identified. "He came from a very prominent family, he went to Harvard University, he came back to Mexico with a very high position and then had an uninterrupted string of success after success that led straight to the presidency of Mexico when he was just 40."
"It would be very difficult to detect a single point of rupture or failure in that career except for what happened since he left office," the official added. "Perhaps he was simply not prepared for it."
Another official who worked with Mr. Salinas said the former President "had no tolerance for failure."
Mr. Salinas's world changed abruptly just after dawn on Dec. 20 when the Zedillo administration announced that it had been forced to devalue the peso 15 percent, setting off a chain reaction that has plunged Mexico into an economic emergency for which most Mexicans, according to public opinion polls, blame Mr. Salinas. The devaluation also virtually destroyed his chances of heading the World Trade Organization.
Revelations by Mr. Zedillo's Attorney General that the investigation into Mr. Colosio's slaying had been manipulated raised suspicions that somehow Mr. Salinas's office had been involved.
Then last Tuesday came another crushing blow, when Mr. Salinas's elder brother, Raul, was arrested on charges of having ordered the murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary general of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI. Investigators now say that evidence implicating Raul Salinas was removed deliberately from official files during Carlos Salinas's administration.
Within minutes of the arrest, Mr. Salinas made a telephone call to a popular midday news program to defend his record. The call ended a tradition dating from the 1930's, in which former presidents silently accept public scorn to strengthen their successors. Jose Lopez Portillo, another former President, told a Mexican newspaper on Friday that the function of former Presidents consisted of "shutting up and not creating more problems for the next President."
Whether he believed Mr. Zedillo was attacking him personally, or simply that he was being accused unfairly, Mr. Salinas showed he was going to fight back. On Thursday night, he said he would not eat until the suspicions against him were proved to be unfounded.
In Mexico, hunger strikes are a common form of protest for everyone from aggrieved taxi drivers to Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the Catholic Bishop who recently fasted for peace in the troubled state of Chiapas.
Although he had been a master of the art of image during his term in office, Mr. Salinas failed to strike a convincing pose. The overwhelming reactions to his hunger strike were derision and total bafflement, especially after he suspended it Friday night and then resumed it briefly on Saturday.
Friends of the former President say that in the last year Mr. Salinas lost nearly all his closest allies, beginning with Mr. Colosio. The political turbulence of 1994 forced other confidants to either flee the country or retire from public life, leaving Mr. Salinas without a trusted sounding board. After public opinion turned against him, other friends and associates abandoned him.
When Mr. Salinas showed up in Monterrey in the dark hours of early Friday morning searching for a place to stage his hunger strike, he was accompanied only by a bodyguard.
Negotiations with an emissary from Mr. Zedillo had resulted in a public statement by the federal Attorney General exonerating the former President in the Colosio investigation, and a promise from Mr. Zedillo to clarify the actions taken last December in handling the economy. Mr. Salinas ended his hunger strike Saturday night.
After six years in office, Mr. Salinas's legacy is evident all over Mexico. The thousands of streets that were paved with Solidarity money and miles of highways built by private investors remind millions of Mexicans of his vision.
But which of Mr. Salinas's many images will survive? The neighborhood where he staged his brief hunger strike was a garbage dump until Solidarity money built houses and paved streets. But now, just months after he left office, even the painted Solidarity signs around the corner from the house where Mr. Salinas slept for two uneasy nights are already beginning to fade.

The original design for the project created a landscaped corridor with a new 1,000-room hotel, amusements and retail pavilions reaching from a state-financed $254 million convention center, under construction at the eastern end of the Atlantic City Expressway, to the casino district on the boardwalk and ocean five blocks away. Weedy lots and dilapidated buildings -- the first things a visitor to the island resort now sees -- would be eliminated in the corridor, and hopes were riding high that these improvements would encourage private investment in adjoining downtrodden neighborhoods. 
 All the key players -- casino operators, state and city officials -- appeared to embrace the idea after it was introduced in 1993, when there was confidence that $500 million in public and private financing was available.
But now there are complaints that casino operators are acting to limit the scope of the project by opposing key features that moved tourists and conventioneers farther away from their own casinos and hotels.
Hired to mastermind the project was one of the nation's most respected urban tourist planners, the Rouse Company of Columbia, Md., developer of the South Street Seaport in New York, Faneuil Hall in Boston and Harborplace in Baltimore.
But cracks developed both in the plan and the spirit of cooperation after two hard-driving casino operators were appointed last summer to the board of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, the public agency that oversees the corridor project.
This month the debate over the project escalated from squabbling to accusations that the new board members, Arthur M. Goldberg, chairman of Bally Entertainment Corporation, and Nicholas L. Ribis, who runs the three Trump casinos in Atlantic City, were acting together to sabotage the project and advance their own interests.
Mayor James Whelan, who also sits on the board, was one of those raising questions about whether the pair's actions constituted a conflict of interest.
"There are a lot of strong-willed folks on the board now and they aren't shy about articulating their views," the Mayor said.
"Things have reached a point where it's easy to throw up one's hands and call it a disaster," he added. "We can't allow the hotel to go down the drain. If it does, the state will have wasted $250 million for a new convention center that will be left sitting out in the middle of nowhere."
Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Ribis said their major complaint is that private financing for the entertainment complex and the convention headquarters hotel was inadequate. Their only motive in raising these issues, they said, was to impose some restraints on a project that had grown too ambitious for the money stream available to underwrite it.
But Mr. Goldberg, in particular, drew fire when he disclosed several weeks ago that Bally had purchased the vacant property next door to its Park Place casino for $7.5 million and planned to spend another $150 million to add 60,000 square feet of gambling space and build its own "entertainment center." It was the same land that the development authority had paid Rouse some $1 million to study as the site for Monopoly Square, which was to be the corridor's main retail and amusement attraction, based on the board game.
That same day, at a development authority meeting, Mr. Goldberg ridiculed Rouse officials as "clowns" and persuaded the board to suspend payments to the company. In addition, the 13-member board delayed the start of work on the hotel, which had already been scaled back to 500 rooms to cut costs. Some said the delay would hold up the hotel's opening at least six months after the convention center's scheduled completion in early 1997.
Another wrinkle was added when Mr. Goldberg approached Original Ventures, a small development planner little known in a field dominated by Rouse, encouraging it to propose the conversion of the city's existing boardwalk convention hall into a multi-level entertainment attraction and huge indoor wading pool. The old structure, best known as the site of the Miss America Pageant, is flanked by two Trump properties, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, and Trump Regency Hotel, and has figured in Rouse's plans.
Rouse Company officials said they were perplexed by criticism that the company was moving too slowly.
"We've met every scheduled deadline and the C.R.D.A. has been informed of every step taken," said Robert Minutoli, a Rouse senior vice president in charge of the Atlantic City project. "Any periods of delay have occurred when the ball was in the court of the public sector."
While saying Rouse "would never attribute ill will toward anyone or call anyone names," Mr. Minutoli defended his company's reputation and said the current crisis was the product of "posturing" by individuals "advancing what they think best for various constituencies."
"I still believe we will sort out the issues," Mr. Minutoli said. "Our plan may be changed and others may change their minds, but we can still work something out."
James Kennedy, C.R.D.A. executive director, said Mr. Goldberg informed the authority on Feb. 24 that he will recuse himself on any further matters involving Rouse, Monopoly Square and boardwalk development. "Our counsel tells us he is not legally obligated to refrain from voting on these matters but Mr. Goldberg says that will be his position from now on," Mr. Kennedy said.
The authority director also said Mr. Goldberg has personally assured him that he will not stand in the way of the hotel project and that it will be built once private financing is secured.
Thomas Scannapieco, a partner in the group selected to build the convention headquarters hotel, said he questioned the sincerity of the assertions by Mr. Ribis and Mr. Goldberg that they used their positions of public trust only to assure sound financing in the corridor.
"The board members leading the opposition to the hotel are the same whose casinos would be the disproportionate beneficiaries of every dollar diverted from it that goes into entertainment dollars invested near the boardwalk at their casinos," he said in a telephone interview.
The development agency was formed by the Legislature in the administration of Gov. Thomas H. Kean to redirect some of the money earned by the casinos into urban renewal projects, especially in their home base of Atlantic City. Since the inception of casino gambling in New Jersey in 1978, the casinos have paid the state an 8 percent tax on gross revenues. That tax has gone into programs to help the elderly and disabled. The development agency took another 1.25 percent bite for bonds that would be redeemable by the casinos far in the future, and set a $2 casino parking fee to help offset the cost of the corridor.
As bond interest rates climbed, and projections of parking revenues fell, the project was reduced in scope to about half its original estimated cost of more than $500 million.
Mr. Ribis and Mr. Goldberg said they had no intention of killing off the headquarters hotel to steer conventioneers to their own rooms. It will be built, they said, even if they have to fund it themeselves.
"This controversy came about because of the perception that the casinos are trying to stop something," said Mr. Ribis, who several years ago led an unsuccessful effort to locate the new convention hall closer to the boardwalk. "But the reality is that it's our money going into the corridor. At the moment there's not enough private money to do all the things people want."
At the very least, the recent bickering, coming after so much talk of harmony, has disillusioned people who thought Atlantic City was finally on the road to becoming more than a fiefdom for casino owners.

HEADLINE: A U.S. Look For Lessons In Barings

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

DATELINE: CORAL GABLES, Fla., March 5

 BODY:
Whether the failure of Barings P.L.C. was a regrettable but instructive accident or a sign of a growing weakness in the world's financial system was the subject of an uneasy debate this weekend by regulators, financiers and academicians who gathered here for an annual Federal Reserve conference on markets.
The Barings collapse, involving losses of $1 billion from speculation about the direction of the Japanese stock and bond markets, followed precisely a script that had been the biggest worry of many regulators: a trader careens out of control and in a matter of weeks loses enough money to bankrupt a major financial firm. 
 While the demise of Barings has not led to a cascading disaster that many have feared, the regulators were still concerned that the financial system had been tested so much in the last year. The Barings disaster was preceded by the insolvency of Orange County, Calif., and the sudden and unexpectedly large losses at banks, corporations and even mutual funds from various innovative financial deals.
What disturbed regulators most was not the knowledge that such huge losses could occur -- that has been clear for some time as derivatives and myriad other financial innovations have developed -- but that seemingly well-managed firms had handled them in ways that seemed preventable.
"In most, not all, of the cases, the problems involved individuals and institutions that by any rule of reason, were probably quite sophisticated," said E. Gerald Corrigan, the chairman of Goldman, Sachs International Advisers, and the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "Yet they appear to have forgotten the elementary relationship between risk and reward. If you see a 16 percent instrument in an 8 percent market, something has to tell you it's not right."
This is by no means a new observation. Derivatives are side bets, contracts whose cash value changes with some underlying market like stock prices or interest rates. As government and industry groups have studied derivatives, they have uniformly concluded that their use is essentially no riskier than investing in the underlying stocks or bonds themselves, except for the matter of speed. Derivatives can turbocharge an ordinary investment portfolio in the same way that a new V-8 can help a jalopy.
"The one thing the Barings episode illustrates," said Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, "is the productivity for making losses has gone up very significantly in the last 25 years. You couldn't write the execution slips fast enough 25 years ago to lose as much money as was lost by one individual, aided by terrific technology."
The speed, flexibility and low cost of derivatives is often useful to investors and corporations navigating the world's rocky markets, and it would probably be counterproductive -- not to mention nearly impossible -- to ban technological innovation.
As a result, Mr. Greenspan and other regulators around the world have argued that the proper response to derivatives is the rough equivalent of driver safety education. They have repeatedly urged banks and brokers that sell derivatives -- and their customers -- to keep a close eye on where they are driving with derivatives and not to go so fast that they would be hurt if forced to make a sudden stop.
The appropriate control procedures are well established, and Barings, the oldest member of London's financial establishment, knew full well that it was not considered proper practice to have one person in charge of both trading and accounting for the trades. Yet Nicholas W. Leeson, the 28-year-old trader blamed for losing the $1 billion by trading futures in Singapore, was apparently assigned both tasks.
One explanation for this stunning lack of controls is stinginess in management, said Richard C. Breeden, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who is now the head of the financial services practice at Coopers & Lybrand. "Most chief executives can't spend enough on traders and trading systems, because these add to their bottom line, but they see controls as overhead to be cut. It's like building a car with a very powerful engine, but no brakes."
Regulators -- including the Bank of England, which looked after Barings -- try to conduct the financial equivalent of brake inspections, auditing internal controls of all sorts. Clearly, it was not enough.
Yet some regulators see instructive value in the Barings demise, arguing that such an event every now and then provides useful warnings of the dangers of excess.
Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency, who oversees national banks, quoted what he called a bank regulators' prayer: "God, let there be a failure, but a small one."
Barings, he said, "wasn't a small one, but the effect was salutary."
Not everyone was so sanguine.
"It's nice to see that when some failures occur, the system has been resilient," said Steven M. H. Wallman, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission. "On the other hand, one has to wonder if there are more and more failures occurring, is there something to be concerned about?"
Mr. Wallman said he was concerned about the effect of such collapses on public confidence. "There is a psychological ripple effect to the failure of a firm involved with retail investors," he said. "It is important for people investing to feel secure about the financial system in this country."
But no one at the conference offered any concrete suggestions.
"There aren't any easy answers," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "It's not obvious that just because there is a problem there is a solution."
So regulators were left again with little more to do than urge bankers not to give the car keys to joy riders.
"The gut feel of the 55-year-old trader," Mr. Greenspan said, "is more important than the mathematical elegance of the 25-year-old genius."
To which Mr. Corrigan added, "The one thing we need more of, to put it succinctly, is gray hair."

HEADLINE: Law Lets Midwives Supervise Only Low-Risk Cases

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The increasing use of midwives at many public hospitals in New York City comes as there is renewed interest in the age-old profession across the country. Their focus on the most natural and least invasive methods of childbirth is attractive to women who are put off by the more clinical approach of some doctors.
They have become popular among some healthy, young middle-class women who can expect uneventful pregnancies and deliveries that are not likely to require the technology available in modern maternity wards. 
 Administrators in New York's public hospitals say they believe their patients are more comfortable with midwives, who are almost all women and more likely to be from minority groups than are obstetricians. As a result, the patients may be more likely to seek and continue prenatal care.
The appeal of midwives is also economic. Midwives at public hospitals are paid an average of $61,000 a year, while obstetricians receive about $150,000, so the hospitals can hire more midwives and assign them to spend more time with each patient.
Only certified nurse-midwives are allowed to practice in New York. They are registered nurses who have graduate degrees in midwifery and pass a national certification test. Of the 500 midwives registered in New York State, a quarter work in the city's public hospitals, where they handle 22 percent of the deliveries. In private hospitals, midwives handle about 5 percent of the deliveries.
Although midwives have delivered babies in New York for centuries, it was not until 1992 that the Legislature established midwifery as a separate profession with its own licensing board. The law gave midwives the right to prescribe certain drugs and order laboratory tests, and required them to work in consultation with physicians.
A woman whose pregnancy and delivery are handled by a midwife may never see a physician. But midwives, both in private practice and in hospitals, must work under formal guidelines arranged with obstetricians. And by law, midwives are allowed to manage only the "normal pregnancies" of "essentially healthy women."
But the 1992 law and its predecessors do not define those terms. As a result, there is a wide range of opinion about the types of patients midwives should be handling, as well as who should be classified as "high risk" and beyond the expertise of midwives.
"The term 'high risk' is totally misused," said Dr. Patricia Burkhardt, associate clinical professor of midwifery at New York University, who helped draft the law. "It's not the same as a complicated history."
For instance, a woman who developed diabetes during one pregnancy could be managed by a midwife in another pregnancy, she said, as long as the diabetes does not recur. The fact that a woman may have a statistical risk of developing a complication should not disqualify her from the care of a midwife, said Dr. Burkhardt, who has a doctorate in public health.
As midwives have grown in popularity, tension has developed between them and some doctors, who fear that midwives may take on cases they are not trained to handle.
Dr. Kenneth J. Leveno, the director of obstetrics at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, said he often found himself at odds with midwives who take on complex cases.
"It's sort of like putting a pilot who flies a Piper Cub in a 747," said Dr. Leveno, an author of Williams Obstetrics, a reference book widely used by doctors. "When patients get into the airplane, they need to be told who's in the pilot's seat." Midwives are important, he said, "but they need to be part of a team that has a 747 pilot."
Some midwives say that doctors' fears are misplaced and that sometimes doctors don't want to spend the time necessary to deal with troublesome -- and bothersome -- patients, leaving them to be treated by midwives. This is particularly true at public hospitals, Dr. Burkhardt said.
"When patients are complicated," she said, "the doctors don't want to bother with them."

HEADLINE: Europeans Devalue 2 Currencies

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Monday, March 6

 BODY:
In a move expected to doom efforts to create a single European currency in the next few years, finance officials of the European Union agreed at an emergency meeting early this morning to devalue the Spanish and Portuguese currencies against those of eight other European countries.
The two Iberian currencies have come under enormous pressure as concerns about Spanish politics, and the broad global uncertainty about the Mexican financial crisis and the recent collapse of the British investment bank Barings P.L.C., have led investors to turn to German marks in a search for a safe haven. 
 The uneasiness in the foreign-exchange markets has extended to the dollar, which fell this morning to a postwar low of 92.95 yen in Tokyo trading, before rising in late trading to 93.40, still down from its close in New York on Friday of 94.14 yen.
The dollar's plunge came despite large purchases of dollars on Friday by the Federal Reserve of the United States, the Bank of Japan, the Bundesbank of Germany and several other European central banks -- and despite an additional intervention by the Bank of Japan this morning.
But unless the dollar goes into a free fall, American economists and portfolio managers say they do not expect its bout of weakness to have much impact on United States financial markets. [Page D4.]
Economists said the dollar's slide reflected investors' nervousness about the Fed's willingness to fight inflation, as well as other issues.
The lack of confidence in some currencies and the deep differences in the economic strength of many European countries have created the third wrenching of the European monetary system in three years.
After their 11-hour meeting in Brussels ended early this morning, the finance ministers announced a 7 percent devaluation of Spain's peseta and a 3.5 percent devaluation of Portugal's escudo. The decision would seem to make it impossible to stabilize and align Europe's leading currencies into a single currency within the next two years, as called for under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, and almost impossible to achieve the goal by the end of the century.
"If anyone was still around believing that monetary union was possible by 1997, here is a glaring example of divergence that still exists between European countries and why monetary union is so impractical," said Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt.
Economists argue that monetary union will significantly reduce the costs to businesses of dealing in multiple fluctuating currencies; politicians see it as a way to bring the union's members closer together politically.
Under the concept of monetary union, member countries would impose on themselves nearly identical fiscal disciplines in a preliminary step toward a single European currency. In the Maastricht Treaty, members agreed not to have budget deficits of more than 3 percent of gross domestic product or accumulated debt levels exceeding 60 percent of G.D.P. Without meeting such guidelines, a country cannot enter monetary union.
But Germany and the tiny country of Luxembourg are the only countries now able to meet those strict tests. Moreover, with a significant break in currency stability occurring in Europe about once a year, economists say it is difficult to foresee monetary union anytime soon.
Throughout Sunday evening, as the representatives of finance ministries and central banks of the 15 European Union countries met behind closed doors, speculation was high that Spain and Portugal might even drop out of the currency system, which establishes limits that restrain the relative value of the currencies. Ten of the 15 member countries of the union participate in the currency system.
On Friday, the peseta fell almost to the lower limit of its permissible trading band, closing at 88.43 to the German mark, 3.5 pesetas away from its floor against the mark of 91.91. Portugal, whose economy is closely linked to that of Spain, had also seen its currency hit by traders.
The devaluation was the fourth in two and a half years for the peseta and the third for the escudo.
Though Spain has kept inflation under control, it has been very slow to privatize Government-controlled businesses and to eliminate the enormous costs of Government employment and social programs, creating a large budget deficit. That deficit, and recent accusations that the Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez financed a covert war against Spanish terrorists, have weakened confidence in Spain's ability to keep up with economic stalwarts like Germany.
In a communique issued by the ministers, Spain promised to limit its current budget deficit to no more than 5.9 percent of its gross domestic product.
"Structural reform to improve the efficiency of the economy will be a high priority, including privatization of public enterprises and labor market reform," the communique said of Spain's promised improvements. "The Spanish Government will evaluate labor market reforms adopted in 1994 and will determine whether further measures are needed."
The Maastricht Treaty says that if a majority of the 15 countries meet the economic standards by the end of 1996, they can create a single currency beginning in 1997. If there is no majority, the countries that meet the requirements can form a monetary union two years later. But economists say it is unlikely that a majority will meet the 1997 deadline, or that a significant number will do so by 1999.
Indeed, Europe's recent history of currency instability has been fraught with failed attempts to maintain artificial price ranges for currencies and as divergent economic realities in the countries send currencies in different directions.
In 1992, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed, international turmoil forced both the British and Italian Governments to pull their currencies from the European Monetary System.
A year later, currency traders again tested the narrow trading limits set by European monetary officials. And again the system broke down. Officials were forced to greatly widen the parameters, to permit a 15 percent swing in value for any one currency, from swings of between 2.25 percent and 6 percent.
In addition to the peseta and escudo, the other currencies now in the system are the German mark, the French franc, the Belgian franc, the Luxembourg franc, the Dutch guilder, the Austrian shilling, the Irish pound and the Danish krone.
But weak currencies are not the only problem for the grid and, by extension, a future monetary union. Some currencies, especially the German mark, are seen as too strong.
Indeed, as investors have worried about recent developments in Mexico and at Barings, there has been a flight to safety in the German mark, which has been setting new postwar highs weekly against a basket of 18 world currencies.
Because of the Bundesbank's almost impeccable record on using interest rates to stop inflation, the mark is now the preferred global currency for those seeking safety amid uncertainty.
And economists were predicting further flight to safety by investors, saying that in addition to pressure on the dollar, there would also be pressure on the currencies of Italy and France because of problems of rising budget deficits in those countries.
The Bank of Japan confirmed that it was buying dollars early this morning to prop up the currency. The bank said it injected 300 billion yen, or about $2.8 billion, in early trading to support the dollar.
Analysts argued that there was little at this point to argue for buying dollars, since the latest statements by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, indicated that the Fed thought the economy might have peaked and that it saw little reason to push interest rates any higher.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Propose Using a Work Requirement to Help Cut Food Stamp Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
House Republicans said today that they wanted to cut $16.5 billion from the food stamp program over the next five years by establishing strict new work requirements for recipients and by trimming the growth in benefits.
The proposal represents a fundamental shift in the design of the program, which serves as the ultimate safety net for more than 27 million poor Americans. 
 It is one piece of a huge bill intended to free poor people from dependence on Government while vastly increasing the power of state officials to run their own welfare programs free of Federal supervision. Democrats say the overall bill is cruel to women and children because it would, for example, scrap the national school lunch program and give the money to the states as well as bar the use of Federal money to provide cash assistance to unmarried teen-agers.
The food stamp proposal would cut $16.5 billion, or 11 percent, from the $149 billion that would otherwise be spent on food stamps in the next five years.
The Republican plan would require hundreds of thousands of able-bodied adults without children to find work within 90 days of getting food stamps. It would also reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment for food stamp recipients, which provides additional benefits to match increases in food costs.
Republicans say the changes are needed to control the cost of the program. Democrats call the proposed cutbacks Draconian, and they say the work requirement would end benefits for many people who are unable to find jobs.
More than 27 million people receive food stamps, up from 20 million in 1990. The economy has improved significantly in the last few years, and unemployment has fallen. But the number of people on the food stamp rolls keeps rising, as does the cost of the program, $25 billion last year.
The Republican plan, to be considered this week by the House Agriculture Committee, is likely to win approval in the full House. The outlook in the Senate is less clear.
Under the plan, food stamp spending would still rise from year to year. But recipients could not buy as much with their coupons because the monthly food stamp allotment would not keep pace with inflation.
Food stamps are described as the ultimate safety net because eligibility is based almost entirely on a person's income and assets. Single people and childless couples with low incomes can get food stamps but usually cannot get cash benefits under other Federal welfare programs like Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
The new proposal supplements a Republican plan, already modified several times, that would give states the option of running their own food assistance programs in place of food stamps. States choosing that option would get a lump sum of Federal money roughly equal to the value of their food stamp benefits in 1994, with no adjustment for inflation in food prices.
But the Federal Government would still set policy for the national food stamp program. And the Republican plan says that able-bodied food stamp recipients from 18 to 50 years old "will be required to find work."
"These persons will be ineligible for food stamps after three months unless they are employed at least 20 hours per week or are participating in a workfare program," it says.
In workfare programs, people must do public service work in return for food stamp benefits. But the Republican proposal would not require states to operate such programs or provide money for them. Only a half-dozen states have workfare for food stamp recipients, and the programs are all small, with fewer than 100,000 participants nationwide.
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who was head of the Food and Nutrition Service in the Carter Administration, said, "These proposals would eliminate the only part of the safety net that remains for large numbers of indigent people who receive no other Government assistance."
The bill, he said, "would end food stamp benefits after just three months for hundreds of thousands of people who wanted to work and searched for jobs but couldn't find them."
The current food stamp program does have a work provision. It generally requires food stamp recipients to search for jobs, to accept training and to take any jobs they can find, but it does not require people actually to have jobs.
The whole question of work requirements for welfare recipients has generated intense conflict between Democrats and Republicans. House Democratic leaders attacked other parts of the Republican welfare bill, saying that those portions should have much more stringent requirements that people work as a condition of receiving cash assistance. At the same time, the Democrats demanded money to pay for education, training, child care and work programs, and in general they would not deny benefits to people who are willing to work but unable to find jobs. The Republican food stamp proposal would impose the new work requirements without the additional money.
Under the Republican proposal, Congress would set an annual limit on food stamp spending. The Republicans would deny food stamps to most legal immigrants for at least five years. After that, immigrants could get food stamps only if they applied for United States citizenship.
A pervasive theme of the Republican proposal is to reduce or eliminate adjustments in food stamp benefits that reflect rising costs of food, shelter and other necessities. The bill would freeze the shelter deduction and the standard deduction allowed to food stamp recipients. Such deductions are used in computing household income. Families with more deductions get more benefits.
Food stamp allotments are increased each year to reflect changes in the price of a low-cost diet known as the thrifty food plan. The Republican proposal says, "The annual increase in the thrifty food plan will be curtailed." The amount of the cutback has not been decided. It will be set at whatever level is needed to help lawmakers achieve their overall goal of $16.5 billion in savings over five years.
The food stamp bill is part of an ambitious Republican effort to limit the growth of welfare spending and free poor people from dependence on Government. Other House committees are working on legislation to transform school lunch, child nutrition and cash assistance programs. Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia says he will package the measures in one big bill to be considered by the full House this month.
The original Contract With America, the Republicans' 1994 campaign manifesto, would have replaced all Federal food assistance programs, including food stamps, with a block grant. States could have used the money in any way they wanted to feed low-income people. Republicans on the House Agriculture Committee rejected that idea.
The lawmakers, from farm states, made this argument: If poor people receive cash instead of food stamps, there is no guarantee that the money will be spent on food. Sales of milk, pork, wheat and other commodities will decline, and the potential for fraud and other abuse may increase.
Groups involved with preventing hunger joined farm lobbyists in urging Congress to keep food stamps as a Federal program with uniform national eligibility criteria and benefits.
But several Republican governors demanded that House Republican leaders keep the promise made in the Contract With America. The governors, led by Gov. John Engler of Michigan, said they could run food assistance programs better than the Federal Government and wanted to coordinate food aid with other welfare benefits.
In a partial reversal, House leaders agreed to let states run their own food assistance programs if they replaced food stamp coupons with a system of "electronic benefits transfer." That system helps investigators detect fraud because it makes an electronic record of every transaction in which a person uses Federal money to buy groceries.

HEADLINE: Why Microsoft and Justice Dept. Settled

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Microsoft Back in the Dock" (editorial, Feb. 20) reflects an apparent misunderstanding of the antitrust investigation of Microsoft. The phrase "in the dock" refers to a holding area in British courts for people accused of criminal conduct. This is a civil, not criminal case. 
 Both the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department have sweeping powers and formidable resources to collect and marshal evidence and to apply law and economic principles to that evidence to determine if there is a reasonable basis for an antitrust claim against a target company.
During a four-year investigation, the Government received information, both documents and testimony, covering potential allegations from Microsoft and dozens of third parties. It analyzed the evidence and negotiated a consent decree based primarily on allegations regarding Microsoft's licensing practices.
The Justice Department negotiated about licensing practices because, as Assistant Attorney General Anne K. Bingaman stated in court, that was the only case she thought she could prove. Although Microsoft did not violate antitrust laws, we were willing to accommodate the Government's concerns in the licensing allegations to end the investigation and avoid protracted and expensive litigation.
Under the Tunney Act, designed to insure against influence peddling in antitrust investigations and negotiations, the judiciary reviews the consent decree to determine that it provides adequate relief for the concerns in the Government's complaint. To require the Justice Department to reveal its entire investigation would discourage target companies from agreeing to a consent decree, denying the Government a principal tool of enforcement.
To second-guess whether a regulatory agency should have pursued other allegations than those in its complaint is an unjustified invasion of the executive branch's prosecutorial discretion. If private parties disagree with the Government's decision, they are free to commence a private action.
Other allegations were raised in a book about Microsoft that the judge read on vacation and relied upon during his deliberations. Similar allegations were reiterated by the 11th-hour third parties in these proceedings. However, the Justice Department represented to the court that it could not make a case on those allegations.
The trial court's decision is before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. It is Microsoft's hope that upon full judicial review, the consent decree will be entered, a result you seemed to anticipate in a July 21, 1994, editorial that extolled the consent decree.

HEADLINE: Chinese Leader Says 'Mistakes' By Government Fueled Inflation

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 5

 BODY:
Prime Minister Li Peng acknowledged today that "mistakes" made "at all levels" of his Government had allowed inflation to reach its highest point since Communist rule began in 1949 and that this increase last year had "aroused great resentment among the masses."
The declaration, in Mr. Li's opening address to this year's National People's Congress, appeared to lay the groundwork for an overall retrenchment of the economic reform program that was begun by Deng Xiaoping in 1979. 
 It may have also set the stage for long-rumored personnel changes that would dilute the power of Zhu Rongji, the Vice Prime Minister who has overseen economic policy since assuming control of the central bank in 1993.
Speaking to 2,811 deputies gathered in the Great Hall of the People, Mr. Li reported that overall inflation reached 21.7 percent in 1994, a rate that was double the level he pledged to maintain a year ago.
Consumer price inflation, the main indicator of the effects of price increases on Chinese citizens, was 24.1 percent. The prices of many basic foods and grains, however, increased by 60 percent.
The last peak in consumer prices was in 1988, when inflation reached 19 percent and contributed to an outpouring of popular anger toward the Government during the democracy protests of the following spring. Since then, consumer inflation had been a negligible factor in the economy, reaching 3 percent in 1991 and 5 percent in 1992 until the rate rose to 13 percent in 1993.
"Practice has proven that in a Socialist market economy, the Government must carry out necessary regulation and management in pricing for the major commodities, which have a great bearing on the national economy and on the people's livelihood," Mr. Li said.
At the same time, he said, while economic reform will continue, it will come under greater control.
The United States Ambassador, J. Stapleton Roy was among the foreign diplomats who attended today's session and he said, "My instant analysis is that they are more focused on domestic issues than they were last year."
In addition to inflation, the issues of crime, corruption and a decline in agricultural output dominated the Prime Minister's address. Of all the concerns that have seized the generation of leaders who will succeed Mr. Deng, inflation and corruption are pre-eminent. Mr. Li said combatting corruption was a "matter of life and death for our nation."
But his exhortations to greater vigilance against corruption were focused on local party officials, not the ranks of senior party officials and military officers where corruption is believed to be endemic.
His emphasis on "mistakes" in economic management seemed aimed at Mr. Zhu, whose power over the economy has vaulted him above Mr. Li in influence at times over the last two years.
Mr. Li's case was simple. He said price liberalization measures and a weak harvest had sent prices of many commodities soaring, but that "the mistake we made was that we had underestimated the repercussions of these measures."
"The Government took no emergency measures to stop these practices and launched no overall austerity program," he said, because some officials were trying to "prevent a sharp decrease in economic growth."
China's economy grew at 11.8 percent in 1994, compared with the 9 percent Mr. Li had sought. His comments implied that a timely austerity program could have headed off inflation and brought growth down to a manageable level.
Mr. Zhu, seated two rows behind Mr. Li during the speech, held his posture ramrod straight, never glancing at the text of the speech before him, while other vice prime ministers scribbled and underlined the document.
During his speech, Mr. Li said China would seek to slow its economic growth rate of 12 to 13 percent of the last three years to 8 to 9 percent.
The central Government plans to slow the pace of investment, and reduce the number of national construction efforts so that financing can be made available for major projects that are already under way, like the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, the largest hydroelectric project in the world.
The annual session of the congress gives the 53 million members of the Communist Party the opportunity to display its strength, with delegates from every province and from each of China's 55 minority groups. But the body itself lacks any real legislative powers and serves to ratify the decisions made by the party's 170-member Central Committee, whose chairman is President Jiang Zemin, the party's general secretary.
Five years ago, Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress and a member of the Politburo, was considered a contender to succeed Mr. Deng as paramount leader but was edged out by Mr. Jiang and has since lost other important party posts.
Mr. Li's power in the inner circle comes from his long association with the conservative wing of the party, whose most hard-line members have begun to grumble that Mr. Deng's economic reforms have created such destructive forces as unemployment, inflation and corruption.
At the same time, Mr. Li's health has declined. A heart attack in early 1993 removed him from leadership responsibilities for four months, and Mr. Li has reportedly been working less to conserve his energy.
Today, minutes after he began speaking, a page quietly brought a chair to the rear of the broad wooden podium so Mr. Li could discreetly support himself during the speech.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the opening of the National People's Congress in Beijing referred incorrectly in some editions to recent rates of Chinese inflation. Inflation, a major concern of the congress, last peaked in 1988, not 1989; the rate then was 19 percent, not 17.5.

HEADLINE: Subway Bomb Suspect in Lineup

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
The suspect in a subway firebombing, Edward J. Leary, was identified in a police lineup yesterday by 12 of 17 people, some of whom were on the train that was firebombed last December, his new lawyer said.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Leary made an unscheduled appearance in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, where he was ordered by Justice Rena Uviller to shave his beard for the lineup so that he appeared the way he did on the day of the firebombing. He and 47 other people were injured on Dec. 21, when a car on a No. 4 train erupted into flames in the Fulton Street station in lower Manhattan. 
 Mr. Leary, a 49-year-old unemployed computer technician, also appeared in court to confirm a request by his wife to change lawyers from Stephen G. Murphy to Ira D. London.
Mr. London, the new president of the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, received widespread attention defending Joel Steinberg, who was sentenced in 1989 to eight and a third to 25 years on a reduced conviction of first-degree manslaughter in the death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg, whom he had raised.
He accompanied Mr. Leary, who had grown a scraggly beard while recovering in the hospital, to transit police headquarters in Brooklyn, where the lineup was held.
Mr. Leary is accused of carrying jars with flammable liquid attached to a timer onto the train.

HEADLINE: Stocks Recover From a Blow by the Dollar

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
At first, the battered dollar dragged down the stock market yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average plunging as much as 34 points in the first 15 minutes of trading.
Nervous currency traders turned to stronger foreign currencies, like the German mark, lessening the value of dollar-denominated assets, like stocks. Bond prices fell, and long-term interest rates rose. 
 "The biggest bang for your buck was in the mark," Kevin J. Lawrie, foreign exchange manager for the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said.
Still, the Dow rebounded strongly, closing at 3,997.56 points, up 7.95 points, and the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, rose 0.21 point, to 485.63. Analysts said, however, that the rebounds on both indexes are misleading.
Shares of the Walt Disney Company accounted for six points of the Dow's rise. Oil stocks, after a favorable article in the financial weekly Barron's, also rose, accounting for most of the jump in the S.& P. 500.
The rest of the market was down. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 1.02 points, to 797.77. On the New York Stock Exchange, almost two stocks fell for every one that rose, with 785 gaining and 1,453 declining.
What has happened since the Dow broke the 4,000-point level and set a high of 4,011.74 just nine days ago on Feb. 24? Analysts say not much, as far as the performance of the American economy. Inflation is low, growth is moderate and corporate earnings are surprisingly strong.
But expectations by all financial markets about the near future have changed because of currency traders' sudden nervousness.
The dollar has fallen sharply since March 1, establishing postwar lows as it falls. The dollar closed yesterday in New York at 92.69 Japanese yen, down from 94.14 yen. The devaluation of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo yesterday did not help, because the resulting flight to German marks further buckled the dollar and hurt bonds.
The proximate cause is Mexico, where political scandal, civil unrest and uneven economic performance have upset the expectations of its partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States and Canada.
It also did not help that Federal Reserve officials last week seemed to indicate that economic concerns were more important than defending the dollar. Traders then viewed last week's $3 billion intervention by the Treasury and the central banks of Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Sweden as half-hearted.
And adding to the anxiety were market rumors that Japanese investors were repatriating billions of dollars in investments not only for accounting purposes when the Japanese fiscal year ends March 30, but also to rebuild the earthquake-damaged regions around Kobe.
The Dow has gained 4.25 percent this year in terms of dollars, but fallen 2.63 percent in terms of yen and dropped an even worse 5.43 percent in marks.
Shares of the 3Com Corporation, a maker of computer networking products, rose 3, to 57 3/4, after a Paine Webber analyst said that the company's earnings in the third quarter ended Feb. 28 would be better than expected. Xcellenet shares rose 2 3/4, to 29, after the AT& T Corporation chose an Xcellenet software product as part of its "Virtual Workplace" program of approved products and services.
Class A shares of the National Western Life Insurance Company fell 3 to 33, after its fourth-quarter earnings fell to $1.08 a share from $5.25. Harley-Davidson shares fell 2 7/8 to 24, after posting fewer sales for recreational vehicles.
Auto stocks fell after analysts began to question the 1995 profitability of the Big Three. Stock in the Chrysler Corporation, for example, hit a 52-week low of 39 7/8 a share, down 7/8.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
DOLLAR CONTINUES TO PLUNGE AS U.S. PONDERS STRATEGY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
The dollar plunged more than 1 percent today to a new post-World-War-II low against the Japanese yen and briefly touched a historic low against the German mark as the currency accelerated a decline that began in the middle of last month.
The dollar's weakness is clearly worrying the Clinton Administration, as demonstrated by the effort it led on Friday, when more than a dozen central banks bought dollars in currency markets to try to support the value of the currency. But that coordinated effort failed. And as officials scramble for a strategy that would revive the dollar without running the risk of tipping the American economy into a recession, they appear to be running out of palatable options. 
 The recent plunge seems to have been driven by an odd melange of concerns. One is that the Administration will get sucked deeper into Mexico's crisis, which worsened today as the peso fell to its lowest point against the dollar since the crisis began in December. [Page D1.]
Fear that the Mexican crisis could spread to the rest of Latin America is also weighing on the dollar. In addition, there is some concern that the failure of the balanced-budget amendment in the Senate last week presages continuing huge deficits.
But the solution that the markets appeared to be demanding, another increase in interest rates to lure foreign investors to buy dollars again, is fraught with economic and political problems for the Federal Reserve and the White House.
In past sharp declines in the dollar -- most recently, in June -- the Fed consistently resisted any effort to prop up the dollar with higher interest rates, maintaining that interest rates should reflect domestic economic conditions, not fluctuations in the currency markets.
Federal Reserve officials have repeatedly hinted in recent weeks that their yearlong increases in interest rates have been just about enough to assure a "soft landing" for the American economy, in which the economy slows to a moderate pace but avoids a downturn.
Many economists fear that another big increase could slow the economy too much. If a downturn came as a result of action by the Federal Reserve, it would probably become clear to the public about nine months to a year from now, or as one Administration official noted ruefully today, "just around the time of the primaries."
The dollar dropped 1.5 percent, to 92.69 yen today, from 94.14 on Friday, the third consecutive daily low. The dollar also fell 1.5 percent, to 1.4037 marks, from 1.4244 marks, and during the day traded as low as 1.3860 marks, its record low, last touched in September 1992. For the year, the dollar is off 6.9 percent against the yen and 9.4 percent against the mark.
There was no evidence of any effort by the United States to intervene today by buying dollars.
And the White House and the Treasury, apparently acknowledging the unhappy choices they face, said nothing about the startling drop. The new Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, did not repeat his statement of Friday that "a strong dollar is in our national interest." On Mr. Rubin's advice, President Clinton is steering clear of even the vaguest comments about the financial markets.
For Administration officials, the problem is not so much a declining dollar as the possibility that the currency could suddenly, sharply fall, unnerving the stock and bond markets even more and creating a broader financial crisis that they would have to respond to quickly.
The decline of the dollar has a variety of impacts. The most immediate pain will be felt by American tourists in Germany, Britain, France, Switzerland and elsewhere where the dollar has plunged, making vacations more expensive.
For American exporters, however, the weaker dollar can be good news because it makes their products less expensive abroad. But for European manufacturers selling to the United States, the weaker dollar means their goods -- like automobiles -- become more expensive and harder to sell. Mercedes-Benz, for example, estimates that it loses 3 million marks for each one-penny rise in the value of the mark, based on its revenues last year in America.
Such rising costs could force foreign auto makers to raise prices, which would be a boon for American auto makers. But some foreign companies said they thought the current extreme weakness of the dollar was temporary, requiring no response.
Another fallout is that the higher prices of imports could add to inflation. But this impact might be muted by the fact that two major trading partners of the United States are Canada and Mexico, whose currencies have been falling against the dollar.
Those trade links, however, may be undermining the dollar. Traders suggested that the currency markets, which often operate on a theme rather than any substantive change in economic fundamentals, regard Mexico, Canada and the United States as an economic union in trouble.
"I think what is happening is that the North American continent is looking hopelessly in debt," said David F. DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. "And the worst problem is in Mexico."
Indeed, the markets are apparently believing the oratory the Clinton Administration employed to win support for its $20 billion aid package for Mexico's troubled economy, especially Mr. Clinton's insistence that the Mexican and American economies were intertwined. Today, with the Mexican Government racing to take over failing banks and to stabilize a tumultuous political situation, the peso dropped to a new low of 7 to the dollar, closing at 6.555. That means that after a brief rise over the past month, the peso is now weaker than it was when the Administration announced an international rescue package totaling $50 billion, intended to keep the Mexican economy from collapse.
The speculation in the markets now is that the package may not be enough to do the job -- and that even if it is sufficient, the economic downturn in Mexico will spill into southern Texas and California.
The result in markets where image is often more important than reality is that the dollar is being dragged down by the peso. And in the absence of other safe harbors, traders are putting their money into the German mark and the Swiss franc, both of which have soared.
"The rise of the Deutsche mark and the fall of the peso are almost mirror images of each other," said John Mueller, the chief economist at Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc., an investment advisory firm with strong conservative leanings. "And the Germans and other Europeans take the view that Mexico is our problem, and if we want to keep it from affecting the dollar we should just raise our interest rates."
Some believe that the Administration may be reluctant to expend the resources it would need to defend the dollar: Mexico's $20 billion in loans and loan guarantees account for more than half the assets of the United States Exchange Stabilization Fund, which is usually used to maintain order in foreign exchange markets.
The Administration has repeatedly said that if the markets think the reduction of the fund's size will make the United States reluctant to intervene, they are mistaken. "The remaining resources in the E.S.F.," Lawrence G. Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury, said last week, "are sufficient to engage in any exchange-market interventions that may prove to be necessary."
But currency traders around the world seemed confident today that no amount of intervention would reverse the flow. So they are willing to go on selling dollars until they think there is some reason, like an increase in interest rates, for the dollar to reverse its downward course.
But today the Fed's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, hinted that he was satisfied with the current domestic economic performance, leading many to conclude that he did not believe another rate increase was merited. He said he saw signs that the economy was slowing to a sustainable rate of growth after its brisk expansion last year.

HEADLINE: Where a School Lunch Is Food, Not a Policy Issue

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: LACROSSE, Wis., Mar. 2

 BODY:
For Gloria Brown and her daughters, free lunch at Franklin Elementary School is a big deal. The meals are well-balanced, and Heidi, age 7, and Samantha, age 10, like them.
Like many parents at Franklin, Mrs. Brown, who works the 3 A.M. shift at Hardee's, does not understand why the Republicans want to scrap the national lunch program and instead give a lump sum of money to states for school meals. 
 "What are they -- plain stupid?" said Mrs. Brown, who earns $6 an hour, and whose husband, Daniel, makes $5.75 an hour stacking lumber. "The Republicans don't have to worry about their kids eating lunch. They have a lot of money."
Free and reduced price lunches are not only for families on welfare and are not served only in inner city schools. They are also for working people like the Browns, and for many other parents at Franklin, at Jefferson Elementary, a couple of miles away, and at the 14 other public schools in the LaCrosse district here in the urban heart of dairy country.
Throughout LaCrosse County, people are angry. They consider themselves lucky to have jobs -- at Heileman's Brewery and LaCrosse Rubber Mills and the Trane air conditioning factory -- but in today's economy they are only scraping by. If the factory shuts down they go to work at Hardee's. If one job doesn't feed their families, they get two. For 59 cents they buy the Kraft Macaroni and Cheese dinner in the blue box that serves four and add hot dogs so it will serve six.
Now some of them are writing protest letters to their Congressman, Steve Gunderson, a moderate Republican, whom they helped elect last fall. "I just think this whole business is so mean-spirited," said Terry Witzke, the principal at Franklin Elementary School and a Democrat. "They are victimizing the children of this country. It almost makes me ashamed of our leaders."
Kim Lang, a single parent and a nurse, has two sons, Robert, 8, and William, 11, who eat reduced-price lunches at Franklin. "To me, it's something parents have always counted on," said Ms. Lang, who grew up on free lunch as one of seven children raised by a mother who worked as a waitress.
Now, suddenly, with the Republican majority working to pare long-standing social programs as part of its Contract With America, the school lunch program that feeds 25 million schoolchildren daily has entered the public debate alongside such contentious issues as welfare and Social Security reform.
In February, a House committee approved legislation that would give states new discretion to design their own school lunch and breakfast programs. Federal nutrition standards for school lunch would be eliminated; states would set their own standards. The Republicans said the amount of money in the block grant would increase from $6.7 billion in 1996 to $7.8 billion in 2000.
Under the House bill, each state would get a fixed sum of money each year, an amount that would not increase in response to a state recession or high unemployment. Under current law, Federal spending for school meals increases in hard times because all children in families with incomes that meet the program's criteria are automatically entitled to free lunches. The House bill would eliminate that guarantee.
Moreover, the amount of money available for meals could be further reduced by the stipulation in the House bill that 20 percent of the block grant could be used for programs other than school food.
Public health experts, along with school officials here and elsewhere, say they are worried that some states might end the free meals that studies have linked to improved academic performance. Or, they say, states might try to cut costs with less nutritious meals.
"I don't know much about the Federal deficit, but by God leave this alone," said Richard Swantz, the superintendent for LaCrosse, which has 16 schools with 8,000 students, 82 per cent of whom are white and the majority of the others African-American or Asian. "This is not just a program for poor kids. It's an investment for the entire country. Are these going to be America's children? Or are they going to be Mississippi's children, and Oregon's children?"
Republicans said the change to block grants would not cut the program but would make it more efficient and reduce the paperwork required by Federal regulations. School officials here concede that they have often complained about the paperwork. The bill is likely to be approved by the full House, but the outlook in the Senate is unclear.
The full price for a hot lunch in the public elementary schools here, with choice of two entrees, vegetables, homemade bread and butter, a salad bar, fresh fruit and milk, is $1.10; the reduced price lunch is 40 cents. A full-price breakfast is 75 cents, and the reduced price is 30 cents.
Amanda Amundsen, a Jefferson fourth grader, whose mother was laid off last month from her job as a receptionist with the state, was enjoying a free lunch of roast turkey with whipped potatoes, low-fat gravy, and peas at Jefferson the other day. "I like having a hot lunch," Amanda said. "It's expensive to pack cold lunch. A lot of things in stores are rip-offs."
In the LaCrosse district, 60 percent of schoolchildren rely on the schools for their lunches. Of those, 51 per cent come from families whose incomes qualify them for free or reduced meals.
Under current federal guidelines, a family of four with a combined annual income of less than $19,240 qualifies for free meals; a family with an income of less than $27,380 is eligible for meals at reduced price.
About half of Franklin's 223 students get free lunches and 30 pay a reduced price. Most of the others buy lunch for the full price of $1.10. Only a handful bring lunch from home. About 69 children at Franklin eat free or reduced price breakfasts. The numbers are similar among Jefferson's 216 students.
Twenty years ago, only 36 per cent of the district's children qualified for free or reduced lunches, said Marilyn Hurt, the supervisor of LaCrosse's school nutrition programs for 17 years. "Families don't make as much money as they used to," Ms. Hurt said.
Today, with more and more single parents, both parents working, and odd shifts and overtime, school officials say many children would go hungry if they could not eat at school. For some children, school may be the only time during the week that they do not eat alone.
In the spotless Franklin cafeteria recently, 7-year-old Brittney McGuire talked over toast with peanut butter, cornflakes with low-fat milk, and grape juice. "A lot of parents don't have time to make breakfast," she said. Her mother, for example. "My mom has to leave at 6 A.M. to make boots at the rubber mill," she said matter-of-factly."
Dozens of children at Jefferson and Franklin who were interviewed for this article volunteered that they liked, even loved, school lunches. They are served here along with lessons in good nutrition. The staff introduced broccoli by doling out samples over several months and now it is the school vegetable.
"My favorite is cheese dunkers," said Lindy Kron, a fifth grader, after finishing off the dish made with herbed garlic bread, mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. "I need food. I can't think without it."
Nancy Dull's fifth graders were having a hard time understanding what was happening in Washington. Block grants are a new idea for them. But they have heard plenty from their parents and they say they are mad too.
"I think it stinks," Nate Kennedy said. "Some kid could go hungry."
Michael Shuda, 11, chimed in, "They obviously need more money -- need or want. They should give the kids a vote."
The hallways at Franklin are hung with signs that say: "Breakfast -- Don't Go To Class Without It." Mr. Witzke, the principal, is so passionate about breakfast he found money in the budget this year to serve it free to all his students two days out of every six.
He said his thinking has changed radically since he arrived at Franklin 25 years ago. "I believed in more and more parental responsibility," Mr. Witzke said. "By giving children breakfast and lunch, I thought we were facilitating the attitude of 'let the schools do it.' "
Mr. Witzke, who is 55, said he had in mind the way his grandparents raised him in LaCrosse. "My grandmother made me French toast and cream of wheat for breakfast. When I came home from school, I would smell her homemade bread. She ironed my shorts. I had this naive idea that that's the way it should be."
But Mr. Witzke said the lives of the children at Franklin changed his mind. "If I had my way, we'd have universal free meals. There are too many other obstacles to overcome. We can preach all we want, but if kids are hungry they aren't going to learn."
With all the meals currently federally subsidized, school officials said the proposed legislation might force states to raise prices. Families would drop out of the program, they said.
Wanda Werner, a nursing assistant whose husband earns $8.50 an hour as a mechanic, said she carefully budgets the $48 it costs to buy a month of full-price school lunches for her two children at Jefferson.
"There's times we don't have enough money so I'll make them cold lunch," said Mrs. Werner, who is a Republican and who counts on hot dogs to stretch the Kraft Macaroni and Cheese blue-box dinner. "The school sent home a sheet of what we should pack for a balanced lunch." She laughed. "There's no way you can do it for $1.10."

Developments in Washington

 BODY:
LEGAL REFORM: The House began debating an overhaul of the American legal system as it considered legislation that would for the first time place civil laws governing personal injuries and defective products under Federal rules. The debate, which is expected to occupy much of the week, began with a proposal to require that people who undertake civil lawsuits, and then lose, pay the costs and fees of their opponents in many cases. The bill is a sharply curtailed version of the "loser pays" proposal embodied in the House Republicans' Contract With America.
ENDANGERED SPECIES: With Congress preparing to rewrite the Endangered Species Act, the Clinton Administration proposed changes intended to increase the law's flexibility and decrease its economic costs without putting rare plants and animals in greater danger of extinction. For instance, it wants to exempt from regulation most homeowners and activities on small plots of land, allowing some disturbance of habitat as long as the overall effect on a species is negligible. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt also wants to give more power to state governments in carrying out the law, and has said that future decisions to list species for protection would have to be supported by independent scientific peer reviews. 
 MILITARY SPENDING: Suggesting that his Republican rivals were less sympathetic to the needs of veterans, President Clinton denounced as "unwise and unnecessary" a proposal approved by the House Appropriations Committee last week that would eliminate $200 million from current spending on veterans' health. He has proposed an $1.3 billion increase in spending over the next five years for the Department of Veterans Affairs, most of it for health care.

HEADLINE: Iran Signs Oil Deal With Conoco; First Since 1980 Break With U.S.

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
A major American oil company said yesterday that it had been awarded a contract by Iran to develop a huge offshore oilfield in the Persian Gulf, the first energy agreement involving Iran and the United States since Washington severed relations with Teheran in 1980.
American companies are permitted to buy oil from Iran, but they may not resell it in the United States. The contract by Conoco Inc. goes far beyond buying oil to sell to a third party, and the arrangement to develop oil and gas sources in Iran indicates a long-term relationship. 
 The deal was announced despite support in Congress for a bill that would impose an economic embargo on Iran.
Although the financial details of the Conoco deal were not disclosed, some oil analysts estimated that the project could be worth $1 billion.
The contract was signed after three years of negotiations, according to Jim Felder, a spokesman for Conoco, which is based in Houston and owned by the chemical giant E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company of Wilmington, Del.
Mr. Felder said he would be briefing the Clinton Administration on the deal in the next few days. He said some officials in Washington knew that Conoco was pursuing it.
Administration officials said Conoco had informed them that they were planning a deal with Iran. Officials said they planned to discuss it with the company, but did not try to hide the fact that they were displeased with the agreement, although they were reluctant to criticize it publicly.
The Administration officials said they were seeking more details to determine whether the agreement violated prohibitions of loans at below-market interest rates or transfers of advanced technology that could be used by Iran's military.
Christine Shelly, a State Department spokeswoman, said the Administration had sought to exert economic pressure on Iran and had focused on three areas: trying to limit arms transfers, government-to-government loans and sales of advanced technologies.
Furthermore, the Administration last year protested Iran's membership in an $8 billion oil consortium of mostly Western companies in Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic. Iran's $350 million investment, a 5 percent share in the Azerbaijani oil project, was vehemently opposed by Washington.
Concerns by the United States over the potential for Iran's growing influence in the gulf region prompted a policy of containment in 1993 to limit Teheran's strength and reach.
The policy was aimed at putting pressure on Iran to relinquish its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, its sponsorship of international terrorism and its opposition to the Middle East peace effort.
Denying charges of terrorist activity and of a nuclear weapons program, senior Iranian officials have blamed the United States for growing economic hardships, saying Washington is hostile toward Iran because of its Islamic Government.
The bill introduced in January by Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, and referred to committee, would forbid all economic and financial transactions, banning American companies from buying Iranian oil.
Paul Ting, an oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, said Iran and other Middle Eastern oil-producing countries had been feeling the pinch to come up with money for major oilfield development since lower oil prices have cut their revenues.
He said there had been doubts whether Iran could reach its goal of increasing its oil production from 3.6 million barrels a day to 4 million without substantial help from foreign oil companies.
Major oil producers in the Middle East have been seeking to increase their production capacity to meet growing demand in the coming decade. Some oil analysts have predicted that oil supplies may be tight by the end of the decade because Middle Eastern countries have not been expanding production fast enough as they faced greater demands to spend more on domestic needs.
Mr. Felder said that under the agreement, which was also announced by Oil Ministry officials in Iran, Conoco Iran N.V., a Netherlands-based affiliate of Conoco, would act as the contractor to develop the offshore fields on Sirri Island. Mr. Felder said he did not know the estimated size of the oil and gas reserves in the fields.
Sirri Island, 700 miles south of Teheran, is near the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic thoroughfare for shipping.
Mr. Felder said two fields, which were discovered in 1972 and 1976, would be developed. They are expected to produce more than 120,000 barrels a day in two years. The United States needs to import about 8 million barrels of crude oil a day to meet its needs.
He said a natural gas pipeline would also be built from Sirri Island to producing oil fields in Dubai. He said some gas would be injected into the existing fields in Dubai to increase their output. Sirri Island is about 80 miles from Iran and 90 miles from Dubai.
Mr. Felder added that Conoco had been competing with European oil companies including Elf Aquitaine S.A. and Total for the project.
Based on unofficial figures, American oil companies have purchased 30 percent of Iranian oil exports through subsidiaries.
Western diplomats have made it clear that economic ties would be a vital question before Washington would consider any restoration of diplomatic relations with Teheran. But high-ranking Iranian officials publicly maintain that ideological considerations take precedence over economic and political factors in shaping foreign policy.
"Establishing relations with the United States is not on our foreign policy agenda," Abbas Maleki, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Strategic Research, said last week, the newspaper Salam reported.
Nevertheless, the special circumstances of today's oil agreement, which was signed in the Netherlands, apparently through a United States company subsidiary, was reported in the state-run press as a deal with "the Dutch company Conoco." That the project is to be based off shore merely underscored the sensitivity surrounding any important deal with American companies.

HEADLINE: A Presidential Hopeful for '96 With a Low-Key, Serious Air

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Richard Green Lugar has been a United States Senator from Indiana for 18 years, but much of the national electorate has yet to notice. That would not seem to make for a promising start to a campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination like the one Mr. Lugar disclosed, to the surprise of many here, on Thursday.
Unlike Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, who can summon network cameras whenever he wants toopine on any issue, Mr. Lugar is known largely as an authority on dry topics like arms control and foreign affairs. Unlike Senator Phil Gramm, of the Texas twang and saber-toothed sound bites, Mr. Lugar speaks in flat tones and shades of gray. 
 Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee Governor, wears flannel shirts and wants to cut Congress's pay and send its members home. Mr. Lugar lives in dark suits and white shirts and leaves no question that Washington is a lifetime career.
"I'm glad Dick Lugar is in the race," said William Kristol, the Republican savant who used to be chief of staff to another Indianian, Vice President Dan Quayle. "But I don't know how he wins, frankly."
Neither do some of his supporters, yet. Still, they see a combination of qualities -- steadiness, deftness in crisis, bipartisanship -- that they believe the President and many of his Republican rivals lack. Some cast Mr. Lugar as a natural successor to Mr. Dole, a man of similar views and generational stature, if the Kansas Senator stumbles in the primaries as he did in 1988.
"He's not from the junior leagues," said Jeff Nesbit, a onetime Quayle adviser and current Lugar supporter. "He'll walk through the door ready to be the leader of the free world. This is a man who reads his briefing papers for hours before hearings. He takes the job seriously."
When he appeared with other Republican Presidential aspirants last month at the first of New Hampshire's many Presidential cattle shows, Mr. Lugar was notable for being the only speaker who did not try to crack a joke. Not many people doubt that he would be a serious and extremely well-briefed President.
The case against Mr. Lugar lies elsewhere. Even supporters say he is a premier foreign-policy expert in an era dominated by domestic politics, running in a race that frequently turns on issues like the flag, crime and the economy. Mr. Lugar seems to recognize that and has recently sought to raise his domestic profile.
In mid-February, he used his post as chairman of the Agriculture Committee to call for a drastic reduction in farm subsidies as part of the effort to reduce the Federal deficit. He also opposes demands by leading Republicans in the House and Senate for an income-tax cut for middle- and upper-class families, something Mr. Lugar says the country cannot afford now.
Such stances are unusual for a senator from a farm state and not popular among Republicans. They could set him apart from rivals like Mr. Dole, who does not like Mr. Lugar's proposed phase-out of crop subsidies for farmers in Kansas and elsewhere, and Mr. Gramm, who fervently supports tax cuts while fighting proposals to pay for them by trimming popular Texas programs.
Slim as Mr. Lugar's prospects might look, they could worsen if another Republican pragmatist, like Gov. Pete Wilson of California, enters the primaries, as many predict.
Supporters say Mr. Lugar intends to make the deficit a principal issue in his campaign, arguing that he would approach the question of balancing the budget with the unflinching resolve that Mr. Clinton lacks and his rivals are hard put to match. Mr. Lugar maintained last week that Mr. Clinton's failure to step up to fiscal problems had eroded what he called the "American advantage," an alliteration voters will have to get used to if his campaign prospers.
He also contends that he has experience in domestic matters that even rivals like Mr. Dole lack, though the comparison can sometimes seem stretched. Mr. Lugar oversees a small family farm outside Indianapolis and likes to say that he knows more than most politicians about filling out Federal forms and complying with tax rules. He also was Mayor of Indianapolis, and dubbed "my favorite Mayor" by President Richard M. Nixon, two decades ago.
"The Presidency is not a solo voice," he said last week. "It's a question of finding the best team. And I've been a consensus-builder." By comparison, he noted, Mr. Gramm was a professor, and Mr. Dole has been in politics almost his entire adult life.
Mr. Lugar is no novice to high-level politics. He has run the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; been considered three times for vice president, by Presidents Nixon in 1973, Ronald Reagan in 1980 and George Bush in 1988; run for Senate majority leader, and lost to Mr. Dole, and currently is leading the Agriculture Committee.
Now at the age of 62, he suggested on television last week that being President required "maturity" and "many years of experience," making an implicit comparison to the 47-year-old Mr. Clinton.
Still, Mr. Lugar cannot escape his label as a foreign-policy expert, and he appears not to want to. In interviews, he has suggested that the Government and Congress have a healthy supply of experts and ideas to deal with most domestic issues, whereas only the President can properly address the nation's two biggest concerns: the Federal debt and an increasingly unstable world.
In a news conference on Friday, he opened his pitch by accusing Mr. Clinton of conducting foreign policy in "episodic chapters." Later that day, he criticized Mr. Clinton in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington policy organization. He accused the President of virtually abdicating American leadership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by supporting the group's eventual expansion to include nations in Eastern Europe, but never specifying how the countries would join, or trying to sell the idea to the American public.
Mr. Lugar disagrees with Mr. Clinton over more than NATO. He believes the President has embraced the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, too unreservedly. He criticizes the Administration's Bosnia policy. He has qualms about the accord to curb North Korea's nuclear program.
But his broad approach to foreign affairs is bipartisan. With Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, Mr. Lugar wrote the policy that earmarked $2 billion to help Russia dismantle much of its nuclear force and convert its industry to peacetime uses.
Mr. Lugar pushed for sanctions against South Africa in the 1980's when his party opposed them. This year, he criticized Mr. Dole's call for the United States to ignore an international arms embargo and begin allowing weapons to flow to besieged Bosnian Muslims.
He disputes Speaker Newt Gingrich's demand to end aid to Russia if Moscow supplies Iran with nuclear reactors, saying that Moscow's reactors are similar to those the United States may supply North Korea. And he opposes Mr. Gingrich's demand to pull American peacekeepers from United Nations forces unless they are placed under American command.
Those positions wear well with a foreign-policy establishment disenchanted with Mr. Clinton and fearful of the isolationism of Mr. Gingrich and those to his right.
"He's very solid on foreign policy," said Brent Scowcroft, the retired Air Force general who was Mr. Bush's national security adviser.
But what is reassuring to Washington's establishment may well enjoy less support in primary elections, where the voters are often diehard Republicans and the diehards are disproportionately to Mr. Lugar's right. And in the end, Republican political analysts say, that may cost him votes and money.

HEADLINE: Potash Buys Big Producer Of Phosphate

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Elf Aquitaine S.A. of France and the Williams Companies announced yesterday that they had sold Texasgulf Inc., one of the world's largest producers of phosphate rock, to the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan for $810 million in cash.
The sale signals a major pullback from Elf Aquitaine's long and costly entry into chemicals in North America. The French oil company had owned 85 percent of Texasgulf, with the rest held by Williams, a pipeline company in Tulsa, Okla., that transports natural gas and oil. 
 Potash, based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, is the world's largest producer of potash. Both phosphate and potash are used in fertilizer.
Paul Ting, an oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, said the cash from the sale would strenghten the ability of Elf Aquitaine to finance its primary business, which is finding and producing oil and natural gas.
Elf Aquitaine has been one of the state-owned companies involved in the French Government's drive toward privatization. The Government has reduced its stake from 50.8 percent to 13 percent.
The company, which has other chemical units and a pharmaceutical business, plans to sell about $1 billion worth of assets this year.
Phillip Jaffre, the chairman of Elf Aquitaine, had said that Texasgulf would be put on the block because it did not fit well with the company.
Elf Aquitaine acquired Texasgulf in 1981 and spent heavily to upgrade its operations in solid and liquid fertilizers, animal-feed supplements and purified phosphoric acid.
Texasgulf, based in Raleigh, N.C., is a big producer of sulfur. With a price closely tied to the economic cycle, sulfur did well for Elf Aquitaine for a while but the last recession caused prices to fall and Elf Aquitaine took a large write-down in 1990 to reflect the reduced value of the unit.
John B. Parry, an analyst with John S. Herold, a securities firm in Greenwich, Conn., said that the price Elf Aquitaine received was fair and that the money could be used to expand the oil, gas, and specialty chemicals businesses.
"The division did not fit in well with their plan to be mostly in fine and specialty chemicals," he added.
Also, he said, the company needed the cash because it had been increasing its debt to maintain capital spending and pay its dividend.
C. E. Childers, chairman, president and chief executive of Potash, said the acquisition would broaden the company's fertilizer product line and virtually double its work force and assets.
Douglas Groh, a chemicals analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, told Bloomberg Business News: "Potash Corporation was the right one to buy it. The acquisition diversifies Potash Corporation's business and uses their balance sheet better."

HEADLINE: California Job Loss Affected Base Closing List

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Concern about job losses in California led the Navy to limit its base closing list, Navy Secretary John Dalton told the base closing commission today.
Mr. Dalton's comments were the clearest statement to date that top Pentagon officials scaled back the closing list not only because of the high initial costs of closing bases but also to protect jobs in the nation's most populous state. 
 "I decided to make some economic impact decisions as it related to the state of California," Mr. Dalton said.
The Navy considered closing four small training and maintenance installations, three in the San Francisco Bay area, Mr. Dalton said. But such a recommendation, with a loss of 1,720 civilian and military jobs, combined with the impact of previous closings, would have meant a combined loss for California of about 30,000 jobs.
Still, those concerns were not enough to save the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, leading to the direct loss of 4,058 jobs as well as 9,248 jobs not directly affiliated with the yard.
A Navy chart ranked Long Beach slightly ahead of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Me., for overall military value. But Mr. Dalton said the Portsmouth yard's ability to service nuclear-powered attack submarines led to the decision to keep it open and close Long Beach.
Mr. Dalton and Adm. Jeremy Boorda, the chief of naval operations, said they made their decisions independently, without political pressure from the White House or the Secretary of Defense.
"I got input from a number of sources, but the decision was mine," Mr. Dalton said.
In a separate speech today to the National Association of Counties, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said communities like Long Beach could turn base closings into job producers "and actually wind up, many of them, better off with a more diverse economy and more jobs."
To do so, he said, they must plan carefully and avoid long local debates over how to use the space.
"Over the last three decades, almost 88,000 Federal jobs were lost as a result of base closing, but a total of 171,000 jobs, nearly twice as many, were created in and around the bases after they closed," Mr. Perry said.

HEADLINE: Whitman's Urban Agenda Outlines Self-Help Program

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 6

 BODY:
On a hill where rioters tore the heart out of New Jersey's capital city in 1968, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announced a new urban agenda that offers the cities of New Jersey help in planning for economic recovery, but not much help in paying for it.
Calling for the creation of neighborhood-based development groups that would seek money from private and nonprofit groups, the program announced today was carefully tailored to the Republican self-help philosophy of a tax-cutting Governor with no money to spare and scant political support in the cities. 
 "For our urban strategy to truly succeed, we are calling on everyone -- community groups, businesses, clergy, educators, local officials, police and charitable foundations -- to work together," the Governor said in her remarks. "The power that comes from these partnerships will revitalize our cities neighborhood by neighborhood."
Governor Whitman's plan envisions the creation of numerous Neighborhood Councils, composed of local businesses and residents and assisted by nonprofit development groups such as Isles Inc., based in Trenton.
These local councils would create revitalization plans that they would submit to city governments and to the Governor's Urban Coordinating Council, a new group made up of cabinet members whose role would be to cut through red tape in focusing state aid to local groups with approved revitalization plans. New Jersey currently spends $2 million a year in urban aid, and the Governor said that figure would not be increased any time soon.
Four cities -- Trenton, Camden, Elizabeth and Asbury Park -- will take part in the program initially, and their mayors joined Mrs. Whitman under the spire of the Trenton Battle Monument, where George Washington dug in his artillery for the Battle of Trenton in 1776, and where, in 1968, rioters ended Trenton's life as a working city.
The mayors, all Democrats, said they were glad to have the state pay attention to their problems, which include negligible business investments, soaring real estate taxes and crime.
"It creates a discussion, it creates a framework, but clearly, it's no panacea," said J. Christian Bollwage, the Mayor of Elizabeth.
Trenton's Mayor, Douglas Palmer, declaring that the Battle Monument area would be the first district of the city to begin a renewal under the Governor's plan, said: "Today, the Governor has given Trenton what we have needed all along, a hand up, not a handout, to accomplish our goals."
The announcement of an urban development strategy makes good a promise Mrs. Whitman made early in her administration. While it may lack specifics in how each local government will accomplish its goals, the initiative fills a gap in the social agenda of a Governor whose political base is in the suburbs, far from the blight that surrounded her today.
Mrs. Whitman also has yet to mend her relations with New Jersey's black and Hispanic political and religious leaders, who have often accused her of ignoring their issues. New Jersey's cities missed out on the economic boom of the 1980's, and their leaders are intent on positioning their communities to catch the next wave, if and when it comes.
Evidently intent on deflecting criticism that she is not coming up with new money for urban areas, Mrs. Whitman said that $7 billion from a variety of state programs had gone to the four target cities over the past 10 years without solving their problems.
The mayors argued that the way that money was spent was out of their hands. Of the $2 billion given Elizabeth over that decade, Mayor Bollwage said, better than two-thirds went to education, medical services and welfare, programs over which mayors have scant control.
"The philosophy espoused by state and national leaders that urban areas just throw money away is not true, and I challenge anyone who believes it to come to Elizabeth and see that it is not true," he said.
Although the state does not have new money to offer the cities, Governor Whitman said special stress will be put on attracting money from private companies and nonprofit groups.

Marriott to Acquire a Ritz-Carlton Stake

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Eager to add a luxury chain to its portfolio, Marriott International announced yesterday that it had agreed to acquire about 49 percent of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company.
Marriott is not buying any of the Ritz hotels, which are mostly franchised, only the right to manage them. The proposed acquisition, which also includes several minority partners, is scheduled to close this spring, and Marriott could later acquire the rest of the company. 
 "This is one of the most significant developments in the hotel industry in the last decade," said Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney. "Marriott is probably the best hotel management company in the world and the Ritz-Carlton is probably tied with the Four Seasons as the best luxury brands in the world. The Ritz just hasn't been able to generate the occupancy and cash flow that Marriott has, but if anyone can significantly improve the profitability, Marriott can."
Marriott stock rose $1.375 a share, to $32.625, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The Atlanta-based Ritz-Carlton is controlled by William B. Johnson, an Atlanta developer and real estate investor who bought the Ritz-Carlton trademark in 1983. He owns three of the hotels and has investments in 10 others.
The transaction, which is said to be valued at almost $200 million, originated with Frederic V. Malek, one of the investors in the deal and chairman of Thayer Capital Partners, a private investment firm in Washington that specializes in management buyouts. Mr. Malek was campaign manager for the 1992 Presidential bid of George Bush and before that was president of Marriott from 1980-88.
"I started on the transaction about Dec. 1," Mr. Malek said, "and when it became apparent the synergies that could be added by Marriott could be pivotal to the deal, I went to Bill Marriott."
That was on Feb. 2, and the parties signed an agreement in Atlanta on Feb. 24. Bill Marriott is J. William Marriott Jr., chairman and president of the company. Mr. Malek, who reported directly to Mr. Marriott for 15 years, said Mr. Marriott was one of the few people who could accept that another company -- the Ritz-Carlton -- was doing a great job of pampering its guests, and who would maintain the integrity of its brand name.
The investment group includes Mr. Malek, Richard E. Rainwater, the Fort Worth investor; Frank Pearl, an investor from Washington, and Raymond G. Chambers, a co-founder and formerly senior partner of the Wesray Capital Corporation. Mr. Malek described their investment position as "a minority one, but not insubstantial."
With Ritz-Carlton access to Marriott money, reservations system and worldwide sales force, the transaction is expected to strengthen the Ritz-Carlton properties and spur the growth of the chain. The name was derived from Cesar Ritz, the Swiss-born hotelier who made his name synonymous with quality and service.
Although Marriott has about 900 hotels, from the 258 upscale Marriott Hotels, Resorts and Suites to the 172 economy Fairfield Inns, J. William Marriott Jr., chairman and president of the company, said that Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton complemented each other. While they serve different market segments, he said, they share "an incredible commitment to customer service."
The Ritz-Carlton's growth potential is "tremendous" outside the United States, Mr. Doyle said. If Marriott can profitably manage those or the existing properties, he added, "it can go to individuals who want to develop luxury hotels and say let's do it together. We can make you good money."

HEADLINE: Peso Reaches Lowest Point In 3 Months

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 6

 BODY:
The political and economic storm battering Mexico took a further toll on the badly weakened peso today, driving the currency to its lowest point since the crisis began last December.
The peso traded at an exchange rate of more than 7 pesos to the dollar at midday before Mexico's central bank stepped in to buy pesos and help stabilize the currency. At the end of the day, the spot rate for the peso was 6.555 to the dollar, or just above 15 cents, compared with nearly 29 cents before the peso's first devaluation on Dec. 20. Since then, the peso has lost 47 percent of its value. 
 Financial analysts here and in New York said the peso was hurt by several factors, including the weakness in the United States dollar, the continuing melodrama of Mexican politics, the Government's takeover last Friday of a large Mexican bank and delays in the revised economic stabilization plan that investors have been awaiting for the last two weeks.
"There was just a mixture of more bad news and no good news imminent," said Geoffrey E. J. Dennis, head of Latin American equity research at Bear, Stearns in New York. "All roads lead to the peso at the moment and we need some more guidance from the Government."
Banpais, Mexico's eighth-largest bank, was taken over Friday by the Government, which mentioned "irregularities." Carlos Escalante, a currency analyst with the Vector brokerage firm in Mexico City, said the administrative takeover of Banpais worried investors who feared that it might signal the beginning of a cycle of bank failures.
"There's a lot of speculation that there might be other banks with problems and that all that's missing is the official notices" of failures, Mr. Escalante said.
All the problems did not seem to hurt the Mexican stock exchange today. The market gained 3.2 points and closed at 1,522.7, which analysts said reflected the inflow of a small amount of speculative money that was not expected to last.
While a new economic plan had been expected two weeks ago, President Ernesto Zedillo now says that he will wait until the Mexican Congress has a chance this week to examine the details of the $20 billion bailout from the United States before announcing anything.
Mexican Government officials say Mr. Zedillo wants to build a broad public consensus on the objectives of the new plan before committing himself to a revised set of economic goals and projections.
Last month, Mr. Zedillo conceded that the Government could not achieve its initial plan's targets of 19 percent inflation, wage increases limited to 7 percent, economic growth this year of 1.5 percent and an exchange rate stabilized at 4.50 pesos to the dollar.
A new version of the plan is expected to peg inflation to more than double the original estimate. It could include wage increases of 15 percent or more, no economic growth in 1995 and a peso exchange rate of around 5.50 to the dollar or higher.
Some analysts said they thought that Mr. Zedillo was trying to buy more time by waiting for Mexico's Congress to examine the American rescue plan. The President himself has said congressional approval is not needed because the plan does not increase the Government's level of debt. Mr. Zedillo's party has a solid majority in Congress and the Mexican Government has already started using some of the bailout money authorized by the United States.
"What we're hearing is that there are a lot of negatives being brought out by labor and the corporate sector about the economic plan," said Eduardo M. Cabrera, manager of Latin American strategies for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. "To use the excuse that they are waiting for Congress when they control the Congress, and can pass it if they want to, raises a lot of questions."
Mexico economic problems have been compounded by unrelated political melodrama, with Raul Salinas de Gortari, the older brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, accused of ordering the murder last Sept. 28 of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary general of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. A motive has not been given.
Mr. Escalante said that the confusing political picture had driven investors to dump pesos.

HEADLINE: Food Stamps in Peril

 BODY:
The food stamp program is the best part of the nation's welfare system. It saves millions of poor Americans from hunger and malnutrition every year and, unlike other welfare programs, is sensibly designed to insure equitable treatment from state to state. Yet if House Republicans get their way, this exemplary program could be wrecked within weeks.
Food stamp benefits are paid by Washington, indexed for inflation and set at identical levels across the country -- worth up to $375 per month for a family of four. They are a true safety net: if you are poor, you qualify. During the past 20 years, states have allowed cash assistance to the poor to fall, after accounting for inflation, by over 20 percent; food stamps alone have stood between poverty and malnutrition. 
 The House G.O.P. now proposes to rip two huge holes in this safety net. First the bill, which the House is almost sure to approve, would allow those states that adopt fraud-detection systems to opt out of the Federal program. They would then receive a fixed sum from Washington and distribute it to the poor any way they please. To protect taxpayers from possibly excessive outlays, states would most likely end an individual's right to collect stamps.
Judging from the past 20 years, states will balance their budgets in hard times by ratcheting down benefits. The pressure to cut is intensified by the fact that skimpy benefits encourage poor families to leave the state, relieving taxpayers of the burden of all their assistance costs.
Second, the G.O.P. would deliver an even worse blow to the remaining Federal food stamp program, which for the foreseeable future would probably enroll the bulk of recipients nationwide. Under current law, Congress spends whatever money it takes to feed hungry Americans -- increasing spending when, for example, recession hits and workers lose their jobs or when inflation drives food prices higher. But under the Republican bill, spending on food stamps would be capped. Come a recession, Congress would be forced to kick families out of the program or reduce the value of food stamps.
The bill would also require able-bodied adults without children to find work within 90 days of enrolling for food stamps. But the bill provides no money for job training or public-sector jobs. The next time the economy slows, 100,000 workers would lose their jobs and food stamps in quick order.
The benefit formulas would also leave recipients prey to inflation: the dollar value of stamps would not keep pace with prices, leaving the poor with less food every year. The list of other insults is so long it is hard to take stock: for example, the bill would save money by stripping food stamps away from many legal immigrants, no matter how long they had worked and paid taxes.
The House G.O.P. would eventually cut the $25 billion program by probably more than 15 percent. That reduction goes well beyond any reasonable estimates of waste, fraud and abuse. The richest country in the world would strip its citizens of the ironclad right not to starve. Perhaps the Senate can save the country from that ignominious distinction.

HEADLINE: A Shrewd Move on Schools

 BODY:
The pilot program announced by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Ramon Cortines to privatize the maintenance and repair of New York City schools is a smart idea. It could save money. It could help prevent the city's school buildings from collapsing around the students and teachers who inhabit them.
The system of repairing schools has long been inadequate. The fault has been shared by the Board of Education's Division of School Facilities and the school custodians. Together they are responsible for more than 1,000 school buildings. 
 Mr. Cortines has already shaken up the division, appointing a new administrator and decentralizing some decision-making to the borough level. Meanwhile, City Hall negotiated a tough labor settlement with the custodians, who had long been permitted to operate under sloppy work rules. The agreement calls for stricter accountability, and ties future pay increases to job performance. As an added goad to the custodians, the Board of Education contracted with private companies for cleaning services at about 90 schools. City Hall made it clear that it would push for more privatization in the future.
The board and City Hall are now making good on these promises. They will seek bids from private companies to clean and repair an additional 52 city schools beginning in July. The companies will not only clean the schools, as custodians are supposed to do, but will also do minor repairs, like fixing shattered windows or re-plastering walls, that custodians are not now required to do. The companies will serve a cluster of a half-dozen to a dozen schools within certain areas, which should allow for some economies of scale in purchasing and labor.
It is unclear how much money, if any, can be saved from the $300 million originally budgeted for repairs this year. What is clear is that whatever its cost, a competitive system to patch up the schools will almost surely save the city heavy capital expenditures down the road.

HEADLINE: Doctors, on Offensive, Form H.M.O.'s

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Doctors, on the defensive in recent years as employers and insurers sought to control medical costs, are starting to fight back against the growing sway of insurance and health care companies over the practice of medicine. And in a challenge to health maintenance organizations and other insurers, a small but growing number of physicians are leapfrogging the middleman by offering to sell their services directly to employers.
The doctors insist that they, rather than insurers, can do the best job of protecting the interest of patients while providing the economical care that the public demands. 
 Seeking greater influence with health care buyers, physicians across the country organized hundreds of new medical groups in the last two years, abandoning their old individual and two-doctor practices.
Now some doctors are going even further to gain influence in the marketplace. In New Jersey, 3,500 doctors recently contributed $5,000 each to raise $17.5 million to organize their own health maintenance organization. About 200 doctors in El Paso County joined last year to form the El Paso Community Health Plan, which has just announced an agreement with a Levi Strauss plant in El Paso to treat job-related injuries. The Holzer Clinic, based in Gallipolis in southeastern Ohio, which has 80 doctors, has a contract with the local operations of the Federal-Mogul Corporation, an automobile parts maker.
One of the biggest and best-known doctor-run groups, the Mayo Clinic, has provided care for Deere & Company workers in Iowa and Illinois since 1993, and last year it enrolled 8,000 I.B.M. employees in Rochester, Minn., Mayo's home base.
In the New York metropolitan region, the Long Island Physician Holdings Corporation is planning a new doctor-owned H.M.O. "We're the people who provide the care," Dr. Rosario J. Romano, a board member, said. "We would like to have some control over our own destiny."
Even doctors who are not contracting directly with employers now recognize that they must form groups to survive. "Individual doctors don't stand a chance," said James C. Robinson, a professor of health economics at the University of California at Berkeley. "The future is in the large capitated medical group," which accepts a monthly per capita fee for everybody it covers. "It can bargain as equals with the H.M.O.'s," Professor Robinson said.
Dr. Peter Kongstvedt, a partner at Ernst & Young, the accountants and benefits consulting firm, said the per capita deals were "the way for physicians to lock in business and profit margins." He added, "Then those physicians who succeed under comprehensive capitation can be very big winners."
Some of these groups have been so successful that they have received buyout offers from some of the same health care giants that many doctors are dodging. In Connecticut,
M.D. Health Plan doctors are considering a $101 million offer from Health Systems International, a big California-based H.M.O. That would be a huge windfall for members of the Connecticut state medical society, who started the North Haven group with a $5 million investment in 1987. But the doctors would also be giving up control.
And Bridgeport doctors who have a majority of the shares of Physicians Health Services announced recently that they were seeking to put the company up for sale.
"Physician-owned H.M.O.'s are continually being propositioned" with big-money takeover offers from health care companies, said Dr. Jacque J. Sokolov, a Los Angeles-based consultant who is working with an American Medical Association program that encourages doctors to run their own show.
Many group practices are acquiring the ability to largely duplicate services generally provided by H.M.O.'s. These include eliminating wasteful practices, taking the financial risk of per capita contracts, and rewarding physicians for keeping costs down.
But it can take millions to start an H.M.O., which requires an expensive computer information system to project costs, keep track of performance and handle billing. The American Medical Association said recently that it would provide help in obtaining capital for doctors who want to organize medical groups, joint ventures with hospitals or start a doctor-controlled health maintenance organization.
A growing number of medical groups are making deals with health care management companies to handle business chores that many doctors say are daunting. For a fee and share of profits, companies such as the Caremark Corporation, Phycor Inc., Pacific Physician Services and Coastal Healthcare Group provide financing, legal services and access to information systems. They often negotiate contracts with the health plans and hospitals.
Lawrence Marsh, an analyst with Wheat First Securities in Richmond, said the physician management business had tripled in the last three years. He said publicly held physician companies would report $1.4 billion in 1994 revenues and privately held companies had $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion in revenues.
State medical societies in 21 states are organizing physician networks, H.M.O.'s or other types of managed care groups. The state society in Florida recently sold a 40 percent minority interest in a new physician network to Coastal Healthcare for $7 million in start-up money and working capital.
To be sure, the overwhelming majority of medical groups still work with or for health maintenance organizations and other insurer middlemen. Many big employers prefer to deal with intermediaries that can bargain with individual doctors and hospitals. "We are not interested in being in that business," Helen Darling, a corporate benefits planner for Xerox, said.
The GTE Corporation, for example, set up its own doctor network in San Angelo, Tex., and brought Travelers in to administer the network," George Crowling, a GTE regional benefits manager in Dallas, said.
The insurance companies obviously have a different view of doctor-owned H.M.O.'s. "The system works best when insurance companies and doctors are partners," said Dr. William C. Roper, chief medical officer of the Prudential Health Care System.
"Relationships with doctors are fragile and need to be carefully tended," he added. "The living together in a happy marriage doesn't come by accident."
Existing health maintenance organizations hardly welcome doctor-owned H.M.O.'s as competitors, either. In California, where H.M.O.'s are powerful, two big medical groups backed off their plans to start their own health maintenance organizations after existing H.M.O.'s threatened to stop using affiliated physicians.
"We didn't think it was worth going to war over," said Dr. Albert Barnett, chief executive of the Friendly Hills Healthcare Network.
Seeking to avert just this type of problem, Long Island Physician Holdings asked for a preliminary opinion from the State Attorney General's office, said Jay Kossman, senior vice president of Nextstage Healthcare Management, a Roslyn, L.I., company that is helping the doctors organize an H.M.O. "We were told that if physicians were dropped from a network because they are in another network, it would violate the Federal antitrust laws," he said.
But it works both ways. A group that has exclusive deals with too many doctors in a region may also be taken to court. In a closely watched case, United Wisconsin Services, a for-profit Blue Cross plan based in Milwaukee, brought charges of civil antitrust violations against the Marshfield Clinic, a physician-owned group in central Wisconsin. United Wisconsin said Marshfield had effectively barred it from doing business in the region by signing up most of the doctors there.
A jury in Federal District Court in Madison recently awarded $48 million in treble damages to United Wisconsin. A spokesman for Marshfield said it would appeal.
The Mayo Clinic, which has acquired clinics in nearby western Wisconsin, is taking no chances. "The network is being developed so there will be ample competition," Dr. Michael O'Sullivan, chairman of Mayo's regional practice board, said. "We don't look to dominating the entire region and acquiring all the practices."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW: DEATH DEFYING ACTS;
Really a Jungle Out There, a Jungle of Urban Neuroses

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY 

 BODY:
A lawyer with a fully developed talent for obfuscation is suddenly put into the position of defending his most important client (himself). The charge: burying a hypothetical lawn mower. An angry hooker, who describes herself as a "para-professional," pours out her heart to the suicide counselor, a man new on the job, answering the telephone at a Manhattan hot-line center. Meanwhile, over on Central Park West, two civilized, upwardly mobile couples straighten out their Byzantine extramarital relationships, not through cool analysis but with a snub-nosed gun.
Deliciously overwrought basket cases all. 
 They're also the principal characters in "Death Defying Acts," the program of three effervescent one-act comedies by David Mamet, Elaine May and Woody Allen, which opened last night at the Variety Arts Theater. Who needs Broadway when Off Broadway can be as much easy and mischievous fun as this?
To be accurate about it, "Death Defying Acts" is really two extended sketches: Mr. Mamet's "Interview" and Ms. May's "Hotline," which are the program's first half, and Mr. Allen's fully developed, farcical one-act comedy, "Central Park West," which concludes the program after intermission. Though each playwright has a distinctive voice, a unifying theme is provided by the kind of late-20th-century urban desperation that prompts everything from benign smiles to belly laughs.
Also holding things together is the expert staging by Michael Blakemore, the Australian director responsible for such Broadway hits as "City of Angels," "Lettice and Lovage" and "Noises Off." The cast is a dream ensemble of comic talents headed by Linda Lavin, Paul Guilfoyle and Gerry Becker, each of whom play two or three roles, and Debra Monk, who, as a psychiatrist, barges triumphantly through "Central Park West" with the authority of an Upper West Side Queen Boadicea.
Programs of one-act plays are usually a risky business in the commercial theater. With the end of each segment and the start of the next, the program starts and stops throughout the evening. Momentum can slow; attention may wander. "Death Defying Acts" is so cannily constructed that it successfully builds from its comparatively quiet, spookily funny beginning, "An Interview," through the alternately desperate and hilarious "Hotline," to the riotous revelations of marital betrayals in "Central Park West."
It's especially good to have Ms. May back in the theater. After apparently contributing to, and sometimes salvaging, more screenplays than she ever takes credit for, she is again writing under her own name in "Hotline," which is about the common-sensical, terminally depressed hooker named Dorothy (Ms. Lavin).
"Hotline" recalls one of those classic (Mike) Nichols and May telephone sketches of the 1960's updated with the jargon of the 1990's. The stage is divided between Dorothy's sloppily barren apartment and the office at the suicide hot-line center, run by the eager but inexperienced Ken (Mr. Becker). Though Dorothy's preparing to end it all, she has ordered in one last hamburger and wants to chat with whomever she can reach on the hot line.
It's not easy. For one thing, the information operator can't find the right number, giving her instead the number of a coffee shop called the Suicide Center. Then when Dorothy does reach Ken, he's such a nitwit that she's ahead of him all the way. "Hotline" is the comic flip side of "The Human Voice," Jean Cocteau's celebrated (and possibly overrated) melodramatic monologue about a suicidal woman who won't put down the phone.
As played with furious and sarcastic spirit by Ms. Lavin, Dorothy is not easily salvageable, but she has a tenacity that magically transforms the feckless Ken into a man of action. They're both like characters seen in line drawings. The economy of detail with which they are realized provokes a kind of delight particular to theater. This is a marvelously actable stage piece.
Mr. Mamet's program opener, "An Interview," starts in Kafka territory and winds up as a blackout sketch: the Attorney (Mr. Guilfoyle), a professional hair-splitter, sits across a table from his examiner, who's identified only as the Attendant (Mr. Becker). The Attendant is a bland, utterly unflappable fellow with the self-assurance of the Stalinist interrogator in "Darkness at Noon."
In fact, he asks very few questions, allowing the increasingly panicky Attorney to talk himself not into a corner but over an abyss. "AnInterview," which is wittier than it is funny, is a shaggy dog story about the practice of law and, as such, might be taken as a kind of commentary on what's going on at the O. J. Simpson trial. The piece is acted to dry, caustic perfection by Mr. Guilfoyle and Mr. Becker.
As much as it's about anything else, including the hypothetical lawn mower, "An Interview" is about the debasement of thought through tricky language. It's a fitting introduction to a program that celebrates the art of the writer.
"Central Park West" is set in more familiar terrain. That is, the Upper West Side Mr. Allen has explored in so many film comedies, a land of big, old-fashioned apartment buildings with doormen, high ceilings, waste space and psychiatrists on every floor.
When introduced, Phyllis (Ms. Monk), a successful therapist, is steaming mad and a little bit tight. She has just broken an expensive sculpture aimed at her philandering husband, Sam (Mr. Guilfoyle), and strongly suspects her best friend, Carol (Ms. Lavin), to be Sam's latest paramour. Also participating in the evening's revels are Carol's husband, Howard (Mr. Becker), a would-be writer and manic-depressive (currently in an up mood), and the pretty, young Juliet (Tari T. Signor), one of Phyllis's former patients.
Mr. Allen has written several plays ("Don't Drink the Water," "Play It Again, Sam" and "The Floating Light Bulb"). Yet he has never written anything for the stage with quite the manic efficiency of this chef-d'oeuvre about the sexual bungles of the overarticulate. Ms. Monk and Ms. Lavin are priceless as they go to war over a man who would like to be rid of them both. Mr. Guilfoyle and Mr. Becker are splendid as the would-be guilty parties in liaisons that inevitably fail. Ms. Signor, a tall waif, is lovely in the sort of role that Juliette Lewis played in "Husbands and Wives."
The terrain may be familiar, but not the theatrical skill with which Mr. Allen sends his characters into riotous, near-lethal combat. "Central Park West" is a joy.
Though the space at the Variety Arts Theater is limited, the physical production matches the classiness of the performance, particularly the contributions of Robin Wagner, who is responsible for the sets, Jane Greenwood (costumes) and Peter Kaczorowski (lighting).
"Death Defying Acts" (a fine title, by the way) is lighter than air, an elegant diversion. I trust it will be around for a while.

HEADLINE: Babbitt Seeks to Ease Rules in Bid To Rescue Imperiled Species Law

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
With the Republican-controlled Congress preparing to rewrite the Endangered Species Act, the Clinton Administration today proposed changes intended to increase the law's flexibility and decrease its economic costs without putting rare plants and animals in greater danger of extinction.
Among other things, the Administration said it wanted to exempt from regulation activities on most small plots, like house lots, allowing owners to disturb the habitats of endangered and threatened species as long as the overall effect on the species was negligible. 
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt also called for giving more power to state governments in carrying out the law's protections, and said future decisions to list species for protection would have to be supported by independent scientific peer reviews.
His proposal boils down to this: if better science is used to understand the condition and needs of a species, more flexible ways can be found for protecting it while minimizing the disruption of human activities.
Described as a set of "guideposts" for Congress, it was the most detailed presentation yet of Mr. Babbitt's proposals for defending a law that in the current political climate sometimes seems as vulnerable as the rarest butterfly.
In the last two weeks, the House of Representatives has voted overwhelmingly to suspend all new listings of endangered species temporarily and to require that landowners be paid for any decline in property values that results from restrictions under the Endangered Species Act. The law is overdue for its periodic revision, and there are separate legislative moves afoot to cut the spending of the agencies that enforce it.
To stave off the assault, Mr. Babbitt has been changing many of the regulations that enforce the law, trying to shore up political support by protecting private property owners from the law's more onerous restrictions. The proposals he described today would expand ideas he has been testing for a year or more.
"I've never taken the position that the terms of this act are graven in bronze, never to be changed," he said. "But this act, in its basic premises, in its basic framework, is a good law."
Mr. Babbitt said that the provision adopted by the House to compensate private landowners "would simply gut the Endangered Species Act."
His proposal calls for the law to be "carried out in a manner that avoids unnecessary social and economic impacts upon private property and the regulated public, and minimizes those impacts that cannot be avoided."
Some of the ideas Mr. Babbitt proposed can only be carried out by changing the law, while others can be put into effect administratively under the existing law.
As an example of administrative changes, he said, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service, the two agencies charged with species protection, have directed that an independent scientific peer review be done for any proposal to list a species for protection and any plan to assure that a species will recover.
New guidelines are being drafted for petitions requesting protection for individual species, toughening the standard of scientific evidence in support of these proposals.
Mr. Babbitt has emphasized that the Government would make it easier for private landowners to comply with the law. For example, he wants landowners who come up with an approved plan for conserving habitats for imperiled species to be protected against later demands that they do more.
The exemptions for small landowners would exclude from regulation activities on land occupied by a single household and used solely for residential purposes; one-time activities that affect five acres of land or less, as long as the land was acquired before the species it contains was listed for protection, and other activities deemed to be negligible.
Conservationists responded cautiously to Mr. Babbitt's proposals. James Waltman, director of refuges and wildlife at the Wilderness Society, said that he was uncomfortable with the idea of giving blanket exemptions to small landowners, and that it would be better to grant such exemptions on a case-by-case basis. "Five acres can be the world to a small invertebrate," he said.

HEADLINE: A Hard Look at Corporate Welfare

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
On the same day last week that the Senate dramatically rejected a measure to force the Government to balance the budget, an obscure Federal agency was accepting last-minute requests for annual handouts from some of America's largest businesses.
As a result, the Campbell Soup Company, which receives $500,000 a year from the Government, will most likely be using taxpayer money once again to help advertise V-8 Juice and soup in Argentina. 
 Although complaints of dubious drains on the Treasury are a staple of political life, the Republican takeover of Congress and the prospect of deficits running $200 billion or more for at least the rest of the decade have raised the level of urgency about continued subsidies to business through direct Government payments and indirect tax breaks.
Concern over the issue has brought together such rare allies as the Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich, one of the most liberal members of the Clinton Administration, and the Cato Institute, a conservative group with a strongly libertarian cast.
"At the same time that we are trying to cut welfare and make sure we get people into work, we ought to take a look at aid for dependent corporations -- and there's a lot of it in this country," Mr. Reich said earlier this year.
"Corporate pork is pervasive," the Cato Institute said in a report issued today. Every major department, it added, "has become a repository for Government funding of private industry."
The obscure agricultural subsidy is a prime example. Not only is Campbell Soup a major beneficiary, but the Pet Food Institute also expects to receive about $1 million, some of it to be used to wean Japan's dogs from table scraps to Friskies. And the U.S.A. Rice Federation will use part of its anticipated $3 million to promote Uncle Ben's, a brand belonging to Mars Inc., the confectionery giant, in places like Turkey, Poland and Saudi Arabia.
"All the majors are on the program," said Jim Willis, vice president of the Houston-based rice group, which represents producers and processors.
What Mr. Willis is referring to is the market promotion program operated by the Foreign Agricultural Service. In all, it dispenses about $100 million a year to help American business interests overcome quotas or other trade barriers in selling their agricultural products abroad.
While many companies do not acknowledge participation -- it is not a matter of public record when they operate through trade associations -- the program is fiercely defended by many users as crucial to success and, in some cases, to survival.
"Exports have gone up tremendously," said Larry Graham, president of the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, who noted that foreign sales jumped to $520 million last year from less than $100 million a decade earlier. For rice, which suddenly lost 20 percent of its exports with the embargo against Iraq, Mr. Willis said that without the promotion program his industry would be "in a marginal state of trying to survive."
Yet this effort, passionately defended as it is, pales in comparison with the full panoply of Federal largesse for business. According to the Cato Institute, the Washington-based free-market research organization, the total outlays on such programs will exceed $86.2 billion this year.
Moreover, this does not include tax breaks, which the Progressive Policy Institute, an arm of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, contends are just as large. The institute today published "Cut and Invest: A Budget Strategy for the New Economy," which lists possible savings over five years totaling $265 billion.
Among the multibillion-dollar items noted by the two groups are grants for energy research and supply and for airports and waste-water treatment plants. From both sides of the political aisle, the two groups also zero in on income tax exemptions worth more than $18 billion over five years for companies, mostly prescription drug manufacturers, earning money in Puerto Rico and other offshore territories.
The Government also builds roads in national forests to make it easier for private industry to bring out timber, gives low-interest loans through the Rural Electrification Administration that hold down the cost of running ski resorts in Aspen, Colo., and casinos in Las Vegas, Nev., and is providing $333 million to help American automobile manufacturers create a new generation of "clean" cars to help keep them competitive.
Still, despite all the complaints from Washington think tanks, little is done to curb the practices. Many of them are popular with politically influential businesses and other groups that are heavy contributors to both Republicans and Democrats. And nearly all of them are defended as necessary to help support the economy. Indeed, Mr. Reich has so far found little support from others in the Clinton Administration for his repeated calls to end the corporate welfare practices he decries.
For instance, there has been only a modest paring back in some energy research programs. The White House, worried about a political backlash in states critical to Mr. Clinton's re-election, rejected a recommendation by Hazel R. O'Leary, the Energy Secretary, that the Government sell the Tennessee Valley Authority and other Federal agencies that market low-cost power in several regions of the country, including the Northwest.
The Clinton budget "does not substantially cut spending for any significant constituency," said Robert J. Shapiro, a founder of the Progressive Policy Institute and a principal economic adviser to the President's 1992 campaign.
In fact, the Administration has requested an extra $500 million to expand the Technology Reinvestment Project, a military conversion program using subsidies to help develop civilian technologies. Among the 1994 recipients were Texas Instruments Inc., which got $13 million, and the Chrysler Corporation, which got $6 million.
On the other hand, Secretary Reich's specific challenge in November to the capital's research organizations to produce their own lists of corporate targets has been eagerly accepted.
Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel of the Cato Institute said they found 127 Government programs that provided subsidies to particular companies or industries.
Cato does not include tax expenditures in its calculations because it wants them to be abolished by fundamental tax reform rather than considered in conjunction with spending cuts.
But these groups and others generally agree that subsidies are poor policy on various grounds, among them that governments around the world have repeatedly failed in attempts to "pick winners" and that subsidies divert resources from more productive uses, corrupt the political process and often raise costs to consumers.
While not expecting immediate success in breaking the political stalemate over subsidies, Mr. Shapiro said he was encouraged over what he called the convergence of thinking at the policy level. Indeed, the failure of the balanced budget amendment, he said, could force its supporters into trying to do something promptly to preserve credibility.
In any case, corporate largesse at its current scale is inevitably doomed, Mr. Shapiro contended, since it represents the last sizable source of money "before you get to entitlements" like Social Security.

HEADLINE: Mexico Says Ex-Aide Impeded Inquiry on Brother's Killing

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 6

 BODY:
The Government announced today that it had charged a former Deputy Attorney General, Mario Ruiz Massieu, with impeding the investigation he conducted into the assassination last fall of his own brother, a leader of Mexico's governing party.
The action represented a potentially explosive turn in the inquiry. The prosecutors asserted that while Mr. Ruiz Massieu was serving as a close aide to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the former President, he intimidated witnesses and falsified evidence to keep Mr. Salinas's elder brother from appearing as a crucial suspect in the case. 
 Responding to a preliminary extradition request from the Mexican Government, a Federal magistrate in Newark ordered today that Mr. Ruiz Massieu be held without bail pending hearings on his possible return to Mexico. He was arrested on a customs charge Friday night as he prepared to board a plane from Newark to Madrid with more than $ 40,000 in cash.
A lawyer for Mr. Ruiz Massieu said he would seek political asylum in the United States.
In an important finding in Mexico today, officials said a judge ruled that the Government had enough evidence to prosecute former President Salinas's brother, Raul Salinas de Gortari, for ordering the slaying on Sept. 28 of Mr. Ruiz Massieu's brother, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
According to senior officials, some of the Government's strongest evidence against Raul Salinas comes from witnesses and documents that have been available to the Attorney General's office for months.
"Mario knew about all of it right away," one official said. Why Mr. Ruiz Massieu might have hidden the information, he added, "is something that we are going to find out."
The Government of President Ernesto Zedillo did not comment publicly today on whether it believed Carlos Salinas might be implicated in the case. But two officials, speaking on the condition that they not be identified, said there were indications that Mario Ruiz Massieu had briefed the former President extensively about his investigation.
The Goverment's move to prosecute Mr. Ruiz Massieu appeared to have begun just as Carlos Salinas ended a brief, bizarre hunger strike that he said was meant to defend his honor.
In making the protest, Mr. Salinas said he wanted the Zedillo administration to stop blaming him for the country's three-month-old economic crisis and admit the importance of its own mistakes. He also demanded that the Government clear him of any responsibility for what it described as efforts to cover up another political slaying last year, that of the governing party's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio.
Throughout, Mr. Salinas insisted that the hunger strike had nothing to do with the arrest of his brother Raul, which brought an end to decades in which former Mexican leaders and their families enjoyed virtual immunity from prosecution for corruption and other crimes. But some officials speculated that Mr. Salinas may have meant the hunger strike as a signal of the lengths to which he would go to try to save his tattered reputation.
In a complaint filed on Mexico's behalf, the United States Attorney's office in Newark said the Mexican Government had evidence that Mario Ruiz Massieu had pressed two major suspects in the investigation to change their testimony to protect Raul Salinas. Mexican officials also said they had documentary evidence and accounts from prosecutors and others that corroborated the suspects' assertions.
While Government officials have said there is some evidence of a connection between the two assassination cases, the possible ties remain unclear.
The conspiracy theories swirling around both of them have included governing-party politicians and powerful drug traffickers as possible suspects. Increasingly, however, the Government has described the slaying of Jose Ruiz Massieu as a result of a personal feud between Raul Salinas and the victim.
The elder Mr. Ruiz Massieu was a close friend and political ally of Carlos Salinas from the time the two finished their studies at the national university. He was also married for a time to Adriana Salinas de Gortari, the younger sister of Carlos and Raul.
Yet while Carlos Salinas said in an interview last week that Raul Salinas and Jose Ruiz Massieu had a "respectful" relationship, friends of Mr. Ruiz Massieu said the two men had disliked each other for years and had sometimes fought bitterly.
According to documents from Jose Ruiz Massieu's personal files that officials said were taken into evidence shortly after his death, the two men began to clash as early as 1987 over what Mr. Ruiz Massieu, then beginning a six-year term as Governor of the western state of Guerrero, took to be corrupt dealings by Raul Salinas.
Among the documents are a hand-written letter from the Governor to Carlos Salinas after he became President in December 1988 voicing outrage at a legal suit filed against the state government by a subordinate of Raul Salinas.
By then, Raul Salinas had been installed as a senior official of a powerful food-distribution agency called Conasupo. But in an annex to the letter, Jose Ruiz Massieu appears to suggest that the legal suit was an attempt at revenge by Raul Salinas for the Governor's having previously denied him and a man described as his business associate, Roberto Gonzalez Barrera, a lucrative contract to build a corn-flour production plant in the state.
A spokesman for Mr. Gonzalez Barrera, the billionaire owner of a huge corn-processing company called Maseca, said he had no immediate comment on the matter.
A Government official who was a friend of Jose Ruiz Massieu said he also clashed with Raul Salinas over the construction of a $ 2 billion toll road through Guerrero and a huge real-estate development in the Guerrero resort city of Acapulco, called Punta Diamante.
Both Maseca and the big construction company that won a one-third share of the highway construction project, Grupo Tribasa, have also been tied in the past to the family of one of the governing party's richest old-guard politicians, Carlos Hank Gonzalez, who served as Agriculture Minister under Mr. Salinas. Mr. Hank's eldest son, Carlos Hank Rohn, serves on the boards of both companies.
Late on Sunday night, the Mexican Government sent a diplomatic note to the United States State Department saying that it would seek the extradition of Mario Ruiz Massieu, who was arrested on Friday night at Newark International Airport for filing a false customs declaration.
American officials had been alerted to Mr. Ruiz Massieu's movements by Mexican officials who say he intended to flee to Monaco, which has no extradition treaty with Mexico. A Justice Department official said American agents lost his trail after he flew to Houston on Thursday night, but he was apprehended as he prepared to board a plane bound for Madrid with his wife, their 6-year-old daughter and $ 46,000 in cash. That was more than double the amount of American and Mexican currency he had claimed to be carrying.
At Mexico's request, the Justice Department filed a provisional warrant today seeking Mario Ruiz Massieu's extradition. At a hearing in United States District Court in Newark this afternoon, a Federal magistrate, Ronald J. Hedges, ordered that he be held without bail at the Metropolitan Corrections Center in Manhattan pending another hearing on March 14.
The Mexican authorities have 60 days to present a formal extradition request. Mr. Ruiz Massieu also faces a single charge of filing a false customs declaration, which carries a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment and a fine of $ 250,000.
Mario Ruiz Massieu left Mexico on Thursday night shortly after completing six hours of testimony to the police about how Raul Salinas had managed never to appear in any of the witness statements or other evidence gathered in his investigation.
Adding to the Government's suspicions about his conduct, one official said that before leaving Mario Ruiz Massieu had large amounts of money deposited for himself in several banks. Mario Ruiz Massieu's personal secretary, Maria Dolores Mota, said she knew nothing of any such deposits.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS TO CLOSE A FLORIDA PLANT

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation will close its plant in Titusville, Fla., putting 1,000 people out of work, because of the loss of a $1 billion missile contract, company officials said yesterday. The plant will be shut down later this year as production of the Navy's Tomahawk cruise missiles winds down. Military cutbacks are also causing the company to close a plant in St. Charles, Mo., where 800 workers make electrical and ground support equipment for aircraft and missile systems. About 300 employees will be laid off and 500 will be reassigned, the company said.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Secretary of State's Bleeding Ulcer Illustrates Arthritis Drug Problem

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. 

 BODY:
THE bleeding stomach ulcer that Secretary of State Warren Christopher suffered as a complication of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug he took for arthritis vividly illustrates the dangers of such drugs.
Complications of these drugs, referred to by doctors as Nsaid's (pronounced EN-seds), are a significant public health problem. The complications have been described in a medical journal as the most prevalent serious drug toxicity in the United States. Each year such complications lead to about 41,000 hospitalizations and 3,300 deaths, studies show. They are a principal reason for the procedure known as gastroscopy, which Mr. Christopher underwent, in which doctors pass a tube through the mouth into the stomach to diagnose stomach disorders. 
 Mr. Christopher's ulcer sent him to the intensive care unit of Ottawa Civic Hospital during President Clinton's visit to Canada last month. Doctors there said the ulcer had been caused by complications of Ansaid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug made by the Upjohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich. It is one of 25 Nsaid's approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration.
On his return to Washington, Mr. Christopher, 69, checked into Georgetown University Hospital for overnight observation. Now back at work, Mr. Christopher is to leave today on a trip to the Middle East. It will be another month before the ulcer is completely healed.
Mr. Christopher was luckier than many who develop a bleeding ulcer due to an Nsaid. The death rate from such complications is about 8 to 10 percent, said Dr. Marie R. Griffin, an expert on the epidemiology of drugs at Vanderbilt University in Nashville who has carried out studies on Nsaid usage.
About 3.4 percent of the 2.2 billion prescriptions written each year are for Nsaid's. Millions more nonprescription Nsaid's are bought as over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, which are often used for short-term use to relieve inflammation and pain from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Nsaid's are among the oldest commercial drugs still on the market; aspirin and another Nsaid, sodium salicylic acid, were developed in the 19th century. In the 1950's, drug companies began marketing the first newer ones and the numbers have been increasing ever since. The latest Nsaid approved was in 1993.
Among people aged 65 and over, half have pain or swelling in at least one joint. Rheumatologists say it would be harder to give patients relief if Nsaid's were not available. Their use is expected to increase as more people live longer.
But some experts say that aggressive marketing practices of drug companies have made Nsaid's too popular and that many people could get as much relief with fewer adverse effects and at less cost if they took milder drugs like acetaminophen (Tylenol), which is not an Nsaid. Some prescription Nsaid's cost 12 times more than over-the-counter ibuprofen.
On any day, 10 to 15 percent of Americans aged 65 and older have a filled prescription for an Nsaid.
Although Nsaid's have merit, they should be prescribed and used cautiously with the risks explained to each patient, said Dr. Janet Woodcock, a rheumatologist and official of the Food and Drug Administration.
Dr. Stuart Nightingale, an associate commissioner of the F.D.A., has cited studies showing that bleeding ulcers develop in about 1 percent of those who use the drugs for three to six months, and from 2 to 4 percent of those who use them for a year.
Studies also have shown that those who use the drugs have a four times greater risk of developing an ulcer than nonusers in all age groups. Complications of the drugs lead to 30 percent of the hospitalizations and deaths from ulcers in people aged 65 and older in this country, Dr. Griffin said. The remaining 70 percent are caused by a bacterium, Helicobacter pylori.
"It appears that you are at about the same risk in the first month of taking an Nsaid as in the 12th or 24th, not getting any worse or better," Dr. Woodcock said. With some drugs, like sulfa or penicillin, the risk of a catastrophic event is highest when it is first taken.
The Arthritis Foundation in Atlanta says, "No single Nsaid is guaranteed to work; you may have to try several types before you find one that works for you."
The foundation advises users of the drugs who are bothered by repeated nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, heartburn, gas, bloating, constipation and diarrhea to check with their doctors.
The Medical Letter, a respected review of drugs and therapeutics published in New Rochelle, N.Y., warns that these drugs may interact to decrease the effectiveness of many other drugs that are used to lower high blood pressure. Doctors also warn that the interaction of Nsaid drugs with alcohol or aspirin can be harmful.
It is not clear whether some drugs in the group are more likely than others to cause complications. Dr. Woodcock said the F.D.A. is studying reports that piroxicam (Feldene) may cause a higher rate of intestinal bleeding than others.
The National Kidney Foundation in New York City has expressed concern about the increased risk of kidney failure from chronic use of the drugs.
Over all, Dr. Griffin said, "the adverse effect rate is pretty high for a drug that is not curative and used mainly to relieve symptoms." She said the complication rate of the drugs was about that of anti-coagulant drugs that are used to prevent blood clots and for which doctors generally exercise greater precaution.
Dr. Gerald Weissmann, a rheumatologist at New York University, said: "All the newer Nsaid's are safer than aspirin and are valuable when used under a doctor's observation for defined inflammatory arthritis," but that they are overused by people who take them for more non-specific reasons.
Most doctors believe that the benefits of daily use outweigh the risks for those who get substantial relief. But studies indicate that many people take more than they need to get relief.
Concern also exists for those who seem to get only a modest or marginal benefit from the drugs and for the many patients who are unclear why they are taking them.
"Many people have a misconception about how good these drugs are," Dr. Griffin said. "For some people they work great, for other people they don't work that well. We and many others who treat elderly people believe that the complication rate is high and that they should probably try acetaminophen first" because it affords about the same relief for osteoarthritis as the prescription and nonprescription medications.
Chronic use of acetaminophen, or Tylenol, however, has its own set of problems.
In criticizing studies of Nsaid's, Dr. P. A. Dieppe and his colleagues from the University of Bristol in England have written in The Lancet, "We still know very little about the causes, diagnosis, natural history, and appropriate management of osteoarthritis."
Most studies of the drugs last only a few weeks, while the pain of the condition is present for months or years in most cases. Few studies have compared the effectiveness of an Nsaid with that of a pure analgesic like Tylenol, and "one of the main reasons for this paucity of comparative studies of simple analgesics and Nsaid's must be the vested interests of the pharmaceutical industry," Dr. Dieppe's team wrote.
Large trials are needed, but the money for them is unlikely to come from drug companies, they said.
A major reason for the widespread use of the drugs is that dealing with arthritis is frustrating for patients and doctors. Many arthritics get incomplete relief of pain, and doctors and patients want to do something to improve their quality of life. So doctors are continually tempted to try new drugs, even when their effect is symptomatic and does not address the root cause of the disease.
Each new drug that comes on the market is advertised as easier on the stomach than its predecessors, leading doctors and patients to try it in the hope that this will be the drug that really helps.
But head-to-head studies have shown little difference in effectiveness between the many available, Dr. Griffin said, and only ibuprofen has been found consistently safer than the other drugs, presumably because individuals take it in smaller amounts than they do the others.
Doctors and patients often overlook many alternatives like exercise, weight loss and measures to relieve the load on affected joints, Dr. Griffin said, adding, "They take much time and are harder to comply with than taking a pill."
Doctors also tend to underestimate the dangers of these drugs, largely because the overwhelming majority of their patients do not have trouble and when they do develop ulcers and other complications they do not always link them to the drugs, Dr. Griffin said.
Dr. Woodcock said that her drug agency was trying to find new ways to provide information about the drugs people use. For many years, she said, "there was a complacency where many people seemed to take all kinds of drugs and consumers did not recognize that they could result in bad adverse reactions."

HEADLINE: In Chaotic City Hospitals, A Bureaucracy to Match

SERIES: Mismanaged Care: A Health System in Peril -- Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET and JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
When New York City's public hospitals underwent their last major reorganization more than 25 years ago, civic leaders renewed a longstanding promise to bring medical care for the poor up to the standards of the best private hospitals.
Faced with financial mismanagement, squalid conditions and a bureaucracy out of control, they drew up plans for a sleek, modern business unfettered by politics: the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. Forged in the more magnanimous era of the Great Society, the public corporation was to insure the most generous medical services of any American city. 
 "We all know that New York's problems are the toughest in the world," Joseph T. English, the new corporation's first leader, said shortly after his appointment in 1970. "And it has the courage, guts and imagination where no one else is willing to try."
The system that emerged is now under attack for both its ideology and its cost. But long before the change in political sentiment, New York's public hospitals were moving toward a crisis of their own making, with problems that had a familiar ring.
The plans of nearly 30 years ago fell apart almost from the beginning. The corporation was supposed to be a temporary vehicle to improve the troubled public hospitals before placing them under private management. Instead, it became a permanent bureaucracy hampered by political meddling, as troubled as the one it was supposed to replace.
And rather than addressing serious problems that have arisen over the decades, its administrators have allowed them to linger. As a result, the system is vulnerable, both to economic forces and a more conservative era in New York politics.
Delivery room disasters reported by The New York Times over the last two days are only the most dramatic examples of chronic trouble. Many of the system's 11 hospitals operate on the edge, barely meeting the minimum standards of the national agency that evaluates them.
In the last three years, two of the hospitals -- Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the Bronx and Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center in Brooklyn -- have lost their accreditations because of poor care and unsafe conditions, then regained them. Three others received only conditional approval.
Doctors seethe with frustration over their daily struggle against a bureaucracy that seems bent on defeating them. Dr. Janet Mitchell, who treats high-risk pregnant women at Harlem Hospital Center, routinely orders two, and sometimes three, copies of the same test to increase the odds that she will actually get the results.
The health care agency is one of the city's most enduring and unwieldy bureaucracies, with a $3.8 billion budget and layers of central office staff and consultants. It employs nearly 50,000 people in a far-flung network of 11 hospitals, 76 clinics and 5 chronic care centers.
As this vast system struggles with problems large and small, the health care marketplace is changing all around it.
Nationally, health care is moving away from the kind of expensive and comprehensive services offered by big hospitals like those in the Health and Hospitals Corporation. In Albany, Gov. George E. Pataki has pledged deep cuts in Medicaid, the major source of revenue for the public hospitals.
In the city, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wants even deeper Medicaid cuts and has announced plans to sell 3 of the 11 hospitals. He is considering closing others. And he has said that the city should consider getting out of the hospital business altogether, a suggestion that would have been unimaginable a decade ago.
"By and large, the city should be in the role of provider of last resort," Mr. Giuliani said last week, "meaning, to cover the populations that aren't being covered; and, secondly, as a regulator of standards."
Supporters of the system say such a realignment would represent a retreat from New York's longstanding promise of equal medical care for rich and poor. They say the public hospitals would face the fate that generations of officials have tried to prevent: becoming dumping grounds nobody wants, struggling with the complex problems of the least desirable patients -- drug addicts, prisoners, the homeless and the mentally ill.
"You're going to end up with hospitals that are lousy, in the worst sections of the city," said Dr. Billy E. Jones, who headed the hospital corporation for 18 months at the end of the Dinkins administration. "And nobody's going to want to work in them."
Under Mr. Giuliani's plan, private institutions would have to take on a greater load of the city's poor and working-class patients, a burden that some critics say the private hospitals are unlikely to accept without pressure.
Even the Mayor's choice to head the hospitals corporation, Dr. Bruce Siegel, who took over a year ago, questioned whether New York's private hospitals would be willing to treat the toughest cases.
"Would they take care of every undocumented immigrant we now take care of?" he said during a series of interviews. "Would they take care of the city's AIDS patients? Could they do it? Theoretically.
"Would they do it? I don't know."
 
The Corporation
From the First, Power Struggles
 New York City has run public hospitals for more than 200 years. Its earliest hospitals, like Bellevue, which opened in 1736, were regarded as national models of compassionate care for the poor. But by the early 20th century, the hospitals had weathered waves of scandal and recurring reports of Dickensian conditions.
With each scandal came plans for reform. The most recent was in 1967, when a city commission chaired by Gerard Piel, the publisher of Scientific American magazine, concluded that conditions in the hospitals -- 20 of them at the time -- were "deplorable."
The commission recommended that the city turn over hospital management to some of the city's best private institutions. The Health and Hospitals Corporation was created to unite the hospitals, which were run by several city departments, under one agency that would be independent from City Hall. The agency, in turn, was supposed to affiliate each public hospital with a private partner, and then dissolve. The city would then pay the private hospitals a management fee and monitor their performance.
The commission did not want to sell off the public hospitals because the city would then lose ultimate control of medical care for the poor. Then, as now, the city was skeptical of private business's commitment to quality care for all.
The plan barely got off the ground before labor unions and local politicians began to exert influence. They persuaded City Hall to let the corporation continue as part of a hybrid arrangement, in which administrators hired by the city and doctors from the private institutions co-managed public hospitals. This arrangement left thousands of nonprofessional and union jobs under the city's control.
It also set the stage for management turmoil that continues to this day, and a daily struggle for control of the wards and clinics of the public hospitals.
"You could never tell who was in charge of the hospitals," said Mr. Piel, the system's architect. The divided leadership hampered the hospital system from the start, he said. "I've always denied paternity of that corporation."
Beyond the struggle, questions have been repeatedly raised over the years about whether the private hospitals and medical schools have lived up to their part of the bargain.
"I can't tell you right now with a straight face that we get $475 million worth of service from the affiliates," said Dr. Siegel, the 34-year-old internist who now runs the system.
In a series of interviews, Dr. Siegel, the former New Jersey Commissioner of Health, accused the private institutions of using New York City's money to finance arcane specialties for their residency programs, the teaching regimens for young doctors. These specialty departments -- he described them as a "luxurious maze of clinics with very few patients in them" -- have little to do with the needs of the communities they serve, he said.
As a result, he said, the system actually has too many doctors over all but not enough in more mundane, yet crucial, sections of the hospitals.
In particular, he expressed dismay that the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, a highly regarded medical school, has escaped public criticism for the role it played in the disintegration of Harlem Hospital Center, its public partner.
"We have a hospital that basically didn't develop what it needed, and paid the price, because people stopped going there," Dr. Siegel said. "Nobody wants to take responsibility for what happened. I'm willing to take some of the burden for H.H.C., but where was the affiliate all these years."
Dr. Edward B. Healton, an associate dean at Columbia and the medical director of Harlem Hospital, said the hospital's decline has been exaggerated by the city. But, he acknowledged: "Columbia is a big institution. Certainly, there are times when we'd have liked the university to pay attention to the Harlem affiliation."
One of the major problems over the years, by Dr. Siegel's account, is that no one leading the public system has had the will to challenge the "barons of American medicine" who run the city's prestigious private hospitals and force them to realign their services.
"I think the fundamental flaw is that you have a low-power, low-prestige organization -- the public hospitals of New York -- paying a large sum for professional services to a series of high-power, very high-prestige organizations in New York," he said. "It's a very unequal relationship." For example, the city is financially liable for the mistakes private doctors make at the public hospitals.
But Dr. Siegel and others inside the system concede that the hospitals corporation has done little to monitor the care being provided in its hospitals, despite repeated warnings from state regulators and others.
For example, one regulatory report after another has criticized the corporation for permitting Kings County Hospital Center, the busiest hospital in the system, to be dominated by inexperienced doctors just out of medical school. Those trainees receive little guidance from more experienced physicians, many of whom are provided by the State University Health Science Center, Brooklyn, the reports say.
"Kings County is terrible," said Dr. Jeremiah A. Barondess, president of the New York Academy of Medicine, who warned of the supervision problems in his sweeping 1992 study of the city hospitals.
In 1993, a resident at Kings County hospital two years out of medical school waited too long to help a patient who was severely short of breath, state reports show. The patient developed seizures and died.
A year earlier, regulators said, a third-year Kings County resident ignored a senior doctor's requests and declined to order a brain scan for a 73-year-old woman who complained of chest pains. The woman also died.
Officials of North Central Bronx Hospital, including Emilio Morante, its executive director, said they repeatedly went to their private affiliate, Montefiore Medical Center, to complain that poorly supervised midwives were handling deliveries far too complicated for their training. But, the North Central Bronx officials said, the complaints were not taken seriously.
"It was so bad that we were afraid we would lose our accreditation," said Mr. Morante, who left the hospital late last year.
Montefiore officials said the midwives provided high-quality care.
 
 
The Leadership
Problems Outlast Faces at the Top
 The main reason the corporation fails to solve its problems, even when they are obvious, is the lack of consistent leadership. There have been 14 presidents in 25 years.
"The turnover is too frequent to call it managed," said Edna Wells Handy, who was the hospital corporation's lawyer until a year ago. "It's too unstable. It's too fractured."
Former presidents say that by the time they came to understand the byzantine system and its myriad problems, political pressures had forced them out of their jobs.
Dr. Jones, the former corporation president, said that few administrators, including himself, were around long enough to gain control of the bureaucracy. "All you have to do is outlast the president, which usually takes no more than two or three years," he said.
Dr. Siegel, too, acknowledged that the agency's churning leadership had trouble getting things done. "Things don't get fixed," he said, because of a "lack of continuity, lack of leadership, changing faces."
The story of Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center illustrates how a clearly identified problem can outlive generations of corporation leaders. The hospital has been regarded as an embarrassment for 25 years, even before it opened. Twice in the last six years, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the industry group that inspects hospitals, has refused to accredit Woodhull, citing poor care and management failures.
Through one crisis after another, Woodhull has been run by a private corporation, Woodhull Medical Associates, which receives $42 million a year from the city.
In the summer of 1993, Dr. Jones and other corporation officials found that Woodhull had committed a grievous offense: Someone had rewritten internal records in a way that seemed to conceal serious lapses in care.
Shortly afterward, the hospital corporation announced that Woodhull Medical Associates was out, and that a task force would find a new management team.
Dr. Siegel said that he made numerous management changes at Woodhull in the last few months, and that the corporation was still trying to find someone willing to replace Woodhull Medical Associates.
"We're getting rid of it slowly," Dr. Siegel said. "We're not doing it overnight. We're actually going through and looking at it department by department, how to get rid of it. We can't do that overnight. But we are doing it. And let that be on the record."
 
 
The Politics
A System Mired In Patronage
 As it has grown, the health care agency that was supposed to be free from politics has come to be dominated by patronage. Norman Steisel, a deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins, called the hospitals corporation "the last great bastion of patronage in the city."
For example, Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, perennially portrayed by regulators as one of the worst hospitals in the system, has long been the fief of Ramon S. Velez, a South Bronx power broker. Hospital officials acknowledge that Lincoln is packed with Mr. Velez's allies.
Even the Giuliani administration, while attacking the hospitals corporation as antiquated and wasteful, has not resisted using it to reward political friends.
Last year, Leonard R. Piccoli was named an assistant director of North Central Bronx Hospital, even though hospital officials said they did not need another administrator. Mr. Piccoli is a former hospital manager, as well as a former top aide to State Senator Guy J. Velella, the Bronx County Republican leader, who supported the Mayor in his election effort.
"We created the job for him," said Mr. Morante, formerly executive director of the hospital. "They gave me instructions to create a deputy's slot for him. Siegel called and said he was between a rock and a hard place, and was under pressure from City Hall to take on Piccoli."
Mr. Morante said that Mr. Piccoli, at a salary of $90,000, was forced on North Central Bronx at a time when the hospital needed to cut more than $8 million from its budget.
Dr. Siegel acknowledged that he gave Mr. Piccoli's name to North Central Bronx officials, though he said he did not recall speaking to Mr. Morante. He recalled having received Mr. Piccoli's resume from City Hall, but said he did not pressure the hospital to hire him.
Through a spokeswoman for the health care agency, Mr. Piccoli declined to be interviewed.
While the corporation is dominated by the Mayor, the individual hospitals hew to powerful local interests, from community groups to City Council members and state legislators. Each hospital must navigate through local politics when making most major decisions, from appointing top hospital officials to deciding which departments to shut down.
"The hospitals are not just hospitals in these communities," said Mr. Steisel, the former deputy mayor. "They are police stations; they're welfare offices."
The result is an agency paralyzed by its need to win a consensus on every decision, no matter how mundane. Metropolitan Hospital Center in East Harlem, for instance, could not pick a new director of nursing without a series of meetings with community leaders who were concerned about the ethnic backgrounds of the candidates.
The clearest example is the city's inability to shrink any of its hospitals, even those that are underused. Most experts have long agreed there is no longer a need for 11 hospitals, some just a few miles away from others. During the Dinkins administration, Mr. Steisel said, "There was a general feeling that many of the hospitals were redundant."
But no one was willing to publicly single out a particular hospital for closing, he recalled. "There was a general feeling that politically, you couldn't do it."
 
The Future
Fearing the Worst: Modern Asylums
 It seems certain that there will soon be fewer public hospitals. Mayor Giuliani will have little trouble finding buyers for at least two of the hospitals he has put up for sale -- Elmhurst Hospital Center and Coney Island Hospital.
For many New Yorkers, the disappearance of public hospitals will have little impact. In working- and middle-class neighborhoods, patients who could pay for better care or had insurance abandoned them long ago.
More recently, private hospitals, desperate to fill their own beds, have begun wooing the most lucrative of the hospital corporation's remaining constituents -- Medicaid recipients. At least partly for that reason, 8 of the 11 hospitals in the system have lost patients over the last decade.
But some experts say the private hospitals will not want to treat some patients, like the homeless, drug abusers and the mentally ill, whose presence might scare off other patients.
"Are there people who are undesirable, people who they don't want?" said Robert D. Gumbs, executive director of the state-financed Health Systems Agency, which examines health care trends. "Yes. The corporation could be left with that, the uninsured and the undesirable."
As the Mayor makes over the city's health care system, Mr. Gumbs and other planners say, one of his biggest challenges will be to find a place for these patients. They number in the hundreds of thousands.
By all accounts, Mr. Giuliani will have to come up with a package of financial incentives and new laws to force private hospitals to take on more of the patients they do not want. And, the planners say, the administration may have to fashion a pared-down public system to treat the worst cases.
The most difficult task will be keeping those public hospitals from degenerating into modern-day asylums, the kinds of places the city set out to eliminate decades ago. Some of the Mayor's critics look to the future and warn of squalid hospitals with relentless problems that will repel most doctors and all but the most desperate patients.
Even before confronting this daunting task, the Mayor will have to overcome some more basic obstacles -- the nitty-gritty details of selling huge public institutions, the inevitable outcry from neighborhoods whose economies are driven by public hospitals and the opposition of political opponents.
For one thing, when Mayor Giuliani begins breaking apart the system to sell its pieces, he is likely to find that many hospitals will have no takers.
"Who's going to buy Woodhull?" asked Dr. Jones, the corporation's former president.
Beyond that, some members of the corporation's board, particularly those aligned with former Mayor Dinkins, are angry that Mr. Giuliani announced his plan to sell hospitals without telling them first.
"We read about it in the press," said Dr. James R. Dumpson, a board member and longtime Dinkins ally. Dr. Dumpson said that Mayor Giuliani must get a majority of votes before shaking up the system, though he acknowledged that mayors generally get their way with the board.
Dr. Siegel himself has expressed reservations about the idea of selling or shutting down hospitals.
In interviews before the Mayor's plan was announced, Dr. Siegel said he was not yet willing to give up on the corporation. He outlined proposals for sweeping changes that he hopes will revitalize the system, like shutting down little-used services and getting tougher with the private affiliates.
He also said it was time for the corporation to return to the model first proposed by Mr. Piel's commission -- recasting itself as an independent body free from City Hall's meddling and swings in political philosophy.
"My sense is the city wants to get out of the hospital business," he said. "And that's fine. I want the city out of my business."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 19, 1995, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A chart on March 7 about the tenures of the presidents of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation misstated the disposition of a case against John J. McLaughlin, who was president in 1984 and 1985. Although he was convicted of charges involving the theft of profits from a private investment fund, the verdict was later set aside by an appeals court, which ruled that the prosecutors had not proved jurisdiction in the case.

HEADLINE: A Well-Founded Fear

BYLINE: By Geraldine Brooks; Geraldine Brooks is author of "Nine Parts of Desire: The Hidden World of Islamic Women."

 BODY:
She makes women's clothes. In today's Algeria, that is a political act, and potentially a fatal one. Until last year, when she abandoned her market stall in Algiers, 38-year-old Naima Belahi imported fabric from France and Italy and sewed it into beaded evening gowns or stylish short dresses. Then, last March 10th, Algeria's Islamic insurgents ordered all women to veil themselves within a week or risk becoming legitimate targets of murder. The day after the deadline, militants killed a 16-year-old high school student who was walking to class without a head scarf.
Ms. Belahi, visiting the U.S. at the time, was afraid to return home. She neither makes nor wears the shroudlike Islamic dress that must cover the female body. To do so, she feels, would be to signal agreement with the extremists. She has taken refuge with a Connecticut family and applied for political asylum. 
 Unfortunately for Ms. Belahi, her case has fallen into a chaotic system that almost never considers persecution of women a basis for asylum. Despite growing worldwide abuse of women by religious extremists -- not just in Algeria but also in Afghanistan, Sudan, the Gaza Strip and Saudi Arabia -- the Immigration and Naturalization Service works from a sketchy manual that advises against accepting most sex-based claims.
Asylum seekers must show a "well-founded fear of persecution." This can be based on race, religion, nationality or political views. Less commonly, it can be based on membership in a "particular social group" that is subject to abuse.
In Algeria, more than 50 women have been killed since the Islamic insurgency began in 1992. Many more have been knifed or raped for working alongside men or wearing Western dress. The murdered women have included the principal of a co-ed school, a secretary who worked at a police station to support her unemployed siblings and a 22-year-old woman wearing jeans and buying cigarettes -- enough to identify her to the militants as a "prostitute."
Yet when an Algerian doctor applied for asylum here this year, saying she had been threatened with death because she supervised male physicians, the I.N.S. case officer said that violence in Algeria was "too random" to support her claim to belong to a "particular social group" at risk of persecution.
If Algeria's violence is considered too random to warrant asylum, awkward questions arise about countries -- including a close U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia -- where abuse of women is systemic. In 1993, after almost two years of deliberation, Canada granted asylum to a Saudi student known as Nada who had argued that she risked flogging and imprisonment for walking in the street with her hair and face uncovered. In the U.S., asylum experts say that Nada's predicament would most likely have been viewed by the I.N.S. as a matter of cultural mores rather than as persecution.
But substitute race for sex and the American position seems untenable. Imagine a country half black and half white, where the blacks may not legally leave the house without a white's permission, or where they may be caned in the street for refusing to wear the official segregating dress. That is the situation for women in Saudi Arabia.
Last spring, some experts in immigration law at Harvard Law School submitted guidelines on asylum for women to the I.N.S. with the hope that they might become the basis for a fairer assessment of claims of persecution. With anti-immigrant sentiment rampant in the Republican Congress, however, any attempt to liberalize I.N.S. standards is sure to meet resistance.
Yet asylum seekers constitute a tiny fraction of the people seeking admission to the U.S. each year. Opening the gate wider to persecuted women is hardly likely to result in a flood of new applicants. Most of the persecuted women live in countries where men control their right to leave the country, or even the house.
By granting asylum to women like Naima Belahi, the Algerian seamstress, the U.S. could send a powerful message to those who distort religion to justify terror. The message would be that Americans, too, hold certain things sacred -- and among them are liberty, equality, the pursuit of happiness and the right to hold one's own beliefs.

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 7

 BODY:
Mexico's stock market ended marginally higher today in another slow session, as investors stayed on the sidelines, waiting for the Government's economic plans to become clearer.
"The absence of news is keeping investors away from the market," one analyst said. "For the time being, it is more prudent to keep liquidity." 
 The lower house of the legislature gave formal approval to the $20 billion American loan guarantee package today. It now goes to the Senate, where passage would clear the way for President Ernesto Zedillo to announce measures to resolve Mexico's 11-week-old financial crisis.
The 37-share IPC index inched 1.48 points higher, or one-tenth of 1 percent, to close at 1,524.20 after moving across a range of 22 points. Despite the index's rise, declining shares far outnumbered gainers 46 to 22.

HEADLINE: New Croat-Bosnian Link Worries U.N.

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, March 7

 BODY:
Three weeks before its threatened expulsion of United Nations peacekeepers is to begin, Croatia has forged a new military alliance with Bosnia, establishing what on paper is a common front between former adversaries to counter Serbian rebels in both their countries.
The move, announced on Monday night, added to the concerns of United Nations officials and Western nations over the possibility of renewed war in Croatia and Bosnia if the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, goes through with his threat to expel the 12,000 United Nations peacekeepers in Croatia when their Security Council mandate expires on March 31. 
 The Croatian leader's threat has prompted the United Nations to consider revising the mandate under which its forces operate here, the United Nations spokesman, Michael Williams said, but he declined to give details.
Some United Nations officials have suggested that the United Nations force might be reduced by more than one half and limited to a narrower area of Croatia. There was no formal confirmation of other reports here tonight that the United Nations had proposed replacing peacekeeping troops with unarmed monitors on Croatia's international borders instead of along cease-fire lines.
The reported proposal could satisfy the Croatian Government, which argues that the armed United Nations troops have prevented it from reasserting control over the 30 percent of its territory now in the hands of rebel Serbs. But it would also run into strong opposition from the Serbs.
The United Nations' strategy reflects growing fears that the new pact between Croatia and Bosnia is one more preparation for renewed conflict if the United Nations forces withdraw.
The new agreement was "in fact a preparation and an agreement on how to act if the situation starts developing" toward broader and fiercer hostilities after the March 31 deadline, said Kresimir Zubak, the Croat who leads the Muslim-Croat federation set up in Bosnia with the backing of the United States one year ago.
The remark intensified the bellicose drumbeats echoing through the Balkans at a time when Western diplomacy is again faltering.
A United States attempt to persuade Mr. Tudjman to allow the United Nations peacekeepers to stay on has produced no visible sign of a breakthrough. Indeed, Croatian and Bosnian military leaders announced their pact just as Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke was meeting with President Tudjman in what was billed as a last-hour attempt to avoid renewed fighting.
The State Department in Washington denied today that the encounter had been a failure.
But a United Nations spokesman, Chris Gunnes, registered "increasing concern" today at violations of the year-old cease-fire in Croatia, saying there was an "unacceptable degree" of military activity by Croatian Government forces and the Serbian rebels who control one-third of the country.
As for Bosnia, the French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, told a news conference today in Paris that the risk of a resumption of hostilities "is higher than ever." He spoke at a meeting of officials from France, Germany and Britain to assess inconclusive efforts to persuade the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, to recognize Bosnia and Croatia in return for an end to economic sanctions against the rump Yugoslav federation, which is dominated by Serbia.
Against the background of such uncertain diplomacy, the players in the Balkans are maneuvering for whatever advantage they can through whatever high-stakes plays they can arrange.
The Croatia-Bosnia military pact is apparently intended to counter a similar pact by Serbian rebels in Bosnia and Croatia two weeks ago. European diplomats said Croatia apparently viewed the new pact as a possible means of pinning down Bosnian Serbs and thus preventing them from helping rebel Serbs in Croatia in the event of renewed fighting in Croatia, which has been mostly quiet since cease-fire in early 1992.
The newest military agreement is the most dramatic result of the federation so far but diplomats here said it had still to prove that it was more than a symbolic gesture between two groups that were essentially at war with one another only a year ago, and still harbor deep mutual mistrust. But in the nervous days leading up to the March 31 deadline in Croatia and to the April 30 expiration of an already badly frayed cease-fire in Bosnia, they appear to be reaching for any advantage.
"It's another development that we view with some concern," said Michael C. Williams, a spokesman for the United Nations forces in the former Yugoslavia.
United Nations officials say the most likely flash point is the Krajina region, held by rebel Serbs since 1991, where, the United Nations says, peacekeeping forces have been alarmed by increased movements of heavy weapons and larger-than-usual troop movements.

HEADLINE: Valea Calugareasca Journal;
From Communist Vineyards, a Bouquet of Iodine

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: VALEA CALUGAREASCA, Romania

 BODY:
With a slight air of apology, Viorel Stoian eased the cork and a piece of faded plastic out of a bottle of cabernet sauvignon that had rested in the cellar of the National Wine Institute of Romania for almost two decades.
"Like almost everything in Romania, the corks we had were so bad that we had to put plastic in with them to keep the wine from running out," he explained. 
 Mr. Stoian poured some of the deep-red liquid into a small glass, swirled it around and raised it to his nose, a faint smile crossing his face. After a sip, he offered it with satisfaction to his guests.
"It gives you the sense that something is burnt, something very fine," said Mr. Stoian, a 59-year-old viniculturist. "There is also the faintest touch of an iodine. It's a godly wine."
A touch of iodine, or "burnt," may not be how most people would describe a fine cabernet, but Romania remains a world apart when it comes to promoting its products.
Mr. Stoian and his wine institute, set in the middle of 1,800 acres of hills carpeted with vineyards, are fighting an uphill battle in the growing business of Eastern European wines.
Since the fall of Communism in 1989, Hungary and Bulgaria in particular have pushed their inexpensive but worthy table wines into the Western market, offering consumers in Britain, Germany and the United States cabernets, merlots and sauvignon blancs at a fraction of the cost of their counterparts from France or California.
Bulgaria has thrown open its markets to Western investors and entrepreneurs and now exports 70 percent of its production. Hungary has heavily subsidized its wine exports and is selling 40 percent of its production on the world market.
But, despite what many experts say is its far superior climate for viniculture, Romania seems stuck in the past.
One reason is its political legacy. Although most vineyards are now in private hands, the Government of President Ion Iliescu, led by former Communists, has refused to permit foreigners to own land. That means outside investors must find local partners who already own vineyards. Wine merchants say that when investors seek to buy assets in Romania, the Government overvalues them. Few doubt, however, that the investment restrictions will eventually be eased.
"We are in a transition period from a very stupid Government to a medium-stupid Government," Mr. Stoian said. "Meanwhile, our vineyards are deterioriating."
Romanians have long been attached to wine. A bottle typically costs less than the equivalent of $1, and annual consumption in this bleak economy is very high, more than 40 bottles per person -- more than twice the rate of consumption in Britain.
Romania is also the world's eighth-largest wine producer, at 600 million liters, or roughly 150 million gallons, a year. But it exports barely 4 percent of that amount.
During the 25-year dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, any hard currency from wine exports was funneled by central planners into heavy industry like aircraft manufacturing and oil field equipment. Since the 1989 revolution that overthrew and executed Mr. Ceausescu, the Government has been so short of money that state financing for the wine industry has been stagnant.
With 10 research centers across the country and 500 employees, the wine institute has a budget of less than $1 million. It also has income from a limited amount of wine from its own vineyards that it sells both on the local and international markets.
"There is essentially no money for us, so how are we going to compete?" Mr. Stoian asked as he opened a bottle of white made out of a Romanian grape called sarba (pronounced CHAR-bah), that he hopes to develop during the next few years. It is a tart, young wine that looks somewhat cloudy. "It's a whimsical grape," he said. "After you swallow it, you get the sense of rose."
The institute is in the Dealul Mare region, which is on the same latitude as the Bordeaux region of France and is considered optimal for producing red wines. In the cool mountain plateaus of Transylvania, the country grows only whites, particularly sauvignon blanc and two of its own varieties, Feteasca Alba and Feteasca Regale.
Though many consumers may not be familiar with Romanian wines, Mr. Stoian's reputation, and that of several of his institute's varieties, extend well beyond the country's borders. He is best known for developing Romania's pinot noir, considered one of the most fickle of grapes.
"This is a very difficult wine to produce because it is prone to disease and it yields a very low quantity of grape," said Dan Muntean, commercial manager for Halewood Vintners of Yorkshire, England, the main importer of Romanian wines in Britain. "But that is Romania's best red wine, and that is mostly thanks to Viorel."
Mr. Stoian, whose normal attire is an olive-green polyester sports jackets over an an old charcoal-gray sweater, said one of his goals over the next few years is to develop Romania's Feteasca Negra wine, which is already gaining an international reputation. Mr. Stoian believes it should be classed among the great reds of the world.
He said the best indication of its potential as a world class wine came in 1990, when he allowed one of his assistants to enter it under the cabernet classification at a competition in Italy.
"He picks up a bottle of 1983 Fetesca Negra, tastes it and insists it is a cabernet," Mr. Stoian said of his assistant. "I decided not to say anything. So he goes and enters it as a cabernet. And it wins all kinds of prizes."

HEADLINE: Orange County Discloses Plan To Trim Jobs And Services

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif.

 BODY:
The human and social costs of Orange County's financial crisis came into painful focus today as its new chief executive announced the layoffs of 1,040 employees and the elimination of 563 other positions, and elected officials decided that the county could not afford to pay a public defender to represent a man accused of killing 12 people.
The new chief executive, William J. Popejoy, told county supervisors that the layoffs and job eliminations -- amounting to more than 10 percent of the 15,000-member work force -- were necessary just to balance the county's budget in the coming fiscal year. 
 The job cuts would allow the county, which declared bankruptcy after its investments lost about $1.7 billion last year, to make a 41 percent cut in its discretionary budget. The budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 will be $275 million, down from $463 million in the year that will end on June 30, Mr. Popejoy said.
But the cuts and layoffs will not help close a $382 million shortfall in the amount the county will owe bondholders this summer, he said.
"I wish to underscore the human costs," Mr. Popejoy told the supervisors. "The county employees who may be laid off did not cause the bankruptcy. Many have devoted their entire years to serving Orange County. This is not the thanks they deserve."
The supervisors also decided that the county was too impoverished to pay the costs of defending Charles Ng, the Northern California man whose mass-murder trial was moved here because of pre-trial publicity. On a 4-to-1 vote, they deferred paying the first $100,000 necessary for the county public defender to provide services to Mr. Ng.
They also authorized the board president, Gaddi H. Vasquez, to write a letter to the presiding judge of the Orange County Superior Court, asking that the case be moved elsewhere.
Supervisor William Steiner refused to support the motion, saying that the county should immediately decline to pay any costs in the case.
"I can't even believe we're having this discussion," Mr. Steiner said. Noting the layoffs and cutbacks in services like child-abuse investigations, he said: "And we want to defend this guy?"
Mr. Ng is accused of torturing and killing 12 people at a remote mountain house in Calaveras County, about 150 miles east of San Francisco. The authorities found a torture chamber and charred human bones at the compound in 1985.
Calaveras County would repay Orange County for some costs, but Orange County would have to bear the administrative expenses incurred by the court, the public defender's office and the sheriff's office.
Orange County officials have blamed Merrill Lynch & Company and other brokerage firms for the $1.7 billion loss, claiming they exploited the county's former treasurer, Robert L. Citron, by supplying him with risky investments.
Cities, schools and other elements of the government have also been forced to cut services.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Continuing Drop in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury securities continued their slide for a fifth day yesterday as the dollar plunged again in the currency markets.
Analysts said an early muted response by Treasuries to the dollar's fall in Europe forced some investors to cover short positions hurriedly and gave an early lift to bond prices. But the buying quickly ended as the dollar fell even lower. 
 The 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32 , to a price of 1002/32 , sending the yield up to 7.62 percent, from 7.58 percent on Monday. Some expect the shorter maturities will continue consolidating, as traders await Friday's report on jobs data.
Yesterday rumors that the Federal Reserve was in the market to buy two- , five- and ten-year maturities for another central bank gave some support to the intermediate maturities. Many dealers speculated that the Bank of Japan was the other central bank.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at the CS First Boston Corporation, said he was impressed with the market's resiliency. While the volume was average, he said, it was surprisingly well behaved, considering the sharp currency fluctuations.
Two clues to the market's composure are that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, will be testifying before the House Budget Committee today, and the market may be waiting to see if he touches on the currency situtation.
"All along the Fed has been saying domestic policy will be the chief determination of monetary policy," Mr. Alexy said. "Currently some think the economy has cooled a bit from its fourth-quarter pace.
"What is currently happening to the dollar and to the economy are two separate issues. What happens next depends on the Fed, which has to determine the trade-off between the two. Helping the dollar could cause problems with the economy."
Indeed, because of the economy's strength, some analysts expect an interest rate increase of 50 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- when the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, meets on March 28.
"The dollar is still only a marginal policy factor and will only become a central issue if it threatens a major financial crisis in the U.S.," said James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco. "The economy and inflation remain the primary policy parameters for the Fed, with the economy still growing at a respectable 3.5 percent pace in the first quarter."
Municipal bonds were little changed as investors moved to the sidelines, waiting to see how the $1.258 billion of new state, city and agency issues sold yesterday would be priced.
Municipal bond issuers sold $540.8 million through negotiated transactions and $717.9 million through competitive bidding; Georgia priced the largest competitive issue that will be seen this week.
The state sold $349 million of debt to pay for capital projects. If the state's quality rating was not incentive enough to pay a premium price, this year's decline in new bond issues has increased the competition among investors for the quality deals, driving up prices.
Moody's Investors Service, which expects continued economic growth to keep the state's economy among the strongest, says Georgia's economy will receive a lift from the 1996 Olympic Games.
Merrill Lynch won $328.21 million of the general obligation bonds, with serial bonds priced to yield from 5.10 percent for an issue due in 2001 to 6.05 percent for bonds due in 2014 and 2015. J. P. Morgan Securities was awarded $21.8 million of the bonds and priced them to yield from 4.50 percent.

HEADLINE: Six Communities Compete For a New Military Center

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Wanted: 140,000 square feet of secure office space. Good airline connections to Latin America. Affordable family housing. Strategic site for nabbing drug lords and running top-secret military missions.
With American forces scheduled to withdraw from Panama by 1999 under terms of the Panama Canal Treaty, the Pentagon is looking for a new home for its Southern Command, the headquarters responsible for United States military activities in Latin America. 
 The selection of a new headquarters site is particularly rare at a time when scores of American military bases are closing, and six communities are using political ties and financial incentives to compete for it. Beyond bragging rights to one of the military's five major regional commands, the prize, by one estimate, will mean 1,500 new jobs and a five-year infusion of $100 million into the local economy.
The Pentagon has narrowed the field to Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Atlanta, Washington and Puerto Rico, and is expected to announce its choice later this month. Most of the competing communities have been spared base closings in the past, although Miami's Homestead Air Force Base was ordered partly shut in 1993.
The Defense Department is trying to treat the move, in which Miami and Tampa appear to be the front-runners, as a by-the-books real-estate deal that weighs only affordability and military needs. But politics is playing a big role.
Florida, which will have 25 electoral votes in the 1996 Presidential election, has a powerful Congressional delegation that is lobbying heavily for Miami or Tampa, as is the Democratic Governor, Lawton Chiles. Louisiana legislators, led by Representative Robert L. Livingston, a Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee, are pushing hard for New Orleans.
The communities are rushing to outbid one another. Miami has spent $100,000 on an aggressive promotional campaign, including a helicopter tour of the city for senior military officials. Puerto Rico is offering up to $100 million in financing to build homes for officers and their families.
And officials in Atlanta, billing their city as one with an ideal management climate, got right to the point when a Pentagon review team visited recently: Saab, Holiday Inn and the United Parcel Service all recently moved their corporate headquarters there. "The object wasn't to wine and dine them," said William Hubbard, senior vice president for economic expansion at the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. "These were numbers guys."
The Southern Command is responsible for United States military activities in 19 Latin American countries, excluding the Caribbean and Mexico. The command, which now has 8,500 troops based in Panama, provides humanitarian aid to the region, wages an aggressive counterdrug campaign there and protects the Panama Canal.
But even as the Pentagon looks for a new hub, some budget-cutters say the military could save money by consolidating the Southern Command into some other headquarters. For example, Gen. John J. Sheehan, the head of the Atlantic Command, based in Norfolk, Va., believes that the Southern Command would fit naturally in his fief. Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the head of the Southern Command, bristles at that idea and instead wants to seize the Caribbean from General Sheehan's jurisdiction.
Turf wars like that one are important to an understanding of the debate. General McCaffrey, a decorated veteran of the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars, likes Miami because, among other reasons, he would be the only four-star commander there. If the Pentagon picked Tampa, the general would have to share the city with the four-star generals who head the Central Command and the Special Operations Command.
The military nearly picked a new Southern Command headquarters late last year, when an assessment team recommended two sites in Miami and two in Puerto Rico. But that first assessment failed to consider costs, and lawmakers from the losing communities expressed outrage. Mr. Livingston, along with Louisiana's two Senators, J. Bennett Johnston and John B. Breaux, fired off an angry letter to Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch last Dec. 1. "There has been no attempt," they wrote, "to inform the Congress as to how the Department of Defense intends to specify criteria for a site selection or objectives for a site evaluation."
Mr. Deutch then formed a team -- made up of Assistant Defense Secretary Edward L. Warner; the principal deputy comptroller, Alice C. Maroni, and Lieut. Gen. Wesley Clark, the Joint Staff's director of strategic plans and policy -- to undertake a new search that would hold up to Congressional scrutiny.
A group of staff members headed by Mr. Warner's deputy, Thomas K. Longstreth, has since narrowed the list of candidates to 12 from 112, and then to the final 6, all of which they have visited. Pentagon officials want a site that is near Latin America (or at least one plane connection away), that is reasonably priced and that offers good housing, schools and health care for about 700 military and civilian employees. The military will either build a new headquarters or renovate an existing center.
In its new headquarters, the Southern Command will have no permanently assigned troops. Instead, like the Central Command, whose primary area of responsibility is Southwest Asia, it will summon forces as needed from around the country.
Each location still in the running has given its own particular pitch to the staff group. Atlanta promoted itself as a corporate center, Washington as the center of government. Tampa said it had room for another command at MacDill Air Force Base. New Orleans cited its deep port and naval air station. Puerto Rico positioned itself as the site closest to Latin America, not only geographically but also culturally.
But all competitors concede that Miami will be tough to beat. Officials in that city, which bills itself as the cultural, business, transportation and telecommunications hub of the Americas, estimate that the new headquarters would bring more than 1,500 new jobs and inject $100 million into the economy over five years through construction, wages of permanent new workers and entertainment spending by the frequent visitors to a command that operates largely through personal contacts.
Dan Tarman, the coordinator for Team Miami-U.S. Southcomm, a coalition of civic and business leaders in the Miami area, said, "Miami is the best place for this thing, because it enhances the command's ability to meet and greet."

HEADLINE: House Panel Votes to Cut Food Stamps

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
The House Agriculture Committee began voting today on legislation to cut $16.5 billion from projected spending in the food stamp program over the next five years, despite protests from Democrats who said the bill was immoral and mean-spirited.
The Democrats complained bitterly that the Republicans were making vast changes in the food stamp program with little analysis of the effect on human lives and no reliable estimate of the savings. 
 But the chairman of the committee, Representative Pat Roberts of Kansas, said he had "marching orders" from House Republican leaders to finish work on the bill this week, so it could be combined with welfare legislation from other committees in one big package.
The overall bill is expected to win approval in the House within a few weeks, although the outlook in the Senate is unclear.
Nonetheless, Democrats were intent on having their say. Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota, said the food stamp proposals were "God-awful." Representative Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, called it "radical, right-wing extremist" legislation that punished children.
Representative E. (Kika) de la Garza of Texas, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said, "We have a responsibility as a nation and as a people, a moral responsibility, to see that in this, the greatest nation in the world, there is no hunger." Another Democrat, Harold L. Volkmer of Missouri, said the bill would hurt "the neediest of the needy."
Republicans offered comparatively little defense of the bill, except to say that it would control costs and reduce fraud. Representative Nick Smith, Republican of Michigan, said the food stamp program was "one of the most corrupt welfare programs we have in this country."
Mr. Pomeroy said the committee was irresponsible to vote on the legislation without cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
Such numbers, he said, are needed to show "how deep are the cuts we're making in the food stamp program."
Twenty-seven million people get food stamps. Slightly more than half of them are children. Benefits average $69 a month for each person.
House Republicans said their proposals would cut $16.5 billion, or 11 percent, from the $149 billion that would otherwise be spent on food stamps in the next five years. But the Agriculture Department estimates that the savings would total $24.4 billion over five years.
The committee rejected a proposal by a freshman Republican from Indiana, Representative John Hostettler, to scrap the food stamp program and replace it with a lump-sum payment of Federal money, which states could use for any form of nutrition assistance. This proposal was part of the Republicans' original Contract With America, and Mr. Hostettler said, "It's time to give the program to the states."
Lawmakers from both parties said they wanted to preserve food stamps as the ultimate national safety net for poor people, at least for several years, until states were ready to issue food stamp benefits through an electronic accounting system.
The Republican bill would establish strict new work requirements for food stamp recipients. People 18 to 50 years old would be denied food stamps after 90 days unless they were working at least 20 hours a week.
The bill would also reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment for food stamp benefits, deny benefits to legal immigrants for at least five years and set overall limits on food stamp spending.
The Acting Secretary of Agriculture, Richard E. Rominger, denounced the bill, saying it would "eliminate the national nutritional safety net" and harm the health of low-income people.
Specifically, he said, the Republican bill would destroy two features of the food stamp program that have made it highly effective: uniform national standards for eligibility and benefits, and a budget that increases automatically to meet additional need in time of recession.
Under the bill, states that issue benefits in electronic form could eventually get Federal food stamp money in a block grant and could then set their own eligibility standards and benefit levels. As a result, Mr. Rominger said, "there could be 50 vastly different state programs using 50 different eligibility standards and offering 50 different nutrition benefits." Indeed, he said, "each state could set up different standards for different counties."
Mr. Rominger said the proposed work requirement would end food stamp benefits for 1.2 million people who were willing to work but unable to find jobs. Thus, he said, "the bill holds nutrition benefits hostage to jobs that may not exist."
The committee today rejected a Republican proposal that would have prohibited the use of food stamps to buy coffee, tea, cocoa, candy and other snack food.
Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida, said it was wrong for the Federal Government to subsidize "people's appetite for popcorn, potato chips, ice cream, Coca-Cola and Gatorade."
On the other hand, Representative Sam Farr, Democrat of California, said the committee was not authorized to enforce morality. And Mr. Volkmer said, "This is going too far in punishing children."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
HEINZ (H.J.) CO. (HNZ,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The H. J. Heinz Company said yesterday that its earnings rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter, as recently acquired businesses helped bolster sales.
The company's earnings increased to $138.3 million, or 56 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Jan. 25 from $128.6 million, or 50 cents, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 14.2 percent, to $1.95 billion from $1.71 billion. The results were in line with Wall Street's expectations. 
 Heinz, based in Pittsburgh, said its recent acquisitions accounted for about half of the revenue growth, with volume gains and favorable currency exchange rates also contributing to the increased earnings. The company benefited from a lower tax rate, but interest expense rose by $18 million because of acquisitions and rising interest rates in the United States.
Last year, Heinz strengthened its position as the world's second-largest maker of baby food after Gerber Products by acquiring Farley's Health Products from the Boots Company for about $144 million and Glaxo Holdings' baby-food business in India for about $70 million.
Heinz also bought the food-service business of Borden Inc. for an undisclosed price. The deal expanded a profitable food-service business that was already the biggest money-maker at Heinz, accounting for 20 percent of its annual revenue.
Volume gains in ketchup, Starkist tuna, Ore-Ida bagel bites, Heinz sauces and other products like frozen potatoes also contributed to the improved earnings, Heinz said.

Heinz attributed its increase in third-quarter sales to volume gains, the favorable effect of foreign exchange translation rates, and acquisitions. The company said that net income was affected by an increase in interest expense and a lower tax rate. Interest expense increased by $18 million as a result of acquisitions and an increase in short-term interest rates. The tax rate for the latest third quarter was 36 percent, compared with 40.3 percent in the year-ago period.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Jumps to 6-Week High; Reaction to Dollar Turmoil

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gold prices bounded to a six-week high yesterday as investors sought refuge from the crumbling American dollar.
There were also solid gains in wheat, soybean and hog futures on the assumption that demand would rise abroad as the weaker dollar made American commodities less expensive in foreign currencies. 
 The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities gained 1.61 points, to 234.68.
Gold for April delivery jumped $5.20 on the Commodity Exchange of New York, to $385.40 an ounce, the highest daily settlement of the April contract since Jan. 20. May silver soared 19.2 cents, to $4.695 an ounce.
The dollar fell to post-World-War-II lows yesterday against the German mark and Japanese yen, prompting investors to sell American securities and reinvest in gold, which is often regarded as a safe haven from financial turmoil.
"We reached a point where the dollar got blasted enough to stimulate some buying in metals," said Bernard Savaiko, an analyst at Paine Webber.
Prices of precious metals have fallen this year on perceptions that rising interest rates will slow economic growth in the United States and reduce inflationary pressures.
Investment demand for gold tends to rise when inflation heats up. Analysts said the dollar's decline heightened fears of inflation, because a higher dollar leads to rising prices for imported products while also pushing up prices of raw commodities, reflecting stronger demand overseas.
Wheat and soybean futures prices rose sharply for the second consecutive day on the Chicago Board of Trade on strong buying from investment funds, underpinned by the dollar's decline.
Many big funds that had wagered that wheat and soybean prices would fall began losing money when prices turned sharply higher, so they bought futures contracts to stop their losses, said Steve Bruce, a grain analyst for Geldermann Inc. in Chicago.
March wheat jumped 9.5 cents, to $3.6725 a bushel; March soybeans rose 5 cents, to $5.68 a bushel.
Hog and pork belly futures prices rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on speculation that the dollar's plunge would stimulate pork exports.
April live hogs rose 0.18 cent, to 39.65 cents a pound; March frozen pork bellies rose 0.77 cent, to 42.52 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Mexican Malfunction

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
As my flight into Mexico City was landing, I began to feverishly fill out the customs form they passed out on the plane. Line three, though, stumped me. It consisted of nine different boxes, out of which you were supposed to find and circle your occupation. Columnist wasn't listed. There was, however, "farmer," "driver of a vehicle," "livestock raiser" and then one that just leapt out at me. It said: "bond holder."
Those two words tell you a lot about what's wrong with Mexico today. Mexico is so dependent for its economic growth on foreign investors who will buy its government and commercial bonds that "bond holders" now have their own box on the visa form. Unfortunately for Mexico, most of the people who check that box are going out, not coming in. 
Despite the $50 billion bailout package that the Clinton Administration and I.M.F. have put together for Mexico -- a package designed to reassure foreign bond holders that Mexico can repay them so they will keep investing here -- the big money is still heading el Norte.
The Clinton rescue package is not working. The only question now is whether it has irredeemably failed or whether adjustments can still salvage it. So far, all that is happening is this: Foreign bond holders are cashing in their bonds for pesos as soon as they reach maturity, then they are taking those pesos to the banks here, changing them immediately into dollars and taking them back across the Rio Grande. The banks are getting the dollars to pay the foreigners from the Mexican Government, and the Mexican Government is getting the dollars on loan from the U.S. Treasury. That is not a pretty picture.
The result is that the peso, instead of being stabilized and inviting investment, is being dumped and therefore gyrating wildly downward. If you were to plot it on a graph, the peso's decline would look like the EKG of someone having a heart attack.
A key reason the rescue package is not persuading foreigners to reinvest here is that Mexico still has not put forward a convincing plan for restructuring its budget. And the more the peso falls, the more any new plan has to be redesigned, and the more the Government promises to have it ready "Manana."
Complicating matters further is the fact that Mexican politics today is a spooky Spanish version of Oliver Stone's "JFK." The brother of the former President stands accused of ordering the killing of the former ruling party secretary general and then conspiring to cover up the murder with the help of the former chief investigator, who happens to be the brother of the dead man, and who was arrested in Newark Friday with $46,000 in his suitcase. With such conspiratorial shadows swirling around Mexico's elite, the face of George Washington on a U.S. Savings Bond looks awfully attractive.
The other reason foreigners are cashing out of Mexico is because they are afraid of what will happen here if the rescue plan does "work." For sure there will be a recession. But the fear is that the terms the U.S. demanded in exchange for the bailout -- 60 percent interest rates, tax increases and curbs on government spending -- will produce not just a cleansing recession but a revolutionary depression. We may save the Mexican Government at the cost of killing Mexico's private sector, which is supposed to be the engine for Mexico's resurgence. (The tragedy of Mexico is that the only rescue package that might work -- one that focuses on reviving the private sector with more money and fewer impossible conditions -- is not one the U.S. Congress would ever have approved.)
The other day I visited the tape factory owned by Sami Moadeb outside Mexico City. In the hour I was there, he telephoned his bank four times to check the rate of the peso so he could adjust his own prices. Most of his machines were idle, and some of his most skilled workers were sweeping the stockroom and repainting gray pipes red. Wiping his brow, Mr. Moadeb sighs: "If it keeps up like this much longer, I will have to start laying off employees."
He and a thousand others. Now I understand why every time I ask someone on Wall Street where the next global economic crisis is likely to erupt after Mexico, I get the same answer: "Mexico."

HEADLINE: Easing in Consumer Debt

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Consumer credit rose in January at the slowest rate in 20 months, led by a decline in borrowing to buy automobiles. Credit rose $3.7 billion compared with a gain of $6.6 billion in December, the Federal Reserve said today.
Consumer credit includes all household debts except home-equity loans, mortgages and other loans not secured by real estate. 
 Installment debt increased at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in January, the smallest advance since May 1993, when it rose at a 2.1 percent rate. Credit rose at an annual rate of 8.7 percent in December and 17.7 percent in November.
Economists had predicted a slowdown in the pace of debt buildup, but the January increase was smaller than expected. In addition, the December gain was revised downward from an earlier estimated increase of $7.4 billion.
Michael Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York City, said some Americans might be shifting debt by drawing on home-equity loans. But he said the slower pace of consumer borrowing was in line with other signs of a slowing economy.
The use of revolving credit, including credit cards, increased at an annual rate of 16.7 percent in January, compared with 10.2 percent in December and 26.1 percent in November. The January advance totaled $4.8 billion, compared with $2.8 billion the previous month.
Automobile loans declined 1.1 percent, or $289 million, compared with an increase of 4.0 percent, or $1.1 billion, a month earlier.
Loans for mobile homes, education, boats, trailers and vacations also fell in January, slipping 3.6 percent, or $751 million, compared with an increase of 12.8 percent, or $263 million, in December.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Want to break into commercials? Get on a hit TV show like 'Seinfeld' or 'Northern Exposure' first.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
IT'S certainly not news when a television star is signed by an advertiser to pitch a product. But in an unusual twist to celebrity endorsements, three popular series are contributing what seems a disproportionate number of cast members to the ranks of spokes-stars.
The actors appearing in "Murphy Brown" and "Northern Exposure" on CBS, and "Seinfeld" on NBC, are seemingly omnipresent, whether appearing in broadcast commercials and print advertisements or serving as voice-over announcers. But unlike other series, including "Ellen" or "Beverly Hills 90210," in which one or two cast members engage in ad work, almost all the regular performers on these three series are doubling as product peddlers. 
 Every regular from "Murphy Brown" is hawking something -- from long-distance services to upset-stomach remedies. Five principal cast members of "Northern Exposure" are promoting products as varied as automobiles and iced tea. And all but one regular cast member of "Seinfeld" is also a pitch-star, for products as disparate as salty snacks and hair coloring.
David Letterman recently mocked this with a fake book, "The Guide to the TV Commercials Made by the Cast of 'Seinfeld.' "
It was 600 pages long.
"Every consumer tells you celebrities are paid shills," said F. Stone Roberts, chief executive of the Gotham Group in New York, which introduced commercials last month for the O-Cel-O Stay Fresh sponge with voice-overs by Grant Shaud, the nervous Miles on "Murphy Brown."
"But when you have the right celebrity," Mr. Roberts added, "it produces results."
And the cast members from these three shows have been deemed the right celebrities.
"These guys are fabulous awareness vehicles," said Bill Gray, senior vice president and head of client service at Ogilvy & Mather New York, which uses Jerry Seinfeld to advertise the American Express Company's green charge card.
"You ask anyone what Jerry Seinfeld advertises and they'll tell you 'the American Express card,' " added Mr. Gray, who is executive group director on the American Express account. "And you ask anyone what Jason Alexander advertises, and they'll tell you 'Rold Gold pretzels.' " His reference was to the actor playing George on "Seinfeld," who appears in a campaign by DDB Needham Chicago.
Mr. Gray said that "the group we want to soften the ground with" -- that is, consumers being sought to carry the green charge card -- "says that Jerry Seinfeld and the card are a perfect fit."
That was a quality that recommended Candice Bergen, Murphy Brown on "Murphy Brown," to the Sprint Corporation and its agency, J. Walter Thompson San Francisco.
"We tend to have a technologically sophisticated, somewhat younger audience with somewhat of a female skew," said Tim Kelly, assistant vice president for corporate advertising, media and sponsorship at Sprint in Kansas City. "That synched nicely with the audience that follows 'Murphy Brown.' "
Indeed, that kind of demographic profile -- generally better-educated, higher-income viewers -- also matches the demographic profiles of many ardent fans of the three series.
"These stars speak to the baby-boom generation, the economic base of the population," said George F. Schweitzer, executive vice president for marketing and communications at CBS in New York.
And the characters they portray "are so identifiable, so engaging," he added. "They work on television, so they work in advertising."
For instance, "Northern Exposure" served as a showcase for the "communicative skills" of Janine Turner, who portrays the peppery pilot Maggie, said Jeff Hurlbert, general marketing manager of the Chevrolet division of the General Motors Corporation in Warren, Mich. Chevrolet and its agency, Lintas Campbell-Ewald in Warren, have used her in an important annual year-end ad campaign since 1992.
"Of all the individuals we looked at," Mr. Hurlbert added, "we were very impressed with Janine, because she did a good job in conveying the sincerity, honesty and believability we want."
Other similarly prized perceived attributes attracted the Clairol unit of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and its agency, J. Walter Thompson New York, to Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who portrays Elaine, the male-dominated cast's female foil, on "Seinfeld." The next in her series of commercials for Clairol's Nice 'n Easy line of hair-coloring products is due in April.
"Because of who she is, a celebrity on a sitcom, you're buying someone the consumer already likes and laughs along with," said Laurie Garnier, senior partner and group creative director at Thompson New York. "That's the value."
"The minute you see Julia," she added, "it immediately signals it's a humorous commercial."
Which other series might join this trio in appealing so powerfully to marketers in search of pitch-stars? Advertising executives cite as likely prospects "E.R.," "Friends" and "Mad About You," all on NBC. They have attractive young casts and are finding favor with the demographically desirable viewers who watch "Murphy Brown," "Northern Exposure" and "Seinfeld."

HEADLINE: Delinquent Mortgages

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
The number of homeowners late in paying their mortgages rose in the fourth quarter as consumers felt the pinch from higher payments on adjustable-rate mortgages, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said today.
The mortgage delinquency rate rose to 4.15 percent of total loans outstanding in the fourth quarter from a 21-year low of 3.90 percent in the third quarter, the organization said. The rate in the fourth quarter of 1993 was 4.09 percent. 
 Delinquencies were higher in all regions of the country except the Northeast. Most of the increase in the fourth-quarter delinquency rate was registered in 30-day delinquencies, which rose to 2.76 percent from 2.57 percent. Loans at least 60 days past due rose to 0.66 percent from 0.59 percent; loans 90 days or more past due declined to 0.73 percent from 0.74 percent.
Foreclosures begun during the quarter declined to 0.32 percent of total loans outstanding from 0.35 percent in third quarter.
The quarterly delinquency survey covers about a third of all mortgages on one- to four-family homes.

HEADLINE: Picture It on the Menu: Arctic Hare Ragout

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: MONT TREMBLANT, Quebec, March 3

 BODY:
Canada's vast north, which stretches almost to the North Pole, is unlikely ever to support a three-star restaurant, but the region's foods, particularly those popular among the Eskimos -- caribou, seal, hare and game birds -- may soon be offered in restaurants in Europe and the United States.
Some northern fish like salmon and char (Arctic trout) are already sold abroad, but other staples are not readily available because of export bans and because Eskimos generally don't kill more animals than necessary for their own consumption. 
 Yet, old ways are changing. The establishment of Nunavut, an Eskimo homeland being formed in part of the Northwest Territories, and Nunavik, a semi-autonomous Eskimo region in northern Quebec, has raised prospects of a cooperative Arctic food-exporting venture to create badly needed jobs. (Nunavut means "Our Land" and Nunavik means "Great Land" in the native Inuktitut language.)
The Makivik Corporation, an economic develoment agency run by the 7,500 Nunavik Eskimos, sought a gastronomic reaction to the local diet by having some highly regarded French chefs share their thoughts about how the foods would fare abroad. Since the Eskimos could not send the food to the chefs, they brought the chefs to the food.
Led by Paul Bocuse, whose three-star restaurant near Lyons, France, celebrates its 30th year this year, a party of half a dozen chefs traveled almost 1,000 miles north of Montreal to Kuujjuaq, the administrative center of Nunavik. There, the Canadian chef Jean-Paul Grappe, a professor at the Institute of Tourism and Hotelkeeping in Montreal, prepared meals for them.
Mr. Grappe, an Arctic cooking expert, has been working on seal recipes, among other things. His dishes for the visitors included smoked seal; rock ptarmigan (similar to partridge) roasted in its own juice, and narwhal (an Arctic whale with a long spiral tusk) in a vinaigrette with parsley and dry shallots. He also made roast caribou (reindeer) stuffed with foie gras. Acknowledging that the foie gras was not local, he said with a smile, "We do a very good foie gras in Montreal."
The chefs reported their conclusions at a dinner on Friday in Mont Tremblant, a ski resort 90 miles north of Montreal. Although they agreed that some products were not likely to be accepted by consumers, their comments were encouraging.
Mr. Bocuse noted that the visiting chefs derived no culinary lessons during their four-day visit. "Eskimos eat everything raw," he said. "So there is no cuisine. To have cuisine you must cook."
But he insisted there were commercial possibilities -- with the right marinades and sauces and attention to other details. "Because of their pristine purity, these are products of exceptional authority," he said.
Mr. Bocuse said there were some striking similarities with traditional foods. Caribou, he noted, is much like venison, and the narwhal tastes like tete de veau, or head of the calf, a popular dish in France.
Alain R. Dutournier, owner of two Paris resaurants, Carre des Feuillants and Trou Gascon, said of the caribou, "I think I could work it very nobly, marinate it in oil with spices and a little Armagnac, and it could become very interesting."
Jean Banchet, a former chef of the year in France who went on to open restaurants in Chicago and Atlanta, said he saw possibilities for the Arctic hare, which is about twice the size of its cousins to the south. He would prepare it as a ragout with pasta on the side. As for seal, it could be marinated, dried and made to taste like prosciutto, he said. "The American people would not like the name, but if they ate it, I think they would like it," Mr. Banchet observed.
A major step in the food-exporting venture will come on April 1. Under a new provincial law, caribou steaks, ribs and roasts processed in four new plants in Nunavik may be sold beginning then in the rest of the province. Should federal approval be granted, as expected, caribou could be sold in the rest of Canada and even exported abroad by the end of this year. Other products would have to go through a similar process.
The food-exporting project is to start off slowly. With more than a million caribou, the herds along the Leaf and George rivers, which flow into Ungava Bay, are considered the largest in the world. Eskimos plan to kill 2,000 in the first year. The animals are to be hunted in their wild state, not kept in pens or corrals.
"We want to make sure that not only are jobs created in the north, but that the activity remains as traditional as possible," said Bruno Pilozzi, the chief economic officer of the Makivik Corporation. Widespread killing could bring out animal rights advocates and environmentalists instead of gastronomes.

Indian Chicken Wings
Buffalo wings? How about Bombay chicken wings for a change? Shaan, a luxurious Indian restaurant at 57 West 48th Street, is making tandoori chicken wings to go. They are skinless, lightly spiced and succulent. An order of a dozen wings ($12) comes with yogurt sauce and mint chutney for dipping. Takeout, but no delivery: (212) 977-8400.
 
Miller Brewing's Wheat Beer
 The Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee has bought a controlling interest in Celis Brewery, in Austin, Tex., known primarily for its wheat beer. Celis will be one of the brands in a new division of Miller Brewing called American Specialty and Craft Beer Company. Pierre Celis, the Belgian-born founder of Celis, said the agreement would enable his company to take advantage of Miller's marketing and distribution network without changing the quality of Celis.
 
Presidential Palates
 Much has been written about the eating habits of Bill Clinton. But what about John Quincy Adams or Warren G. Harding? Johnson and Wales University, a culinary school in Providence, R.I., has an exhibition of more than 100 Presidential documents relating to food in the White House, from the collection of Louis Szathmary, a retired chef. The exhibition, "In and Around the First Stomach," can be seen through June 1 at University Hall, 111 Dorrance Street. Information: (401) 598- 2805.
 
Lillian Vernon First
 Lillian Vernon, whose catalogues have been filling mailboxes since 1951, has introduced Lillian Vernon's Kitchen, the company's first kitchenware catalogue. It represents something of a departure for this New Rochelle, N.Y., company, which grosses nearly $200 million a year with the likes of crocheted Christmas snowflakes ($5.98 a dozen).
The catalogue offers items that are cute (bunny teapot, $9.98), economical (six champagne flutes for $9.98) and practical (Waring professional blender, $118). For the catalogue: (800) 285-5555.
 
Studies on Food
 A more erudite catalogue, this one of books, comes from the Food Heritage Press in Ipswich, Mass. More than three dozen titles, most from university presses, are listed. Among the books are "Produce and Conserve: The Grocer and the Consumer on the Home Front Battlefield During World War II," by Barbara McLean Ward (University Press of New England, $24.95). For information, (508) 356-7625.
 
Soda Bread
 The surprise in the traditional Mrs. Greene's Irish soda bread made by Wonderwomen Enterprises, a catering and gift basket company in Brooklyn, is not that it is deliciously moist and velvety, but that it is fat free. How do they do it? Enough baking soda is the answer, but unlike many fat-free baked products, this soda bread is not overwhelmed by the taste of the leavening. The breads can be ordered by mail ($10 plus shipping for three round loaves averaging six ounces each) by calling (800) 856-5901.
With 24 hours' notice the company will deliver the bread to the homebound and elderly in the five boroughs of New York City for $5 extra.
 
Rental Kitchens
 The city is filled with small caterers and food producers that need commercial kitchen space. One of them, Connie A. Peters, who was tired of borrowing ovens and refrigerators for her company, Connie Peters Events, has tackled the problem. Last year, she rented 8,000 square feet at 195 Hudson Street (near Gansevoort Street) and spent $230,000 turning the space into seven commercial kitchens called Gansevoort Kitchens Ltd. She uses one. The other six are for rent starting this week. The rates, by the day, week, month or longer, range from $100 to $300 a day including water and electricity. For information, (212) 925-6604.

HEADLINE: A Partial Cure for Drug Bills For a $370,000-a-Year Ailment

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Many patients with Gaucher disease, a rare inherited disorder, suffer not only physically but financially as well because the only drug effective against the condition can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. But now a panel of experts says it may be possible for many patients to reduce costs without compromising effectiveness by using smaller doses.
The panel, convened by the National Institutes of Health last week to study managing the disease, said studies showed that many Gaucher patients responded well to lower doses of the drug. Although there are not enough data to agree upon an optimal dose schedule that could be applied to all patients, it said, doctors can consider using doses lower than those typically prescribed to find an effective treatment level for each individual. 
 Gaucher disease, caused by a hereditary enzyme deficiency, can be painful, debilitating and sometimes fatal. In 1991, after more than 25 years of research by scientists at the National Institutes of Health, an enzyme replacement therapy that was commercialized by the Genzyme Corporation, of Cambridge, Mass., became available.
The drug, Ceredase, is an enzyme extracted in tiny amounts from human placentas using a costly procedure. Genzyme says it takes 20,000 placentas to produce a year's supply of the drug for an average patient. Last year, the company received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for a genetically engineered form of the enzyme, sold as Cerezyme, developed to overcome processing and supply constraints on using the natural protein.
Initial recommendations by doctors who developed the therapy called for most people to get 60 units of the drug for every kilogram of body weight twice a month. With the price of the drug ranging from $3.50 to $4 a unit, this put the cost of therapy for an adult weighing 150 pounds, or 70 kilograms, at about $370,000 a year. The company says the average cost to patients, including children, is $150,000 a year.
While patients and insurers acknowledge that the drug is very expensive to produce, many, including some members of Congress who have held hearings on drug pricing, say the company is charging too much. But officials at Genzyme said they reached the break-even point on recovering their costs only last year and were not making excessive profits.
Studies by Dr. Ernest Beutler and colleagues at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., Dr. Ari Zimran of the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem and others indicate that many patients respond as well to doses one-half to one-quarter that of the standard regimen if the drug is given more frequently in smaller amounts. For example, instead of taking one standard dose during a two-week period, a patient might take half that amount, but spread out in six doses.
However, patients' responses to the enzyme treatment vary widely, making it difficult to determine the best regimen for each individual, experts said. For example, they said, some with mild disease have been found to need large doses while others with severe symptoms sometimes respond to small amounts.
"Because response to therapy is varied and unpredictable, each patient's progress must be monitored closely," said Dr. Edward R. B. McCabe of the University of California Los Angeles Medical School, chairman of the institutes' 14-member assessment panel, "But we know a sizable number of patients do well on lower dose regimens."
The panel noted that there was considerable debate regarding dose levels, but that a failure to standardize research studies and patient data limited efforts to reach a consensus on optimal dosage. The experts called for the institutes to assemble an independent group of researchers to conduct nationwide clinical studies to determine the lowest effective dose. In addition, they said, there are individuals with the disease who exhibit few symptoms, and studies are needed to see if they might benefit from preventive therapy with the enzyme.
Dr. Richard A. Moscicki, medical director for Genzyme, said that it should be up to each doctor to individualize therapy for patients, but that they should be cautious about assuming that low doses were as effective as higher ones without more information.
"We should be careful about drawing conclusions on dose based on studies with small numbers of patients," he said in an interview. "It would be tragic if a few years from now we find that there are problems with low doses."
Dr. Beutler countered that the company had an economic interest in promoting larger doses, making it slow to accept numerous studies showing the effectiveness of reduced dose regimens. "The people who argue for large doses seem to think the burden of proof is on those of us who advocate small doses when we don't really know the long-term effects of high doses," he said, also noting that a principle of medicine was not to overtreat patients.
One thing agreed upon by all participants, including patients, at the three-day N.I.H. meeting was that the enzyme treatment worked, reducing the size of enlarged organs, restoring abnormal blood cell counts and reversing some skeletal abnormalities.
Leslie S. Gregg, an engineer with an aerospace company who has the disease, said a sister who was incapacitated with Gaucher had returned to a near-normal life because of the therapy. "There's no question that the enzyme is outrageously expensive, but there's also no question that it works," she said. "I'm just so thankful that we have it."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Help Girls in Poor Lands Stay in School

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, March 7

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration will announce here on Wednesday the creation of a program to help keep girls in school in Africa, Asia and Latin America, despite enormous economic and cultural barriers. The first year of the 10-year program will cost about $11.7 million, said the United States Agency for International Development, which will administer it.
Saying that poverty will not end until the lives of women are improved, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in an address today at the World Summit for Social Development, said that the program would be announced as part of a celebration of International Women's Day. It is not clear how many children and young women the program can affect. 
 Mrs. Clinton, who is spending two days at the United Nations conference, made a brief appearance before nongovernmental women's groups today, then addressed the conference. In her speech, she took into account the growing opposition in Congress to foreign aid, saying: "as my husband said in a speech last week, 'Governments will have to choose engagement over isolationism.' "
The money for the education program's first year will come from already allocated resources not subject to Congressional review.
The program will have several broad aims, according to Dr. Nils Daulaire, chief policy adviser to the administrator of the Agency for International Development. At primary school level, it will pay for expert help in determining why girls are not enrolled and in designing schools that parents find appropriate.
"In some countries, especially as they reach adolescence, girls don't attend school because parents fear they are not safe," Dr. Daulaire said.
Teachers will be trained to accept and integrate girls into a classroom, where they might normally be ignored.
For older girls and young women, new literacy projects will incorporate lessons in health and sanitation to benefit the family, Dr. Daulaire said.
The Agency for International Development said it cannot name the 12 or so countries involved. But the White House said that in each country the program will seek to increase by 20 percent either the literacy rate among women or the percentage of girls who complete a primary education. Officials in Washington did not explain how they would go about attaining this goal.
Mrs. Clinton said today that "investing in the health and education of women and girls is essential to improving local prosperity."
"Although women comprise 52 percent of the world population, although they are the primary caretakers for children and the aged and are a significant presence in the workforce, they continue to be marginalized in many countries," she said. "Worldwide, more than two-thirds of the children who never attended school or who drop out are girls. Of the one billion people who remain illiterate, two-thirds are women. And a disproportionate number of those we call living in absolute poverty are women."
Increasing the economic power of women is a recurrent theme at this conference and the multitude of smaller meetings taking place around it.
Noeleen Heyzer, a Singaporean who is director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, said in an interview: "Because the focus here is on poverty, we say that the continued feminization of poverty as we go into the next century is not acceptable."
"When we are generating new wealth and new poverty simultaneously, we have to find ways to improve the condition of women," she said.
After her appearance at the Social Summit today, Mrs. Clinton visited a Danish after-school day-care center for children of working parents. On Wednesday morning, she will have tea with Queen Margrethe of Denmark, return to the conference, then leave Copenhagen in the afternoon.
Vice President Al Gore is to arrive on Sunday for a one-day visit to participate in the summit-level talks closing the conference.
This afternoon, participants at the Social Summit heard about the success of small-scale banking for women in Asia, Africa and Latin America from a panel of experts, among them Esther Ocloo, a Ghanaian businesswoman who uses some profits from her food-processing company to support a foundation for training women.
"There are more self-employed women than men in the third world," she said. "Without their work, Africa would be in a very much worse crisis than it is now."
Muhammad Yunus, a former economics professor who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, said that he began his experiment in one village with a small amount of capital, urging women with skills or rudimentary experience in commerce to expand their operations. Today he has branches in 35,000 villages and gives $500 million in loans to two million borrowers, 98 percent of whom repay on time.
"Still the conventional banks don't believe lending to the poor works," he said.
Ms. Heyzer of the women's development fund, which gives money to nontraditional banks, said that it is time to give larger loans to women who want to go abroad for jobs and who often fall victim to unscrupulous recruiters. Trafficking in women has become a major problem in Asia, where many poor young women are taken abroad by agents who charge high fees, keep the money the women intend to send home to their families and often ultimately drive them into prostitution.
"The type of banks we have set up have put money in hands of the hardcore poor," she said. "But many other women are not hardcore poor and they have to get access to credit through commercial banks, and the whole structure of banking is such that they will have great difficulty."
Ela Bhatt, a leader in self-help projects for women in India and chairwoman of the International Coalition on Women and Credit, said today that women are creditworthy and good at building capital.
"Poverty will not disappear through charity," she said, "but through providing people with access to finance."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Fall Is Still Unabated; U.S. Officials Take No Action

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Trying to ride out an enormous selloff of the dollar on markets around the world, the Clinton Administration watched with growing alarm today but without taking action as the currency fell to post-World-War-II lows against the Japanese yen and the German mark.
Already battered by a relentless decline that began almost a month ago, the dollar lost an additional 2.4 percent of its value against the mark and 2.8 percent against the yen. [The dollar fell as low as 88.765 yen in late afternoon trading in Tokyo on Wednesday.] 
 The White House's decision to remain silent this week in the face of the latest stunning fall was apparently made by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who once managed the currency trading unit of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the New York investment firm. Mr. Rubin's experience has made him particularly reluctant to intervene against the tide of the markets, officials familiar with his thinking said. He was waiting, they said, for the steam to run out of the selloff before committing American funds to try to bolster the dollar.
"When it comes to intervention, it is very much a matter of timing," a senior Administration official said. "It is the right thing to do at the appropriate time, and an inappropriate thing to do at the wrong time."
Mr. Rubin, according to other Administration officials, regards the drop of the dollar as a temporary market stampede that is disconnected to the fundamental condition of the American economy.
Nonetheless, he was forced to spend hours on the telephone today with finance ministers around the world amid growing concern in Washington that further instability might threaten both the nation's prestige and the dollar's position as the pre-eminent reserve currency. Currently, a bit more than half of the currency held in reserve by governments around the world is in dollars.
While most newly developing countries remain closely tied to the dollar, there is considerable speculation that governments could be turning to the other principal currency havens, Japan and Germany.
Whether those rumors are true or not, private investors are clearly rushing there, which in turn could force the governments to follow or risk the shrinking of their dollar assets.
In late New York trading, the dollar was worth 90.05 yen, down from 92.69 on Monday. Earlier, it had touched a low of 89.20 yen in intra-day trading. Against the mark, the dollar was trading at 1.3705 marks versus 1.4037 the previous day.
Mr. Rubin is also combating growing accusations that the Clinton Administration's decision to bail out Mexico -- committing $20 billion to loans and loan guarantees -- has tied the fate of the dollar to the troubled Mexican economy.
"There has never been a more bipartisan foreign policy mistake than our policy toward Mexico," Representative Tom Lantos, a California Democrat, told Mr. Rubin's deputy, Lawrence G. Summers, at a heated hearing of the House International Relations Committee today. "We are paying with the dollar."
For all of Mexico's increasing political and financial chaos, many experts said, the market's battering of the dollar is out of proportion to the risks posed to the United States by Mexico's descent into turmoil. But currency traders, spotting an opportunity to make a quick profit, are capable of moving money in and out of markets so quickly that exaggerated reactions are often the rule rather than the exception.
That has left the Administration in a particularly difficult quandary, caught between a desire to bolster the dollar and a desire not to let its monetary policy be dictated by speculators betting that enough pain will lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates.
Despite the silence emanating from Washington, several market experts said they expected that the Administration and other Governments would be forced into action within days, if not hours.
"This can only go on for so long," said Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs and a former colleague of Mr. Rubin's. "The U.S. cannot preserve the value of the dollar as a strong reserve asset and a strong transaction currency without mustering a solid defense at these levels. We need a financial equivalent of Desert Storm, a coalition to defend the dollar."
It may be a difficult coalition to assemble. Germany views Mexico as Washington's problem, and has said so repeatedly, though rarely on the record.
Moreover, the strengthening of the mark is interpreted in Europe as a sign that the worst economic problems associated with merging the former East Germany with the West are over. European investors have also fled to the mark because of currency devaluations elsewhere in Europe, which have only reinforced the belief that a single European currency will be impossible anytime soon. That makes the mark the de facto regional currency.
Japan, on the other hand, should be an enthusiastic participant in any effort to rescue the dollar, because the 7 percent rise in the value of the yen in recent days will cost Japanese companies billions in lost profits on exports. Their only other option would be to increase the price of cars, electronics and other goods sharply in the United States, making them significantly less competitive.
To some economists, Washington should shed any notion that the strength of the dollar is a sign of national prestige, moving instead to exploit the advantages that it gives to American exporters by making their goods cheaper abroad.
"My first impression is that it is big trouble for the Japanese and not as much for the United States," said Prof. Richard N. Cooper, a Harvard economist and former State Department official.
But in Washington, where many of Mr. Clinton's political enemies are eager for evidence that the Mexican rescue is going wrong, the fate of the dollar is the last straw. Congress abdicated any role in the rescue -- refusing to act on Mr. Clinton's initial plan, which was unpopular among Democrats and Republicans alike. That forced Mr. Clinton to act alone, using funds under his control to pay for the rescue. His decision was greeted with relief and support by Congressional leaders. But now many on Capitol Hill, with no stake in the package, are saying that Mr. Clinton abused his authority.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
The Decline Resumes
 TOKYO, Wednesday, March 8 -- The dollar continued to slide against the yen, falling as low as 88.765 in late afternoon trading.
The decline came even as the Bank of Japan was buying dollars to support the value of the currency.
Cabinet ministers concerned with economic affairs held an emergency meeting this morning in Tokyo. One idea discussed was to reduce Japan's discount rate. But the rate is now 1.75 percent, much lower than the 5.25 percent rate in the United States. Higher interest rates typically bolster the value of a currency. No countermeasures were announced after the meeting.
"We will communicate with other countries and cooperate, but about the specific measures I cannot comment right now," Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said.

HEADLINE: Let the Dollar Drift

 BODY:
The dollar hit new lows against the German mark and Japanese yen yesterday, setting off needless calls for government intervention. The Clinton Administration wisely held off. True, a stronger dollar would make imports cheaper and reassure foreign investors. But the policy that could turn the dollar around -- a stricter monetary policy -- could also suffocate an already slowing economy. The price of intervention is too steep.
There are many theories why the dollar is falling, none convincing. Some say the slide reflects large trade deficits, fiscal imbalance or other structural problems. But these long-term factors did not suddenly worsen last week. Or the slide may reflect dismay over Mexico or short-lived fads and fears. No one knows. 
 The key facts are that the American economy is growing briskly and that current policies are sound. The Federal Reserve Board has steered the economy along a path of growth and low inflation. Over the past few years Washington has cut the deficit, as a percentage of national income, in half. There is no crisis.
There is also no simple way to affect exchange rates. The Federal Reserve tried to stanch the dollar's slide last week by joining forces with other central banks to buy dollars; the tactic didn't work. The Fed could make a dent if it shifted its monetary policy to drive inflation lower and interest rates higher. Such a shift could persuade investors to buy dollars to invest in America. But monetary contraction poses a serious danger. The Fed raised interest rates last year to bring the growth rates down from unsustainable levels of over 4 percent. Further tightening could tip the economy into stagnation or recession -- for little real gain.
A higher dollar would raise living standards a bit by lowering the cost of imports. It might help keep overall inflation lower. It might reassure foreign investors that America would remain a safe place to invest. But all these results would be modest because foreign trade and foreign investment account for only a modest portion of American economic activity.
Mickey Levy, chief financial economist at NationsBank, notes that when the Fed fought off a falling dollar in 1987 with tight monetary policy it helped trigger a collapse on Wall Street. The economy is sound. So too is Fed policy. In this context, a falling dollar poses no crisis. Intervention might.

HEADLINE: Injustice for Consumers

 BODY:
In the name of legal reform, House Republicans are barreling ahead this week with three bills that would drastically curb the rights of citizens to court redress over defective products and securities fraud.
There is unquestionably room for real reform in the American system of civil justice. The courts are slow and overburdened. Juries are inconsistent and occasionally award damages that seem excessive. Frivolous wrongs are sometimes litigated while more grievous harms never make it to court. Such problems require a balanced assessment and remedy. But the Republican proposals include little progress and too much that merely relieves manufacturers and sellers of their proper duty of obligation to the public. 
 One bill, which the House passed yesterday, would require losing plaintiffs to pay some or all of the winners' legal costs. Even plaintiffs who win damages can be deemed losers for the bill's purposes if the jury awards less than the defense offered before trial. That would force many individuals to forgo a meritorious yet risky lawsuit for fear that the penalty would be financial ruin.
The so-called British rule of "loser pays" is alien to the American system of accessible justice. House Republicans seek nothing less than a crippling of the system of contingent fee arrangements that allow plaintiffs without great riches to retain good lawyers, who charge nothing if they lose and a share of the winnings if they win. Senate Republicans should join Democrats and the belatedly aroused Clinton Administration in deploring the idea.
Another bill would set a ceiling on punitive damages -- awards over and above the compensation for actual harm suffered -- at $250,000 or three times proven economic loss, whichever is higher. There might well be good reason to develop guidelines for juries to consider in awarding punitive damages, but critics have not shown a need to cap them. Punitive damages have value in deterring dangerous practices. Critics condemn a few publicized awards but fail to mention that judges routinely reduce those jury awards drastically.
The misnamed "Securities Litigation Reform Act" contains similar new burdens for investors and their lawyers seeking reparation for phony stock dealings. This bill contains an unfair "loser pays" provision and would set unreasonably high burdens of proof on plaintiffs to show that the defendant departed radically from business norms. A new amendment would even repeal the application of the highly effective Federal rackets law to financial transactions. As Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, testified last month, the bill would remove from the marketplace the extra private monitoring that the S.E.C. lacks the resources to provide.
The entire Republican package deserves a more searching examination in the Senate than it is receiving in the House. It looks less like meaningful reform than a threat to American civil justice.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Show Their Plan to Balance Budget

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Senate Democrats today introduced their own balanced-budget proposal, a statute they said would achieve the goals of the defeated balanced-budget amendment but more quickly and without counting Social Security trust funds against the deficit.
The Democrats presented their plan only a week after the balanced-budget amendment went down to defeat in the Senate for the lack of one vote. Since then, Republicans have tried to turn Democratic opposition to it into a campaign issue. 
 "We are here today to introduce the next installment of debate on the balanced budget," the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said at a news conference.
Republicans said they had not had time to study the Democrats' four-page proposal, but that did not prevent them from launching immediate attacks and forecasting its failure.
"It's another political ploy," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Senate Budget Committee. "It's just another way for those who didn't vote for the balanced-budget amendment to try to find political cover."
The Democrats' proposal -- known as the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 -- would require the Senate to adopt a budget resolution this year that would reach balance by the year 2002 unless the Budget Committee designated another date. It would exclude Social Security trust funds from budget calculations.
Under the proposal, co-sponsored by Mr. Daschle and Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska, the Budget Committee and its staff would be required to provide the details on what cuts would have to be made to achieve a balanced budget by the target date. And in order to enforce the legislation -- a point Republicans argued could only be accomplished through a constitutional amendment -- the statute would include language that would block any budget not meeting the goals unless 60 Senators voted to waive that requirement.
Congress could vote to suspend the balanced-budget legislation in the event of a war or during a period of low economic growth.
But Mr. Daschle and the seven other Democrats who joined him today offered no details on how they would make the cuts necessary to balance the budget. Democrats hammered the Republicans on this point during weeks of debate on the balanced-budget amendment, and today they repeated that it was up to Republicans to identify budget cuts.
"There is absolutely no way that the minority party is going to influence the majority to go along with any particular plan that we outline," said Mr. Exon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. "If we put up a plan, they will shoot it down. They are the majority, they have the obligation to lead."
The Democrats were equally vague on the more immediate issue of how they hoped to win support for the statute, in general, from a Republican majority that is still seething from last week's vote.
"We have no choice but to work together," Mr. Daschle said.
Among the Democrats who stood alongside Mr. Daschle today were some who voted with the Republicans in favor of the balanced-budget amendment -- Senators Exon, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin and Charles S. Robb of Virginia -- and some who like the minority leader had supported similar legislation in the previous Congress but voted "no" this time -- Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky.
The Democrats spent more time today trying to erect defenses for the anticipated attacks from Republicans than they did explaining their plan.
"This is not a feel-good amendment," Senator Ford said. "We are dead serious."
"This is real medicine," added Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, who remained undecided on the balanced-budget amendment until the last moment when he voted "no."

HEADLINE: PAKISTAN HUNTING GUNMEN IN KILLING

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: KARACHI, Pakistan, March 8

 BODY:
Pakistan's top officials vowed today to do everything possible to track down gunmen who opened fire earlier in the day on a van carrying three Americans to work at the United States Consulate in this port city, killing two of the Americans and wounding the third.
The gunmen, riding in a taxi, vanished into rush-hour traffic after the fusillade, leaving no obvious clues to their motives or identities. 
 The attack appeared to shock Karachi's 10 million people as much as anything in years of violence that have bludgeoned this city.
The two Americans who died, both with diplomatic status, joined more than 1,100 people who have been killed in the past 15 months in a rampage of brutality driven by ethnic and religious hatreds, and by criminal gangs fighting for primacy in what has become one of Asia's prime narcotics-trafficking centers.
The Americans who died were identified by the State Department as Jackie van Landingham, a secretary in the economics section at the consulate, who was 33 years old, and Gary C. Durell, 45, a communications technician. The wounded American was named as Mark McCloy, an employee in the consulate's post office.
Mr. McCloy, whose age was not immediately available, was in stable condition tonight in a Karachi hospital.
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who will visit Washington early next month as part of an effort to improve faltering relations between the Pakistan and the United States, sent a letter to President Clinton promising an intensified police effort to track down the killers.
"We condemn this heinous crime against innocent people, which is part of a well-planned campaign of terrorism," Ms. Bhutto said in the letter, which was dispatched as she ended an official trip to Singapore. "Every effort will be made to apprehend the perpetrators."
But more than 16 hours after the attack, the police appeared to have no clear leads. There was no statement taking responsibility for the attack from any of the rival political groups, religious factions or criminal gangs that have staged scores of similar drive-by killings here in recent months.
In a statement, Mr. Clinton said the attack "enrages all Americans." Mr. Clinton added, "I have instructed relevant U.S. Government agencies to work with the Government of Pakistan to apprehend the perpetrators of this cowardly act."
The White House also announced that there would be no change in plans for the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to make a two-day visit to Pakistan beginning March 26 as part of a 10-day, five-nation tour of South Asia.
Later the Justice Department announced that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was dispatching agents to work with Pakistani officials in the hunt for the killers.
Among politicians and police officials in Karachi, several theories were advanced for the killings.
One was that the Americans were attacked in retaliation for events a month ago in Islamabad, the capital, when the Bhutto Government agreed to a joint American-Pakistani police operation that captured Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the 27-year-old accused of being the mastermind of the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. Mr. Yousef was flown out of Pakistan on an American military plane within eight hours of his capture and is awaiting trial in New York.
This was the interpretation made by Nusrat Bhutto, Prime Minister Bhutto's mother, who visited the Aga Khan hospital where the Americans were taken after the attack.
"Ramzi was handed over to the United States because he is a terrorist," she said. "That's why these people have attacked the American Consulate."
Nusrat Bhutto, whose political differences with her daughter have caused a bitter estrangement in the last year, offered no evidence to support her statement.
Another theory in Karachi was that the attackers could have been working for one of the drug barons who have enjoyed virtual immunity in Karachi. The port has been used as a shipping point for heroin bound for Europe and the United States and as a distribution center for Pakistan's estimated three million heroin addicts.
Under strong pressure from the United States, the Bhutto Government has pledged to renew judicial proceedings for the extradition of several Pakistani drug barons who are wanted for narcotics offenses in the United States.
One prominent Pakistani official who saw the attack as an attempt to cause a rift between Pakistan and the United States was Abdullah Shah, the chief minister of Sind province, which includes Karachi.
After a meeting this afternoon with John C. Monjo, the United States Ambassador, who flew to Karachi in a United States Embassy plane immediately after the killings, Mr. Shah said the attack on the Americans "was intended to sabotage" Prime Minister Bhutto's forthcoming visit to the United States.
"There are people who do not want an improvement in Pakistan's relations with the United States," Mr. Shah said.
Another theory was that the killers belonged to one of the Muslim sects that have played an increasing role in the violence in the city in recent weeks.
Last week, after Sunni Muslim gunmen massacred 13 men and boys attending prayers at a Shiite Muslim mosque, a Shiite group issued a statement saying the attackers were working for the United States. The implication was that the attack was part of an American effort to strike out at Iran, a predominantly Shiite nation that has backed the Shiite minority in Pakistan.
The attack on the Americans occurred at 7:50 A.M. as the driver of the consulate's white Toyota van entered the heart of the city along a broad divided highway named for King Faisal, the former ruler of Saudi Arabia. In a stretch bounded by car showrooms, fast-food restaurant and hotels, a yellow-painted taxi pulled ahead of the van as the American vehicle's Pakistani driver slowed for a traffic light.
Some witnesses said there were two gunmen in the taxi, but consulate officials said later that they could not be sure how many attackers were involved.
According to accounts given by Karachi police and by consulate officials, the gunmen opened fire with AK-47 assault rifles at virtually point-blank range, drilling the van's windshield with at least nine shots.
At least one gunman then leaped out of the taxi as the van halted, firing a new fusillade through the left side at the bench seats where the three Americans sat. The shooting took place in full view of dozens of other vehicles halted for a traffic light on what is Karachi's busiest rush-hour thoroughfare.
Consulate officials said Mr. McCloy ordered the driver, Nasim ul-Haq, who was not injured, to make a U-turn as the traffic cleared and return two miles up the highway to the Aga Khan hospital, one of the best in Pakistan.
Doctors there said later that Mr. Durell was dead on arrival and that Miss van Landingham died of her wounds shortly after being carried into the hospital.
Mr. McCloy, struck by a bullet on the ankle, underwent a short operation and remained in the hospital under observation.
At the State Department, officials gave Ms. van Landingham's hometown as Camden, S.C. Mr. Durell's hometown was given as Alliance, Ohio, and Mr. McCloy's as Framingham, Mass.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Four-Day Plunge Halts; Greenspan Hints at Higher Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
The four-day plunge of the dollar in international currency markets halted today after the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, hinted that he might raise American interest rates, which would tend to encourage people to buy dollars.
Mr. Greenspan did not say the Fed would raise interest rates simply to defend the dollar. But he suggested that if the decline of the dollar added to inflation here through higher prices for imports, the Fed might respond by raising borrowing costs, slowing the economy and braking inflation. 
 At the same time, a senior German central banker said rates might fall there, which could help strengthen the dollar.
In response, traders bought dollars and sold marks and yen. After falling to new lows in trading in Tokyo, the dollar recovered in trading in New York to 91.42 yen, from 90.05 on Tuesday, and to 1.3960 marks from 1.3705. Higher rates in the United States would make it more attractive for foreigners to invest in dollars, while lower rates in Germany would help reduce the flow of money into German marks.
In testimony to the House Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan described the fall of the dollar as "unwelcome and troublesome," as well as excessive, and said the Fed would not let inflation be driven up by a weak currency.
"Dollar weakness, while very likely overdone, is unwelcome because it adds to potential inflation pressures in our economy," Mr. Greenspan said in his opening remarks today. "As I have emphasized numerous times in the past, it is important that we contain such pressures."
Mr. Greenspan's remarks were part of what appeared to be a coordinated series of comments and increases in interest rates by central bankers around the world, who have been in close touch about the dollar for a week.
While Mr. Greenspan was indicating a willingness to raise rates, a member of the policy council of the German Bundesbank, Hans-Jurgen Krupp, was addressing the other end of the equation that was pulling away money from the dollar. Mr. Krupp said today that a cut in interest rates was possible in Germany to stimulate the economy there.
"A rate reduction is possible because the economic upturn is still not so strong," he was quoted today as telling the business magazine Wirtschafts Woche.
The president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, added his support later in the day, saying he expected the dollar to recover in value.
Also today, France, Denmark and Belgium raised interest rates to buttress their currencies against the mark.
Apparently waiting to see if the comments by Mr. Greenspan would be enough to halt the slide of the dollar, the Clinton Administration remained silent again today and took no action to intervene in currency markets.
Whether the Federal Reserve is prepared to raise rates or whether Mr. Greenspan is simply trying to bluff the international currency markets is unclear. The nation's central bank has a history of resisting pressures from currency traders and of setting interest rates mainly in response to the domestic economy.
During the last international currency crisis in July, the Federal Reserve chose to forgo an increase in interest rates at a meeting of its top officials even though the same officials had voted to raise rates during their three previous meetings in February, March and May.
It is not clear whether the rebound in the dollar was a response to the remarks by Mr. Greenspan or mostly a natural bounce after the dollar had fallen so sharply. But in the absence of almost any response from the Administration this week, Mr. Greenspan helped fill a void by signaling that Government officials considered the fall of the dollar serious enough that traders needed to start worrying about an effort by central banks to intervene.
Some analysts have attributed the fall of the dollar to comments by Mr. Greenspan two weeks ago that the Federal Reserve might start lowering interest rates. Traders have said that they feel free to sell dollars with little perceived risk that the dollar will bounce back in value because of a sudden increase in interest rates.
Mr. Greenspan conspicuously avoided any mention today of lowering rates, warning instead that while some signs of slowing were visible in the American economy, "the jury remains out on whether that will be sufficient to contain inflation pressures."
He also backed away from his suggestion last month that big cuts in the Federal budget deficit might prompt shifts in the financial markets that would push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
Some currency traders and economists interpreted the comments not as a hint of higher rates but rather as an attempt to bring back a sense of uncertainty among traders about the direction of American interest rate policy. "This is all working to introduce a sense of risk," said Robert V. DiClemente, a senior economist at Salomon Brothers.
He added that given the limited reliance on imports in the United States, the risk cited by Mr. Greenspan of extra inflation pressures was plausible but modest.
But few currency experts said they believed that the problems for the dollar were entirely over. David F. DeRosa, director of foreign exchange trading in the New York offices of the Swiss Bank Corporation, said very little money changed hands as the dollar recovered today.
"I don't regard this as a real rally," he said. "In the bat of an eye, it can drop."
Mr. Greenspan linked the weakness of the dollar to the Government deficits he had lobbied Congress to bring down. Providing some support for Republicans' efforts to blame Democrats for the problems of the dollar, Mr. Greenspan said he thought the selloff had been touched off by the defeat in the Senate last Thursday of the balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. While Mr. Greenspan did not support the amendment, he called on Congress to meet the measure's goal of balancing the Federal budget by 2002.
Many economists have contended that the problems of the dollar reflect not so much the chronic budget and trade deficits in the United States but the strength of the mark and yen. Investors have been pouring money into Germany, as other European currencies, notably the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta, have plunged in value, because of budget squabbles in Italy and allegations of political corruption in Spain. Japanese companies have been converting their overseas profits into yen in preparation for the close of the Japanese financial year at the end of this month.
But however effective Mr. Greenspan's words may have been today in propping up the dollar, the idea of using interest rates to support the currency contains many perils. A group of conservative private-sector economists who follow the Fed's moves issued a statement on Monday warning that another increase in interest rates now would risk tipping the American economy into a recession. Administration officials have worried that such a recession might come during the election campaign in 1996, hurting the re-election prospects of President Clinton.
Mr. Greenspan devoted most of his testimony today to pleas for Congress to balance the budget. If anything, he said, the Government should be running a surplus, so as to add to the pool of savings in the United States that can be invested.

HEADLINE: School Lunch Bill Leaves Out Military Children

SERIES: The Fine Print -- A periodic look behind the law.

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
When a House committee voted last month to scrap the national school lunch program and let states decide how to use Federal money to feed pupils, it forgot about a large group of needy young diners.
The Republican plan to revamp the 49-year-old program has no provision for the 57,000 children of military families who receive breakfast or lunch at Pentagon-run schools on bases in the United States and abroad. About 40 percent of the children receive free or reduced price meals, since some service members' income is low enough to allow them to qualify for the program. 
 Under the proposal, a part of the Republican-backed legislation to overhaul the nation's welfare system, states would receive a lump sum of Federal money to run the lunch program. But there are no block grants in Germany, Japan, Italy or the 11 other countries where American military families live. Pentagon officials fear that the bill also omits financing for children at 65 base schools in this country.
Now Republicans, who have sought to position themselves as the champions of American service members by demanding larger Pentagon budgets and better living conditions for troops and their families, are struggling to correct what lawmakers and senior aides say was inadvertently done.
"It clearly was not the intention to leave out military families, but part of the problem with the 100-day sprint is that you can't always be as thorough as you want," said Bill Miller, a spokesman for Representative Constance A. Morella of Maryland, who raised the issue with her Republican colleagues.
In the Republicans' rush to approve the legislative goals of the Contract With America by their self-imposed 100-day deadline, Congressional experts and even lawmakers acknowledge that the frenzied pace has produced some poorly written bills that fail to examine all nuances of an issue.
"They're trying to do the kind of thing that's normally done over a period of months or years, with several programs and details," said Charles O. Jones, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in Presidential and Congressional relations.
From changes in civil law to the line-item veto to military command over peacekeeping missions, several hastily passed bills in the House await a long, skeptical look from the more deliberative Senate. "If the House does something dumb, I think the Senate would fix it," said Carolyn H. Becraft, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for personnel support, families and education.
House Republicans say they are doing their best, but the dizzying pace is taking its toll. "I've had three hearings today," said Representative Randy (Duke) Cunningham, Republican of California. "I've got constituents waiting for me. I've got calls like yours and votes on the floor. I'm not getting to sleep until 2 A.M. It's crazy."
Mr. Cunningham, who sits on the House National Security Committee and the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, which revamped the school lunch program, said he planned to amend the bill to assure that military children did not go hungry at school.
"Are there little glitches like this?" Mr. Cunningham asked. "Absolutely."
Without changes in the law, the Pentagon will have to cover $5.2 million in additional costs to maintain the meal program at its schools overseas. It could also cost the Pentagon an extra $4.9 million to keep lunch programs running at military-run schools at bases in this country.
Defense Department officials say lawmakers inadvertently forgot about the children at military schools when approving their bill because not all lawmakers realize the struggle that many military families face to make ends meet.
Three-quarters of the enlisted members earn less than $30,000 a year. About 3 percent of the 1.6 million service members qualify for food stamps and about 1 percent, or 17,000, receive them monthly, according to the Defense and Agriculture Departments.
At Camp Lejeune, N.C., for example, 55 percent of the 3,400 pupils at the eight military-run schools on base receive meals free or at the reduced price of 40 cents. Switching to a state block grant may increase the price of subsidized lunches beyond the reach of some families, said Jan Holt, director of food services for the Camp Lejeune schools.
"A hungry child simply is not able to learn up to their potential," Ms. Holt said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Parley Puts Focus On Africa

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, March 8

 BODY:
There was little disagreement today among rich and poor countries over the special and urgent needs of Africa south of the Sahara, as delegates at the World Summit on Social Development debated, sometimes bitterly, a plan for fighting worldwide poverty.
There is also a sense that Africa, more than other continents, may be the first to come out of this conference with hopes of concrete action. 
 "Sub-Saharan Africa is now the major development challenge," John W. Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, an independent research and policy organization in Washington, said in an interview here. "The major response is going to have to be hands-on forms of development cooperation, including concessional money."
The region is the one that emerged from the cold war era in worse shape than any other, according to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros-Boutros Ghali.
United Nations agencies meeting last week agreed to set up a special committee to address the human needs of African nations, Mr. Boutros Ghali said today.
The entire region attracts barely 6 percent of international investment, according to James Gustave Speth, administrator of the United Nations Development Program. Thus there is little reason to expect more private-sector support.
There is wide agreement that debt relief of some kind is almost certainly on the way for Africa. Denmark, the host of the Social Summit, led the way this week, announcing it would cancel about $200 million in debts owed by six poor nations, four in Africa -- Angola, Egypt, Ghana and Zimbabwe -- and two in Latin America: Bolivia and Nicaragua.
But questions remain about how much debt to cancel and whether poor nations should be asked to do something in return to combat poverty on their own.
Mahbub-ul Haq, a former finance minister of Pakistan who is special adviser to the administrator of the United Nations Development Program, suggested here this week that every dollar of canceled debt should be spent on social services, that forgiven debt be matched by reductions in arms spending and that the funds be monitored internationally.
"It would be tragic if debts are canceled in the name of the poor and the resources saved were then wasted on the military or on irrelevant projects," he said, reflecting a growing sense here that even the poorest countries will have to be accountable for their policy decisions.
Of 47 nations officially labeled Least Developed Countries, 31 are African. In general, these countries saw per capita incomes drop to an average of $349 a year in 1991 from $369 in 1980. Among all developing countries, per capita average income rose from $1,035 to $1,118. In Eastern Europe, there was also an advance, from $3,880 to $4,620. Nations with developed market economies averaged $20,309 per capita, up from $16,159.
Charles Utete, an economist in Zimbabwe's delegation, said he was pleased at the focus on Africa, but concerned about what goals would survive in the final conference recommendations.
He said the conference "should not end with a document that merely enunciates agreement on positions of principle, and does not give a sense of direction as to what action needs to be taken," he said. Several leading industrial nations oppose debt cancellation.
Zimbabwe devotes about 40 percent of its budget to social programs, he said.
Zimbabwe also benefits from being part of the South African Development Community, a bloc that many believe is the region's most hopeful sector, in part because it has the best railroad and air links, making trade easier. The other members are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland and Zambia.
Mr. Sewell suggests that richer nations will have to make pragmatic choices in aid to Africa in the future.
"The outside community has got to put a priority on African countries where they think they can work, where there is competence and a commitment to development," he said. In these terms, and taking into account the regional transportation networks, agricultural advances and high worker productivity of Southern Africa, he said, "You have an area of great potential here."
"There are other countries where in the immediate sense development is not possible, either because they are literally torn apart, like Somalia, or they are in some form of anarchy like Zaire," he said.
Although such nations may not be viable investments now, some participants in a recent Unesco conference on African development said that the industrial nations owed a "moral debt" for what these countries suffered during the cold war.
But the participants in the Unesco conference also agreed in a report that, "Africa will never be built by foreigners" and that "the end purpose of assistance is to make it possible for assistance to be phased out."
Mr. Sewell sees irony in Republican legislators' calls for an abrupt end to American aid to Africa.
"The four great recipients of United States aid to Africa in the 1980's -- under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, though really starting with Carter, to be fair -- were Sudan, Somalia, Liberia and Zaire. The amount of money was horrifying. Something like $800 million for Somalia over the decade, all for cold war reasons. And it was all wasted.
"Ratholes are bipartisan in the U.S.," he said.
