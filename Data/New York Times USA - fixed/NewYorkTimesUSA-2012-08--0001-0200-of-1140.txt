HEADLINE: Jury Clears Ex-Manager At Citigroup In Debt Case

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN. 
Eduardo Porter, whose Economic Scene column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
A federal jury on Tuesday cleared a Citigroup executive of wrongdoing in connection with the bank's sale of risky mortgage-related investments at the peak of the housing boom, dealing a blow to the government's effort to hold Wall Street executives accountable for their conduct during the financial crisis.
The Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Brian Stoker, a former midlevel Citigroup executive, with negligence related to his role in creating exotic mortgage securities known as collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s. In a lawsuit filed last October, the government said that Mr. Stoker, who prepared sales materials for C.D.O.'s, knew or should have known that he was misleading investors by not disclosing that Citigroup helped select the underlying mortgage securities in the C.D.O. and then placed a large bet against it. 
The jury rejected the S.E.C.'s case, concluding that Mr. Stoker was not liable under the securities laws. In addition to handing up its verdict, the jury also issued an unusual statement.
''This verdict should not deter the S.E.C. from investigating the financial industry, to review current regulations and modify existing regulations as necessary,'' said the jury's statement, which was read aloud in the courtroom by JudgeJed S. Rakoff, who presided over the two-week trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
The statement appeared to echo frustration felt by many Americans that Wall Street executives had not been held responsible for its questionable actions leading up to the financial crisis, and that financial industry reform had thus far been inadequate.
In his own statement,Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement, appeared to take the jury's message to heart.
''We respect the jury's verdict and will continue to aggressively pursue misconduct arising out of the financial crisis,'' he said.
The S.E.C. had filed separate civil fraud charges against Citigroup in connection with the C.D.O. deal, but none of the bank's senior managers were named in the lawsuit. Mr. Stoker was the only individual Citigroup executive charged in the case.
Mr. Stoker's lawyer, John W. Keker, had depicted his client as a scapegoat for Wall Street wrongdoing. While decrying the ''high-stakes, high level gambling'' that banks had engaged in during the housing boom, Mr. Keker urged the jury to set aside any distaste that it had for the financial industry's dubious behavior and the complex mortgage securities that it concocted. He also emphasized that Mr. Stoker was a relatively junior executive whose actions were ordered by his bosses.
''It's not the bank or the transaction that's on trial here,'' Mr. Keker said in his closing argument. ''It's Brian Stoker.''
As Mr. Stoker prepared for trial, his former employer agreed to pay $285 million to settle a civil complaint brought by the S.E.C. related to the same deal. But Judge Rakoff rejected that settlement. Calling the amount of money Citigroup had agreed to pay ''pocket change'' for the bank, he said the settlement deprived the public ''of ever knowing the truth in a matter of obvious public importance.''
Both the S.E.C. and Citigroup appealed Judge Rakoff's rejection of the settlement. In March, a federal appeals court ruled that Judge Rakoff might have overstepped his authority in scuttling the deal.
Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said the bank agreed with the jury's verdict and hoped ''to secure final judicial approval of our settlement with the S.E.C. and put this matter behind us.''
The trial of Mr. Stoker served as a referendum on a questionable practice that became common in the run-up to the housing market's collapse: selling clients complex securities tied to mortgages while simultaneously betting against those same securities.
As real estate prices peaked in the middle of the last decade, Citigroup and other banks dived headlong into C.D.O.'s, which were bundles of mortgage securities pooled together and sold to investors who wanted to benefit from the housing boom. At the same time, another group of investors had a negative view of the housing market and wanted to bet against these C.D.O.'s.
Citigroup decided to play both sides of the trade. Mr. Stoker helped create a $1 billion C.D.O. structure - which was called Class V Funding III - that it sold to a group of sophisticated investors, including the bond insurer Ambac Financial Group and Koch Global Capital, an investment vehicle controlled by the billionaire Koch brothers.
The S.E.C. contended that Citigroup also used the deal to make a $500 million bet against the housing market. Citigroup secretly stuffed the C.D.O. with toxic mortgages that the bank thought would lose value and then took the opposite view of its clients. And Mr. Stoker negligently failed to include this information in the C.D.O.'s marketing materials, the government said.
''Citigroup stacked the deck and Brian Stoker dealt the cards,'' said Jeffrey Infelise, a lawyer for the S.E.C., during his closing statement.
Lawyers for Mr. Stoker presented evidence that Citigroup's marketing materials for the C.D.O. contained warnings that the investment was especially risky and disclosed that Citigroup might bet against the security. Mr. Stoker's lawyers also argued that Credit Suisse, the bank that Citigroup brought in to serve as a manager of the C.D.O., did its own homework on the underlying securities.
Mr. Stoker, who in 2007 was paid about $2.4 million by Citigroup, left the bank in 2008. A graduate of the University of Virginia and Harvard Business School, Mr. Stoker worked at Merrill Lynch and the hedge fund Carlson Capital before joining Citigroup. He lives with his wife and children in Pound Ridge, N.Y.
A broad smile came across Mr. Stoker's clean-cut face as the verdict was read. When Mr. Keker threw his arm around him, Mr. Stoker appeared overcome with emotion. As the jurors left the courtroom, Mr. Stoker tried to connect with them, silently signaling his thanks with a grin and a nod of his head.
''We're grateful that justice was done and Brian Stoker can get back to his life,'' Mr. Keker said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Steel Beats Forecasts in a Tough Climate

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
U.S. Steel reported second-quarter earnings on Tuesday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations as it raised some prices and sold more steel to energy companies.
The manufacturer also said it expects each of its business segments to manage an operating profit in the third quarter, although overall results should decline from the second quarter. 
U.S. Steel's net income still fell by half in the three months ended in June compared to the year-ago quarter because of challenging economic conditions. The company, whose headquarters are in Pittsburgh, earned $101 million, or 62 cents a share. That was down 54.5 percent from net income of $222 million, or $1.33 a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 2 percent to $5.02 billion.
Excluding an $11 million after-tax gain on an early redemption of senior notes, U.S. Steel reported adjusted net income of $112 million, or 69 cents a share. Analysts had predicted net income of 48 cents a share on revenue of $5 billion, according to FactSet.
Typically, the second quarter is the strongest for the industry. But steel manufacturers have turned in weaker second-quarter performances as a number of major customers reduced demand, including the construction industry. The economies of the United States, China and some emerging countries slowed, while Europe remained fragile, with some countries in recession.
Nucor, AK Steel Holding and ArcelorMittal all reported weaker earnings from April through June, blaming anemic demand.
U.S. Steel fared somewhat better because it sells more steel under contract to makers of automobiles, appliances and other products, Curt Woodworth, an analyst at Nomura Securities International, said.
Demand has been stronger in those markets and the contracts helped U.S. Steel keep prices more stable, Mr. Woodworth said.
In addition, U.S. Steel sold more pipes and other products to energy companies in the quarter. Its European operations were profitable for the first time since the second quarter of 2010.
For the quarter, U.S. Steel's overall shipments declined 1 percent from a year ago and were off 4.1 percent from the first quarter.
''The global economic recovery continues to be slow and unsteady, and we have focused on finding ways to make money in the economy we have today,'' John P. Surma, chairman and chief, said in a conference call.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Aims to Cut Growth of Its Health Costs

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
The Massachusetts legislature passed a first-in-the-nation bill on Tuesday that seeks to limit the growth of health care costs in the state.
The bill would not allow spending on health care to grow any faster than the state's economy through 2017. For five years after that, any rise in health care costs would need to be half a percentage point lower than the increase in the state's gross domestic product.
Legislative leaders say the bill, which includes other cost-slowing provisions, could save as much as $200 billion in health care spending over the next 15 years. 
Although Massachusetts, under Gov. Mitt Romney, in 2006 became the first state to require most residents to have health insurance -- the model for President Obama's national health care overhaul -- the law did little to slow health care costs that were already among the highest in the nation. Such spending has increased by 6 percent or 7 percent a year recently, compared with annual state economic growth of less than 4 percent.
Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, has been pushing for a plan to rein in health spending, promising that Massachusetts would show other states how to ''crack the code on costs.'' He is expected to sign the bill, which was filed just before the end of the legislative session as a compromise plan after the House and the Senate passed differing versions.
According to a summary of the bill released by legislative leaders on Tuesday, a new commission would monitor the growth in health costs and enforce the spending targets. But the bill contains no real penalty for missing the targets, and some consumer advocates are skeptical.
''These targets have the potential to establish a clear incentive to make real changes that will reduce costs, eliminate waste and improve patient care,'' Cheri Andes, executive director of the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, said in a statement. ''However, to accomplish these aims, an enhanced enforcement mechanism will likely be necessary.''
The bill includes a number of other provisions meant to cut health care costs, including dedicating $60 million collected from insurers over the next four years to prevention efforts and encouraging the creation of ''accountable care organizations,'' groups of doctors and hospitals that work together to coordinate patients' care.
One contentious proposal that was not included in the final bill would have imposed a ''luxury tax'' on high-priced medical providers and would have redistributed the money to struggling hospitals. Past investigations have revealed that large, prestigious providers -- like Partners HealthCare, which owns Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital, both affiliated with Harvard -- command substantially higher reimbursements from insurers than do their smaller and lesser-known peers.
In recent reports, Attorney General Martha Coakley, a Democrat, concluded that differences in payments to hospitals could not be explained by variations in quality, their mix of patients or the costs of academic medicine.
But some policy analysts warned lawmakers against regulating cost growth too tightly, saying that squeezing the state's world-famous health care sector could hurt its overall economy.
The bill would require that the new commission review providers that fail to meet the spending limits, and it would allow the attorney general to investigate those whose prices are ''materially higher'' than others'. But Nancy Turnbull, an associate dean at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the bill was ''not nearly what we need to deal with market power and the unjustified price differences that result.''
The bill, Ms. Turnbull added, ''still relies on the political will and resolve of political leaders to take action in the face of what will continue to be the overwhelming position and power of these dominant providers, and as this bill and others show, that is very tough to do.''

HEADLINE: Home Prices Rose in May For 4th Consecutive Month

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Home prices rose for the fourth month in a row in May, suggesting the recovery in the housing market continued to gain traction even as other economic indicators showed signs of weakness. 
Other data on Tuesday indicated consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in July but spending fell in June for the first time in nearly a year as Americans saved more.
The report on home prices, the S.& P./Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas, gained 0.9 percent in May from April on a seasonally adjusted basis, exceeding economists' expectations for a 0.5 percent gain.
The housing market, which collapsed in the 2007-9 recession, has been a relatively bright spot in the economy this year, although it remains hobbled by tight mortgage availability and continuing foreclosures.
''Real estate continues to show improvement off the bottom,'' said Subodh Kumar, an investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. ''That's one of the few encouraging signs we've seen.''
On a nonseasonally adjusted basis, prices fared even better, rising 2.2 percent. Compared with a year ago, price declines moderated, slipping 0.7 percent, which was the smallest drop since the last time year-over-year prices rose in September 2010.
Consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of economic activity in the nation, fell 0.1 percent in June after adjustment for rising prices, the Commerce Department said in a separate report.
''Consumers are afraid,'' said Matthew Lifson, an analyst at Cambridge Mercantile Group in Princeton, N.J. ''This data suggests that the U.S. economy is stagnant over all, and it's just muddling.''
Before adjustment for inflation, spending was flat, slightly less than forecasts for a 0.1 percent increase.
Household income rose in June by 0.5 percent, the most in three months, but consumers kept extra cash by saving more.
With price-adjusted incomes rising in June and consumption falling, the saving rate for households rose to 4.4 percent, its highest level in a year.
Still, consumers' moods have not completely deteriorated, and a separate gauge showed confidence unexpectedly rose in July as Americans were more optimistic about the short-term outlook than they were about their current situations.
The Conference Board Consumer Research Center said its index of consumer attitudes climbed to 65.9 from a upwardly revised 62.7 in June. Recent strength in the stock market probably was the reason, economists said.
Despite the improvement, confidence remains well below levels recorded before the financial crisis.
''Given the current economic environment, in particular the weak labor market, consumer confidence is not likely to gain any significant momentum in the coming months,'' Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board, said in a statement.
In the manufacturing sector, the rate of business activity in the Midwest rose in July, as somewhat stronger new orders offset a weakening environment for labor.
The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer rose to 53.7 from 52.9 in June. The report was released a day before two larger national manufacturing reports.

HEADLINE: The Crisis at the Postal Service, as the Union Sees It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Snail Mail in an Election Year'' (editorial, July 24) doesn't mention the primary cause of the United States Postal Service's financial crisis: a 2006 law that requires the agency to prefund health care benefits for future retirees. 
No other government agency or private company bears this burden, which forces the Postal Service to pay a 75-year liability in a 10-year period at a cost of about $5.5 billion a year.
This onerous mandate accounts for 85 percent of the Postal Service's red ink.
Instead, you advocate cuts in service and call on the House to approve legislation that Republican leaders are reluctant to bring to the floor before the election because it is so odious.
The bill (H.R. 2309) would require the Postal Service to shut tens of thousands of rural post offices, close half the country's mail-processing plants, end Saturday delivery and empower a financial control board to tear up union contracts. The service has already scaled back overnight mail delivery.
Does the Postal Service have to modernize to meet the challenge of the Internet? Absolutely. But it can't do that while struggling to survive a congressionally manufactured crisis.

HEADLINE: Seeing the World in Anniversary Style

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A MAGAZINE devoted to travel is sponsoring a promotion that is meant to remind readers of, appropriately enough, an airline's advertising slogan, ''You can't beat the experience.''
The magazine, Conde Nast Traveler, will commemorate its 25th anniversary by offering what is being billed as deeply discounted grand travel packages created for the promotion. The World on Sale, as the promotion is called, includes more than 30 trips to destinations like Argentina, China, India and Russia.
The packages offer experiences that include a helicopter flight over Mount Everest at sunrise; a day at Highclere Castle, where the television series ''Downton Abbey'' is filmed; and a tour of Wolgan Valley in Australia, which a young Charles Darwin visited in 1836, accompanied by his great-great-grandson, Chris Darwin. 
Conde Nast Traveler has signed two marketers to be the top sponsors of the promotion, Chase Card Services and United Airlines. Other sponsors include Abu Dhabi Tourism, Culture Authority, Cartier, Peninsula Hotels and Viking River Cruises.
The promotion officially begins Aug. 21, when the September anniversary issue of Conde Nast Traveler is to arrive on newsstands. There will be a presale period for subscribers of the magazine and holders of the Chase Sapphire and Chase Sapphire Preferred credit cards that starts Aug. 13.
A campaign devoted to stimulating interest in the World on Sale will include ads in Conde Nast Traveler; a section of the magazine's Web site; promotions on Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter; video ads in Times Square and taxi cabs; displays in Hudson News stores in 25 major markets; and an anniversary party at Lincoln Center.
The promotion, which is costing the magazine about $500,000, illustrates two trends that are changing the way Madison Avenue communicates. One, in response to the uncertain economy, is comfort marketing, which uses anniversaries and other aspects of brand history and heritage to suggest they have staying power and are therefore offering value.
''People are going back to the brands they know and trust,'' said Carolyn Kremins, vice president and publisher of Conde Nast Traveler in New York, part of the Conde Nast Publications division of Advance Publications.
For a milestone anniversary, ''there is a natural reaction to look back,'' she added, but ''we also want to use this as a platform for what's next.''
The other trend is called experiential marketing, which engages consumers directly through real-world experiences, rather than indirectly through commercials or similar forms of advertising.
Among the ''high-net-worth, well-traveled'' readers, which are the sweet spot for Conde Nast Traveler, ''experience is the ultimate luxury,'' Ms. Kremins said, as ''they seek out life-affirming adventures.''Ms. Kremins brought the idea to become top sponsors to Chase Card Services and United, which are participating as part of their ad schedules with Conde Nast Traveler for 2012.
''It's our largest partnership with this magazine for a calendar year,'' said Daniel Cuellar, the senior manager for advertising at the United Airlines unit of United Continental Holdings in Chicago. ''We're actively looking for these kinds of opportunities from the media and embracing them.''
''It seemed like a great fit for us, to showcase the breadth of the combined airlines' route networks,'' he added, referring to the merger of United and Continental, ''not just in a full-page ad, but in a creative and fun way.''
United will offer purchasers of travel packages 20 percent discounts on flights, Mr. Cuellar said, whether the tickets are in economy, economy plus, business class or first class. And all those who book their itineraries through United can use the airline's airport lounges, he added, a perk not usually offered to economy or economy plus passengers.
Like United, Chase Card Services, part of JPMorgan Chase, is seeking nontraditional ideas from media companies. Take, for instance, a recent reality series on the Bravo cable channel whose full title was ''Around the World in 80 Plates Presented by Chase Sapphire Preferred.'' The credit card brand was even a co-producer of the show.
''We are looking for media partnerships that create a level of engagement that goes well beyond advertising,'' said Sean O'Reilly, a general manager for Chase Card Services in Wilmington, Del. ''That's absolutely necessary to drive our business.''
''The World on Sale offers our customers, and those considering becoming our customers, exceptional values curated by Conde Nast Traveler,'' he said, adding, ''They are bucket-list packages. They are packages you didn't even know were on your bucket list.''
Chase Card Services will also ''cross-promote the World on Sale with Conde Nast Traveler,'' Mr. O'Reilly said.
And Chase Card Services will separately offer cardholders a package that includes attending the party at Lincoln Center, he added, for 120,000 rewards points.
According to Ms. Kremins, the anniversary issue will carry an estimated 119 ad pages, up 37 percent from the September 2011 issue and the largest September issue since 2008. The rate base, the circulation guaranteed to advertisers, is 800,000; it was 550,000 when the magazine was introduced in 1987.
The discounts on the travel packages are up to 65 percent off retail values, Ms. Kremins said, offering as an example three packages that include the Everest flyover. Each will cost $7,300 a person, or 43.8 percent off the retail price of $13,000.

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: Unprosecuted Crimes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Read the newspaper and you will see many instances of ordinary citizens going to jail when they break the law, while the elites face a mere slap on the wrist. 
One shouldn't be fooled by the perp walks of rogue traders who hid billions in losses, perpetrators of Ponzi schemes or executives who committed insider trading for their own accounts. They are prosecuted because getting rid of the bad apples is in the interests of the firms involved and the securities industry in general.
But what has never been routinely prosecuted are the crimes in which corporations benefit because, after all, Big Business runs government instead of the other way around. For example, efforts to prosecute fraud in the 2008 economic debacle have focused on homeowners who made fraudulent loan applications, not the financial institutions that encouraged these loans.
These are among the others typically not prosecuted for their crimes:
Stockbrokers who engage in unauthorized trading.
Manufacturers that sell harmful products and then lie about their safety.
Factory owners who ignore safety rules and thereby injure their workers.
Except in the most egregious cases or where the larger interests of the industry are involved, executives and professionals are usually charged only civilly, which means they pay a fine or lose some privilege (often just temporarily). For this purpose, an alphabet soup of regulatory agencies, whose real purpose is to protect the industries, exists.
Those in the professions -- law, medicine, accounting and so on -- have it even easier. Their transgressions are usually turned over to their own professional associations.
In other words, nowadays only the activities of chumps fall under the jurisdiction of the police. Everyone else has a ''get out of jail free'' card.

HEADLINE: As Default Looms, Postal Service Sees Deeper Woes

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service, on the verge of its first default on Wednesday, faces a cash shortage of $100 million this October stemming from declining mail volume that could balloon to $1.2 billion next year, newly available documents show.
Confronting $11.1 billion in payments over the next two months for future benefits, the service said it would fail to pay about half that amount, which is due Wednesday, and does not foresee making the other half, which is due in September. An additional $5.6 billion payment due next year is also in question.
The service is struggling for ways to cut costs, but it cannot eliminate Saturday delivery, as it wants to, without Congressional approval, nor can it slow delivery of the mail without regulatory approval.
The Postal Service had hoped that Congress would help stanch the losses, as it did last year when it deferred the payment that is due again on Wednesday. But the House has taken no action. The Senate passed a measure that provided incentives to retire about 100,000 postal workers, or 18 percent of its employees, and allowed the post office to recoup more than $11 billion it overpaid into an employee pension fund. The Senate declined to act to stop Saturday deliveries. 
For now, the agency said its operations would not be affected by the defaults. Mail and packages will continue to be delivered, and employees and vendors will be paid.
The post office wants to reduce operating hours or close more than 13,000 post offices. It has also announced plans to close half of its processing centers. It wants Congress to give it more flexibility in setting prices. And it also wants to lower service standards to largely eliminate next-day delivery for first-class mail.
But even if the post office were to get these changes from Congress, including eliminating Saturday delivery and the multibillion-dollar payments on future retiree programs, the agency would still be losing money, it said. Since 2007, it has lost $25 billion -- $20 billion of which is attributable to the payments for future benefits, required by law since 2006.
''We are continuing to monitor our liquidly situation as we go into the new fiscal year and looking at all of our options,'' said David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service.
The Postal Service inspector general, David C. Williams, reviewed the post office's financial statements and confirmed its projected cash shortages last week in a memorandum to the postmaster general, Patrick A. Donahoe. It noted that if the service does not receive an anticipated $300 million windfall from political mailings before the elections on Nov. 6, the cash crisis could grow.
''The impact of this default may not be seen by the public, but it will be felt by the business community,'' said Arthur B. Sackler, co-coordinator of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, a trade group representing larger mailers like FedEx.
''This default couldn't come at a worse time, as many major and midsized mailers are preparing their budgets for next year,'' he said. ''With Congress delaying action on a postal bill, mailers will be increasingly wary about the stability of the Postal Service and will likely divert more mail out of the system. It would be the perfect storm of negatives for the Postal Service.''
The cash shortfall reflects a six-year decline in mail volume, because of businesses and individuals moving, at a faster pace than the Postal Service expected, to online bill paying, e-mail and other forms of electronic communications. The agency lost $5.1 billion in the 2011 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. So far this year, the agency has lost more than $25 million a day and expects to lose $14.1 billion total.
Mail volume has declined more than 20 percent, to 168 billion pieces last year, the most recent year for which figures are available, from a record high of 213 billion pieces in 2006. First-class mail, which provides the bulk of the Postal Service revenue, declined 28 percent, to 73 billion pieces of mail, from a record of 102 billion in 2002.
The inspector general said that one option could be suspending payments to one pension fund for current employees. The agency has already overpaid into the fund by more than $11 billion, and suspending payments would have no effect on current employees.
Another option would be delaying a $1.5 billion payment to the Labor Department for workers' compensation payments due in October. By delaying the payment or paying in three installments, the agency could hold on to cash, but that could also constrain Labor Department operations, the postal inspector general said.
Missing those payments would be on top of the looming default on Wednesday on payments for future retirees, a financing requirement imposed by Congress in 2006 and now opposed by the post office and its unions as overly stringent.
Thomas M. Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia who proposed the law, said the payment requirement was initiated by the administration of President George W. Bush.
''They saw that mail volume would decline in the future and didn't want the taxpayers to be on the hook for billions for the Postal Service employees' health care fund,'' Mr. Davis said. ''The agency is facing many problems with its business model, but the law has contributed to their financial situation because of the recession and mail volume has declined faster than projected.''
Last year, Congress allowed the agency to defer its payment until Aug. 1 because of declining revenue, and lawmakers worked to pass a bill that would overhaul the agency.
In the House, leaders have said they would not act on the bill before Congress left for the August recess at the end of this week.
Senators have criticized the House and have called for House leaders to schedule a vote on a postal overhaul before the agency defaults on its payments.
''If House leaders will stop punting on postal reform and start voting, we can preserve the Postal Service for future generations,'' said Senator Thomas R. Carper, a Delaware Democrat and co-sponsor of the Senate bill.
Postal unions said Congress created the problem the Postal Service finds itself in when it passed the 2006 law that required to agency to pay $5 billion a year into a future retiree health fund. The fund, they said, currently has $45 billion, enough to pay for decades of retiree health care.
''Congress has failed to deal with the unfair and unaffordable financial burden of prefunding, which is the one thing that could provide the Postal Service some much-needed breathing room to address its long-term challenges in a strategic way,'' said Fredric Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers union. ''In short, Wednesday's default won't be committed by the Postal Service, but by Congress.''

HEADLINE: Lightning Shatters Tower At a 19th-Century Church

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
A historic and graceful mid-19th century Episcopal church in brownstone Brooklyn sustained major damage as a result of a lightning strike last week, and the four weakened steeples rising above the corners of its stately bell tower will have to be torn down.
The lightning strike during severe thunderstorms on Thursday ripped stones off the bell tower of Christ Church in Cobble Hill and sent them tumbling down onto scaffolding that had been put up alongside the church for repairs. 
One pedestrian, Richard Schwartz, 61, a lawyer on the New York State attorney general's staff, had been walking or taking shelter under the scaffolding and was struck by either the collapsing scaffolding or debris and died later at Long Island College Hospital. Mr. Schwartz worked for the agency for more than 25 years as an antitrust lawyer in the economic-justice division.
On Tuesday, structural engineers and a demolition team hired by the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island assessed the damage to the brown sandstone church with the assistance of two cranes. One hoisted a cage for workers to the top of the 117-foot crenelated bell tower; the other raised a metal box in which were placed loose stones from one of the four steeples.
The steeples are about 70 feet tall, though they look shorter because they hug the corners of the square bell tower for most of their height. A spokeswoman for the city's Buildings Department, Ryan FitzGibbon, said Tuesday afternoon that one entire steeple had been taken down and the three others would be removed in coming days.
As saddened neighbors looked up from behind plywood barriers, they could also see that the roof of the nave had been punctured, meaning that rainwater could get inside the main hall of the church, which contains many elements, like the altar and pulpit, that were designed around 1916 by Louis C. Tiffany, more famous for his glass lampshades. One Gothic-arched window in the nave was almost completely devoid of glass; another was shattered. At least eight large brown stones were visible on the Kane Street sidewalk near the base of the tower.
Ms. FitzGibbon said the bell tower itself was structurally stable, although some blocks did come loose.
The church was designed in the Gothic Revival style by Richard Upjohn, a resident of the neighborhood who also designed Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan. Christ Church was completed in 1842, the fourth Episcopal congregation to be established in Brooklyn. The church, according to its Web site, was severely damaged by a fire in 1939 and all but six windows of the nave were destroyed, including a Tiffany window depicting the Adoration of the Magi. The church, though, was rebuilt and designated a city landmark in 1969, around the same time Cobble Hill, with its rows of elegant brownstones and shady, tree-lined sidewalks, was named a historic district.
''It sparkles with the natural variations in coloring of such stonework,'' a Landmarks Preservation Commission report said at the time of the church.
According to the Rev. Shawn Duncan, the canon for media and mission at the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, Christ Church's average Sunday attendance is 77. Asked whether the diocese would restore the church to its state before the lightning strike, Mr. Duncan said, ''We're still in conversation with the insurance company about that.''
''That would be ideal,'' he added, ''but we don't know what's covered and what the congregation will have to bear.''
It was not clear when services would resume at the church, Mr. Duncan said, but for the near future, the diocese would assist the rector of Christ Church, the Rev. Ronald Lau, and the leadership of the parish in finding alternative locations for worship.
The church is a mainstay of the community, residents said, not only for its Sunday services but also for its annual St. Nicholas Medieval Christmas Fair. Elisabeth Broome, the managing editor of Architectural Record, an industry publication, and a resident of Cobble Hill for 14 years, said that her 7-year-old twins, Alejandro and Isabel, attended a preschool at the church and that Isabel still took ballet lessons there. The church also hosts a club for buying organic food, she added.
''It's a seminal piece of architecture from that point in time,'' she said. ''It contributes to the character of this part of brownstone Brooklyn that has been so lucky to be well preserved. It's very much an anchor of the neighborhood.''
Margaret Maycumber, a retired assistant literary agent who often has attended the Christmas fair, said her thoughts were with Mr. Schwartz, who died in the storm.
''That poor man must have been waiting under the scaffolding to stay out of the rain,'' she said.

HEADLINE: 24 Hour Fitness Is Said to Be for Sale

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
The health club chain 24 Hour Fitness is for sale, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.
Forstmann Little, the private equity firm that owns 24 Hour Fitness, has hired Goldman Sachs to run the auction process, these people said. Goldman will soon begin soliciting interest from potential buyers, a group that includes other fitness chains and private equity firms. 
The chain is expected to fetch about $2 billion in a sale, said these people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal publicly.
With about 425 locations, 24 Hour Fitness is the nation's largest privately owned chain of fitness centers. A representative of the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Forstmann Little's eventual sale of 24 Hour Fitness was expected. Once one of the world's largest private equity funds, Forstmann Little began winding down its operations several years ago after ill-timed telecommunications investments. Theodore J. Forstmann, the financier who led the firm, died last November at the age of 71.
The chain is one of the two major investments remaining in Forstmann Little's portfolio. The other is IMG, the sports, fashion and media company. Forstmann Little is also expected to pursue a sale of IMG next year.
The Forstmann Little fund formally expired on June 30, meaning that it was contractually required to sell its assets and return all money to its investors by then. But the firm's investors - called limited partners in private equity parlance - had allowed that deadline to lapse and granted the fund extra time to sell 24 Hour Fitness and IMG.
After Mr. Forstmann's death, Forstmann Little named the hedge fund manager Julian H. Robertson its chairman. He and Mark J. MacDougall, a lawyer at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, have been overseeing the sale of the firm's remaining assets.
Health club chains have been attractive acquisition targets for private equity firms because their membership fees generate predictable cash flows that they can use to pay off the debt taken on to pay for the company. The New York-based chain Equinox, for example, was owned by North Castle Partners and J.W. Childs before it was sold to the real estate developer Related Companies.
Other potential buyers of 24 Hour Fitness include LA Fitness, a chain of health clubs partially owned by the private equity firm Madison Dearborn, and Lifetime Fitness, a publicly traded company.
Forstmann Little acquired 24 Hour Fitness, based in San Ramon, Calif., in 2005 for $1.6 billion. The company's financial results suffered during the recession, but have since improved. In recent years the company has expanded internationally, opening several outposts in Asia.
24 Hour Fitness was started in 1983 by Mark S. Mastrov, a former natural-foods salesman, with a single club. Today, the company is a sponsor of the United States Olympic team, and at the London Games has several athletes on its ''Team 24'' squad, including the beach volleyball star Kerri Walsh and the water polo team captain Tony Azevedo.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: League Labor Proposal Under Review

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
NHL players began examining the league's proposed expansion of revenue sharing in the latest round of labor talks on Tuesday.
NHL Players' Association executive director Don Fehr said he can't make a counterproposal on the league's full package, which included a decrease in hockey-related revenue, term limits on contracts and a 22 percent salary rollback, until his group receives and examines requested team financial reports. The first batch -- 76,000 pages -- arrived late Monday night.
The meetings will continue Wednesday at the NHL offices in New York as the sides work to try to avoid another lockout that would threaten the upcoming season. More talks are scheduled next week when Fehr returns from a meeting with NHL players in Russia. 
While both sides acknowledged negotiations are amicable and constructive, Fehr said players clearly are ''not enamored'' with proposed limitations on contract lengths and a clause that would force them to wait longer before becoming unrestricted free agents.
Fehr wouldn't even say if he is encouraged by the revenue-sharing proposal.
''We haven't evaluated the changes from current revenue sharing to determine whether we think it's the appropriate thing to do or if it misses the mark in some respect,'' Fehr said.
Eleven players attended Tuesday's meetings: Craig Adams (Pittsburgh Penguins), Dan Cleary (Detroit Red Wings), BJ Crombeen (Tampa Bay Lightning), Mathieu Darche (Montreal Canadiens), Shawn Horcoff (Edmonton Oilers), Steve Montador (Chicago Blackhawks), George Parros (Florida Panthers), Cory Schneider (Vancouver Canucks), Kevin Westgarth (Los Angeles Kings), Ryan Whitney (Edmonton Oilers) and Keith Yandle (Phoenix Coyotes).
Yandle's team has struggled financially and would benefit from revenue sharing's increased subsidies. He declined comment on Tuesday.
Three owners also attended the talks -- Washington's Ted Leonsis, Minnesota's Craig Leipold and Boston's Jeremy Jacobs -- along with general managers Brian Burke of Toronto and Jim Rutherford of Carolina.
Though the calendar is turning to August, leaving just six weeks before the current CBA expires, no one was pressing the panic button during the sixth straight week of talks.
NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said he believes there is ''ample time to make a deal'' now that all league proposal are on the table. The NHL canceled the entire 2004-05 season before the current collective bargaining agreement was finally reached seven years ago.
Fehr declined comment on the pace of the current negotiations.
''All I've said is Sept. 15 is not a magic date unless someone wants to make it so,'' Fehr said. ''There's nothing that happens on Sept. 15 if we don't have an agreement, provided nobody says we're going to go on strike or says we're going to lock the doors.''
He said the two sides will just continue working toward an agreement.
While various subcommittees have discussed everything from ice conditions and player pensions to grievance procedure in past sessions, core economic issues are now at the center of the talks.
Players currently receive 57 percent of hockey-related revenues, and reports indicate the initial league proposal on July 13 asked that it be reduced to 46 percent.
The owners want to extend rookie contracts to five years from the current three, and they want to cap all contract lengths at five years.
As for revenue sharing, it remains a key to the health of the league to keep the poorest teams financially stable.
The NHL has had two seasons disrupted by labor disputes over the past two decades. In addition to the cancellation of the 2004-05 season, almost half of the 1994-95 season was wiped out by a labor dispute. Training camps are scheduled to start on Sept. 16, one day after the current CBA ends. The regular season is slated to begin on Oct. 11.
While Fehr continued to ask for financial documents, Bettman claimed the players' association already had much of the information.
''We're doing our best to comply with all of their requests regardless of whether we think they are relevant,'' Bettman said.

HEADLINE: Burmese Tea Leaves That Feel Like Family

BYLINE: By LIGAYA MISHAN

 BODY:
HOW often does a salad make your pulse scurry, keep you up all night? At Foragers City Table, in Chelsea, the culprit is long-fermented tea leaves, pulverized into a pulp the color of a damp forest floor.
Slightly sour, slightly bitter, it invokes grass, roots and all, with a wild turn toward cabernet sauvignon at the finish. It comes in a ring of condiments -- tiny crescents of briny dried shrimp, nutty fried yellow split peas, toasted sesame and sunflower seeds, peanuts and crispy wafers of garlic -- around shreds of little gem lettuce, dewy with an emulsion of sesame oil and lime juice. Mix it all up and you have crunch and tang, bright and dark, salt and heat.
The salad, which costs $17, is an adaptation of the Burmese snack laphet thote, which in Yangon goes for about 500 kyat, or 50 cents. (Welcome to the global economy.) It is traditionally made without lettuce, at street stalls where the ingredients are squeezed together with the cook's bare hands, or served separately in a compartmentalized tray, so you can pinch a little of each. 
The approach here is more reverential. On a stark white plate, the elements are arranged symmetrically, like a mandala. Pause a moment to admire the divine geometry. Then demolish it.
Foragers City Table, which opened in April, is an annex to the boutique market Foragers City Grocer. Both are offshoots of Foragers Market in Dumbo, Brooklyn, which subscribes to the credo of local sourcing and sustainability.
The owners -- Anna Castellani; her husband, the painter Richard Lamb; and Clifford Shikler, a painter and a photographer -- run a 28-acre farm in the Hudson Valley that provides the stores and the restaurant with eggs, herbs and vegetables, some grown, some foraged. Even those fermented tea leaves, imported from Burma, are local in spirit: they come from the family of a Burmese friend of the consulting chef, Douglas Monsalud.
The menu, devised by Mr. Monsalud, who is based in San Francisco, and refined by the on-site chef, Jason Greenberg, cadges seasonings from across Asia. Yuzu kosho, an infernal chile paste with a slug of salt and high, tremulous notes of lemony yuzu zest, is daubed on pudgy raw scallops ($14). Lemon grass perfumes the caramel glazing a Red Wattle porterhouse chop ($30).
Pork crepinettes ($13) are globes of pork sausage, made by the in-house butcher and wrapped in caul fat from a pig's intestine, which gives them a dark crust and a lush interior. Presented Vietnamese style -- with lettuce, chiles and mint for bundling, and nuoc cham, tempered with Meyer lemon, for dunking -- they yield potent, gratifying handfuls.
At first a doll-size portion of potato chips ($5) seems ridiculous. But the diaphanous chips, gilded with chicken fat and brushed with yuzu salt, punch above their weight, although they are nearly upstaged by a garnish of flash-fried sage leaves.
Larger-scale dishes falter, like a milquetoast black cod ($29), briefly prodded to life by shards of house-made bacon, and a lamb-belly adobo ($27) over-sloshed with vinegar. Slabs of fried tofu ($17), huddled in an archipelago on a sea of kale, veer into candy land with a black-pepper caramel. This may be just a matter of one chef inheriting the ideas of another and needing time to come into his own.
The dining room is an airy box of polished wood and steel beams, with a shimmering wall of floor-to-ceiling windows. It is handsome, if slightly unspecific: what might happen if West Elm opened a restaurant. You wish it had more dirt under the fingernails.
The adjoining grocery is cozier. How lovely it is, after dinner, to stroll among the shelves, feeling slightly blurry from that shiso gimlet, stocking up on Whimsy & Spice cookies and Madecasse chocolate, blessing all the artisanal vendors in Brooklyn, and the farmers upstate, and the Red Wattle hogs hanging in the butcher's aging room, and the family in Burma fermenting their tea leaves.

HEADLINE: Archer's Profit Drops 25% on Losses in Ethanol Unit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- Archer Daniels Midland, the corn processing company, posted a 25 percent decline in quarterly profit on Tuesday, hurt by record corn prices and a decline in profit from its ethanol operations. 
The company earned $284 million, or 43 cents a share, below the $381 million, or 58 cents a share, it earned a year ago.
Revenue slipped less than 1 percent to $22.68 billion from $22.87 billion a year earlier.
Analysts expected a profit of 59 cents a share on revenue of $21.85 billion. Stock in Archer Daniels, which is based in Decatur, Ill., fell $1.40, or 5 percent, to $26.09 a share.
Corn processing results slid $48 million because of negative ethanol margins.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other operations generated a profit of $84 million for the quarter, down $6 million, mainly on weaker biodiesel results from Europe, where half of the monetary union has slipped into recession. Corn processing took a hit from negative ethanol margins. Operating profit in the segment was down $48 million from last year, to $74 million.
Weaker merchandising in the United States also hurt the quarter's results. Archer's three main operating segments, corn processing, agricultural services and oilseeds processing, were strained.
Net income from the biggest segment, oilseeds, fell to $331 million from $449 million a year earlier.
The chief executive, Patricia Woertz, vowed to face the headwinds.
''While U.S. crop carryouts are expected to be low, we have an experienced business team to manage through this environment,'' Ms. Woertz said.

HEADLINE: Pondering the Euro Puzzle

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Most people have heard of the Marshall Plan. Some might even know what Brady bonds are. But they have not yet heard of the Brunnermeier plan. Or Bishop bonds. Or the Gros accord.
That is because they do not exist yet -- except as dreamy proposals by economic thinkers to fix the European debt crisis.
While dealing with Europe's financial difficulties has been a grim slog for the Continent's austerity-weary citizens and its frustrated policy makers, it is the opportunity of a lifetime for ambitious idea merchants looking for fame.
If any of them can come up with a plan that is adopted by Europe, they will have secured a coveted place in history -- like George C. Marshall, the secretary of state who fashioned the plan to help rebuild Europe after World War II, and Nicholas F. Brady, the Treasury secretary whose introduction of a class of investor-friendly bonds helped end the Latin American financial debacle in the early 1990s. 
Three in particular who are respected in top policy circles and have access to the right people are Markus K. Brunnermeier, Graham Bishop and Daniel Gros.
Each is proposing a grand plan to save the euro zone from financial ruin -- and to do it in a way that may break through the political impasse that has made a solution so elusive. None of them, or anyone else, are assured of success, given the depth of Europe's problems and the difficulty of reaching consensus among the 17 European Union countries using the euro.
The rival approaches vary. But all are meant essentially to help the two big euro zone countries on the financial precipice -- Spain and Italy -- find buyers for their debt at a reasonable enough cost that their governments can afford to recharge their economies over the long run. Success would mean developing a solution that persuades cash-rich Germany that it will not be on the hook if these countries run out of money.
Armed with PowerPoint presentations and not a little guile, they have been promoting their competing ideas in meetings in Brussels, the center of the European Union; Frankfurt, home of the European Central Bank; and, in particular, Berlin, where the approval of German government officials is essential to the adoption of any plan.
''There is no shortage of ideas to solve the crisis, but there is a shortage of actionable plans,'' said Mr. Brunnermeier, a finance professor from Germany at Princeton who represents Euro-nomics, a recently formed group of nine euro zone economists focused on the European crisis.
As he has shopped his plan, which calls for a type of Europe-backed bond that would not place an onerous claim on German coffers, Mr. Brunnermeier has traveled a similar circuit as the other two who are promoting their own euro restoration blueprints: Mr. Gros, the head of an influential Brussels research group, and Mr. Bishop, a British specialist on European Union financial and regulatory matters.
The odds remain long that any of these proposals will be adopted in full. History-shifting ideas tend to come from within government -- as was the case of the Marshall Plan or the Brady bonds -- not outside it.
But arriving at a plan that satisfies the euro-using countries, and Germany in particular, has stumped government officials. Thus the opening for the well-connected policy entrepreneur.
And there is little time to lose given the fund-raising needs of Europe's weaker nations.
According to a report by Bridgewater, a large United States hedge fund, Spain and Italy must issue 300 billion euros, or $368.5 billion, worth of bonds this year and 1.6 trillion euros, or nearly $2 trillion, by 2015. Cash-depleted banks in those countries are now following the lead of foreign investors by reducing their bond purchases, causing Spain's and Italy's borrowing costs to climb to dangerously high levels in recent weeks.
Mr. Brunnermeier and Mr. Bishop are pushing variants of a common euro bond that would represent a pooling of some of Europe's national debts.
Mr. Gros supports turning the Continent's new rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, into a licensed bank and using it to buy distressed Spanish and Italian bonds. He first floated the idea in a 2011 paper written with Thomas Mayer, Deutsche Bank's chief economist at the time. And it is now under scrutiny in European power corridors.
''In a crisis, what matters is liquidity,'' Mr. Gros said during an interview.
Last week, when Ewald Nowotny, an Austrian member of the governing council of the European Central Bank, was quoted as saying there were arguments in favor of such a plan, European bond markets rallied on the news.
The European Central Bank's governing council will meet Thursday, and the financial world will be awaiting word of how the central bank's president, Mario Draghi, intends to keep his recent pledge to ''do whatever it takes'' to protect the euro currency union.
Mr. Gros, who is German but went to college in Italy and earned a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago, is now director of the Center for European Policy Studies. He argues that the euro zone's current rescue programs are too small to cast fear into the hearts of speculators who are helping to drive up borrowing costs for the bloc's weakest members.
Why not, he proposes, use the European Stability Mechanism's 500 billion euro cash cushion as leverage, to borrow up to five times as much from the European Central Bank? The money could then be used to buy distressed Italian and Spanish bonds in the open market.
That, he says, would be easier and quicker than lending directly to those countries as part of a bailout. ''You buy a Spanish bond at 75 cents to the dollar and you automatically reduce the country's debt,'' he said.
Mr. Gros has been pitching his proposal largely to German Finance Ministry officials in Berlin, without whose support the central bank would be unlikely to adopt such a plan. While he will not reveal the details of his interactions with the Finance Ministry, he points out that the government has not yet said no.
At more or less the same time, Mr. Brunnermeier has been making his own case in the same German circles.
At the root of his Euro-nomic group's proposal is the need in Europe for a safe financial asset that would stem the chaos of investors fleeing risky Spanish and Italian bonds and buying German securities.
Mr. Brunnermeier and his colleagues argue that a new European debt agency should be formed that, over time, would buy up to 5.5 trillion euros worth of euro zone governments' debt directly from governments and on the secondary market.
The debt agency would issue two types of euro bonds to finance these purchases. One would supposedly be extra-safe, backed by the full credit of the euro zone. The other would be riskier, and investors would know going in that they would take a loss if a country like Spain or Italy defaulted.
Mr. Brunnermeier has nicknamed his low-risk bond the Esbie, for European safe bond. Crucially, he points out, the Esbie is different from the original euro bond proposal that Germany rejected because each country would still be responsible for making good on its own debts. The richer ones would not be fully liable for backing the bonds if the weaker countries got into trouble, as would have been the case under earlier euro bond proposals.
The Esbie has the whiff of a pipe dream. The supposed safety of a common European bond without a 100 percent German guarantee may be difficult to sell to investors under current market conditions. But Mr. Brunnermeier says that his peers in Germany are intrigued.
''I think this has a good chance of working,'' said Mr. Brunnermeier, who has traveled to Frankfurt and Berlin frequently over the last months to press his case. ''This is the least costly option.''
Less ambitious, although based on a similar principle of not holding Germany liable for all debts, is Mr. Bishop's plan.
Mr. Bishop, a former investment banker and adviser to the European Commission, represents the European League for Economic Cooperation, a group of entrepreneurs who support closer integration in Europe.
He has been pushing the idea of a euro zone fund of about 2.5 trillion euros that would issue a series of short-term debt securities to match the borrowing needs of all euro zone countries.
The member nations' guarantees would follow the model of Europe's current bailout vehicle, the European Financial Stability Facility, with Germany backing just 28 percent of the fund and thus not being obliged to pump in more money if a Spain or an Italy defaulted on its debts.
Some experts wonder whether these proposals, in their potentially daunting complexity, miss a larger point: that the euro zone sovereign debt crisis will not be resolved until Germany and other rich northern countries agree to accept the losses in the south through debt write-downs, whether by Greece, Ireland, Spain or Italy.
''These proposals just move the losses and risks around,'' said Adam Lerrick, a sovereign debt specialist and visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ''There are real economic problems in Europe. Financial engineering can conceal them from taxpayers but it cannot make them disappear.''
But Mr. Bishop, who spends much of his time in Brussels, has already presented the plan to Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Union's administrative body, the European Council. He noted that Mr. Van Rompuy alluded to the proposal when he and other leaders laid out their vision in late June for the euro zone's future.
And lest there be any doubt that the three thinkers sense a competition among their proposals, Mr. Bishop makes it clear. ''It's the front-runner,'' he said of his group's action plan. ''And it also represents an integral step toward coordinating mutual policies in Europe.''

HEADLINE: With Crucial News Imminent, Traders Hold Back

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks ended slightly lower Tuesday as investors held back ahead of three important events this week: policy meetings at both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank and a closely watched report on jobs in the United States.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 64.33 points, or 0.49 percent, to close at 13,008.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged down 5.98 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,379.32, and the Nasdaq composite lost 6.32 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,939.52. 
The Federal Reserve, which started a two-day policy meeting Tuesday, had appeared to be moving toward announcing some kind of new step to energize the nation's economy. But questions over whether it will do so this week were raised by economists who believe the Fed is not convinced that the economic slowdown is pronounced enough yet to require more stimulus. Recent data, including reports released on Tuesday, have shown weakness in the economy has been offset by some pockets of strength.
The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending was unchanged in June. But personal income edged up 0.5 percent.
''If incomes are rising, but people aren't spending, it tells you that the consumer has some ammunition for more spending during the crucial back-to-school season,'' said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial.
There were other positive numbers. The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index released Tuesday showed that prices increased in all of the 20 cities it tracks. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased to its highest reading since April, and was better than expected.
Investors will be closely watching the outcome of the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday regarding concrete steps to help countries with crippling debt.
It will be the first meeting since the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said last Thursday that the central bank would do ''whatever it takes'' to preserve the euro, sending markets sharply higher. In the next few days, the leaders of Germany, France and Italy also said they would do all they could to protect the 17-country currency union. The comments raised expectations that the bank might step in to buy Spanish and perhaps Italian government bonds to lower the borrowing costs for those countries, which have risen sharply to unsustainably high levels.
Investors were also waiting for the monthly unemployment report on Friday, the most-watched gauge of economic health in the United States.
''There's a lot to absorb this week, including two major announcements from two very important central banks and payroll data,'' Mr. Krosby said.
Corporate earnings news did little to inspire investors. Aetna, the health insurance company, reported a 15 percent slump in net income as rising medical costs outweighed a gain in revenue. Its stock fell $1.08, or almost 3 percent, to $36.06.
Archer Daniels Midland hurt by record corn prices, reported a 25 percent decline in net income. The agriculture company's stock fell $1.40, or 5 percent, to $26.09.
Bond yields ended slightly lower. Investors are particularly interested in whether the Fed will change or extend its bond-buying program. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32, to 102 18/32, and the yield fell to 1.47 percent from 1.50 percent late Monday.
The euro also rose slightly against the dollar, to $1.23 from $1.22.

HEADLINE: Why a French Official Flew the Union Jack

BYLINE: By SCOTT SAYARE

 BODY:
GRANDE-SYNTHE, France -- Far from the news media crush, snarling traffic, air defense missiles and grousing residents of London, the Russian boxer Sofia Ochigava has been training for her Olympic debut at the ripe-scented municipal boxing club in this sleepy French town, across the English Channel from the cliffs of Dover.
''It's really boring here,'' said Ochigava, a 25-year-old lightweight and two-time world championship medalist, giggling a bit at the end of a morning training session. ''But we're not here for fun.''
Despite appearances and the odor, the training room is almost brand-new -- an additional ring has been added, there are now 22 punching bags instead of 3, and blue rubber padding now covers the concrete floor -- and Ochigava is far from the only Olympic contender who has prepared in this quiet corner of northern France. 
Local, regional and European authorities have invested more than $1 billion in an effort to make this region, including a small sliver of Belgium, the ''rear base'' of the London Olympics, with about 50 new or renovated sites for sports, including cycling and badminton. Organizers have also promoted the lower-than-London prices for food, lodging and training sites, and they have promised that athletes will be left alone, allowed to focus on their Olympic preparations away from the tensions and temptations of the British capital. A train ride beneath the channel can have competitors in London in as little as an hour.
Dozens of teams, at least one from every inhabited continent, have trained here, including gymnasts from France, Estonia and even Britain; BMX cyclists from Australia, Colombia, Ecuador and Belgium; wrestlers from the United States, Brazil and Senegal; Haitian sprinters; and taekwondo fighters from Tunisia and Vietnam.
In July 2005, to the shock and consternation of many French citizens, officials, athletes and organizers, London beat out Paris to host this year's Olympic Games. While their compatriots mourned, however, politicians here saw an opportunity to revitalize this declining, postindustrial region, seen by many as a sort of gray backwater. At least one regional official claims to have hoisted the British Union Jack above his offices on the very day of Paris's defeat.
International sporting events often involve the construction of training centers outside the host city, said Frederic Lemang, the technical coordinator for the investment project, which is called Le Plus Grand Terrain de Jeux, a slight play on words that could be translated as the Biggest Playing Field.
''Typically, it's in the host country,'' Lemang noted, however.
In 2010, a $10 million gymnastics facility, Europe's largest, went up in the town of Arques. Roubaix is now the proud home to a $31 million covered velodrome; amid the farm fields and high-tension power lines in Gravelines, rowers can now heave down a 10-lane, 1.4-mile canal; and the boxing facilities in Grande-Synthe received a $1 million touch-up.
Because most sports complexes here are publicly owned, a majority of them have been offered to visiting teams at no charge, said Wulfran Despicht, who leads the steering committee for the project. Such is hardly the case in England.
In addition to the lower costs and the calmer conditions, French authorities have also assured foreign delegations that area residents will receive them with open arms -- by all accounts, the same cannot be said of many Londoners -- and coaches and trainers from the area have been assigned to assist the visiting teams as necessary. Officials have also asked local restaurants to allow team cooks into their kitchens to help prepare meals for the athletes.
''When you know the power of restaurant chefs in France, you can see that this is not so simple,'' Despicht said with a laugh, but a number of chefs have complied.
According to Despicht, regional envoys have been dispatched to competitions across the world in recent years, including the Beijing Olympics in 2008, to sing the region's praises.
Octavian Ispas, the Romanian coach of Japan's canoe and kayak team, took his team to train here on the French seaside, in Boulogne-sur-Mer.
The Olympic Village is ''too busy for us,'' Ispas said, and the weather conditions here are almost identical to those in England. He also prefers French cooking to the cuisine offered just across the channel, he said, and he said that the boathouse here was new and the training facilities had been provided free.
''We came prepared to pay, but they wouldn't accept it,'' the coach said.
The local canoe and kayak club also offered to transport the team's seven carbon fiber boats to London, also without charge. ''They're very nice people,'' Ispas said.
The portly, bald and genial trainer at the boxing club in Grande-Synthe, Jose Leroy, has been shuttling one exigent Russian coach from sporting goods store to sporting goods store. While Leroy, 60, noted with some relief that the Russian team would be staying in France for just a short time, he says he is thrilled at the results of the regional investments.
''Five years ago, we never would have thought about organizing a French national tournament in Grande-Synthe,'' Leroy said. There have now been three such tournaments here, he said, in addition to visits by national teams from Italy, Spain, Poland, Portugal, Germany, Sweden and the Czech Republic. Membership in the boxing club has doubled, to 200 people.
Since 2008, visiting athletes have injected as much as $12 million into the regional economy through hotel stays and food, according to Despicht, of the steering committee.
The broader hope, however, is to transform the area into a hub for European professional sports.
''This is a region that's been eaten away at by economic difficulties, industrial difficulties,'' he said. Perhaps through athletics, Despicht said, the region will show that it has more than ''factories and unemployed people and chimneys spewing smoke.''
Enthusiasm for the new athletic sites is high at La Civette Jean Bart, a small bar and press stand in the port city of Dunkirk, where the French national handball team has trained in recent weeks.
''We used to have all the industries here,'' Davy Lemaire, 27, said as he pulled draft beers for a trickle of clients on a recent morning. ''Now there's nothing left.''
With its new array of facilities, Lemaire says the region is on its way to becoming a sort of sporting capital.
''Thankfully, there's the London Games,'' he said. ''If they had been in Paris, we wouldn't have gotten anything.''

TRAVELING in the United States, one often encounters food proudly touted as authentically ''New York,'' including pizza, hot dogs, cheesecake, Manhattan clam chowder, pastrami and loaves of rye. Sadly, such honorifics almost always prompt invidious comparison, resulting in a good laugh if not a few homesick tears.I still recall biting into a bialy about 15 years ago at the Broadway Deli, a favorite in Santa Monica, Calif., that closed in 2010. I was doing research on that scrunchy, savory Jewish-Polish onion roll. Identified as a ''New York bialy,'' its rubbery, pale appearance was fair warning. It came as no surprise that what looked like a white Rubbermaid sink stopper would taste like one, too.
Similarly, I have never met an out-of-town New York bagel that was not huge, puffy, soft-crusted, slightly sweet and lacking a sharply defined hole. New York cheesecake away from home is usually closer to the all-American Sara Lee model: thin and creamy, often with flavors that deviate from the traditional vanilla or lemon rind. 
Even more depressing, though, is the difficulty of finding what I consider authentic examples of these foods at home in New York. Economics, technology and altered sensibilities have brought changes, and the foods that I cherished from the 1930s to the mid '50s are (like myself) not quite what they used to be.
Hence this search for true New York classics. Better is not the issue; this is about lost tastes. Nor is this an attempt to find new variations on old favorites. Rather, it's a search for foods that recall my original ideals.
PIZZA
Forget Naples for now. The goal is New York City pizza margherita with a thick, crackling hot and blistered rim of yeasty dough, mantled with thickish tomato sauce and decked with slim ribbons or dicings of slightly dry domestic cow's milk mozzarella, all of it graced with grated Parmesan. Scorched in a coal-fired brick oven, the pizza emerges meltingly stringy with an inner crust that is thinner than the rim, but crisply substantial enough to hold as the triangular slice is folded and lifted to the mouth, with oregano and dried chiles to be sprinkled on.
The pizza that almost always still meets those standards is at John's of Bleecker Street. Good news for those needing pizza by the slice is the recent return of Mario DiRienzo, the original proprietor of Famous Ray's Pizza in Greenwich Village. He has renamed the same location Famous Roio's Pizzain honor of his Abruzzo hometown, Roio del Sangro, and the huge slices are deliciously New York.
CHEESECAKE
The New York classic is high and light but subtly textured, with a pale yellow blend of cream cheese, sometimes with a little pot cheese or sour cream, and always lots of eggs, sugar and vanilla. Grated lemon rind is the only other acceptable flavoring. The cake might be based on a thin cookielike crust or one formed of crushed graham crackers. The best example from the old school remains S & S Cheesecake, which has a delicate cookie crust and a good belt of natural vanilla. It is baked on 238th Street in the Bronx and can be ordered and then picked up fresh, warm and unfrozen. It is also sold online and at Zabar'sand two Dean & DeLuca stores, but is shipped frozen, a process that does not overly mar the texture but leaves the cake just a bit sunken when not gently thawed.
A close second is Junior's famed cheesecake, but only at the original restaurant in Downtown Brooklyn. Portions there seem fresher, lighter and more evenly moist, and with a nicely caramelized flavor, in contrast to some at the Grand Central Terminal outpost, where they can be a bit chewy and slightly soggy. Either way, avoid any hint of fruit or its sauce anywhere near the cake.
MANHATTAN CLAM CHOWDER
For complete accuracy, this perhaps should be called Brooklyn-Manhattan clam chowder, as my benchmark is the version I remember from the original Lundy's restaurant in Sheepshead Bay. Most typically, it is a clear tomato-based vegetable soup with dicings of carrots, celery, onions and potatoes, along with tangles of clams -- some in shreds, others in plump belly chunks -- all enhanced by a heady belt of thyme, the seasoning that underpins the saline bite of the clams. Manhattan clam chowder is still widely available at Greek coffee shops on Fridays, but most are canned, overly thick and starchy versions. Otherwise it is hard to find in restaurants, where the creamy New England chowder somehow prevails.
But a few, like the Grand Central Oyster Bar and Restaurant, BLT Fish in Chelsea and Aquagrill in SoHo, regularly serve the hometown soup. The Oyster Bar's chowder is pinkish with a cornstarch thickening and has the gentle flavor of thyme, oregano and bay leaves, and only mild clam undertones. BLT's version, alas, is overpowered by smoky bacon. Aquagrill ladles out the classiest, headiest Manhattan chowder, redolent of sea breezes, with fresh clam bits. The most generous amount of clams in recognizable belly pieces, along with shreds, is at Randazzo's Clam Barin Sheepshead Bay. It is a thick sauce of a soup without any refinement, but with a very filling zap. Detecting no thyme, I asked if it contained any. ''I don't know,'' the waitress answered. ''I've never tasted thyme.''
BAGELS
I remember them well. Say, about three and a half inches across with a good wide center hole; a crisp, shiny, golden crust; and chewy, dense, gray interiors that turned to stone if not eaten within three hours of being baked. (A few words about the hole: It is essential first because it ensures a crisp crust at the center, and because the cream cheese and smoked salmon, when properly laid across that empty expanse, afford a luscious mouthful uncompromised by bread.) Their like will not come this way again, given shortages of skilled workers and the modern taste for softness and eternal shelf life, plus the need for a gigantic size to justify a retail price that covers the high cost of labor.
Mini-bagels (plain only, please) are the best defense. Fortunately, there are quite delicious mini-bagels at Russ & Daughterson the Lower East Side, which gets them from the Bagel Hole, a small retail bakery in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Large bagels with amorphous centers from the same source taste good in small chunks, but have the usual oversized disadvantages. (As for the quality of bagels from the returning H & H, stay tuned.)
BIALYS
These owe more to Bialystok, Poland, where they were called kuchen, than to New York. Developed from the slightly soft, round poppy-seeded and onion-topped pletzel, bialys are distinguished by a puffy rim and a flat, wide, crisp center well. The poppy seeds were eliminated in this country but the onions remained abundant and golden brown. At Kossar's on the Lower East Side, once the mecca for the true bialy lover, craftsmanship has declined, resulting in softer, paler specimens often with no discernible center and a few soggy, pink onions. My solution is to buy Kossar'sstill delicious mini-onion disks, small focaccia-like pletzels too thin to be split but restorative when topped with butter or cream cheese.
JEWISH RYE
Embarrassing to admit, but the best example of this fragrant bread is at Langer's Delicatessenin Los Angeles. Luckily, New Yorkers are not completely bereft. The most readily available loaves are at the 96-year-old Orwasher's Bakeryon the Upper East Side: savory, generously seeded with caraway, but with a lighter, fluffier texture that is considered a shortcoming by the tradition-minded. It is sold at the bakery and at Citarellaand Dean & DeLuca, among many other outlets.
But the very best local example of this fragrant rye is made by the artisanal Rock Hill Bakehouse in Glens Falls, N.Y., and sold at the Union Square Greenmarket on Saturdays. Chewy and yeasty, with a convincingly tan sourdough color, this bread has a firm, tight crumb and plenty of caraway.
PASTRAMI
The goal is dark but brightly red beef, tender with glistening lacings of fat and aromatic with smoke, garlic and crushed black peppercorns. Overly celebrated because it is hand-sliced, the pastrami at Katz'son the Lower East Side, though somewhat flavorful, has never seemed to be made using high-quality meat and is often marred by disconcerting connective tissue.
But at the Pastrami Queenon the Upper East Side, pastrami is also hand-sliced on request, making for softer, more supple pieces than if machine-sliced. There, the deckle cuts of dry-cured and smoked beef are meaty, pungent and delicious, and best in sandwiches when combining lean and fatty cuts. (Sadly, all the corned beef I tried, another New York classic, lacked the essential corned or pickled flavor.)
HOT DOGS
The requirements here are simple: kosher-style, meaning all beef, natural casings and plenty of garlic and pepper. New York hot dogs should have a juicy snap-crackle when bitten into, a result of a generous amount of fat and a golden-brown glazing on the grill, that being the essential cooking method. The most evocative are the hot dogs at Katz's (unless burned black and leathery, as they often are) and at Nathan's, but only in Coney Island, where unmatched seasoning is added by salt-sea breezes and maniacal screams from the nearby rides.
If all of this leaves you thirsty, forget bottled water labeled ''New York.'' Just turn on the tap and let it run cold. It really doesn't get any better than that.

HEADLINE: In Cairo, Panetta Declares Support for Egypt's New President

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Kareem Fahim contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Leon E. Panetta, the United States defense secretary, said on Tuesday that President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt was ''his own man,'' a strong declaration of American support for Mr. Morsi, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood whose future course in Egypt remains a great unknown to the Obama administration.
Mr. Panetta, who was heading from the Egyptian capital to Jerusalem later on Tuesday, also said his meetings with the Israeli leadership would not focus on any possible Israeli or American military strike on Iran. 
''It's the wrong characterization to say that we're going to be discussing potential attack plans,'' Mr. Panetta told reporters after talks with Mr. Morsi and Egypt's top military commander, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi.
Instead, Mr. Panetta said he and Israeli leaders would share information and intelligence about what is known about Iran's nuclear program and its threat to Israel. The United States has developed highly classified plans for attack scenarios on Iran's nuclear facilities -- as a matter of business, the Pentagon prepares military plans for potential crises all over the world -- but is for now arguing that diplomatic pressure and tough economic sanctions on Iran should be given a chance to persuade the Iranian leadership to stop moving forward with a nuclear weapons program. Iran says its efforts are peaceful.
''We don't talk about, obviously, what specific military plans that we have,'' Mr. Panetta told reporters. ''We obviously continue to work on a number of options in that area.''
In Cairo, Mr. Panetta met with both Mr. Morsi and Field Marshal Tantawi in an ornate room at the presidential palace, which had been the home of the ousted president, Hosni Mubarak, for decades. The fact that Mr. Morsi and Field Marshal Tantawi were in the same room was significant because the president and the military have been struggling over who wields authority in Egypt.
The Egyptian military, which has long and deep ties with the Pentagon, has been reluctant to give up the power it seized after Mr. Mubarak was forced to step down last year. The Obama administration has regularly prodded the military to hand the reins to Mr. Morsi, even as American officials are unsure of what they are getting with him. At this point, Mr. Morsi has made no moves toward creating an Islamist government, although Christian and secular Egyptians remain deeply suspicious. Defense officials on Mr. Panetta's trip said that it was still early to know Mr. Morsi's true intentions and that he will probably move slowly.
Mr. Panetta's endorsement, after meeting with Mr. Morsi for about an hour, was the most positive so far from a senior member of the Obama administration. ''I was convinced that President Morsi is his own man, and that he is the president of all the Egyptian people and that he is truly committed to implement democracy here in Egypt,'' Mr. Panetta said.
Notably, the defense secretary also said, ''President Morsi and Field Marshal Tantawi have a very good relationship and are working together toward the same ends.''
At the beginning of Mr. Panetta's meeting with Mr. Morsi, when a few reporters were briefly allowed into the room, the two sat chatting amiably about the weather -- Mr. Panetta noted accurately that it was ''very warm'' in Cairo in July -- and their shared ties in California.
''You spent time at the University of Southern California,'' Mr. Panetta said to Mr. Morsi, who nodded assent. ''My home is Monterey.''

HEADLINE: A Different Continent, a Different Tune

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Nicholas Kulish contributed reporting from Berlin, and Michael Barbaro from New York.

 BODY:
WARSAW -- On the campaign trail, Mitt Romney mocks it as ''a social welfare state'' and an ''entitlement nation.'' He rails that it smothers entrepreneurs and innovators. And he says it is simply not working.
The target of Mr. Romney's dismissiveness: Europe. And he warns ominously that if the United States is not careful, the country may end up just like it. 
But as he wrapped up his seven-day trip here, which began in London last week and ended on Tuesday in Warsaw, a more nuanced view of Europe emerged: there is also the Europe symbolized by Poland, where ''a march toward economic liberty and smaller government has meant a march toward higher living standards,'' in contrast with the Europe he often derides on the campaign trail.
That Europe, which some conservatives label the ''old Europe,'' is symbolized by the troubles of the euro zone, where heavy regulation and a vast social welfare network, they maintain, has led to an intractable economic crisis.
The tone and frequency of Mr. Romney's verbal jabs at that Europe, made in speeches in places like Florida and Ohio, has caught some of the Continent's leaders by surprise. Several of Mr. Romney's aides said they had heard from European diplomats and leaders who felt slighted by his words. The advisers have told foreign officials that they should not read too much into statements made for a domestic political audience.
Though criticizing Europe has become a standard part of Mr. Romney's stump speech, he uses it to differentiate himself from what he says are the big-government ways of President Obama. And during his trip here, Mr. Romney took pains to tone down that language. Instead, he offered conciliatory words celebrating centuries of European-American alliances.
In London, he praised the ''unique'' relationship between the United States and Britain, reminding an audience that the two had ''shed blood together.''
Before heading abroad, Mr. Romney worked with aides to settle on a carefully calibrated schedule of countries that underscored his domestic agenda. Mr. Romney skipped not only those areas of Europe most troubled by economic crisis but even the healthier countries in the euro zone, like Germany. He traveled to Britain, which uses the pound, and Poland, which uses the zloty. Both have right-of-center governments, and both have been staunch allies of the United States.
A senior policy adviser, speaking in a background briefing, said that when Mr. Romney faulted Europe on the campaign trail, his concern was ''about what's happening in Europe more broadly.''
''As you have seen an expansion of the government's role,'' the adviser said, ''as you see expansion in government spending, increasing deficits, increasing unemployment, you're bringing yourself into a pretty untenable situation economically.''
Mr. Romney's critique, of course, is grounded in some hard data: the euro zone economy on the whole has struggled with high unemployment as individual governments battle to emerge from financial crises, which fiscal conservatives attribute to generous government spending on entitlements like pensions and the social safety net. It is a convenient vehicle to use in criticizing Mr. Obama's handling of the economy and his fiscal stewardship as Mr. Romney pushes his antitax message back home.
''There's no contradiction between the Euro-bashing and this trip,'' said Thomas Snegaroff, research director at the Institute of International and Strategic Relations in Paris. ''He's not talking to Europe. He's talking to American voters, and he's saying, 'I'm going to be more American than Barack Obama, and that means going back to old policies.' ''
And to drive home that contrast, Mr. Romney held up Poland on Tuesday as a model for other nations in the throes of economic crisis. ''The world should pay close attention to the transformation of Poland's economy,'' Mr. Romney said in noting the rise in living standards there and tying it to economic liberty.
Of course, there have been distracting missteps, like Mr. Romney's skeptical remarks about London's readiness for the Olympic Games and the comment he made at a fund-raiser in Jerusalem, in which he offended Palestinians by attributing economic differences between Israel and Palestine to cultural differences.
But gone, for now, are standard Romney applause lines back in the United States, like this one delivered during a Republican primary debate: ''Europe isn't working in Europe. It's not going to work here.'' (The only remnants of the criticism from his usual stump speech came at a fund-raiser in Jerusalem, when he said: ''We can't keep running multi-, hundred-billion, trillion-dollar deficits. Ultimately that will put us on a path to Greece.'')
In a contrast to Mr. Obama's trip to Europe as a candidate four years ago, which drew giant crowds, Mr. Romney's trip has gotten relatively little attention here -- scrutinized though it was -- and seemed to hold less import for some citizens and leaders.
''In Europe, we've got bigger problems than Romney's campaign,'' Mr. Snegaroff said. ''No one is really looking carefully.''
Mr. Romney is no stranger to the Continent. He spent more than two years as a young man in France as a Mormon missionary and can speak French. Though he has recalled his time in France fondly, it does not seem to have influenced his politics.
In his book ''No Apology,'' Mr. Romney seems to sum up his feelings for Europe through an e-mail from a friend who expressed disdain for what he described as Mr. Obama's left-leaning, European-style policies. The friend, Mr. Romney recalled, was thinking of moving to France because ''if we are going to live in a socialist country, it might as well be one with really good food.''

HEADLINE: Regulate, Don't Split Up, Huge Banks

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
Steven Rattner, a contributing opinion writer, was a counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.

 BODY:
LAST week, Sanford I. Weill, the mastermind behind the creation of the colossus now known as Citigroup, shook the New York-Washington axis by calling for the dismantling of megabanks. It was as if John D. Rockefeller had proposed the breakup of Standard Oil.
But Mr. Weill's musings are an ill-advised distraction. Instead of focusing our attention on the worrisome risks that remain, four years after the financial crisis, he diverted attention to a tiresome debate over whether the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 banking law that separated commercial banking from investment banking, should be reinstated. 
A bit of recent history: none of the institutions that toppled like dominoes in 2008 -- the investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, the mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the insurance company American International Group -- were commercial banks.
So the bank merger frenzy that Mr. Weill set off in the late 1990s was not the proximate cause of the financial crisis. Nor was the concentration of our banking system, which is less centralized than those in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland and many other countries.
What brought our financial system to its knees was old-fashioned poor management that expanded the banks' portfolios and activities too aggressively without sufficiently robust risk controls, enabled by lax (or nonexistent) oversight by regulators. Many of those excesses were concentrated in the housing sector, where a now legendary bubble formed without regulators or industry leaders recognizing it.
When the bubble inevitably deflated, in 2007, the weakest institutions imploded with it, and systemic risks were exposed. Only with billions of government money -- much of it now happily recouped -- was the system saved.
Out of that disaster came significant improvements. Balance sheets and risk controls were strengthened. Regulatory scrutiny was beefed up. The Dodd-Frank overhaul of financial regulation became law in 2010. A shaken world exhaled.
But because of flaws in Dodd-Frank, the possibility of future catastrophic failures has not been eliminated, nor would it be by Mr. Weill's proposal.
Most important, Congress buckled to vested interests and failed to revamp the dizzying and overlapping patchwork of an alphabet soup of agencies that regulate financial institutions. Just one minor agency was eliminated and a new, unwieldy oversight council was placed above the ungainly mess.
Because of pressure from Sheila C. Bair, then the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the primary responsibility for winding down failing institutions was given to the F.D.I.C., an agency woefully ill equipped to deal with complex global entities. The Federal Reserve Board would have been a far superior choice.
In April 2011, the F.D.I.C. published a hypothetical plan suggesting that it could wind down a global octopus like Lehman in a manner similar to the way in which it routinely takes over small community banks. The report was widely derided.
We need a Dodd-Frank do-over to create the right oversight apparatus for huge banks. Regulators will always be outnumbered by bankers, and they will never find every problem. But, like prison guards, regulators are essential, even if they are outnumbered. In a world of behemoth banks, it is wrong to think we can shrink ours to a size that eliminates the ''too big to fail'' problem without emasculating one of our most successful industries.
Dodd-Frank did set out some sensible principles for dealing with systemically important banks that are endangered. Bondholders and shareholders would bear severe or even total losses. Management and directors would be replaced. Other concepts, however, need to be clarified and made more flexible. Failing institutions should not necessarily be liquidated; reorganization often preserves more jobs and more value than dissolution, as the reorganizations of General Motors and Chrysler proved. Also, regulators haven't been sufficiently clear about whether a failing bank's counterparties -- the institutions on the other side of every derivative transaction -- would be forced to take losses. If they were, that could risk a panic like that of 2008, when financial institutions fled from doing business with one another.
Good management will always be more effective in avoiding bad outcomes than legislation, as Mr. Weill should know. Citigroup would have been managed soundly and would not have needed a $45 billion bailout if he had not capriciously dismissed his talented protege Jamie Dimon (who has done an extraordinary job at JPMorgan Chase, notwithstanding its recent trading losses).
Happily, Dodd-Frank includes a rule, proposed by the former Fed chairman Paul A. Volcker, that forbids banks to gamble with insured deposits. We should focus on putting this and other new regulations into effect, and devising better ways to deal with financial giants -- not distractions like Mr. Weill's call for reinstating an outmoded concept like Glass-Steagall.

HEADLINE: Democrats' Keynote Speaker Is Latino Mayor From Texas

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
Julian Castro, the Democratic mayor of San Antonio, will deliver the keynote speech at his party's national convention in September, taking the role that vaulted Barack Obama to national prominence eight years ago.
Mr. Castro will become the first Hispanic American chosen for the high-profile speaking slot at a time when President Obama is counting on Latinos to help him win a second term in the White House.
The selection was announced by Mr. Castro himself in a video posted by convention organizers and reported first by Univision. 
''I know I've got some big shoes to fill,'' Mr. Castro says in the three-minute video. ''We've come so far over the past three and a half years under Obama's leadership. And I know he's not done yet. We got a lot more work to do.''
A co-chairman of Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, Mr. Castro is a rising star in the Democratic Party who, at 37, has already been elected and re-elected to the top job in San Antonio.
Mr. Castro's Mexican-American background will provide Mr. Obama and the Democrats an opportunity to highlight what they see as a stark contrast with the policies of Mitt Romney and the Republican Party when it comes to Latino issues.
And the speech could serve as a national introduction for Mr. Castro as he pursues a political career outside of Texas.
In the video released Tuesday morning, Mr. Castro previewed the kind of personal story that he will draw upon during his remarks at the convention in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Castro recalled Mr. Obama's 2004 keynote speech and said he hoped to have the same effect.
''I remember watching his speech in 2004 and being inspired,'' Mr. Castro said. ''When Obama talked about the audacity of hope, I thought back to my mother saying if you didn't like the way things were, you could dare to change them. I thought, my mother would like this guy.''
Mr. Castro's home state of Texas is not a political battleground in the presidential campaign and will almost certainly be firmly in Mr. Romney's column in the fall.
But the two candidates are waging fierce fights in Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia - states where the increasing numbers of Latino voters make them an important voting block.
Democrats have said for years that they believe the tough Republican position on illegal immigration will make it more difficult for national politicians like Mr. Romney to earn Latino votes. Picking Mr. Castro for the prominent speaking post is one way of highlighting that issue for voters in those swing states.
Mr. Romney has argued that the nation's economic distress is affecting Latinos even more deeply than other Americans, and that many of them will turn toward Republicans after concluding that Mr. Obama's policies have not worked.
In the video, Mr. Castro argues that Mr. Obama faced a deep economic crisis and has begun to turn things around for all Americans.
''He brought the economy back from the brink, rescued the auto industry while Mitt Romney argued that we should let Detroit go bankrupt, and he created 4.4 million private sector jobs,'' Mr. Castro said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama and Congress in Step Over Iran Sanctions

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Jennifer Steinhauer and Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House and Congress raced to impose more punishing sanctions against Iran on Tuesday, as that country's nuclear ambitions resurfaced in the presidential election campaign after Mitt Romney's pledge to give Israel unstinting support in its confrontation with Iran.
The new sets of measures, which target Iran's oil and petrochemical sectors as well as its shipping trade, intensify existing sanctions intended to choke off the revenue that Iran reaps from its two largest export industries. While they do not represent a quantum leap in pressure, they address a potential weakness in the continuing effort: Iran's increasingly adroit maneuvering to circumvent sanctions by selling its oil through foreign banks or for alternative means of payment, like gold. 
The flurry of activity on Capitol Hill and at the White House reflects both diplomatic and domestic political calculations. Negotiations over Iran's nuclear program are at a standstill after several months, leaving many lawmakers frustrated and administration officials conceding that the pressure campaign has not persuaded Iran's leaders to change course.
Election-year politics have also supercharged the political atmosphere, with Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican challenger, suggesting during a weekend visit to Israel that he would take a far tougher line against Iran than President Obama. These latest sanctions, like previous measures against Iran, have drawn lopsided bipartisan support in Congress.
Even though the White House measures were announced just days after Mr. Romney's comments in Israel, officials said they had nothing to do with Mr. Romney's statements. Both the administration's and Congressional sanctions have been in the works for months. Campaign officials also said that for all his criticism, Mr. Romney's prescriptions for dealing with Tehran do not differ much from the president's.
''Romney likes to sound tougher on Iran, but when you really delve into the specifics, there's not a lot of difference there from what the administration has done or is already doing,'' said Colin H. Kahl, a former Pentagon official who is an adviser to the Obama campaign. ''A lot of this is Romney describing our current policy and masquerading it as criticism of the president.''
A spokesman for Mr. Romney, Ryan Williams, said in a statement released after the sanctions were announced that Mr. Obama's reluctance to confront Iran ''has imperiled our allies and jeopardized our national security.'' He also cited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who said that the diplomatic efforts had not made an ''iota'' of difference in Iran's behavior.
The White House and Congress have clashed over how to deal with Iran: the last major Iran sanctions bill was passed over the heated objections of the administration.
But this time, the White House worked closely with lawmakers. Officials said Mr. Obama's executive order was intended to complement the legislation, not to pre-empt or derail it.
After weeks of negotiation, House and Senate leaders agreed late Monday on new measures targeting Iranian shipping, not only of oil but also of a wide variety of other products. The House was set to vote as soon as Wednesday, while the Senate leaders -- Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader from Kentucky, and Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader from Nevada -- also signaled that they would move the legislation forward quickly.
''The idea is to up the ante to the greatest extent possible,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. ''From a foreign policy standpoint, trying to find every possible way to up the ante makes sense.''
Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a supporter of tougher sanctions, said the new measures were ''a major upgrade of the sanctions regime.'' But he noted that the goal of the sanctions is to change the political calculus of Iran's leadership, increasing pressure to the point that it agrees to resolve concerns about whether its nuclear program is peaceful, as it insists, or aimed at producing a bomb, as many experts contend.
''There's no evidence to date that the sanctions have achieved that objective,'' he said.
Administration officials took pains to point out the economic damage the sanctions have inflicted on Iran. European and American sanctions have driven down its oil exports by 40 percent to 50 percent, depriving Iran of $9 billion in revenue every quarter, said Robert J. Einhorn, the State Department's special adviser on nonproliferation.
Iran's currency, the rial, has lost 38 percent of its value since the sanctions law was passed last January.
''These sanctions are really beginning to sink in,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, who quoted Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as saying they were the toughest sanctions Iran had ever faced.
Most measures announced Tuesday seek to close loopholes in earlier sanctions. The United States will now blacklist any financial institution that receives payments for Iranian oil, which will prevent Iran from using foreign banks or its national oil company, in lieu of the Central Bank of Iran, as an agent to process oil transactions.
A loophole remains, though: Twenty countries that have already been exempted by the United States from existing sanctions because they made significant reductions in oil purchases would also be exempted from these latest measures.
The Treasury Department used a 2010 law to bring sanctions against two banks -- Bank of Kunlun in China and Elaf Islamic Bank in Iraq -- that it says have helped blacklisted Iranian banks to gain access to international markets. The Iranian banks, it said, are involved in terrorism and weapons proliferation.
''We've been under pressure for a while to use this authority and we've shown we're prepared to do that, regardless of where the bank may be,'' said David S. Cohen, under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.
New sanctions against Iran have long had broad bipartisan support, though the latest legislation nonetheless had partisan hues, underscoring the election-year politics of one of the nation's most vexing foreign policy issues.
''Israel has made it pretty clear that they're not going to sit by much longer,'' Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said Tuesday, ''so we need to apply pressure. I think we've been slow in doing it.''

HEADLINE: Tea Party Favorite for Senate Wins as G.O.P. Pick in Texas

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Ted Cruz, an insurgent backed by the Tea Party, easily defeated the candidate favored by Gov. Rick Perry on Tuesday in a runoff election for the Republican Senate nomination that revealed a wide rift in Texas between the party establishment and restless anti-incumbent activists on the right.
With the come-from-behind victory over Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, Mr. Cruz is heavily favored to win the Senate seat being vacated in November by Kay Bailey Hutchison and appears likely to become a star of the national conservative movement. 
''We did it,'' Mr. Cruz told the cheering crowd gathered at a Marriott Hotel in Houston to claim victory. ''Millions of Texans, millions of Americans are rising up to reclaim our country, defend liberty and restore the Constitution.''
Mr. Cruz, 41, is the latest conservative rebel to bring down an established party leader, tapping into frustration within the Republican ranks nationwide. These dissident triumphs include, in this year's primaries, the defeat of Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana by Richard E. Mourdock and Deb Fischer's win over a veteran Republican for the Senate nomination in Nebraska. They also echo Marco Rubio's Senate victory in 2010 over a Republican governor, Charlie Crist of Florida.
''I love it,'' said Ken Yowell, 69, a retired businessman who came with his wife to Mr. Cruz's victory party, their first time ever at a political event. ''We need some conservative Christians in office,'' he said, and someone who will fight for the economy and against abortion.
Mr. Cruz, who is Cuban-American, has drawn comparisons to Mr. Rubio, another youthful Cuban-American who quickly became an icon of fiscal and religious conservatives around the country. Mr. Cruz's rapid ascent has already shaken up the Texas Republican Party, in a race watched as a test of the enduring strength of the Tea Party and its stringent antitax, antigovernment themes.
''Mr. Cruz's success shows that the center of the state party has moved decisively to the right,'' said James Henson, a political scientist at University of Texas. ''The Republicans are in much more treacherous terrain, not because of threats from Democrats, but threats from within the party.''
A Harvard-trained lawyer, a former Washington official under President George W. Bush and the former solicitor general of Texas, Mr. Cruz had argued cases before the Supreme Court but never before run for office. He turned out to be a natural campaigner, and with his implacable opposition to big government, he won the enthusiastic support of Tea Party activists in Texas and around the country.
Mr. Dewhurst, 66, a wealthy rancher and businessman, has held the powerful elected post of lieutenant governor for nine years and was endorsed by Mr. Perry and most other top party leaders as well as business and farm groups. Mr. Dewhurst will continue as lieutenant governor.
Mr. Dewhurst has a deeply conservative record, and often during the campaign the two candidates seemed to mimic each other on the issues, with both vowing to repeal President Obama's health care law, cut spending, get tough on the border and fight abortion.
But Mr. Cruz relentlessly portrayed his opponent as a creature of the establishment who is too quick to compromise.
In an Election Day appearance before a small but revved-up crowd outside a polling station in Houston, Mr. Cruz gave credit to his thousands of fervent on-the-ground volunteers. ''We're here today because of the grass-roots organizing,'' he said.
''We've spent 18 hours a day crisscrossing Texas, going to IHOP and Denny's, listening to the voters, asking for their support one by one,'' he said. ''That's how democracy is supposed to be.''
With indications that an upset was likely, Tea Party celebrities including Sarah Palin, Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, Glenn Beck and Rick Santorum came to speak on Mr. Cruz's behalf over the last several days.
The Club for Growth, a conservative pro-business lobby based in Washington, spent $5.5 million on television ads for Mr. Cruz. FreedomWorks, a national advocacy group closely allied with the Tea Party and led by the former House majority leader Dick Armey, sent money and campaign trainers.
''We're looking for activist, involved, creative conservatives who take more initiative to see things through,'' Mr. Armey said of the group's choice of Mr. Cruz.
At his victory speech, Mr. Cruz thanked the lieutenant governor for his service and for calling to offer his support, and he called for Mr. Dewhurst's followers to forget the harsh words of the campaign and join together.
One Texan who jumped into the grass-roots Cruz campaign was Maggie Wright, a self-described retired housewife and grandmother from Burleson, outside Dallas, who had traveled here to cheer on her candidate on Election Day. Since December, she had been a volunteer, distributing signs and bumper stickers provided by FreedomWorks.
''We don't want a go-along, get-along senator,'' she said, waiting for Mr. Cruz to appear at the polling site. ''We want a fighter who will draw a line in the sand.''
Mr. Dewhurst attacked Mr. Cruz as inexperienced and beholden to out-of-state pressure groups and Washington insiders.
''I'm a lifelong businessman and the only true conservative in the race,'' he said at a final appeal to voters in a Houston deli.
One of Mr. Dewhurst's supporters, Dr. Gary Brock, a pediatric surgeon in Houston, said that Mr. Cruz was too inexperienced at governing. ''The Democrats tried a charismatic Harvard-trained attorney with no record and it hasn't worked out too well for the country,'' he said.
But in the end, in a contest that depended largely on who could turn out the greatest number of voters on a sweltering summer day, it was the passionate legions behind Mr. Cruz who prevailed.
Mr. Cruz, who led by 11 percentage points with 75 percent of returns counted, is expected to have a large advantage over his Democratic opponent. In the Democratic runoff, also held Tuesday, former State Representative Paul Sadler defeated Grady Yarbrough, a retired educator. Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988.

HEADLINE: U.S. Agency Bars a Plan To Reduce Home Debt

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The independent federal agency that administers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said on Tuesday that it would not let the mortgage companies offer debt forgiveness to borrowers, again rejecting the entreaties of the Obama administration.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency said it had concluded after months of study that up to half a million homeowners could benefit from such a program, and that taxpayers might save $1 billion because aid recipients would be more likely to continue making mortgage payments.
But the agency's acting director, Edward J. DeMarco, said the benefits most likely would be much smaller -- too small in his judgment to offset potential costs, including the risk that some borrowers would stop making payments in pursuit of a better deal. 
Offering debt forgiveness ''would not make a meaningful improvement in reducing foreclosures in a cost-effective way for taxpayers,'' Mr. DeMarco said in a statement Tuesday.
The announcement is a direct rebuff to the Obama administration, which has pressed Mr. DeMarco for more than a year to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac join nearly every other major mortgage company in offering debt forgiveness to borrowers who owe more than the value of their homes.
On Tuesday, the Treasury Department immediately called for the agency to reconsider. ''I do not believe it is the best decision for the country,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the secretary, wrote in a public letter to Mr. DeMarco.
The decision also infuriated Congressional Democrats, while Republicans rallied to the agency's defense.
''The administration put incredible political pressure on Director DeMarco, and he deserves praise for standing up for the best interests of the American people,'' said Representative Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican who is chairman of the House committee that oversees the agency.
The importance of debt forgiveness in preventing foreclosures and reviving economic growth has been a contentious issue since the start of the housing crisis six years ago.
Research shows that borrowers whose mortgage debts exceed the value of their homes on average are less likely to keep making payments. Some economists also argue that high levels of debt are impeding consumer spending, the nation's primary economic activity.
But debt forgiveness is more expensive than other methods of reducing a borrower's payments, like deferring a portion of the debt or reducing the interest rate, in part because the lender is forgoing the chance to benefit if housing prices recover.
Moreover, as the generosity of aid increases, so does the incentive to seek help.
And there is a final consideration that weighed heavily in the analysis that the housing agency published Tuesday: After years of debate, many borrowers have slipped beyond the reach of help. The agency noted that most of the half-million homeowners it counted as candidates for debt forgiveness had not made a mortgage payment in more than a year.
The agency estimated that 74,000 to 248,000 borrowers might successfully obtain a debt reduction. In the best case, it estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could collect another $500 million in mortgage payments. But it cautioned that the low end of the range was more likely, resulting in a much smaller financial benefit.
And it noted that the entire benefit could be erased if as few as 3,000 borrowers decided to stop making payments in the hopes of qualifying for debt forgiveness.
''The projected impact,'' Mr. DeMarco told reporters, ''could be negative for taxpayers or it could be positive, depending on the assumptions.'' But given his assessment of the costs, he said, it was clearly not large enough.
In reaching this conclusion, Mr. DeMarco flatly rejected the administration's efforts to change his longstanding opposition by offering to pay the bill.
The housing agency is charged by Congress with minimizing the cost of bailing out Fannie and Freddie, which were seized by the government in 2008 to preserve their role as the primary source of financing for new mortgage loans.
The administration's mortgage modification program offers incentives to lenders who forgive a portion of the borrower's debt, and in January, the White House tripled the incentive as direct inducement to Mr. DeMarco.
The agency said Tuesday that the companies could reap $2.7 billion, increasing the total savings from debt forgiveness to as much as $3.6 billion.
But Mr. DeMarco in effect rejected the administration's helping hand, insisting Tuesday that the only important number was the total cost to taxpayers.
The details of the analysis did little to assuage the agency's critics, who noted the agency's math still seemed to suggest that taxpayers could benefit.
''It is incomprehensible that Mr. DeMarco would reject the chance to save up to a billion dollars in taxpayer funds while helping nearly half a million homeowners stay in their homes,'' said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland.
Analysts also see little evidence that existing incentives for principal reduction have lured borrowers to default, although Mr. DeMarco said he feared that a high publicized announcement by Fannie and Freddie might produce a different result.
The agency also sketched some proposals on Tuesday that it said would benefit homeowners. One potentially significant change could encourage mortgage companies to loosen lending standards by limiting their responsibility if they sold the loans to Fannie and Freddie -- the standard method of raising money for more loans -- and the borrower eventually defaulted. Federal Reserve officials have said that the current standards significantly impede the availability of loans. The agency said that a new standard would be published by September.

HEADLINE: Romney Abroad, Creating a Stir

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Romney Trip Raises Sparks at a 2nd Stop'' (front page, July 31):
Mitt Romney's comment that the reason the Israelis are so much more economically successful than the Palestinians is that ''culture makes all the difference,'' and his vast understatement of the income disparities between the two groups, are quite revealing of the candidate's approach to problem-solving.
Like many financially successful people, Mr. Romney seems to assume that if he reads a book or two and has ''the facts'' about a situation, he can fully understand a problem and then solve it. Conflict and foreign policy in the Middle East are terribly complicated and fraught with risk. 
For a presidential candidate to reduce the region's complexity to the simplistic assertion that ''culture makes all the difference'' and not even get his numbers right shows very limited understanding of a complex issue, a lack of intellectual curiosity and knowledge of history as well as dangerously showing his bias toward a people with whom he may be negotiating if elected.
The reaction of the Palestinian Authority was swift and accurate: ''This man lacks information, knowledge, vision and understanding of this region and its people.''
GUY DeROSA Hopewell, N.J., July 31, 2012
The writer is a professor of political science at Mercer County Community College.
To the Editor:
Mitt Romney's comments in Israel may be upsetting to some who are not used to statements devoid of political correctness.
First, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. No other country in the world is denied the right to choose its own capital. No other country is forced to sit by and watch the rest of the world try to determine the fate of its capital. Mr. Romney called it as it is.
As for the culture of the Palestinians, let's be realistic. This is a culture that glorifies suicide bombers and honors them with money and statues. This is a culture that educates its children to become martyrs and that blatantly projects anti-Semitism through its children's television programming.
If the Arabs had accepted the United Nations partition of Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state, no doubt the economic imbalance would have disappeared over the last 64 years. But the culture focused more on destroying the Jewish state than on developing its own state, and Mr. Romney correctly interpreted the results.
HOWARD B. WEBER President, Coalition for Israel New York, July 31, 2012
To the Editor:
Mitt Romney, by attributing Israeli economic advantages over Palestinians' in the occupied territories to the presumed superiority of Jewish culture and the ''hand of providence,'' and then likening it to income differentials between those in the United States, Mexico and other Latin American neighbors, demonstrated more than historical ignorance and political insensitivity.
He invoked the two pillars of modern racial superiority movements: presumed nurture or cultural superiority; or nature -- in this case, divine natural superiority, the ''hand of providence,'' or God.
Such language is not only dangerous to the Palestinians and the others he disparaged. This language has also been a fundamental weapon against all oppressed peoples, including Jews. A worldview based on ethnic or racial superiority is always and everywhere dangerous, even if momentarily flattering to a particular audience.

HEADLINE: New Polls Show Obama Has Edge In 3 Large States

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and DALIA SUSSMAN; Marina Stefan, Marjorie Connelly and Allison Kopicki contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama is struggling to persuade voters that he deserves to win re-election based on his handling of the economy, but his empathy and personal appeal give him an edge over Mitt Romney in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania, according to Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News polls.
The contours of a deeply competitive presidential race, with three months remaining until the election, are highlighted in the new surveys of likely voters in the three battleground states. Mr. Romney drew fairly even with Mr. Obama when voters were asked about managing the nation's financial situation, but his candidacy remains tested by concerns over his business background and his reluctance to release more of his tax returns.
The polls in the three states, all of which Mr. Obama carried in 2008, offer a window into challenges and opportunities for both candidates as August begins and they prepare for their nominating conventions and the general election fight. Most paths to victory that the campaigns are pursuing include winning at least two of the states. 
While independent voters break strongly for Mr. Obama in Pennsylvania, a state that Mr. Romney has been trying to make more competitive, they are closely split in Florida and Ohio. Of the coalition that Mr. Obama built to win the White House, independent voters remain a hurdle, with a little more than half in Florida and Ohio saying they disapprove of his job performance.
But a torrent of television advertising in the states, particularly in Ohio and Florida, appears to be resonating in Mr. Obama's quest to define his Republican rival. The polls found that more voters say Mr. Romney's experience was too focused on making profits at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he led, rather than the kind of experience that would help create jobs.
A snapshot of the race, taken during a burst of summer campaigning, found that Mr. Obama holds an advantage of 6 percentage points over Mr. Romney in Florida and Ohio. The president is stronger in Pennsylvania, leading by 11 percentage points. The margin of sampling of error is plus or minus three percentage points in each state.
The New York Times, in collaboration with Quinnipiac and CBS News, is tracking the presidential contest in six states through polls over the next three months. In addition to Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania, which have a combined 67 electoral votes, surveys will be taken in Colorado, Wisconsin and Virginia, which have 32 electoral votes.
Four years ago, Mr. Obama won all six states. Mr. Romney is campaigning in each state, with his strategists seeing the efforts in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as the most ambitious. Those two states, which have voted for the Democratic presidential candidate over the last two decades, are considered firewalls, and an erosion of support would signal trouble for the president.
The polls found that Mr. Obama faces substantial hurdles of his own, most of them rooted in the electorate's deeply pessimistic outlook on the economy. By double-digit margins, voters in each state say his policies would hurt, rather than help, their personal financial situation if he won re-election, a worrisome sign considering the economy is ranked as voters' chief concern.
Still, more than half of voters in each state also say the administration's actions are either slowly improving the economy or will, if given more time.
''Romney does have business experience, but I wonder if his business experience would benefit the country or might harm it,'' said Peg Pagano, 72, a retiree in Holland, Pa., in a follow-up interview. ''He was in business in order to make a profit. There's nothing wrong with that, but how would that help the country? I feel Obama needs to be given another four years.''
In all three states, most women say they prefer Mr. Obama. About half of female voters in Florida back him, while his support is even stronger in Ohio and Pennsylvania, where nearly 6 in 10 women say they favor him. In Ohio, men prefer Mr. Romney, while they are more closely split in Florida and Pennsylvania.
The economy is the top concern in all three states. But voters in Ohio express more optimism about their own backyard, with 33 percent saying their economy is improving, compared with 23 percent in Florida. Ohio's unemployment rate, 7.2 percent, is the lowest of the three states and below the national rate.
A sliver of voters, 4 percent in each state, say they are undecided between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney. Only about one in 10 who have picked a candidate say they could change their minds, fewer than some polls showed at this point in previous races.
Mr. Obama has a clear advantage on personal measures, and far more voters say he cares about the needs and problems of people like them.
Mr. Romney is seen as being able to do a comparable job on the economy. More voters in Florida say his economic policies would be better for their own financial situations. Among independent voters in the state, the poll found Mr. Romney outpacing Mr. Obama by 14 percentage points when asked who would perform better on the economy.
''We've seen Romney's track record with the Olympics and with his business, and I think that's what really swayed me,'' said Chris Rench, 47, who recently left his job as an equipment operator from Piqua, Ohio. ''And I haven't seen anything in his past that has been questionable. There is nothing to make me doubt his ability to do the things he says he wants to do.''
The president drew broad support from voters in each state for a proposal to raise income taxes on people whose household income is more than $250,000. The plan received the backing of 58 percent of likely voters in Florida, 60 percent in Ohio and 62 percent in Pennsylvania.
Mr. Romney has endured criticism for declining to release more than two years of his tax returns, and at least half the voters, including about half the independent voters, in each state say presidential candidates should release several years of returns.
The state polls were conducted by telephone, both land lines and cellphones, from July 24 through July 30 among 1,177 likely voters in Florida, 1,193 likely voters in Ohio and 1,168 likely voters in Pennsylvania.
The findings cannot be compared with previous surveys because the polls are a measure of people who are likely to vote, rather than those who are simply registered. While the intensity of the race is high, it remains an open question how much the summer campaigning will influence the outcome.
Tens of millions of dollars have been invested on television advertising in the states, but most voters say they are not swayed by the commercials.
''Regardless of who gets in, neither one of them can do much about the economy, because it's bigger than what one man can do, no matter what his policies are,'' said William Basler, 69, an independent voter and a financial adviser from Fort Myers, Fla. ''I think Romney has a little more economic experience because of his business background than Obama does, but I'm voting for Obama because his policies are more in line with my thinking over all.''

HEADLINE: Envoy Nominee Pledges To Focus on Militant Group

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's nominee to become the new ambassador to Pakistan said on Tuesday that his top priority would be to press the government there to take more forceful measures against the Haqqani network, a Taliban affiliate whose leaders, sheltered in Pakistan, have mounted a series of attacks against American and other targets in Afghanistan. 
The diplomat, Richard G. Olson, made the pledge at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he appeared along with James B. Cunningham, the nominee to become the new ambassador to Afghanistan.
''I will certainly, if confirmed, take it as a central responsibility and the most urgent of my responsibilities to continue to press the Pakistani authorities on the Haqqani network in every way possible,'' Mr. Olson said.
Together, the two seasoned diplomats, both currently stationed in Kabul, Afghanistan, would face perhaps the most complex and unstable tangle of issues to confront any pair of American envoys in the world, a tangle in which terrorism and intrigue meet military, political and economic turmoil.
Both men said that one key to success would be to get Afghans and Pakistanis to trust that the United States and its allies would not abandon the region after 2014, when the last American and NATO combat forces are scheduled to leave Afghanistan.
The diplomats faced respectful but sometimes skeptical questioning from Democrats and Republicans, with several senators from across the ideological spectrum suggesting that it would be a waste of American money to continue providing billions of dollars a year in economic and military aid to the two nations unless they make progress in stamping out corruption, build up their own forces against terrorists and insurgents and demonstrate an ability to hold fair elections.
''I have been supportive, but it is not an open-ended support,'' said Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey. ''I cannot continue, at a time in which we face such enormous challenges here at home, to vote for billions of dollars that at the end of the day do not lead toward a more open, transparent, honest process, at a minimum.''
During the hearing, the nominees said the aid was a vital investment in American strategic goals, but they agreed on the need for substantial changes in Kabul, in Islamabad and in the chaotic provinces of the two countries. Neither diplomat claimed that the task would be easy or the outcome certain.
When it comes to ''further squeezing of the Haqqani network,'' as Mr. Olson referred to his objective, he dryly recounted his personal interest in the matter: he was in the American Embassy in Kabul on both days in the past year when it came under concerted attack by Haqqani forces orchestrated from Pakistan.
''I have a certain amount of skin in the game for this particular issue,'' he said.
Despite the bedevilment of Pakistani-American relations over the matter, Mr. Olson said the United States had gained much from the two countries' on-again-off-again partnership.
''We have had substantial cooperation from the Pakistanis on the question of Al Qaeda in particular,'' he said. ''I mean, we are virtually within grasp of defeating Al Qaeda as an organization. A lot of that, as President Obama has indicated, is due to support from the Pakistani government.''

HEADLINE: Study Criticizes Pentagon Over Its Plans for a Greater Focus on Asia

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- An independent review assessing the Obama administration's plans to move national security resources toward Asia and away from the Atlantic has criticized the Pentagon, saying it insufficiently explained how it would shift military forces to the region and how the government would sharpen its focus on rising security challenges across the Pacific.
The 110-page unclassified study, buttressed by a secret annex, also warns that plans for an Asia-Pacific emphasis have not been squared with increasingly tight budgets. 
While the assessment does not declare the new Asia strategy to be an emperor with no clothes, it recommends that more must be done to persuade Congress to support and finance the new strategy.
The administration announced plans early this year to pivot from Iraq and Afghanistan to focus national security resources on the Asia-Pacific region. As part of a broad Congressional scrutiny into national security policy for the region, a bipartisan trio of senators backed a provision in the defense authorization bill for an independent critique of President Obama's overall Asia-Pacific strategy. The review, conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan policy institute in Washington, found that the Defense Department ''has not adequately articulated the strategy behind its force posture planning, nor aligned the strategy with resources in a way that reflects current budget realities.''
The debate over what the Obama administration hopes will be a signature foreign policy realignment will resume on Wednesday, when the two main authors of the study, David J. Berteau and Michael J. Green, appear before a House Armed Services subcommittee. Two Pentagon officials, Robert Scher, the deputy assistant secretary for plans, and David F. Helvey, the acting deputy assistant secretary for East Asia, are also expected to testify. Senate hearings are expected later.
The senators who pushed for the assessment -- Carl Levin of Michigan and Jim Webb of Virginia, both Democrats, and John McCain of Arizona, a Republican -- issued a statement on Friday noting the need to match strategic goals to spending constraints.
''This is particularly important as support for the resourcing of major overseas initiatives, in the current fiscal environment, will depend to a significant extent on a clear articulation of U.S. strategic imperatives and the manner in which the investments address them,'' the senators said. They emphasized that Congress needed to be reassured that ''force planning and realignment proposals are realistic, workable and affordable.''
In assessing the military rebalancing proposals, the study notes that ''current U.S. force posture is heavily tilted toward Northeast Asia, to Korea and Japan, where it focuses properly on deterring the threats of major conflicts on the Korean Peninsula, off Japan, and in the Taiwan Strait.''
However, the study points out that the stakes are ''growing fastest in South and Southeast Asia,'' as proved by potentially destabilizing actions by China as it tries to extend its sovereignty in the South China Sea and over island territory in the region.
''The top priority of U.S. strategy in Asia is not to prepare for a conflict with China,'' the study said. ''Rather, it is to shape the environment so that such a conflict is never necessary and perhaps someday inconceivable.''
The study calls for one or more additional attack submarines in Guam; the deployment of a second Marine Corps amphibious ready group in the region, which would reduce the number in the Atlantic by one; and the bolstering of missile-defense systems.
Since the new Asia-Pacific strategy was officially announced in January, the Pentagon has sent top officials as emissaries, the most recent being Ashton B. Carter, the deputy defense secretary, who had a 10-day swing through the region.
''I think that what our partners and allies in this region are looking for is confirmation that the United States is serious and concrete about shifting a great deal of our emphasis from the places we have been -- of necessity -- preoccupied for the last decade, namely Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Asia-Pacific region,'' Mr. Carter told the American Forces Press Service, the Pentagon's internal news service, as he was flying home last week.
Previously, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta told Asian security officials in Singapore that the United States was committed to enhancing its military presence in the region despite budget constraints.
The Navy, Mr. Panetta said, will reassign its forces from an even distribution between the Atlantic and the Pacific to 60 percent in the Pacific. These shifts will be amplified by an increase in military exercises with allies and partners in the region, he said.
In a cover letter to Congress for the study, which was made available on Friday, Mr. Panetta pointed out that the refocus on Asia was about more than just military power.
''United States strategy calls for rebalancing defense, diplomatic and economic resources toward the Asia-Pacific region,'' Mr. Panetta wrote. ''Essential to this strategy are our efforts to strengthen alliances and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific to advance a common security vision for the future.''

HEADLINE: Fall Films: More Bitter Pills Than Popcorn

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- On Nov. 6 a contentious election season will presumably come to a close. But we'll still have the movies to fight about.
Last year ''The Artist,'' a silent Hollywood fairy tale, danced to a best picture Oscar in a nostalgic awards season. But films will be crackling with tension this fall and winter, as a number of high-profile pictures tackle tough, sometimes violent, sometimes politically tinged subject matter, while sorting through the usual traffic jams and rivalries on their way to the screen.
The season's tone is almost certain to be set by Harvey Weinstein and his Weinstein Company, an Oscar powerhouse that backed ''The Artist'' last year and a year earlier released ''The King's Speech,'' another bit of heartfelt nostalgia that also became an Oscar-winning best picture.
At the Comic-Con International fan convention in July, Weinstein offered a glimpse of ''Django Unchained,'' one of its awards candidates for 2012. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, it is a bloody fable about a former slave, played by Jamie Foxx, who hunts white overseers in search of a lost love, played by Kerry Washington. 
''It can't be much more nightmarish than it was in real life,'' said Mr. Tarantino, who was trying to describe his film's celebration of deadly vengeance -- he called it ''spaghetti surrealism'' -- in the Old South.
Set for release on Christmas Day, the film was being talked up at Comic-Con by Weinstein representatives as a contender on the order of Mr. Tarantino's ''Inglourious Basterds,'' which featured Mr. Tarantino as a scalped Nazi, had a climactic scene of movie theater violence and received eight Oscar nominations in 2010. (Last week Mr. Weinstein called for a Hollywood discussion of the effects of violence on screen. )
But to be a winner, ''Django Unchained'' will have to edge aside ''Lawless,'' directed by John Hillcoat, about bootlegging gangsters in Prohibition-era Virginia; ''The Master,'' directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, about a drunken drifter who falls in with a cult leader who resembles L. Ron Hubbard, the real-life Scientology founder; and ''Silver Linings Playbook,'' directed by David O. Russell, about an unemployed teacher just back from a state mental hospital.
In addition, there's ''Killing Them Softly,'' Andrew Dominik's story about a hit man investigating a heist from the mob. And those are just the films on Mr. Weinstein's schedule through the year's end.
The producer Megan Ellison, who backed both ''Lawless'' and ''The Master,'' is also helping to finance ''Zero Dark Thirty.'' Written by Mark Boal, directed by Kathryn Bigelow and set for release by Sony Pictures Entertainment on Dec. 19, it tells of the hunt for Osama bin Laden.
''Zero Dark Thirty'' was originally supposed to open in October. But the film was delayed until after the election amid claims by Republicans -- and denials from the Obama administration -- that Mr. Boal and Ms. Bigelow had been given undue access to classified information that might help them dramatize one of the president's achievements at a crucial political moment.
The push and shove of politics may now touch another film, Steven Spielberg's ''Lincoln.'' The movie, with its portrayal of a would-be national unifier under siege, was recently scheduled by DreamWorks Studios and Walt Disney for limited release on Nov. 9, with more theaters to follow the next week.
In a narrow sense that keeps Mr. Spielberg's earlier promise to hold the film until after the election. But it opens the possibility of contemporary comparisons and partisan debate as the inevitable prerelease publicity for the movie begins just as voters head to the polls. (Mr. Spielberg's films typically have not played the fall festival circuit, and it does not appear that ''Lincoln'' will break that pattern.)
Marvin Levy, Mr. Spielberg's spokesman, said ''we wouldn't be surprised'' if there were political discussion around ''Lincoln.'' But the film, he said, is more about leadership than about particular policy positions, and the need to circulate trailers would probably cause talk even if it were to be released later.
''We'd be part of all that, no matter what,'' Mr. Levy said.
Mr. Weinstein is apparently less concerned about political strife. His company's ''Butter,'' a comedy with anti-Tea Party overtones, was screened at festivals last year but is set for commercial release on Oct. 5, in the election's full heat.
At 20th Century Fox publicists have been bracing for months in anticipation of controversy around ''Won't Back Down,'' which was produced by Walden Media. The film stars Viola Davis and Maggie Gyllenhaal in a drama about parents and teachers who take over a failing school through a parent trigger law. (The fictionalized situation posits a law somewhat like California's trigger statute, which allows parents to turn a school into a charter school, replace the staff or even shut it down if 51 percent of the families involved agree.)
Two years ago Walden ran into criticism from some teachers and union leaders because it was among the backers of an education-reform documentary, ''Waiting for 'Superman.' '' Though ''Won't Back Down,'' with similar themes, will not open until Sept. 28, union leaders have already expressed wariness, and opinion writers are lining up for a look, according to people who were briefed on the studio's release plans but spoke anonymously because of the controversy surrounding the subject.
Inevitably, this season's documentaries, beginning with an expected crop at the Toronto International Film Festival in early September, will bring more tough discussion. Among the toughest of the films, it appears, will be ''Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God.'' Directed by Alex Gibney, an Oscar winner in 2008 for ''Taxi to the Dark Side,'' and set for fall release by HBO Documentary Films, it examines the priestly abuse of deaf children at a Wisconsin school, and the case's handling by the Vatican.
''The film is explosive,'' said a promotional message that arrived by e-mail last week.
Less explosive, it appears, will be any interplay between two customary seasonal rivals, Mr. Weinstein and the producer Scott Rudin. The two squared off in the past over conflicting plans for the release of ''The Reader,'' with which they were both at one point involved, and then they competed fiercely for Oscars in 2010, when Mr. Rudin had ''The Social Network'' up against ''The King's Speech.''
In an e-mail last week, Mr. Rudin called it ''very unlikely'' that his ''Inside Llewyn Davis,'' a period drama from Joel and Ethan Coen about a folk singer in New York during the 1960s, would be screened in the coming awards season.
But a collision is looming involving Barbra Streisand and Bette Midler. Ms. Streisand stars in a comedy, ''The Guilt Trip,'' currently to be released by Paramount Pictures on Christmas Day; Ms. Midler has a comedy of her own, ''Parental Guidance,'' scheduled by Fox for Christmas Day.
Two divas. One holiday season.
Things might get tense.
Correction: August 6, 2012, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a number of tense and violent movies coming out this fall and winter, and possible competition among films released within a short time frame, misstated the scheduled release date for ''Parental Guidance,'' a comedy starring Bette Midler. It is scheduled to be released on Christmas Day, the same day as ''The Guilt Trip'' starring Barbra Streisand, not on Thanksgiving.

HEADLINE: A Glimpse of the Alternative Fuel Future

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: While the biofuel, electric battery and liquefied natural gas technologies are advancing, the internal combustion engine will reign supreme for decades, a group reports. 

 BODY:
While a variety of new fuel technologies are advancing, policy makers can be assured that the internal combustion engine will remain dominant for decades, the National Petroleum Council told the Department of Energy on Wednesday in a report. 
The report from the council, an advisory agency, was drawn up in response to requests from the department for counsel on how to accelerate the adoption of new fuels and technologies, from compressed natural gas to fuel cells to biofuels, between now and 2050. One of the nation's biggest energy problems is that nearly all of its ground transportation fuel is derived from oil. 
But looking ahead to 2050 poses challenges. Imagine making prognostications for 2012 in 1974; could we have foreseen the Prius or the Volt in the era of the Ford Pinto and the Volkswagen Rabbit? 
The National Petroleum Council tried to sidestep the uncertainty by saying up front that of all the various possibilities - hybridized vehicles, vehicles running on biofuels or compressed or liquefied natural gas, and battery-electric and fuel cell vehicles - it is far too soon to pick winners and losers.

But at a briefing by the council, one member, William Reinert, the national manager in charge of the advanced technology group for Toyota's American sales unit, put it bluntly. "Internal combustion engines are likely to be the dominant propulsion system for decades to come,'' he said. Hybrids like his company's Prius and vehicles running on natural gas, diesel or cellulosic biofuels have internal combustion engines at their heart, he pointed out. 
 The panel said that substantial increases in vehicle efficiency were possible but that total energy use was likely to grow because the number of miles driven by Americans would increase by 60 to 80 percent. (Note: the study was based on the assumptions of the Energy Department's 2010 annual energy outlook, which appeared before the recent downturn in vehicle miles traveled became clear.)
Growth in "vehicle miles traveled" has intermittently faltered as well as recently. 
 Using lightweight materials, improving vehicle aerodynamics, reducing rolling resistance and making other changes could improve the fuel economy of light-duty vehicles by 50 percent, the group found, and hybridization and electrification of vehicles could have far larger benefits. Heavy-duty vehicles could be made to go twice as far on a unit of fuel, which ultimately might turn out to be natural gas and not diesel.
 But the news on another front, greenhouse gas reduction, was disappointing. The Energy Department had asked whether the transportation sector, which includes heavy-duty vehicles, railroads and ships, could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 50 percent by 2050. Even that number would fall short of the White House's stated goal of a total reduction of 80 percent by mid-century.
S. Sariq Yousufzai, vice president of Chevron, said the industry was "moving tin the right direction'' on emissions. Nonetheless, "if you draw a line in the sand that says you must be at 50 percent, we don't get there,'' he said. The degree of emissions reduction depends on progress in making fuels from cellulosic sources, or the portions of crops that are not food, and on advances in making battery-powered electric vehicles whose energy comes from renewable or nuclear sources. 
Converting vehicles to natural gas would be a step towards greenhouse gas reduction and towards energy independence. Yet even though it has been on the agenda for more than 20 years, it has not been successful so far in the light-duty market, where most of the nation's automotive fuel is burned. 
But another member of the study group, Michael Gallagher, a former chairman of Cummins-Westport, a joint venture between a Detroit-based maker of diesel engines and a Canadian firm that specializes in natural gas, predicted that the change in gas drilling and the success of shale technology would change that. 
Twenty years ago, he said, switching to natural gas would save a driver about 50 cents a gallon. "Fifty cents a gallon is interesting but not enough to get people to overcome the barriers," which include building lots of fueling stations, Mr. Gallagher said. But now, he said, it is more like $1.50 a gallon, "and people are starting to get out their pocket calculators." 
The online version of the report includes a calculator of sorts, a dashboard that allows readers to vary the assumptions and see the results in 2050. 
 Meanwhile, again demonstrating the difficulties of making predictions, the biggest alternative-fuel effort today, corn-based ethanol, is stumbling because of the Midwestern drought and the stunted corn crop. This week a coalition of corn users, mostly dairy farmers and companies that raise poultry, cattle and hogs, asked the Environmental Protection Agency to cut the ethanol requirement to reduce the demand for corn. 
Current rules mandate production of 13.2 billion gallons this year, which the coalition said would require about 4.7 million bushels of corn. But the entire harvest may amount to less than 12 billion bushels this year, the coalition said, down from 13 billion last year, when the ethanol mandate was smaller. Thus ethanol could take nearly 40 percent of this year's corn crop, the organizations said. And the requirement for ethanol in 2013, when most of this year's harvest would be used, is even higher.
But the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group representing corn farmers, promptly issued a statement calling for the E.P.A. to keep the mandate intact. The material left over at ethanol factories, called distiller's grains, are still animal feed, Bob Dinneen, president of the group, pointed out, and reducing the mandate would not lower corn prices, he said. 
In fact, high corn prices are making ethanol more expensive at the pump, so it is not selling as well. Waiving the quota, he said, "would simply reward oil companies that have long sought to repeal this very important and successful program,'' he said in a statement.

HEADLINE: A First Glimpse of the 2014 Mazda 6 Comes in Moscow

BYLINE: NICK KURCZEWSKI


HIGHLIGHT: The 2014 Mazda 6 hews to the automaker's latest design concept known as Kodo and will be introduced to the North American market at the Los Angeles auto show in November. 

 BODY:
Mazda has provided a peek at the revamped 2014 Mazda 6 sedan ahead of the car's introduction at the Moscow Auto Show this month.
Powered by a 2-liter inline 4-cylinder engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, Mazda says the car will be shown in Russian specification. Its surprise appearance at the show, Aug. 27-30, is meant to underscore the importance of Russia as an emerging market.
Later, the car will be displayed at the Paris Auto Show in September and will make its North American debut in November at the Los Angeles auto show.
The setting of the Mazda 6's United States appearance is no accident,because it was during the 2010 L.A. Auto Show when the Mazda Shinari concept introduced the brand's current Kodo design language.
Derek Jenkins, director of design for Mazda North America, said in an interview that Kodo lends the car, "a strong forward movement," which he said was "like an athlete on the starting blocks."
Mr. Jenkins singled out the "sophisticated, bladelike surfaces and details," like the lower surround of the front grille, which flows upward into the bumper and tapers into the headlights. The 6's short overhangs and "cab rearward" stance are design elements Mr. Jenkins promises will appear on other Mazda vehicles.
Since it was introduced in 2002, the Mazda 6 has sometimes fallen through the cracks of the midsize sedan market, at least in contrast to the segment sales leaders like the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Ford Fusion.
Even so, sales of the current Mazda are not suffering, up 63 percent through June 30, over the year-earlier period. Mazda knows, however, it must work harder to get noticed in a crowded field.
"A sports car can push boundaries," Mr. Jenkins said, adding that the styling a sedan like the Mazda6 required knowing "how far is too far" in terms of taking risks.
Those risks have paid off with the CX-5, Mazda's recently introduced five-passenger crossover vehicle. Since it went on sale earlier this year, sales have exceeded supply, forcing Mazda to increase global production to 190,000 from 160,000. Additional production increases appear likely for 2013.
Both vehicles share the Kodo design language and were developed using Mazda's SkyActiv suite of fuel-saving features. Among them: a strategically lightened chassis, lighter and more compact transmissions, along with high compression gasoline and diesel-powered engines.
The SkyActiv technologies help lift the average fuel economy of the Mazda 3, the brand's best-selling model, by about 30 percent.
The Mazda 6 will place even more of an emphasis on fuel-saving features, including the one with an unusual name, i-ELOOP, an adaptation of Intelligent Energy Loop.
The system employs regenerative braking, a feature found on many hybrid and electric cars, which stores kinetic energy gained while the car is decelerating. This captured energy is then stored it in a capacitor, versus a battery pack, and used to power electrical components like the audio and climate control systems.
The advantages of the capacitor-based system, according to Mazda, include negating the need for a bulky electric motor and battery pack. The capacitor can also be rapidly recharged in seconds. Mazda says i-ELOOP offers fuel economy gains of 10 percent.
Sales of the Mazda 6 begin in the first quarter of 2013, for the 2014 model year. Mazda will release details regarding pricing and technical specifications for the American market in the coming months.

HEADLINE: Ancestral Remedies to the Rescue

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: Ethnobotanists help Micronesian communities preserve medicinal plant knowledge and resources for future generations. 

 BODY:
Ethnobotanists are fond of the joke that pills don't grow on trees. The punch line, of course, is that they actually do. Countless pharmaceutical products originate from trees or other plant species, many of which are probably still waiting to be discovered. This week around 1,300 natural products researchers and practitioners gathered in New York to discuss the latest findings in their field, including the ways in which nature, culture and conservation overlap to provide health benefits to millions and how those links can best be preserved.
"The goal is not only to identify plants but to guard and honor this traditional wisdom in order to keep bio-cultural diversity intact," said Michael Balick, the vice president for botanical science and director of the Institute of Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden. The hope, he said, is to help underserved peoples deal with globalization and the loss of their cultures. 
In a presentation at the conference, Dr. Balick discussed his work helping the islands of Palau, Pohnpei and Kosrae identify and preserve their ethnobotanical heritage in the face of Western cultural intrusions.
Scholars coined the term ethnobotany about a century ago for the study of the many ways that indigenous peoples make use of plants. Today that field studies and analyzes traditional medical practices based on natural substances that were the basis for the development of novel pharmaceuticals.
In many cases, it took hundreds of years of trial and error for cultures around the world to identify what local species could treat a stomach ache or defuse an infection. In some cases - in China's ancient pharmacopeias, for example, or Europe's 16th-century texts on medicinal herbs -- that knowledge was preserved in writing for future generations. In other cases, however, the traditions were never codified, but rather passed down orally.
In many communities today, that traditional knowledge threatens to be snuffed out in a generation or two. In many cases, "young people would rather watch television, get on the Internet or migrate to more Western locations," Dr. Balick said. "So a lot of the elders are concerned about loss of information."
In Micronesia, for example, no one he interviewed over a 10-year period could recall how to make clothing from fibers from local breadfruit trees, a tradition that used to be common amongst the islanders.
Local knowledge can also help save lives. When a cholera epidemic hit Palau, the local medical dispensary quickly ran out of pharmaceuticals to treat patients' severe diarrhea. The pharmacist's great-grandmother then offered a remedy that involved what seemed like common weeds growing around the clinic. Her homegrown treatment helped alleviate some of the epidemics' symptoms and also inspired the idea of creating local health-care manuals.
Dr. Balick helped enlist around 60 experts -- including traditional healers, physicians, botanists, toxicologists, linguists and social scientists, many of them native to the islands -- to assemble the manuals. His team began by interviewing elders about which resources, both above ground and in the reefs and waters surrounding the islands, they relied on for medicinal benefits. "People were invited to share information that they would like not to be gone when they pass," he said.
They compiled island-specific manuals for Palau and Pohnpei that addressed primary health care for ills like bites, stings, colds, flus and infectious diseases. In some cases, including "mangrove sickness," which is characterized by achy muscles, stomach ache, dizziness and fatigue, people identified nine separate plants as useful treatments. Those who shared their knowledge are fully credited in the books.
Dr. Balick said he hoped \the manuals would help the islanders become self-sustaining and self-reliant, as they were in the past, in treating ailments that deplete life and financial resources in the communities. In conducting surveys, he found that the more traditional knowledge people have, the more they report being healthy and happy as they age. The manuals are not meant to replace allopathic medicine but rather complement and support it.
He points out that nearly three billion people on the planet have limited access to Western medicine and thus depend on some level on traditional medicines derived from plants. "My goal is to try to help people help themselves in a way that is sustainable and respectful to the environment," he said. 
Sustainability initiatives often originate within the communities and nations themselves. The Micronesia Challenge, for example, was organized by Micronesian nations with the goal of conserving 30 percent of their marine resources and 20 percent of their terrestrial resources by 2020 so they can preserve local flora and fauna for future generations' use.
Dr. Balick's colleagues help support the initiative by identifying and inventorying endemic flora, fungi and biodiversity hot spots on the islands. From there, they work with locals on designing protected areas to preserve rare species. 
"What we find is more successful is not that outsiders designate and exclude people, but that local communities are directly involved in conservation and sustainable management of their resources," he said. "We're in a race against time to hopefully identify where those rare species are so we can help local people and organizations get them into protected regions."

HEADLINE: Want a Job? Move to Oman

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: In Oman and Saudi Arabia, 69 percent of adults say now is a good time to get a job where they live, according to new Gallup data. In the United States, just a quarter of people empathize. 

 BODY:
Just a quarter of Americans think it is a good time to get a job. That compares to about a third of adults worldwide, according to Gallup surveys conducted in 146 countries last year.
If you believe the locals, Oman and Saudi Arabia are the best places on earth to find a job: 69 percent of the adults in each country believe their local job market is good. The available jobs there may not be so attractive, though, by American standards; last year, income per capita was $26,900 in Oman and $24,500 in Saudi Arabia. In the United States, that figure was $49,000.
Some interesting patterns emerge from these numbers.
Nearly all of the top 10 most optimistic countries are developing economies. Singapore is the only developed country making that list.

There's also a lot of variability among euro zone countries about the economic outlook, even if their fates are all intertwined:
Germans are relatively chipper, with about half saying now is a good time to find a job in their city or area. That's higher than the worldwide average.
Italian, Irish and Greek respondents, on the other hand, sound pretty dour. In Greece, 96 percent of adults think now is a bad time to find a job, and just 2 percent think it's a good time.
I'm curious: What businesses are those 2 percent of Greeks involved in? Bankruptcy law?

HEADLINE: Middle East Journal: Can We Compete With a Factory in Dubai?

BYLINE: PAUL DOWNS


HIGHLIGHT: I love touring factories: the layout, the materials, the machinery that's there and the machinery that's not there. This factory was, at first glance, very much like mine. But there were some real differences as well. 

 BODY:
As I said in my previous post in this series, I love touring factories, particularly woodworking shops where I really know what I'm looking at. Everything is interesting: the layout, the materials, the machinery that's there and the machinery that's not there. The factory I got to tour in Dubai was, at first glance, very much like mine. But there were some real differences as well.
Our tour started in the engineering offices, which were air-conditioned. There were a dozen or so engineers, each working on computer drawings for various projects. I asked the manager how many people worked at the plant, and he told me he had more than 200 on staff. Two hundred! That's a pretty big operation. I'm a little dim on the exact breakdown, but my recollection is that he had 30 in sales and engineering (the office positions) and the rest were out on the shop floor. 
They produced a variety of products: millwork (woodwork that is attached to a building, like custom paneling, doors and trim), furniture (chairs, tables and case goods, both upholstered and all wood), and tables (dining and conference). That's a very broad set of skills under one roof, and it would be tough to find a comparable operation in America, as our factories tend to be much more specialized.
For instance, I know a lot of companies here that do custom millwork. There are a few shops like mine that do custom tables, and there are companies that do custom upholstery, but I don't know of a custom shop that does all of that. If someone asked me for upholstered work, I would sub it to an upholstery shop. And it might send table work to me. This specialization allows us to develop very particular skill sets in our workers and helps amortize the cost of that training.
It's very difficult to make money in America if your workers are switching gears all of the time. They can never develop a competitive level of skill and efficiency, unless they are paid a low wage. And low wages don't buy you a worker who knows several trades. Large factories with a broad product line might have a bunch of skills in one place, but that would be pure production line work, with each worker doing a small set of tasks. This ends up requiring lower skills than my workers offer and paying lower wages than my workers get.
I asked the manager where he got his workers, and he told me that they were all foreign, as is he. They are hired on a contract basis to come work in Dubai. I asked him what he paid a shop floor guy, and he told me that it was the equivalent of a dollar an hour. I later tried to verify whether this was a typical wage for skilled labor in Dubai, but couldn't come up with a specific number. Unskilled labor has a legal minimum wage of 950 dirhams a month (about $260) but I don't know whether anyone pays attention to that, or how many hours the workers are expected to work each day.
In any case, labor in Dubai is really, really cheap. A typical skilled cabinetmaker in the Northeast United States makes about $4,000 a month, not including benefits. Let's call it $4,800 a month all in. For that money, I could hire at least 10 skilled laborers in Dubai. I currently have five bench cabinetmakers, who together build between $180,000 and $200,000 worth of product a month. Replace them with 50 guys for the same price and we'd be churning out huge amounts of work. That is, if the workers in Dubai are as productive as my guys. And that's a big if.
Back to the tour. The factory had one feature mine lacks: a mezzanine level that provides a nice view of the shop floor. I had my iPhone handy, so I took a quick video of this scene:
The area visible here is about the same size as my shop floor, maybe a little bigger. Every green dot is a worker. I counted them, and there are 46 visible. (There may be more that are out of sight.) Compare that again to how many people I have in a comparable area: five. (Incidentally, the German factory I visited in April was much like mine -- large space, tons of machines and very few workers to be seen.)
We went down to the shop floor to take a closer look. The factory was busy producing all of the millwork for an embassy in Ghana. This included lots of custom doors, trim molding and some large custom column wraps -- huge wooden cylinders, hollow inside, that would hide structural steel columns in the embassy. This part of the building and, as it turned out, all parts except the office, had no air-conditioning. It was easily 100 degrees on the shop floor.
The workers were dressed in some kind of company garb -- a green polo shirt -- and most of them wore a dust mask. Many had towels wrapped around their heads to catch sweat. For all that, they weren't working at a very slow speed or at a very fast speed. They had the measured pace of guys who are used to a long day of physical labor. One thing that surprised me is that people were working safely. In addition to the dust masks, the sanding room had an efficient dust-extraction system, and the finishing room had very nice spray booths. I didn't notice anyone with missing fingers, a common sight in older American workshops. The manager was proud of this, and I was impressed by his level of concern for worker safety.
Down on the shop floor I got a closer look at the work and the machinery. The work was pretty good, but it was noticeably different from the way we do things. We use a CNC milling machine -- a computerized cutting machine that is essentially a robot -- to cut all of the components of our jobs. It makes very precise parts, which are then assembled by my workers. We do hand work only to assemble precut parts (which is highly skilled work, believe me). In the Dubai shop, all the curved parts, in fact all the parts, were cut by hand, using relatively simple tools, and then assembled with screws and nails. That's how we used to do things 10 years ago, but we've found that the precision of the CNC cutter allows us to make much more complex work at high speed.
The Dubai factory didn't have a CNC machine. In fact, it had machines that were very similar to my older equipment. And it was noticeable that the quantity of tools was lower than in my shop. We have four table saws, it had one. We have three wide-belt sanders, it had one. We have two jointers, it had one. Again, keep in mind that it had at least 46 guys out on the shop floor, and we have only five. The value of the machinery I saw was maybe a third of the cost of what's on my shop floor.
The next thing I noticed was that quite a few of the guys were just standing around, generally near someone who was doing work. It wasn't clear to me what this was all about -- are they apprentices? Helpers? Are workers so inexpensive that businesses just hire a big pile of them and it doesn't really matter whether they produce anything? Or is there a government subsidy that makes this kind of hiring economical? I wasn't there long enough to figure it out, but I saw this so many times that I gave the phenomenon a name: the stand-around guy. You can see two examples in the video below:
I'm sure there's an explanation, but the way things were done was obviously unproductive. There were always many more people doing things than I would have assigned to the same task. Here's another example: six guys running a panel across a jointer to straighten a long edge.
That piece may be large, but it's not that heavy, probably about 100 pounds. If we had to do this in my shop, two guys would take care of it. But we would never have to do this task, because our CNC machine would have cut the part at exactly the right size. In my shop, an engineer in the office would have defined the cuts that made the part. In the Dubai shop, it was done out on the shop floor and adjustments were made as needed. Doing things this way slows a project down a lot -- every part has to be fitted and refitted to the pieces it touches. A complex project takes a huge amount of fussing so that it fits together correctly. And it's all hand labor of the highest skill level. Once a part is cut too small, you start over. You don't want anyone but your very best guys on that task. Our use of robotic cutting has pretty much eliminated the need to do this unless the project is extremely complex.
We went to the different areas of the shop, and the pattern was repeated. There would be a guy working hard, with one or two helpers who weren't. The work was well made, with sturdy joinery. A lot of stuff was being produced, as you might expect with 200 workers. And the shop was creating an astonishing variety of work. From the millwork for the embassy to upholstered banquettes for a restaurant to conference tables just like the ones we make.
It was also obvious that there were a number of very highly skilled workers, including a guy who could cut intricate veneer patterns with a knife, and another who was carving beautiful flowers out of wood. They were turning out very sophisticated work with very simple tools -- the definition of great hand skills. But schooled in the tough economics of American manufacturing, I was most struck by the number of stand-around guys.
A previous version of this post referred incorrectly to the local currency in Dubai. It is the Dirham. (Thanks to commenter Under a mango tree.)

HEADLINE: American White Phosphorus Shells in Libya: A Challenge to a Pentagon Chestnut

BYLINE: C. J. CHIVERS and JOHN ISMAY


HIGHLIGHT: The uprising in Libya last year, especially the decades-old weapons let loose in the chaos, tell a cold-war tale of allies and arms deals. 

 BODY:
The history of how Libya became a bunker state reduces readily to short-hand. After overthrowing King Idris in 1969, Muammar el-Qaddafi, a young army officer, used his nation's oil revenue to underwrite a decades' long arms-purchasing spree, stockpiling weapons from the West but principally from Russia, China and the Eastern bloc. As his holdings grew, he used his arsenal to supply his expanding army and internal security units, as well as a source of items to export to guerrilla or terrorist groups in Chad, the Palestinian territories, Ireland and beyond. This was one of the many ways that Libya became a menace and regional scourge. Libya's growing arms stockpile was also a means by which the colonel's hold on power remained secure, at least until the uprising that toppled him and cost thousands of lives, including his own.
This abbreviated chronicle is of course true. It also has its limits. It picks up the story of the arming of Libya after the process was well under way. The fuller story is darker and richer, and points to the persistent and often unacknowledged risks of arms transfers to developing states. This blog has said it often: Time and again arms passed between states outlive the governments and people who orchestrate the transfers, to be put to use in ways the exporters once insisted were not grounds for worry, or against which they said they had responsibly put safeguards in place.
Take a look at the photograph at the top of this post. That cheerful logo - two right hands in a firm handshake within a crest bearing stars and the colors of the American flag -- was the product of another era. In the 1950s, it served as the logo of the U.S. Mutual Security Agency, a precursor to the Agency for International Development. The label used to find its way onto, among other things, sacks of wheat.
Why does it open this post? Because last year, as troops loyal to Colonel Qaddafi and his sons were being beaten back by the combined effects of a popular uprising and a NATO air campaign, this logo turned up on weathered ammunition packaging scattered about the North African battlefield. Its appearance was a clue to the time, many decades back, when the United States and Britain were the principal suppliers of Libya's military equipment.
In the case of the photograph above, the sticker had been affixed to a storage tube for an 81-millimeter white-phosphorus mortar round with a point-detonating fuze. The tube, with many others, was found by a reporter for The New York Times in an abandoned government munitions depot that in the summer of 2011 had fallen under the control of anti-Qaddafi fighters. It had been packed, according to the yellow stenciling on its side, in November 1944 -- late in World War II, as the United States contemplated the invasion of Japan. Wooden crates containing rifle and machine-gun ammunition, seen below, bore that same label, suggesting an acknowledged state-to-state transfer of ammunition in an aid program.
These old labels stoked natural curiosity. With time, analysis of the ammunition-packaging markings and a review of declassified American cables and intelligence documents helped trace the munitions back to their sources and to the programs and foreign-policy choices that carried them to North Africa. By the evidence available now, the stickers had been put on roughly a decade after the end of World War II, when surplus arms stocks were thought to have another currency -- in securing cold-war friends.
The study of arms and ordnance often is not just about arms and ordnance. These items can tell of other things. In this case, the battlefield finds were valuable because they pointed to a little mentioned chapter in Libyan history, when the United States actively worked to increase the size and capabilities of Libya's military, which became the source of the coup that cast the country into despotism, brutality and enduring disarray.
They led, in other words, to a case study of American military engagement gone awry, and a military-aid program having exactly the opposite of its intended effect. And they potentially carry lessons for the present day, when the United States has busily helped equip and train the security forces of other fragile and immature states, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Georgia and many more, and as various commentators call for the arming of would-be allies elsewhere, including in Syria.
Arms for Libya: "Opportunity Too Good to Miss"
The Libya of three generations ago bore little resemblance to Libya today. After World War II, the country did not yet know of the huge reserves of oil beneath its desert sands. It was emerging from colonialism as one of the most impoverished nations in the world.
The initial American interest in Libya centered on something else: a former Italian and Luftwaffe air field now known as Mitiga International Airport, located just outside Tripoli, the capital. Built by Italy when it was a colonial power in 1923 and renamed Wheelus Air Field in 1945 by the American military, the base was considered so vital to military plans that early in the cold war, strategic bombers stood ready on the flight line to attack the Soviet interior. Tankers and fighters supporting those aircraft were kept there, too. American Matador missile units did exercises as well, training for nuclear war. The access had been made possible by postwar agreements between King Idris and the United States that gave the Pentagon permission to operate Wheelus until 1970.
Why did the Pentagon deem Wheelus important? The answer was in part related to Europe's gray weather, which all too often grounded planes. And so American fighter and bomber pilots stationed in Europe were rotated through Libya, taking advantage of the fine flying conditions presented by the arid North African air. While in Libya, air crews also trained on aerial gunnery and bombing ranges, the use of which was eased by the lopsided power dynamic between the White House and Idris's palace. Libya was too poor to complain.
In keeping with the times, Washington was not alone in courting the Libyan monarch. Idris was a new king, assuming power when the country declared independence of foreign administration in 1951. As a leader of a nation just stepping onto the world's stage, he received Soviet delegations willing to look past their ideological opposition to monarchies to expand Kremlin influence across Africa.
In 1956, the Soviet Union opened an embassy in Tripoli. From this competition a familiar contest played out. Idris was Western-leaning. Hoping to secure this loyalty and deny Moscow a possible ally, the American Embassy in Tripoli asked Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to free financing under the Mutual Security Program to pay for aid to Libya. The program, which extended the ideas of the Marshall Plan beyond Europe, had been signed into law by President Harry S. Truman in 1951. It allowed the United States to offer food, economic and agricultural training to impoverished nations; it also made available weapons, ammunition and military training intended to help keep anti-Soviet leaders in power.
President Truman had framed his arguments for the program in language that mixed anti-Kremlin sternness with the bitter aftertaste of World War II.
"The Mutual Security Program is a positive program for peace. It is absolutely essential to the security of the United States. At a time when one nation is bent upon world conquest - as the Soviet Union is today - other nations, large or small, have but two real choices: To pay the ransom of appeasement or to pay the price of building together sufficient strength - military, economic, political, and moral strength - to keep the peace. The United States and other free nations have chosen to build up their strength. That is what the Mutual Security Program is all about."
Managed by the State Department and the Pentagon, in time it would distribute billions of dollars in aid worldwide. (Eventually, after a series of changes, it would morph into the U.S. Agency for International Development.)
Aid for Libya started small. American assistance teams trained Libyans in agriculture and animal husbandry, and the United States shipped in tens of thousands of tons of wheat. By 1955, however, new possibilities were in play. Libya's loyalist army had been founded in 1953, and King Idris had repeatedly asked John L. Tappin, the American ambassador, for more military engagement, saying he feared his country's provincial police forces. With 5,000 men under local control, the police forces outnumbered the king's army by almost three to one, and possessed the real authority in the land. (Libya's army had grown to 1,800 soldiers equipped with basic armaments and trained by soldiers from the British garrisons in the country, which numbered several thousand.) Idris wanted a more imposing guarantor of his throne. He urged Ambassador Tappin to help raise a loyalist force of 5,000 men.
If the king saw a way to strengthen his position, the ambassador, an unabashed champion of Libya's monarchy, saw a chance to pull far ahead of the Soviets, and to prevent Libya from slipping, as Egypt had, toward becoming a Soviet proxy, replete with Soviet military goods. He argued to Secretary Dulles in May 1957 that a $10 million investment then would "do more good than $100 million elsewhere or too late." Ambassador Tappin closed his comments by saying "Libya can be put solidly in U.S. camp now. Opportunity too good to miss."
Congress required recipient countries to agree to use the military equipment responsibly, and to return unused weapons as deemed necessary by the president. With these stipulations, the National Security Council decided in 1957 that the United States would help the Libyan Army expand to 4,500 men and would train these soldiers to maintain internal security and resist guerrilla raids. In turn, Libya rebuffed much of the Soviet advance.
Thus began a classic, implicit arrangement in military-to-military engagements. The United States, with Britain, provided weapons and know-how with the hopes of cementing a relationship and securing a friend and the basing rights he granted.
Guns, Oil and Internal Security
The program found traction. Total American aid in 1960 reached $24.6 million, and by the early 1960s, the Libyan Army had grown to 4,200 men.
Then a new factor emerged: oil.
Big strikes of crude in Algeria had excited Idris's government, giving grounds for the United States to fear losing its base. Libyans by then viewed Wheelus as a nuisance and a threat to their security. The American presence had been tolerated because of the need for aid and because it provided the tiny country a degree of leverage over the United States. Libya's newfound wealth was changing the equation. Libya's oil revenue hit $40 million in 1962. It was expected to reach $200 million per year by 1965. Washington's position was eroding, and with it, control of Libya's military aspirations and influence over its appetite for arms.
Earlier reasons for helping Libya were eroding, too. By 1962, Idris, who suddenly had arms-purchasing power that did not need to be vetted by foreign defense attaches, wanted an air force of his own. And the United States was interested in expanding the army even more, both to keep pace with Libya's provincial police forces, which had not been disbanded, and to be more able partners. An American Army survey team recommendedin 1962 that Libya's army should grow to 8,500 men, at a cost of $9.8 million over five years.
Momentum from this point forward could not be stemmed. Soon Libya was asking its American military sponsors for M-48 tanks and 155-millimeter howitzers. Washington turned down the requests, saying these weapons were unnecessary for internal defense. But in other ways, the United States was open to helping Libya sharply enhance its military capabilities. The calculus was clearly being recalibrated.
In 1964, the Joint Chiefs presented President Lyndon B. Johnson with an assessment that Wheelus was necessary for American national security, so much so that covert action should be considered to retain it. President Johnson chose another course. He agreed in principle to close the base, but began a stalling campaign. The administration feared being seen as acceding too quickly to a host nation's desire for the United States to reduce its forward military footprint. What would that mean elsewhere, if other nations' leaders changed their stances? Could the United States be pushed around and compelled to leave, even by a "non-country" like Libya?
A new enticement was worked up: a plan to convert Wheelus into a sprawling international airport, with both the American and Libyan air forces as tenants -- a process the Johnson administration called "Libyanization." (Followers of the latest Afghan war will hear an echo of this thinking in the common use in recent years of the term "Afghanization" by Pentagon planners.)
The changes in Libya driving Washington's new thinking were accelerating, but another force was quietly gathering influence. The army the United States and Britain had helped equip, train and multiply had signed on a new officer candidate - Muammar el-Qaddafi, who began studies at the military academy in Benghazi in 1961. He graduated in 1966, and immediately was part of the West's engagement with its Libyan protg. The photograph below hints at an arrangement soon to sour.
It shows then-Lieutenant Qaddafi walking the streets of London, on break from a five-month course at the British Army's School of Education in Beaconsfield. The instructors there, according to an article by Michael Cockerell in Standpoint magazine, took note of Lieutenant Qaddafi's intense nationalism and were suspicious of him. They also found him to be not especially remarkable.
A senior officer, who later served at the Ministry of Defense, said: "Gaddafi certainly wasn't the most ghastly hooligan we'd seen at Beaconsfield." He added with a rueful smile: "He gave us no reason to poison him while he was there."
Lieutenant Qaddafi was moving quickly. Just three years later, he led the coup that deposed King Idris. The army the United States had helped build to protect the monarch had instead unseated him. The local police forces had been eclipsed as the primary threat to the throne. The solution, in retrospect, proved to be worse than the problem.
Adding to the Stockpiles, Which Would Help Topple the Throne Again
From here the well-known tale resumes. Muammar el-Qaddafi's contempt for the United States was clear; he was not open to negotiation on extending an American military presence at Wheelus. In June 1970 the U.S. Air Force handed the base back to Libya. The last American airmen left.
Libya, holding billions of dollars in oil money, started buying arms at a scale not previously seen.
It now had the means to buy that which had previously been denied: offensive weaponry. It struck a$400 million deal with the French for modern equipment, including 110 Mirage fighter jets. A $40 million purchase from the the Soviet Union in 1971 brought in 130 tanks, 24 self-propelled guns, 90 artillery pieces and 100 armored personnel carriers. Another 120 similar vehicles were delivered by Czechoslovakia, a satellite the Kremlin sometimes used as a cut-out for arms transfers. In April 1971, a National Intelligence Estimate placed the size of the Libyan armed forces at 19,000 men; it had grown more than ten-fold in the 15 years since the United States decided to underwrite and equip it. The following year, rising anti-American sentiment forced the United States to withdraw its ambassador in Tripoli. In 1979, the United States shut down its embassy entirely. Colonel Qaddafi's Libya by then was an open state sponsor of terrorism.
Arms buys continued throughout the cold war and after the Soviet collapse, including from China, North Korea and post-Soviet Russia, and, among others, Belgium and Spain. With time, Mr. Qaddafi managed to acquire napalm bombs, which his air force was accused of using in the 1980s in Chad. The napalm and the batteries of ground-to-ground rockets showed just how far Libya's military had come from the original American plan. And the old stock remained, and still had martial use.
That brings us back to that logo at the top of the post. The white-phosphorus mortar rounds in that photograph were not alone. The United States had also provided stocks of American rifle ammunition, most notably M2 ball ammunition, commonly called the .30-'06, that was used in American military rifles and machine guns until being abruptly phased out in the 1950s, replaced by the 7.62x51-millimeter NATO round. The photograph below shows several cases that remained last year.
Markings on the boxes conform to the standard used in the United States from 1949 to 1975. Staff members at the Joint Munitions Command at the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois said this ammunition was made at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant and at Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant.
Now look at the photograph below. This was another storage tube for an 81-millimeter mortar round, found by The New York Times beside a mortar used by anti-Qaddafi forces skirmishing last summer with loyalist forces on the desert flatlands north of the Nafusa mountains. The packaging indicates that this, and many other rounds fired by the tube, were M57 white-phosphorus (vol. 3, pg. 85) and M301 illumination rounds, manufactured in Redstone Arsenal in Alabama.
All of these munitions bore the same hand-in-hand logo. Adopted in 1953 as the symbol of the new Mutual Security Agency, it remained in 1955 with that agency's successor organization, the Foreign Operations Administration, which was absorbed by the International Cooperation Administration in 1957 -- the year military aid to Libya began. The presence of the sticker bearing this logo appears to date the transfer of these munitions from American to Libyan custody to sometime between 1957 and 1961 -- during the optimistic period of American military engagement with King Idris.
These munitions, today 60 years or more old, along with high-explosive squash-head and high-explosive antitank rounds for M20 and M40 American-made recoilless rifles, were used to overthrow the dictator who overthrew that king. The recoilless rifle ammunition was particularly interesting. To see one of these weapons in use, go here. This was one of the most important weapons used by the anti-Qaddafi forces in the siege of Misurata, and helped change the course of the ground war. Many of these rounds were manufactured, according to their markings, at the Milan Army Ammunition Plant and the Beaumont Precision Product Machining Inc. The photograph below shows one round for an M20 in the bed of a pickup driven by anti-Qaddafi fighters in spring 2011. That round, according to its lot number, was manufactured in the Iowa Ammunition Plant in 1953 - suggesting that it was almost new when shipped to Idris's army, and almost six decades old when it was used in the ouster of Colonel Qaddafi.
All of these were once part of stocks of weapons of American provenance that are now loose, with many crates or storage tubes displaying a handshake signifying an opportunity, as one long forgotten American ambassador said, that was too good to miss. They stand as marooned, lethal junk from a period of Pentagon and State Department cooperation with a nation that has since endured decades of repression and bloodshed, and been a supplier that transferred its weapons far and wide. When the Pentagon discusses ramping up the military engagement with Libya anew, they serve as warnings, once more, of the law of unintended consequences, and the value of using history to understand decisions being considered today.
An earlier version of this blog post misidentified the United States Secretary of State under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was John Foster Dulles. His brother, Allen Welsh Dulles, was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1953-61.

HEADLINE: The Times's Agenda Project for Campaign: Some Readers Vote Yes, Some Scoff

BYLINE: ARTHUR S. BRISBANE


HIGHLIGHT: New York Times readers respond to the public editor's most recent print column on the 2012 presidential campaign. 

 BODY:
Included below is some reader responses to my column "Resetting the Campaign Agenda" on July 29:
I thought your editorial piece yesterday was spot on. I can think of no greater calling for the Fourth Estate than to force our current presidential candidates to talk about the issues that really matter and their detailed plans for dealing with them. For some time I have thought that a journal of national stature such as The Times should have the candidates address one important topic a week chosen by you with their responses containing a brief opening position statement followed by as many action specifics as possible. These candidate statements would be published in The Times on Sunday and then the public could respond to those comments over the balance of the week.
 With fourteen weeks remaining in the campaign, there should be no shortage of topics to discuss. For the good of the democratic process, something needs to be done and you are in a position to make it happen.

Thank you for some fine reporting regarding the agenda.
Does the New York Times still have the power to elevate political debate? Your article confirms the difficulties will be substantial. It also revealed a true jewel of an insight from Geneva Overholser, one that warrants systematic consideration by the parties charged with executing the agenda. Specifically, her idea that "capturing the value of reader perspective requires more than just opening blog posts up to comments" truly crystallizes a key aspect of the challenges ahead.
The NYT writers involved in the initiative can legitimately argue that by examining responses to articles/blog posts and distilling them into new content reflecting the combined contributions of the paper and its public, they are doing far more than just allowing comments. I agree, but respectfully request the situation be viewed from a different perspective.
I suggest that despite allowing for reader comments, The Agenda remains in essence a classic 'top-down' flow; the paper creates, the public consumes. Perhaps you will consider inverting this model for some portions of your effort. Envisioning NYT products as not always the apex of a tree, but as its vital informational roots may help you utilize reporting as a basis to spur organic growth in public discussions through new communications modes.
How can that goal be reached? Encourage people not only to read and react to your work, but to transmit your messages as well as build on them. For example, why not at the end of each article ask bloggers who have built on your original work to provide feedback describing what they created? Whenever you find important contributions, incorporate them into new NYT articles (as already planned), but also blast a Tweet through Twitter announcing each gem to the world. And send a personal e-mail to let those creators know you value their help and express hope they will continue the partnership. By highlighting the best observations and content extensions (with links, please) you expand your network outward, empower creators and incentivize sustained participation. And exploit all public input as a golden opportunity to recruit additional voices to amplify the effect of future NYT articles. The NYT puts out a fine product; imagine a super-powered form of grass roots global syndication in which the type of reporting citizens can't do becomes the instigator of a creative chain reaction to which they can add real value. There is no limit to the amount of information that can be produced and every aspect of content [blogs, e-mail, Twitter, letters to the editor (of other papers) comments, videos] represents potential amplification opportunities rooted to NYT reporting. Make it easy for content creators to let you know what they have done and take full advantage of their efforts.
How about this? As debates or town hall meetings get scheduled during the campaign, why not establish a Twitter hashtag "I'd like to know..." to enable people to submit questions they wish the candidates would answer. Make this a self-building conversation by mining the public input for pertinent new article ideas and writing about how the candidates fared if and when they deal with the questions. And keep a continuously updated candidate answer score card. Imagine the power of questions multiplied hundreds or thousands of times tweeted from every corner of our nation. Could the candidates ignore that clamor? Here is the first question I would tweet to Mr. Romney if I had the chance: "Will your tax plan make it possible to move your overseas assets back to the US?"
Can the NYT elevate the political debate of our nation? I firmly believe you have something few others possess; a tremendous collection of talented and active journalists. Perhaps by augmenting that solid journalistic nucleus with new communications technologies where appropriate and amplifying the signal through teaming and co-creating with the public, it will happen. But, I doubt it will happen on its own; it may take some active recruitment efforts and nurturing. Please request explicitly that readers, bloggers, Twitter users, etc. help you in this daunting and critical undertaking. In so many ways it really is up to the public.

I read with interest your column today regarding "Resetting the Campaign Agenda." Excuse me, but I had to laugh a bit. You state in the fifth paragraph that, "The Times, which many people look to for coverage on substantive issues...." I truly think that today that is a very false premise. It might have been true in the long distant past but this past week that New York Times clearly demonstrated that it is certainly not interested in covering substantive issues regarding the current presidential campaign.
On Friday of this past week, the Commerce Department announced that the U.S. economy grew at a very tepid 1.5%. This story led most broadcast media and on Saturday it was covered on the front pages of a significant number of papers around the country. I would suggest that the reason for this was two- fold. Number one, it is something that affects the lives of every single American - not just Democrats or Republicans, not just people who live in California or New York, not just black or white, but everyone no matter where they live or who they are. Number two is that it is the single most important issue, according to every poll, of the current presidential campaign. If you had read the front page of Saturday's New York Times, there was not one single word on the faltering (1.5% growth) economy - not one. The most important paper in the country (at least that is what The Times thinks of itself) could not cover a subject that reflects poorly on the current president and that everyone -yes, everyone - is concerned about. Yes, the story was on the front page of the Business Day section but I would venture to say that significantly fewer people read the Business Day section than read the front page. And, it was not a business story; it was a national story of significant impact.
If The New York Times was truly interested in discussing the agenda of the current election, the current state of the economy would be at the very top of the list. The problem, I suggest, is that is not what The New York Times is actually interested in discussing. It is much more interested in discussing issues that are favorable to the current occupant of the White House rather than highlight what most people believe (again, most polls agree) is a major failure of the Obama presidency.
When The New York Times discusses "Resetting Campaign Agendas," it should start with what is most important to every single American. At this point in time, the is it and everything else is a distant second.

The dearth of substantive political debate in the United States calls to mind Cicero's admonition that emotion (pathos) often overwhelms reason (logos) and integrity (ethos) in the realm of public discourse.
Yet our existential quandary in 2012 goes far beyond staccato sound bites, voter apathy or the candidates' "bumper-sticker rhetoric."
 As a result of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, well-heeled ideologues have poured untold millions into Super Pacs designed to swift-boat the opposition while affording presidential aspirants the patina of plausible deniability. Aided by cable TV pundits and a partisan blogosphere, vitriolic billionaires can reap the sluttish spoils of opportunistic demagoguery.
 This election year may well be a watershed in American politics. Should the malefactors of great stealth prevail, the Republic as we know it will not long endure. In this age of political deception, The Times's The Agenda, represents a revolutionary and patriotic act.

"Where's the beef?" I've been reading and hearing that all voters are really concerned about is which candidate can do something to improve the economy and reduce unemployment. The list of titles for your elite bloggers does not include these topics. Certainly, their areas of research and expertise are important and they should be included, but the omission of economic proposals and direct comparison of each candidate's position pushes The Agenda to the back pages. Plus, I, for one print subscriber, do not want to have to put down my paper and go fire up my computer to read these authors. In the season where at least 50% of all televised headline news is about the election campaign I don't understand why these REAL issues cannot occupy a section of my front page and continue in National news.
The Agenda is a great idea! Why go to all this effort and then miss the point?

The "sophisticated NY Times reader," along with the sophisticated Wall Street Journal reader, has long since made up his/her mind regarding Obama v. Romney. As have, for the most part, the less sophisticated non NYT /WSJ readers, aka the great unwashed on the right or the so-called independents that lean decidedly left. The election will be decided not on issues but by the negative ads in the states up for grabs. The NYT election coverage is irrelevant. Totally irrelevant.

I would certainly appreciate someone forcing substance into the candidates' debate. My biggest concern is whether there would be any credibility if The Times was the one to do the forcing, for the following reasons:
 The Times is the leading newspaper promoting the progressive (used to be liberal) agenda.
 It seems that the Times advocates every part of the Democratic Party platform.
 The Times consistently attacks the Republican Party and Mitt Romney.
With that concern, how would the paper appear to be objective? Or, in fact, be objective?

With the exception of your own Gretchen Morgenson, business warrior princess, and some of the environmentalists trying at least to be heard (Bill McKibben; Rolling Stone), there is little journalism that illuminates the "starkly different paths" that you point out, which are truly only an uncomfortable starting point for the path to economic reform and environmental sustainability. A Republican victory would be a disastrous event for the country and the planet. Either pack your bags for the train to Jordan or consider armed rebellion if the blatant corporate champions win this election, because the economy and the environment will literally start causing death to those innocent of connections. This is, of course, tremendously frightening and prevents discussions we need into the faults of the current administration.
 How do you separate the issues of jobs and the environment, when even the obvious examples are lost on many of those affected the most? For instance, the fishermen that fight government limits on their catches, missing the connection that fewer fish now sustains the source of their jobs into the future. If such a clear cause and effect is unclear or ignored, how can you expect a connection between sustaining the basics of air and water to be made when a well paying drilling or pipeline job, not to mention "cheaper" gas, is in the balance? It's all about money and immediate survival and nobody is able to take one for the team or the children. The conversation has to bring morality or nobility to a basic (or base) conversation. Put this way there seems to be no balance between the two parties.
I appreciate your feelings of responsibility to bring substance into the election discussion, and realization that all illumination doesn't shine from east coast pundits and academics. It is what makes The New York Times great.

HEADLINE: Socit Gnrale's Profit Falls Below Expectations

BYLINE: LIZ ALDERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The big French bank reported a second-quarter profit of 433 million euros, a drop of 42 percent from last year and well below what analysts forecast. 

 BODY:
PARIS - Socit Gnrale, the big French bank, reportedsecond-quarter results on Wednesday that fell short of analysts' estimates as it struggled against a downturn in Europe.
Net profit in the second quarter fell 42 percent, to 433 million euros ($530 million), compared with 747 million euros in the period a year earlier. Analysts were expecting the bank to earn 764 million euros in the latest quarter. The bank also said it was making progress in bolstering its capital cushion. 
"Despite a challenging environment, the Socit Gnrale Group has progressed, quarter after quarter, with its transformation strategy, in line with its objectives," Frdric Ouda, the bank's chief executive, said in a statement.
Socit Gnrale took a series of write-downs related to past acquisitions, including 250 million euros on Rosbank in Russia and 200 million euros on TCW Group, a fund firm in Los Angeles. Analysts are waiting to see whether Socit Gnrale sells TCW as part of a broader plan to raise money. 
Like the results of its peers, the report raised concerns that financial weakness could persist as the debt crisis drags on.
The bank said growth in Europe slowed significantly in the second quarter, crimping some of its profitability from retail operations. Its international retail banking revenue fell nearly 2 percent, to 1.24 billion euros.
The bank signaled that it also continued to face financial challenges with its Greek subsidiary, Geniki Bank. In a statement, Socit Gnrale said its operations in Central and Eastern Europe "excluding Greece" did well, but it did not provide figures for the Greek unit. Socit Gnrale has recently cut financing to Geniki to a minimum as the Greek economy shrinks.
French banks have been reducing their exposure to Greece by selling much of the nation's sovereign debt, and those with subsidiaries there are scrambling to figure out how to cope with the worsening situation. One of Socit Gnrale's French rivals, Crdit Agricole, said recently that it was in talks to sell its Greek subsidiary, Emporiki Bank, as soon as possible.
The debt crisis is also wreaking havoc on the investment banking business. The bank said customers remain reticent as policy makers struggle to find "durable solutions to the sovereign debt crisis." Corporate and investment banking revenue fell more than 30 percent, to 1.22 billion euros.
Socit Gnrale also noted deteriorating conditions in France, which has the largest economy in the euro zone after Germany's. So far, France has avoided the worst of the debt crisis that first engulfed Greece and now Spain. But the economy has been softening, and the government's share of the bill for cleaning up the crisis is likely to grow. 
The bank's French retail operations remained flat at 2.04 billion euros.
Shares of Socit Gnrale rose 0.5 percent in Paris, to 18.11 euros.

Ted Cruz, an insurgent backed by the Tea Party, defeated the candidate favored by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas on Tuesday in a runoff election for the Republican Senate nomination. Erik Eckholm writes that the contest revealed a wide rift in Texas between the party establishment and restless, anti-incumbent activists on the right.

        
President Obama and Mitt Romney draw fairly evenly among voters when it comes to matters of the economy, but Mr. Obama's empathy and personal appeals give him an edge over his opponent in three of the hotly contested battleground states, according to new Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News polling, Jeff Zeleny and Dalia Sussman report.

        
House and Senate leaders on Tuesday reached a tentative agreement that would pay for federal government operations through next March, averting the prospect of another messy showdown in an election year, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.

HEADLINE: Obama Supporters Barraged With Pleas for Cash

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The urgent and repeated appeals, sent to millions of Barack Obama's supporters via e-mail and text message, are a vivid reminder that the president's campaign is likely to raise significantly less than Mitt Romney and Republicans for the third month in a row in July. 

 BODY:
Each plea for money from President Obama and his allies has become more urgent and desperate than the last. 
His campaign's chief operating officer said on Monday that "we've gotten our behinds handed to us."
Vice President Joe Biden warned on the same day that Mr. Obama would lose if "the other side spends us into oblivion."
Michele Obama worried aloud about waking up on election day "wondering if I could have done more." And Al Gore, the former vice president, said victories by the "extremist fringe" would "spell disaster" for the country.
The answer, according to all of them? A donation of $3 (or more) by midnight on Tuesday. (The e-mails don't say "Pretty please!" -- yet.)
The urgent and repeated appeals, sent to millions of Mr. Obama's supporters via e-mail and text messages, are a vivid reminder that the president's campaign is likely to raise significantly less than Mitt Romney and Republicans for the third month in a row in July.
Neither campaign has released their fund-raising totals for the month yet. They are required to report those totals to the Federal Elections Commission by Aug. 15. 
In the meantime, the result is a Democratic campaign that is trying to portray the sitting president as a financial underdog whose ability to stay in the White House depends on the largess of his army of everyday supporters.
"My upcoming birthday next week could be the last one I celebrate as President of the United States, but that's not up to me -- it's up to you," Mr. Obama said to his supporters in an e-mail late last week.
Accompanying the e-mail was a link to donate in exchange for a chance to attend his "birthday get-together" in August.
The dire hand-wringing is partly tactical for a campaign that is likely to have more than enough money to execute its strategy. By appearing desperate, Mr. Obama's campaign hopes it can persuade more of its supporters to donate now, rather than later. 
But in fact, Mr. Obama is facing a quandary his 2008 campaign team never even contemplated: a rival whose fund-raising operation appears better positioned to tap into both the deep pockets of wealthy donors and the economic frustrations of average Americans.
In May, that translated into a $17 million edge for Mr. Romney. The next month, the Republican candidate and the party apparatus took in $37 million more than Mr. Obama and the Democratic party structure.
And that understates the advantage that Mr. Romney could have in the fall campaign as well-financed outside political groups pour hundreds of millions of dollars into ads against the president.
In briefings with reporters, Mr. Obama's campaign predicted total spending on Mr. Romney's behalf of $1.25 billion. "Make no mistake, we will be outspent," a top adviser to Mr. Obama said at a Washington briefing for the media in July.
Regardless of the real impact on Mr. Obama's campaign operations, there's an image problem to worry about.
The appeals for donations occasionally recall the "Everything 80 percent off! Going out of Business" sales that try to entice customers into the store. And yet, Mr. Obama's campaign team has clearly calculated that it is willing to risk leaving that kind of impression if it means raising more money.
One of the many e-mails sent by the Obama campaign to supporters on Monday had the subject line: Romney defeats Obama?
The e-mail from Mr. Biden warned that such a headline might be possible on the day after the election if supporters don't dig deep into their pockets now.
"Don't let anyone convince you that this is a sure thing -- our opponents have almost unlimited resources at their disposal, and we already know they'll outspend us by a good amount," Mr. Biden warned. "What we do now decides the headlines on November 7th."
Not to be outdone, Mr. Romney's campaign manager forwarded Mr. Biden's e-mail to the Republican's list of supporters, describing the vice president's appeal as "quite telling."
"We've had enough of the scare tactics and blame games from President Obama and the Democrat attack machine," Matt Rhoades, Mr. Romney's campaign manager, wrote. "Americans want real solutions and a real leader -- not more excuses and unmet promises."
Mr. Rhoades's solution: "Donate $10 or more to make sure the headlines read correctly in 100 days."

HEADLINE: Poles Apart

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Zlotys of luck. 

 BODY:
So on the third leg of his foreign tour, Mr. Bean Mitt Romney lavished praise on the Polish economy. It wasn't quite as big a blooper as his praise for Israel's single-payer-plus-price controls health care system, but it wasn't good.
For one thing, Poland has substantially bigger government than the US; in 2007, that is, pre-crisis, the Polish government spent 42 percent of GDP, compared with 37 in the United States. And despite what Romney claimed, there was no obvious trend toward smaller government; Polish spending as a share of GDP was about the same in 2007 as it had been in 2000.
Oh, and universal health care too.
Beyond that, there's a good explanation of Poland's relative resilience in the crisis compared with most of Europe: currency depreciation, or as Republicans put it, debasing the currency (note that a rise here is a fall in the zloty):
When capital was flowing into the European periphery, Poland responded with appreciation rather than inflation -- and when the capital flows dried up, Poland quickly regained competitiveness with depreciation, rather than having to rely on slow, grinding "internal devaluation".
So actually Poland's success suggests that (a) big government isn't so bad (b) sometimes its good to debase your currency.
Doesn't anyone tell Romney to do his homework?

HEADLINE: Indian Conglomerate Buys New York's Plaza Hotel

BYLINE: NEHA THIRANI


HIGHLIGHT: The acquisition is the latest in a string of Indian purchases of foreign hotels. 

 BODY:
The storied Plaza Hotel in New York is the latest buy for Sahara India Pariwar of Lucknow.
The Plaza, whose first guest in 1907 was Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, heir to the Vanderbilt industrial empire, has been struggling in recent years after a conversion into condominiums. It took nearly seven years to convert the units, and buyers - who spent as much as $50 million on their homes - complained about the quality of the renovations.
But on Monday, the Plaza's owner, Elad Properties, a real estate company owned by the Israeli businessman Yitzhak Tshuva, said the Sahara group had agreed to buy a controlling stake in the property for $570 million. Elad has a 60 percent stake in the hotel, and Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holdings owns the rest. Once the deal is completed, Kingdom Holdings' stake will be reduced to 25 percent. The hotel will continue to be managed by Fairmont Hotels & Resorts.
Financial analysts said the hotel should be viewed as more than a "trophy asset."
"I think it is a well-thought-out business decision," said Praveen Chakravarty of AnandRathi Financial Services. "Looking at the hospitality market in Europe and the United States and the valuations available, it makes sense for anyone with liquid cash to spare to pick up assets, be patient, do some cross synergies and wait for the market to rejuvenate."
The Sahara group is cash-rich, he added, and the deal is not expected to harm the company's finances.
This is not the Sahara group's first overseas hotel acquisition. In December 2010, the company purchased the iconic Grosvenor House Hotel in the Mayfair area of London from the Royal Bank of Scotland for $726 million. The company plans to add an Indian restaurant, nightclub, spa and swimming pool to the hotel, which will continue to be managed by Marriott International. The group has also reportedly bid 750 million, or $1.18 billion, for a group of Marriott hotels in London being offered by the Royal Bank of Scotland, though it has not confirmed that bid.
"Both the Plaza Hotel in New York and the Grosvenor House Hotel in London are both extremely prestigious properties in very attractive markets," said Sudeep Jain, executive vice president of Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels. "New York and London are gateway cities of the world and financial capitals, so the group strategy would seem to be acquiring prized assets in prized markets."
Also in New York, the Sahara group is reportedly about to acquire the Dream Downtown Hotel from the Indian-American hotelier Sant Singh Chatwal. The Sahara group's chairman, Subrata Roy, is reported to have made a formal offer for an 85 percent stake in the hotel, valued at $100 million. The Sahara group is also said to be interested in other high-end iconic hotel properties in New York, like the Four Seasons, the Mandarin Oriental and the Waldorf-Astoria.
The Sahara group did not make an executive available for comment.
The group is not alone among Indian hotel companies looking to expand their business overseas. Indian hoteliers like the Oberoi Group and Indian Hotels Company Limited, which operates the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, have had an established international presence for many years, and other Indian companies have rushed into the market recently.
The availability of Indian capital, along with a slowdown in the hotel industry in Europe and the United States, which has caused a drop in property values, has accelerated this, analysts said.
"It has become more prevalent for Indian capital, both hoteliers and investors, to evaluate foreign hotel assets," Mr. Jain said. "Certain markets could be more attractive than deals available in India at the moment because of the state of the economy and different business cycles."
In April, New Delhi-based Bharat Hotels, which operates the Lalit brand of hotels, acquired Lambeth College building, a heritage property in London, for an undisclosed amount. The property, which will be reopened in three years, is being developed into a luxury boutique hotel. The group already has a project under development in Koh Samui, Thailand. The Indian Hotels Company acquired the Ritz Carlton in Boston in 2007 and renamed it the Taj Boston. In April this year, the company has also said to have renewed attempts to increase its stake in Orient-Express Hotels, an international hotel chain.
"There seems to be a sudden realization by Indian entrepreneurs that they can run hotels better than some of their counterparts abroad," said Mr. Chakravarty. The Nadathur Group, founded by N. S. Raghavan, is buying hotels in Australia and Indonesia, he said, and intends to run them.
"There seems to be something about the hospitality business that so many Indian entrepreneurs feel that they could do a better job at it than their Western counterparts," he added.
Sahara India Pariwar, founded in 1978 by the billionaire Subrata Roy, has interests in finance, infrastructure, real estate, media and entertainment, manufacturing and information technology. In 2004, Time magazine famously called the Sahara group India's second-largest employer after the railways. The company also owns a 42.5 percent stake in Force India, the Formula One Team, and the Pune Warriors, an Indian premier-league cricket team.
"The Sahara group has shown an inclination to be in high-profile, consumer-facing businesses," Mr. Chakravarty said.
The company also recently announced that it would own one of the six franchises of the proposed Hockey India League and is said to be close to purchasing a controlling stake in DigiCable, a cable TV distribution company, to enhance its interests in the Indian television business.

HEADLINE: Crunch Time for the Euro - Again

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Officials of the eurozone's central bank meet in Frankfurt tomorrow in the latest effort to salvage the single currency. But will Germany go along with a pledge by the bank's president to "do whatever it takes"? 

 BODY:
LONDON - Sorry to drag you away from the Olympic Games, but reports from the euro frontline indicate that this week could be crunch time for the single currency - again.
"We've reached a crucial point," according to Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister and chair of the group of 17 euro zone finance ministers. "There is no time to lose."
It is a familiar refrain in the sorry saga of a euro crisis that has stumbled from bad to worse despite a series of ostensibly make-or-break summits since the Greek debt bomb exploded in late 2009.
Mr. Juncker was speaking at the weekend ahead of a meeting on Thursday of the European Central Bank, whose president, Mario Draghi, last week pledged the institution would "do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And, believe me, it will be enough." 
Markets rallied on just those words, then plummeted on the realization that Mr. Draghi might not be able to deliver, particularly in the face of German-led opposition to proposals that would allow the E.C.B., in effect, to buy the most vulnerable euro zone economies out of the crisis.
My colleague Stephen Castle, reporting on the latest grim jobless figures - yet another record - from the euro zone, describes Thursday's E.C.B. meeting as "a gathering upon which many hopes have been pinned for a decisive new intervention to stem the crisis."
The hopes include those of a U.S. administration frustrated by a European debt crisis that is putting a brake on a global economic recovery. 
President Barack Obama phoned Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister, to lend his support to "decisive action to resolve the crisis." That sentiment was echoed by Timothy F. Geithner, the U.S. Treasury secretary, in an interview published on Wednesday on the eve of the E.C.B. meeting.
Mr. Geithner wants to see lower interest rates and more credit for vulnerable European economies like Italy and Spain as they struggle to institute reforms. No European leader would disagree with that. But how to accomplish it?
Rendezvous reported a week ago on support for a proposal that would allow the euro zone's rescue fund to borrow from the E.C.B. as part of a strategy for lowering the borrowing costs of states now facing dangerously high interest rates.
Speculation surrounding that option, coupled with Mr. Draghi's upbeat remarks, eased the pressure on Italian and Spanish bonds. France, Italy and others support a plan to give the rescue fund - the European Stability Mechanism - access to unlimited E.C.B. funds.
But the proposal has been rejected by German officials and politicians who see it as a scheme to print money and fuel inflation. 
Referring to the key component of the proposal, which is to grant the bailout fund a banking license, Germany's finance ministry said the E.S.M. did not need such a license and the matter was not even being discussed.
The Bundesbank, the German central bank, has also reiterated its opposition to alternative measures to ease the pressure on vulnerable economies by allowing the E.C.B. to buy up those countries' bonds.
(Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, by the way, has sensibly gone off on a hiking vacation in the Alps.) 
The expectations - and the divisions - surrounding the E.C.B. summit look likely to produce a nail-biter when the bank's council members meet in Frankfurt. A Reuters headline summed it up: "E.C.B. on course to act strongly or disappoint mightily."
Mr. Monti says Europe is starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. Let's hope it is not the light of the debt train approaching head on.

HEADLINE: New Romney Ad Hits Obama on Layoffs After Auto Bailout

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Seeking to pierce one of President Obama's strongest arguments, Mitt Romney highlights an auto dealer who lost his business after the bailout. A new Obama spot also hits a traditional Republican strength: military spending. 

 BODY:

The Obama campaign often sums up the president's accomplishments like this: "Osama bin Laden is dead. General Motors is alive."
But Mitt Romney, whose campaign has struggled to overcome his "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt" op-ed, is no longer ceding the bailout ground. In an ad running in Ohio to coincide with President Obama's trip there Wednesday, the Romney camp contends that "in 2009, under the Obama administration's bailout of General Motors, Ohio dealerships were forced to close."
The spot, financed in part by the Republican National Committee, features Al Zarzour of Lyndhurst, Ohio, voice shaking as he recounts receiving "a letter from General Motors. They were suspending my credit line. We had 30 some employees that were out of work."
The Obama campaign did not struggle to craft a response.
"Let's get this straight - the very person who argued for the U.S. auto industry to go bankrupt, something that would have caused more than a million jobs lost and utter economic devastation in the Midwest, is now trying to attack the president on how it was handled?" said Frank Benenati, a regional spokesman for the Obama campaign, in an e-mailed statement loaded with statistics about the industry's recovery. He added that there are "now 2,200 more Ohioans employed in dealerships than when the president took office."
How would Mr. Zarzour's dealership have survived under Mr. Romney's approach? There's no way to know.
"The course I recommended was eventually followed," Mr. Romney argued in a February 2012 op-ed. "GM entered managed bankruptcy in June 2009 and exited it a month later in July." However, he argues that "crony capitalism" related to the bailout dictated the terms of the bankruptcy proceedings.
Meanwhile, a new spot released Tuesday by the Obama campaign shows Mr. Obama being bullish on a point where Republicans are typically stronger. Titled "Worried," the ad seeks to tie Mr. Romney not only to George W. Bush's economic policies, but also to the former president's hawkishness.
The ad opens with a narrator saying, "You watched, and worried: Two wars. Tax cuts for millionaires. Debt piled up."
The spot, which is running in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and Ohio, then notes Mr. Romney's plans to cut taxes for the wealthy and "increase military spending," both of which, the campaign claims, would increase the deficit.
Likewise, the Romney campaign had no trouble drafting a response, which noted trillion-dollar deficits before adding: "President Obama's plans to raise taxes and cut the military won't create jobs or make us safer. As president, Mitt Romney will revive our economy, strengthen our military and repair the damage done to the middle class by President Obama's failed policies."

HEADLINE: Republicans Would Interrupt Recess, On Their Own Terms

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: House Republican leaders say they would be willing to interrupt the August recess to address fiscal issues - but not for a deal that would raise taxes on those with high incomes. 

 BODY:
House Republican leaders - on the verge of a monthlong August recess - told the Senate they stand ready to pull the House back into session to reach agreement on legislation to avert the expiration of tax cuts and the imposition of across-the-board defense cuts set to begin in January. 
But they again declined to accept tax increases as a part of the solution, referring instead to "common-sense spending cuts and reforms."
"Congress must take action to eliminate both the threat to our economy posed by the looming small-business tax hike and the threat to our security posed by the defense sequester," House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and the three other top Republican leaders wrote. "By the end of this week, the Republican-led House will have acted to eliminate both threats. The Democratic-controlled Senate must follow suit. In the event the Senate takes action, we stand ready to bring the House back into session for the purpose of enacting solutions."
Republicans in recent days have been raising alarms about the "fiscal cliff" next year, when $235 billion in tax cuts lapse and about $100 billion in automatic defense and domestic spending cuts kick in - trying to make sure Democrats get the blame if the nation goes over the cliff. The legislation that created the automatic spending cuts was passed last year with bipartisan support - including the votes of the Republican leadership - to resolve the impasse over raising the nation's borrowing limit. The Bush-era tax cuts were structured intentionally in 2001 and 2003 to expire all at once.
But House Republicans have passed legislation this year to stop the first year of defense cuts by shifting them to domestic programs. And on Wednesday, the House is expected to pass legislation extending all the Bush-era tax cuts for a year.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, has held firm, demanding that Republicans meet his terms for a deficit reduction deal that unwinds the defense cuts in part through tax increases on the rich.
"We can avoid these defense cuts tomorrow if Republicans have millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share," Mr. Reid said Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Obama Heads to Ohio Battleground, Again

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama will make stops in north-central Ohio and plans to discuss "the choice in this election between two fundamentally different visions of how to grow the economy, create middle-class jobs and pay down the debt," according to his campaign." 

 BODY:
MANSFIELD, Ohio - As polls in this battleground state and nationally continue to show voters split over President Obama's stewardship of the economy, Mr. Obama on Wednesday is making his ninth visit this year to Ohio to contrast his vision for the nation's future with that of his Republican rival, Mitt Romney.
In stops here in Mansfield and in Akron in north-central Ohio, an area that Mr. Obama only recently visited during a campaign bus tour, the president planned to "discuss the choice in this election between two fundamentally different visions of how to grow the economy, create middle-class jobs and pay down the debt," according to his campaign.
But Mr. Obama was flying, literally, into a controversy in Mansfield that Republicans, led by Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a potential running mate for Mr. Romney, were only too happy to fan. According to local media, Air Force One was landing at an air base that is home to the 179th Air National Guard Wing, which would be mothballed under the Obama administration's proposed postwar reductions in Pentagon spending.
Mr. Obama is expected to repeat his call for Republicans in Congress to agree to extend the Bush-era tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, on annual income of less than $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for individuals, and to drop their insistence that the lower tax rates be extended as well for income above those thresholds. While higher taxes for the wealthiest taxpayers are central to Mr. Obama's broader deficit-reduction plan for the coming decade, Mr. Romney is calling for an additional $5 trillion in tax reductions over 10 years beyond the Bush tax cuts and has not said how he would offset the revenue loss to reduce the federal debt.
Mr. Obama has a six-percentage-point advantage over Mr. Romney in Ohio according to new polls of several battleground states for Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News. But while independent voters strongly support Mr. Obama in next-door Pennsylvania, those in Ohio and in Florida - where the president will campaign on Thursday - are split between the candidates and just over half of independents in those states say they disapprove of Mr. Obama's job performance.
Even so, more voters in Ohio also said Mr. Romney's experience as a private-equity manager has been too focused on making profits for investors and not enough on creating jobs. That reflects the abundance of negative ads that the Obama campaign and a independent "super-PAC" supporting the president have run in swing states to define Mr. Romney as an out-of-touch multimillionaire who puts personal profits over jobs for average Americans.
In time for Mr. Obama's latest visit - the 25th in his presidency, according to the count of CBS White House reporter Mark Knoller, who keeps such records - his campaign is broadcasting a new ad titled "Worried" that draws parallels between Mr. Romney's agenda for increased military spending and tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations, and the major policies of the Bush administration in the past decade.
"You watched, and worried," a voice says in the ad, which also is running in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire. "Two wars. Tax cuts for millionaires. Debt piled up. And now we face a choice." The ad then segues from those Bush-era policies to Mr. Romney's military spending and tax cut proposals.
Local media in Ohio reported on Tuesday that voters were lined up for blocks to get tickets from campaign field offices for Mr. Obama's appearances.

HEADLINE: As Banking Titans Reflect on Their Errors, Few Pay Any Price

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Prominent financial figures now see the wisdom of breaking up megabanks. This admission, as well as any debacles on their watch, seems to cost them absolutely nothing in fashionable society. 

 BODY:
Like a defecting Syrian colonel or converted climate-change denier, Sanford I. Weill has been heartily welcomed among those on the right side of history.
The sheer inappropriateness of the vessel, the breathtaking audacity of the messenger, can oddly confer authority on an idea. If even the creator of Citigroup now believes that the giant banks should be broken up, who could not believe it?
His belated conversion is only the latest from the "corner office to Zuccotti Park" banking crowd. The former merger aficionado Philip J. Purcell, who headed up the pithily named Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover, wrote a recent Wall Street Journal opinion article suggesting that shareholders should break up the banks. Sallie Krawcheck, a former top-ranking Wall Street executive, recently criticized big banks. Two other former top executives, David H. Komansky and John S. Reed, have attacked the current financial system.
These converts tend to have followed a similar path. They participated in the merger frenzy and pushed deregulation when the getting was good. They departed from finance's sweet embrace sometimes involuntarily, ousted in power struggles. And they stayed quiet, or did little, throughout the debates on how to fix the system when the nation was struggling over the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul.
That's when it would have mattered.
Those who are left defending the banking status quo are on an island. These are current bank executives - who can be counted on to change their views the instant they lose out in the corporate race and are booted from the organization with engorged severance packages - and the politicians and lobbyists who love them.
And so what? Supporters of change can win all the intellectual arguments they want; the structure of the financial system remains intact.
As every frustrated American knows, no major banking executive has gone to prison or has been fined any significant amount in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
But what's astonishing is that Wall Street bankers seem not to have paid any social cost either. They sit on corporateand nonprofit boards and attend functions and galas. They remain top Wall Street executives, or even serve as regulators. The nation's prominent op-ed pages, talk shows and conferences seek their opinions. If you are rich, you must be intelligent. Your views must be worthwhile, never mind the track record.
The embrace of Mr. Weill sets a new standard for reputation rehabilitation.
Some disagree that he played a central role in creating the modern financial system that blew up the world economy. Perhaps. But these people must concede that he failed on his own terms as a businessman.
Sandy Weill was a deal maker who aspired to more. He had a vision to create a financial supermarket. The scrappy public school graduate from the streets of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn realized his dream and created Citigroup.
And it didn't work.
Mr. Weill's only unambiguous success was to make himself enormously rich.
By the mid-2000s, Citigroup was a flop. The business synergies never materialized and the stock was lagging. Its chief executive then, Charles O. Prince, was divesting divisions. In 2007, investors and analysts called for the very sort of breakup that Mr. Weill now endorses. Then the financial crisis hit and the government had to bail out the behemoth Mr. Weill created.
His institution had also served as a (unheeded) harbinger of the banking rot to come. Throughout the 2000s, Citigroup was riddled with scandal. It settled with the Federal Trade Commission over deceptive practices. Its CitiFinancial unit was embroiled in predatory lending controversies before it was fashionable. The bank was an entwinedbackerof both Enron and WorldCom. Citigroup employedJack Grubman, who was at the heart of the research conflict-of-interest scandals of the early 2000s. Even back in his less reflective days, Mr. Weill had to apologize for that.
Things got so bad that the otherwise somnolent Federal Reserve actually bannedCiti from making any more acquisitions while it sorted out its mess.
What's a guy gotta do around here to lose a little credibility?
Our society wasn't always this way. In Edith Wharton's novel "The Age of Innocence," set in the 1870s, the arriviste Julius Beaufort's bank fails (it appears not to be fraud, just recklessness). Mr. Beaufort is banished from New York society for a generation.
After the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, major Wall Street figures populated prisons, not presidential advisory panels. The head of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Whitney, who hailed from one of the most patrician families in America, went to Sing Sing for embezzlement.
In 1936, Roosevelt gave his famous speechlisting reckless banking and speculation among the "enemies of peace." These enemies hated him and he asserted, "I welcome their hatred."
It wasn't just rhetoric. F.D.R.'s appointees "were neither impressed by, nor subservient to, bankers," said Eric Rauchway, a historian from the University of California, Davis. Roosevelt appointed people like William O. Douglas, the future Supreme Court justice, as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He threatened to nationalize the stock exchange.
No such situation for us today. Our meager lot is to celebrate when these guys change their minds.

HEADLINE: Political Gymnastics

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: A little bit on the campaign, a lot about the Olympics. 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, I feel compelled to discuss Mitt Romney in Europe, but before we get to that, let's try a happier topic. How are you feeling about the Olympics?
One of the many things I like about the Olympics is that it evens the fan playing field. I speak for those of us who labor under the feeling of inferiority that comes with realizing that virtually everybody else in the country knows more about baseball and football than we do. Now, suddenly, the subject is water polo or rhythmic gymnastics, and everybody's on the same level.
David Brooks: Gail, you only say that because you don't know how much time I've spent memorizing the fine points of women's rhythmic synchronized weight lifting. Though as for gymnastics, I have to admit that if I were a judge I'd base my entire score on whether they take a little step at the dismount or not. Everything else looks exactly the same to me.
Gail: Also, I like hearing the kayak commentator saying that one of the competitors "comes from a paddling family." I like the weird dramas, like the outrageous clock issues in the fencing, and the Korean fencer who staged a sort of a sobbing sit-in when she lost her match and who, I just heard, is now being given a sportsmanship award. 
Plus, I like the obscure sports. And the underdog countries. I like hearing the announcer screaming, "Lithuania Wins!"
David: I do find myself slightly rooting against the U.S. if we're up against a country that never wins medals, like India. But generally, I get swept up in the jingoistic fever. I loved the triumph of the American women's gymnastics team, and especially the way the clinching floor routine was done to the tune of Hava Nagila, though as somebody noted, it would have been more impressive if she'd done a winning routine to the tune of the Mourner's Kaddish.
In any case, Aly Raisman gave us the greatest display of Jewish-American gymnastics since Kerri Strug.
Gail: Most of all I like the way the country sort of takes a vacation from the normal news cycle during the Olympics. We get to stop talking about the economy and devote our time to arguing about whether the rower from Niger should really have been allowed to compete in the games if he'd never been in a boat until a couple of months ago.
David: I agree, I hate the way they keep interrupting my hatred of Ryan Lochte with news about the civil war in Syria. Lochte's interviews would go better if he did them underwater.
Nonetheless, I sense that you are about to take us back to reality.
Gail: I am holding it against Mitt Romney that he's been forcing us to pay attention to his international tour when we should only have been thinking about Tim Phelps. Romney's an Olympics guy. You think he'd have the courtesy to leave us alone until the torch is snuffed out. Look at Barack Obama. Nobody has any idea what he's been up to since the Olympics started.
David: I think you mean Michael Phelps. Tim Phelps is the guy who was denied gold after a horrible leash asphyxiation accident at the Westminster Dog Show.
Gail: Oh Lord. Sorry. I think Tim Phelps was a character in "The Wire."
David: As for Romney, I do sort of resent this trip, especially the way he pretended not to care about the dressage outcome. I can't imagine there were too many aides who supported the idea of him going abroad when all the big issues were at home.
Gail: I was totally freaked out by Romney's behavior abroad. As you may have noticed, I'm not a big fan. But throughout the primaries I always thought of him as the potential non-crazy nominee. This trip made me rethink that.
David: Even I was a bit alarmed. The comments in London were true, but since when did Mitt Romney start speaking frankly, and why do it at the most inopportune moment possible?
Gail: Obviously the business of dissing the preparations for the Olympics in London was trivial, but being a good guest shouldn't have been all that hard to manage. It's not that tricky to know that when you're in England for the London Olympics, you're supposed to say that you're sure it's going to be a great show. When he got to the part about how he wanted to wait and see if the British would manage to "come together" for the celebration, I really began to have my doubts about whether we could trust this guy to host a White House dinner, let alone negotiate treaties.
David: As an out and out Anglophile, I'm kind of disgusted by the way both these candidates diss the British. Whenever a president comes into office, he declares he's going to rebalance our foreign policy toward some richer country, like Germany or China. But then when the you-know-what hits the fan, it turns out the Brits are the only country that really reacts the way we do. They remain our closest ally save maybe Canada. Show some respect.
Gail: Israel was more serious. An American president has to be able to continually reaffirm our commitment to Israel's security while also prodding the Israelis and the Palestinians back toward a peace settlement. He has to assure the Islamic world that while we're Israel's partner, we're not going to ignore the concerns of the rest of the Middle East. To go to Israel with your big donors in tow and make a speech insulting the Palestinians while you make it clear that you'll recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital just plays into all the feelings of isolation and rage in the region. It makes life more dangerous for the Israelis, and diplomacy more difficult for the Obama administration.
David: I don't think the recognizing Jerusalem as the capital part was at all unusual. Most Democratic candidates spend the weeks before the New York primary promising to move the Israeli capital to Amman. The insulting the Palestinians part was more serious.
I went to a lunch with Romney with a few other journalists in 2007 and he talked a bit about the controversy between Jared Diamond and David Landes. I was super impressed that he knew about it. That's what he rolled out again here, emphasizing that, with Landes, he tends to think that culture (by which I assume he means values and institutions) matters most in determining the relative wealth of nations.
Gail: I knew you were going to like the Diamond-Landes part.
David: But I completely agree with your general point. The problem is that it doesn't really apply to the Palestinians. Whatever one thinks of the situation in the Middle East, they have been living under some pretty horrific restrictions from the Israelis and they have been saddled with a spectacularly inept government of their own. Moreover, the Palestinians are one of the most industrious peoples in the region. I would not hold them up as an example of the Landes thesis, as Romney did. It was obtuse. And it did make you wonder how much his clumsiness would hurt him if he was elected.
Gail: O.K., I'm done ranting. But did you notice that Mitt was so eager to extol everything Israeli he even praised the health care system? Which is way more socialist than anything Barack Obama ever dreamed of. That's right up there in dog-on-the-roof territory.
David: You had to rub that in, didn't you? I've been up several nights in a row with nightmares since that opening ceremony dance in honor of the National Health Service. In my nightmare, Obama is re-elected, Chicago finally gets the Olympic games and the entire opening ceremony is a Lady Gaga homage to the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform law, complete with giant inflatable blimps of its co-sponsors.

HEADLINE: Obama, in Ohio, Attacks Romney Over Tax Cuts

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama attacked Mitt Romney's proposal to cut taxes for individuals and businesses by more than $5 trillion over the next decade. 

 BODY:
MANSFIELD, Ohio - As polls in this battleground state and nationally continue to show voters split over President Obama's stewardship of the economy, Mr. Obama on Wednesday attempted to contrast his vision for the nation's future with that of his Republican rival Mitt Romney.
At his first stop here in north-central Ohio, in a small park against a backdrop of small businesses, Mr. Obama faced more than 2,000 supporters and offered an attack on Mr. Romney's proposal to cut taxes for individuals and businesses by more than $5 trillion over the next decade. The president would take the same message next to Akron, and is to go to Florida on Thursday.
Mr. Obama cited a newly released study from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint effort of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, two Washington-based policy research organizations. It concluded that the sort of tax code that Mr. Romney has proposed "would provide large tax cuts to high-income households, and increase the tax burdens on middle and/or lower-income taxpayers."
Mr. Obama said: "Ohio, we do not need more tax cuts for folks that are already doing really well. We need tax cuts for working Americans."
Speaking loudly and emphatically, Mr. Obama singled out the study's finding that if Mr. Romney erased enough existing tax breaks to offset the revenue loss from his proposed tax cuts, so that his plan did not add to budget deficits, the changes would shift $86 billion of tax burden away from the high-income taxpayers and onto everyone else. And the tax breaks to be reduced or repealed include the deductions and credits for mortgage interest, college tuition and health insurance.
"This wasn't my staff, this wasn't something we did," Mr. Obama said. "Independent group ran the numbers."
The Romney campaign quickly dismissed the study as partisan, noting that one of its three authors had been on the staff of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. The Tax Policy Center is widely respected, however, and is used often as a resource by members of both parties in Washington.
Mr. Obama was flying, literally, into a controversy in Mansfield that Republicans, led by Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a potential running-mate pick for Mr. Romney, aggressively fanned. Before his arrival the local media noted that Air Force One was landing at an air base that is home to the 179th Air National Guard Wing, whose C-27J aircraft were being mothballed under the administration's proposed postwar reductions in Pentagon spending.
But en route to Mansfield, Mr. Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, told reporters on Air Force One that the Pentagon would work to find a new mission for the roughly 800 guardsmen at the base - news that Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat facing re-election in Ohio, trumpeted in a news release but that the Romney campaign attacked as a politically motivated flip-flop.
Mr. Obama repeated his call for Republicans in Congress to agree to extend the Bush-era tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, on annual income of less than $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for individuals, and to drop their insistence that the lower tax rates be extended as well for income above those thresholds. Higher taxes for the wealthiest taxpayers are central to Mr. Obama's broader deficit-reduction plan for the coming decade, along with reductions over 10 years in so-called entitlement programs like Medicare.
Mr. Obama has a six-percentage-point advantage over Mr. Romney in Ohio, according to new polls of several battleground states for Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News. But while independent voters strongly support Mr. Obama in next-door Pennsylvania, those in Ohio and in Florida - where the president will campaign on Thursday - split between the candidates and just over half of independents in Ohio and Florida say they disapprove of his job performance.
Even so, more voters in Ohio also said Mr. Romney's experience as a private-equity manager had been too focused on making profit for investors and not enough on creating jobs. That reflects the abundance of negative ads that the Obama campaign and a "super PAC" supporting it have run in the swing states to define Mr. Romney as an out-of-touch multimillionaire who puts personal profits over jobs for average Americans.
In time for Mr. Obama's latest visit - his ninth in 2012 and his 25th in his presidency, according to the count of the CBS White House reporter Mark Knoller, who keeps such records - his campaign is running a new ad titled "Worried" that draws parallels between Mr. Romney's agenda for increased military spending and tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations and the major policies of the Bush administration in the past decade.
"You watched, and worried," a voice says in the ad, which also is running in Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and Colorado. "Two wars. Tax cuts for millionaires. Debt piled up. And now we face a choice." The ad then segues from those Bush-era policies to Mr. Romney's military spending and tax cut proposals.
But the Romney campaign also was running a new ad, only in Ohio, that sought to turn against Mr. Obama an issue that has been a big help to the president to date - the government's successful rescue of the auto industry - and to blunt the disadvantage Mr. Romney has for having opposed that bailout.
The ad featured a man in Lyndhurst, Ohio, whose auto dealership was among those that General Motors closed as part of its downsizing. "It was like the dream that we worked for and that we worked so hard for, was gone," the man says.
Local media in Ohio reported on Tuesday that voters were lined up for blocks to get tickets from campaign field offices for Mr. Obama's appearances. Also on hand Wednesday in Mansfield was a large Romney bus in which volunteers made phone calls to potential supporters, according to Chris Maloney, a spokesman for the Romney campaign in Ohio. And about 30 protesters supporting both Mr. Romney and the former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul heaved anti-Obama signs and chanted "Shame on you, Barack Obama."

HEADLINE: Dooh Nibor

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney, reverse Robin Hood. 

 BODY:
Update: And the Romney people respond with deep voodoo, invoking the supposed fabulous growth effects from his tax cuts. And who could argue? Remember how the economy tanked after Clinton raised taxes? Remember how great things were after Bush cut them? Oh, wait.
More seriously, we have lots of empirical work on the effects of tax changes at the top -- and none of it supports the Romney camp's claims. What we've just learned is that they were faking it all along. There is no plan to offset the tax cuts; Romney is just intending to blow up the deficit to lavish favors on the wealthy, then use it as an excuse to savage Social Security and Medicare.
Lots of justified talk today about a new Tax Policy Center report on the distributional implications of the Romney tax plan, showing it to be very much a Dooh Nibor - that is, reverse Robin Hood - thing. Obama is talking it up; Romney, predictably, is dismissing the report as the work of a "liberal group".
The question one might ask is, did TPC - which is actually painstakingly and painfully nonpartisan - make questionable assumptions to get its results, so that some other set of assumptions might portray Romneynomics in a more favorable light? And the answer is no: TPC actually bent over backwards to literally give Romney every possible benefit of the doubt.
Here's what they did. They took Romney at his word that he plans to offset his cuts in income tax rates by broadening the base, that is, limiting exemptions and other loopholes. They also assumed, however, that Romney would not be willing to tax dividends and capital gains as ordinary income, since he has made it clear that he opposes any rise in taxes on investment income. As they point out, this leaves a relatively small pool of loopholes to close - big enough that the Romney tax cuts could, in principle, be paid for by base broadening, but not with a lot of room to spare.
So which loopholes are closed? TPC made the most Romney-friendly assumption they could - namely, that base broadening is concentrated on top incomes as much as possible. First you eliminate all deductions that benefit those with more than $1 million in income; then all that benefit those with between $500,000 and $1 million; and so on.
The key point is then that even if you do this, the tax cuts Romney gives high-income Americans are bigger than the loopholes he could conceivably close:
This means that even on the most favorable assumption, the Romney plan would give the rich big tax cuts on net - which means that to be revenue-neutral, it must raise taxes on Americans making less than $200,000 a year. 
So they're actually giving Romney every possible benefit of the doubt - and still his plan is a redistribution from the middle class to the rich. In practice it would surely be much worse.
I'll be curious to see how all this gets reported. The TPC results are ironclad; there is no valid Romney counterargument except to say that he doesn't really mean all that stuff about actually making up for lost revenue. My guess is that the stories will nonetheless be he said/she said, but maybe I'll be favorably surprised.

HEADLINE: Campaigns' Rapid Response Efforts Get a Little More Rapid

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's campaign began a new Twitter and Tumblr account to quickly rebut what it views as inaccurate information coming from President Obama's campaign. 

 BODY:
Follow @RomneyResponse for the latest on @BarackObama's failed record, his campaign's false attacks, and our response.
 - RomneyResponse (@RomneyResponse)1 Aug 12
Mitt Romney's campaign began a new Twitter account, @RomneyResponse, and Tumblr blog on Wednesday to quickly point out online what it views as false information promoted by President Obama and his campaign team, along with inaccuracies made in reports from mainstream news media organizations.
"We are committed to using these tools to communicate accurate information to our supporters and to reporters quickly," said Ryan Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Romney's presidential campaign.
As part of the campaign's rapid response operation, the Twitter account got to work shortly after its first post at 7 a.m. Eastern, raising questions about Mr. Obama's visit and speech in Ohio. 
The Twitter account posted an update about the airfield where the president was landing, with a link to the campaign's new Tumblr page, noting that 700 jobs at the base are threatened under proposed defense cuts.

 - RomneyResponse (@RomneyResponse)1 Aug 12
Updates on the Twitter account also tried to refute a newly released report that Mr. Obama cited in his speech, which concluded that Mr. Romney's tax proposal "would provide large tax cuts to high-income households, and increase the tax burdens on middle and/or lower-income taxpayers."
As the campaign works on putting together a detailed response, the Twitter account said that Mr. Obama incorrectly referred to an analysis of Mr. Romney's tax proposal as being independent when one of its authors is a former White House staff member.
Today in Ohio @BarackObama cited a study authored by a former staffer, claimed it wasn't written by "my staff". WATCH: http://t.co/EHYvCuma
 - RomneyResponse (@RomneyResponse)1 Aug 12
In the world of real-time responses, Lis Smith, who leads the rapid response team for the Obama campaign, wrote to Mr. Williams on Twitter, saying one of the other authors had worked in the Bush administration.
.@RyanGOP Bill Gale, the other co-author, was a senior staff economist on George H.W. Bush's CEA http://t.co/ltbjgoFi
 - Lis Smith (@Lis_Smith)1 Aug 12
Then, Danny Kanner, the deputy director of Mr. Obama's rapid response team, jumped in, posting on his Twitter account that the Romney campaign had cited the Tax Policy Center in an attack on Gov. Rick Perry of Texas last November.
.@RyanGOP BETTER: On 11/4, Romney camp attacks @GovernorPerry citing "Nonpartisan Tax Policy Center" and its"Objective, 3rd Party Analysis"
 - Danny Kanner (@DannyKanner)1 Aug 12
The two campaigns have been aggressively using Twitter to woo supporters, deliver messages and raise money. And now Twitter is tracking voter sentiment every day, called the Twitter Political Index. In its initial finding, the "#Twindex," for short, shows Mr. Obama with a score of 34 and Mr. Romney with 25, based on tweets posted on Tuesday and analyzed by Topsy.
The Romney campaign's beefed-up Twitter presence comes after some supporters complained that Mr. Romney did not do enough to push back on criticism of his recent trip to Europe and Israel or fight hard enough against a Newsweek magazine cover calling him a "wimp."
In a post on Breitbart.com, the columnist John Nolte offered the Romney campaign some suggestions on how to effectively use the account, starting with getting up at 4 a.m. to begin reshaping the daily narrative driven by the mainstream news media and enlist the army of Republicans on Twitter to jump in and help.
"Reward your army with links and retweets," Mr. Nolte suggests. "Once you flood the zone with your predicted narratives, cover-ups, and challenges for the day, throw some love to those online who help you get the truth out. This can start a snowball effect that spreads the truth far and wide."
The Twitter account, however, was silent about a new video, titled "#RomneyShambles: Welcome Back, Mitt" and posted on YouTube by the Democrat-run response team. It features clips from local news organizations, highlighting Mr. Romney's missteps during his trip abroad. 
Mr. Williams dismissed the YouTube attack as another example of the Obama campaign's attempts to "distract from the president's record and to make this race about anything other than his failed record on jobs and the economy."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Slips After Fed Comments

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wall Street closed lower and the dollar rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve stopped short of offering new monetary stimulus even as it acknowledged that the United States economic recovery has lost momentum so far this year.
Equities and the euro had gained lately on increased expectations central banks in the United States and Europe would take aggressive steps to stimulate their respective economies and contain a spreading debt crisis in Europe.
The Fed said after a two-day meeting it was prepared to do more to support an ailing economy but it disappointed some market expectations by taking no new action. Many economists had expected the Fed to push back its guidance for when it might start to raise interest rates but it stuck with its ''late-2014'' language. 
Attention now turns to a European Central Bank decision on Thursday. President Mario Draghi heightened speculation of further bank purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds when he said last week he would do ''whatever it takes to preserve the euro.''
''Kind of a disappointment. The market was hoping for more news on (quantitative easing) or a longer time frame for not raising rates,'' said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the Convergex Group in New York.
''It was very status quo at a time when people are saying the economy is getting worse,'' he said. ''We have to now hope that the E.C.B. will come in with aggressive moves.''
Fed officials described the economy as having ''decelerated somewhat,'' a change of tone from its previous assessment in June when it said the economy had been ''expanding moderately.'' Policy makers also reiterated their disappointment with high unemployment.
The MSCI world equity index fell 0.2 percent to 315.46.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down about 32 points, or 0.3 percent, at 12,976 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-share index fell 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.7 percent.
''They did absolutely nothing here. It suggests there is a lot of internal debate going on in the Fed,'' said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities in New York.
Earlier, a computer glitch at market maker Knight Capital caused a surge in volume in about 150 share listings at the market's open. Knight said in a statement that it was advising traders to execute their trades elsewhere, and the company's shares were hammered, falling 31.3 percent to $7.10, at least a seven-year low.
European shares ended up 0.5 percent.
Investors shrugged off data showing the that United States private sector added 163,000 jobs in July, topping economists' expectations of 120,000. The report from payrolls processor ADP came two days ahead of Friday's more important monthly government nonfarm payrolls report for July.
Also on Wednesday, surveys showed American and euro zone factory activity struggled again in July while Chinese manufacturing fell to an eight-month low, as economies around the world showed signs of slowing.
In government debt trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 19/32 in price, with the yield at 1.5325 percent.
The dollar rallied as the Fed offered few clues about near-term policy easing. The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.2233. The dollar gained 0.5 percent to 78.48 yen.
The dollar index rallied 0.5 percent to 83.077.
But analysts said further dollar gains should be limited ahead of the European Central Bank policy announcement on Thursday.
''I do not expect follow-through U.S. dollar buying given the proximity to the ECB meeting where policy expectations are far from calm,'' said Alan Ruskin, head of G10 FX strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.
One of the biggest critics of the ECB buying more government bonds, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, said governments overestimated the capacity of the central bank and placed too many demands on it.
Brent crude settled at $105.96 a barrel, gaining $1.04. United States crude settled at $88.91, gaining 85 cents. Prices drew support from data showing a bigger-than-expected drawdown in crude stockpiles last week.
Spot gold fell to $1,601.60 an ounce.

HEADLINE: These Things Were My Things

BYLINE: By ALEXANDRA JACOBS

 BODY:
THE young woman was hovering anxiously as a shop clerk at the new Manhattan outpost of Beacon's Closet, a small chain of consignment stores that began in Brooklyn, sorted through a large duffel bag stuffed with her possessions.
Out for inspection came a pair of sunglasses by a brand called Salt, obscure at least to the clerk, the slacker cartoon heroine Daria made flesh. ''They're sort of like Oliver Peoples?'' put in the hopeful consignor as the moment of judgment lingered. And then, a tad desperately (and ineffectively), ''I got them at a sample sale.'' 
Being not only hot, but the most popular season for moving homes, summer is when even the most committed clotheshorses tend to molt. Factor in the listless economy and the occasional twinge of eco-consciousness and it's no wonder consignment stores are bustling right now, even as designer discounters like Filene's Basement and Daffy's collapse -- and even though the experience of selling one's used clothes, as parodied on ''Portlandia,'' can be humbling, if not downright humiliating.
The Union Square area, where Loehmann's continues to hang on by a purse strap, has become a veritable Secondhand Alley, partly because of its proximity to the fickle youth of N.Y.U.; partly, I would argue, because of the glut of Marc Jacobs boutiques in the West Village.
Indeed you can't swing a cat in Beacon's without hitting a Marc Mistake-obs like a gray safari dress with yellow necktie ($44.95) or the boxy red shoulder-buttoned T-shirt that I picked up in a rash moment at Saks a few years ago, one of the few items to be plucked for resale by the staff member from my own sad sack. (I chose not to supervise the sorting process, though I couldn't help but notice Daria smiling with fond condescension over another top I'd had altered, as if it were a mildly injured child, before placing it in the reject pile.)
The new branch achieves more glam than its counterparts over the river, with fleur-de-lis wallpaper, button-mobile chandeliers, credits issued on refillable plastic cards rather than mimeographed slips, fedoras galore and a clientele that includes models and Europeans, two of whom were causing some trouble at the till.
''I have a feeling they're trying to return something,'' moaned a cashier to her manager, fanning her damp neck. In a place where you might luck into lightly worn red Marni flats for $59.95 or a J Brand taupe silk jumpsuit for $29.95, neither second thoughts nor effective air-conditioning are part of the bargain.
The sweat flows even faster several blocks northwest at Fisch for the Hip, where you have to buzz not only for entrance but exit, as if the owner, a former Barneys buyer named Terin Fischer, fears you might make a dash for the IRT with a four-figure scarlet Vuitton Epi tucked under your arm. Possibly this and worse crimes have happened; I overheard Ms. Fischer discussing a check forgery with one consignor in low tones, as two spaniels nipped protectively about her heels.
The sense of having stepped into a couture crime novel is enhanced by her shrouding many goods in plastic body bags, like corpses; and a lot of black, including a lace bubble skirt by the now-defunct label Tuleh, identical to one I'd scored a few years ago at the Park Slope Beacon's for $20, marked here at $300.
I summoned the courage to release a Balenciaga pleated red-white-and-blue wool spaghetti-strap dress ($1,000!) from its casing and maneuvered it into one of the small dressing rooms, where the mirrors are small and high, forcing one to emerge for a better look.
''I've been waiting for someone to have the nerve to try that on,'' Ms. Fischer said, swooping by. ''I applaud you.'' Perhaps it's to her credit that she didn't also try to sell it to me.
A HAPPY medium between Beacon's and Fisch is down the street at the Chelsea location of Ina. There are three other Inas downtown, plus one for men, which may be why they know what they're doing in this neighborhood: the dressing rooms are generously sized and cooled, the racks aren't packed to the rafters and the sales help greets visitors warmly. On a recent visit, a red-dot sale was bringing prices in line with what management consultants like to call ''current reality.''
With a little iPhone help, I calculated the price of a taupe embellished Prada skirt that would be quite at home in the current Met exhibition: around $150, ditto a pair of nude and pointy platform ''Loubs.'' The cuts were just ever so slightly off, the clothes inhabiting that uncertain purgatory between current and vintage, but they seemed sound enough investments. Just be careful of the unmarked stair that bisects the store, lest you compound the day's chagrin with a face plant.

HEADLINE: Strong Yen Is Dividing Generations in Japan

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
SHIZUOKA, Japan -- As Japan has ceded dominance in industry after industry that once lifted this nation to economic greatness, there has been plenty of blame to go around. A nuclear disaster that raised energy costs. A lack of entrepreneurship. China's relatively cheap work force.
Increasingly, however, business leaders point to a problem that is at least partly within the government's power to control: a high yen that has made Japanese products, from televisions to memory chips, prohibitively expensive abroad. In an echo of a debate that raged in the United States in the 1980s, the government faces growing criticism for doing almost nothing to rein in the yen, despite alarm that the record-high currency is dealing crippling blows to the country's once all-important export machine.
One big reason, analysts and some politicians say, is simple, if generally left unsaid: A high yen benefits Japan's rapidly expanding elderly population, even if it hurts other parts of the country. 
By speeding the flood of cheaper imported products into Japan, the strong yen is contributing to deflation, a broader drop in the prices of goods and services that has helped retirees stretch their pensions and savings. The resulting inaction on the yen, according to a growing number of economists and politicians, reflects a new political reality, with already indecisive leaders loath to upset retirees from the baby boom who make up more than a quarter of the population and tend to vote in high numbers.
''Japan's tolerance of the strong yen and deflation is rooted in a clash of generations,'' said Yutaka Harada, a professor of political science and economics at Waseda University in Tokyo. ''And for now, the seniors are winning.''
That victory comes at a high price, however, hastening the hollowing out of Japan's industrial base as companies continue to move abroad, exacerbating the nation's two-decade-long economic stagnation.
On Monday, the government released the final draft of a new economic strategy that it contends will help break what it described as a vicious cycle of a strong yen and deflation. But even though the long-awaited plan identifies the heart of the problem as Japan's aging population and declining export prowess, analysts said the government's modest approach fails to take on the entrenched interests, including the elderly, that have long stood in the way of fundamental change.
Japan can trace the start of the yen's latest rise to the worldwide economic panic that began in the United States and spread to Europe. Just before the first tremors of the American housing crisis appeared in 2007, the exchange rate stood at 123 yen to the dollar, as the Bank of Japan kept interest rates low to stimulate growth, and money flowed out of Japan in search of higher returns.
After the crisis began, raising doubts about the soundness of American and European banks and the ability of governments to stand behind them, the tide of money reversed. Japan, with its huge security cushion of domestic savers, became a haven for investors, driving the yen up.
The yen hit a postwar high of about 76 to the dollar in February and today remains not far from that level, trading Wednesday around 78 to the dollar. It would not be easy to reverse the value of Japan's currency; worldwide macroeconomic trends currently favor a strong yen. Nor are most experts suggesting that consideration of the elderly is the only cause of political paralysis over how to revitalize the economy.
But breaking that stalemate is becoming harder as the elderly's political clout grows. Even some retirees reveling in the benefits of the government's inaction see the long-term quandary.
Shigeru Ono, a retired oil company manager who won a small following blogging on deflation's virtues, can tick off the strong yen's advantages, including lower prices for shirts made in Vietnam and the Chinese flat-screen television he bought recently. He is also clear on the perils.
''The strong yen and deflation have been a boon for us baby boomers,'' said Mr. Ono, 62, who is living on limited savings and a fixed monthly pension of 130,000 yen, or about $1,660. ''But I also know that they cannot be good for my son's generation.''
The office of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has defended the government's handling of the currency, not only by presenting its new plan, but also by pointing out that companies have been offered $6 billion in subsidies to help them move into higher-end products less affected by competition from other Asian exporters.
The Finance Ministry, meanwhile, has taken small steps to drive down the yen by buying a total of $200 billion worth of United States currency during the last two years. But officials said its efforts were never intended to do more than blunt surges driven by speculators.
A more effective step, economists said, would be for the Bank of Japan to essentially turn on the printing presses, encouraging the currency's value to drop. The Federal Reserve has done just that in response to the financial crisis and the economic weakness in the United States, keeping down the dollar's value and helping to foster a strong rise in American exports.
Critics say the central bank's entrenched bureaucrats have resisted doing something similar in recent years out of an outdated fear of rekindling the rampant inflation in the value of real estate and other assets of the 1980s bubble economy. But the bank argues that it makes little sense to intervene without longer-range economic fixes, like deregulating protected domestic industries to spur competition.
As such debates rage on, the supercharged yen bolsters the ability of Japanese to buy foreign goods and to travel abroad, but continues to eat away at the foundations of the economy, hurting companies from mighty Toyota to small ones like Kyouwa, a manufacturer of factory automation equipment in rural Seki, west of the rust-belt city of Shizuoka.
Kyouwa's second-generation owner, Ryuji Usuda, said he finally decided, after he lost an important Japanese customer last year to a Korean rival, that he had no choice but to move his production line to a new factory in Vietnam. He said the plant would allow him to make machines for 30 percent to 40 percent less than in Japan.
''Pretty soon, nothing will be made in Japan anymore,'' said Mr. Usuda, 40, who noted that many of the Japanese factories he supplied were also moving to Southeast Asia.
Last year, the influx of products from abroad contributed to Japan's first annual trade deficit in 31 years.
Some members of Parliament, including some from the governing party, have become worried enough to begin organizing a sort of political insurgency, proposing ways to fight the strong yen. But they have made little headway in changing the underlying political calculus.
''The strong yen robs from youth, but there is not much awareness here yet of generational inequalities,'' said Keiichiro Asao of the opposition Your Party.
One way to spur such awareness, critics say, would be to allow national pension payments to drop with falling consumer prices, as the law demands. But the government ignored the law for years rather than upset elderly voters.
Last year, it finally took a baby step, slightly trimming pension payments. The loss of just a couple of dollars a month, though, was enough to start Mr. Ono, the blogger, rethinking. ''Now I am starting to realize that deflation can be bad, too,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Banking Titans Reflect on Errors, Few Pay Any Price

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. E-mail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
Like a defecting Syrian colonel or converted climate-change denier, Sanford I. Weill has been heartily welcomed among those on the right side of history.
The sheer inappropriateness of the vessel, the breathtaking audacity of the messenger, can oddly confer authority on an idea. If even the creator of Citigroup now believes that the giant banks should be broken up, who could not believe it?
His belated conversion is only the latest from the ''corner office to Zuccotti Park'' banking crowd. The former merger aficionado Philip J. Purcell, who headed up the pithily named Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover, wrote a recent Wall Street Journal opinion article suggesting that shareholders should break up the banks. Sallie Krawcheck, a former top-ranking Wall Street executive, recently criticized big banks. Two other former top executives, David H. Komansky and John S. Reed, have attacked the current financial system. 
These converts tend to have followed a similar path. They participated in the merger frenzy and pushed deregulation when the getting was good. They departed from finance's sweet embrace sometimes involuntarily, ousted in power struggles. And they stayed quiet, or did little, throughout the debates on how to fix the system when the nation was struggling over the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul.
That's when it would have mattered.
Those who are left defending the banking status quo are on an island. These are current bank executives - who can be counted on to change their views the instant they lose out in the corporate race and are booted from the organization with engorged severance packages - and the politicians and lobbyists who love them.
And so what? Supporters of change can win all the intellectual arguments they want; the structure of the financial system remains intact.
As every frustrated American knows, no major banking executive has gone to prison or has been fined any significant amount in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
But what's astonishing is that Wall Street bankers seem not to have paid any social cost either. They sit on corporate and nonprofit boards and attend functions and galas. They remain top Wall Street executives, or even serve as regulators. The nation's prominent op-ed pages, talk shows and conferences seek their opinions. If you are rich, you must be intelligent. Your views must be worthwhile, never mind the track record.
The embrace of Mr. Weill sets a new standard for reputation rehabilitation.
Some disagree that he played a central role in creating the modern financial system that blew up the world economy. Perhaps. But these people must concede that he failed on his own terms as a businessman.
Sandy Weill was a deal maker who aspired to more. He had a vision to create a financial supermarket. The scrappy public school graduate from the streets of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn realized his dream and created Citigroup.
And it didn't work.
Mr. Weill's only unambiguous success was to make himself enormously rich.
By the mid-2000s, Citigroup was a flop. The business synergies never materialized and the stock was lagging. Its chief executive then, Charles O. Prince, was divesting divisions. In 2007, investors and analysts called for the very sort of breakup that Mr. Weill now endorses. Then the financial crisis hit and the government had to bail out the behemoth Mr. Weill created.
His institution had also served as a (unheeded) harbinger of the banking rot to come. Throughout the 2000s, Citigroup was riddled with scandal. It settled with the Federal Trade Commission over deceptive practices. Its CitiFinancial unit was embroiled in predatory lending controversies before it was fashionable. The bank was an entwined backer of both Enron and WorldCom. Citigroup employed Jack Grubman, who was at the heart of the research conflict-of-interest scandals of the early 2000s. Even back in his less reflective days, Mr. Weill had to apologize for that.
Things got so bad that the otherwise somnolent Federal Reserve actually banned Citi from making any more acquisitions while it sorted out its mess.
What's a guy gotta do around here to lose a little credibility?
Our society wasn't always this way. In Edith Wharton's novel ''The Age of Innocence,'' set in the 1870s, the arriviste Julius Beaufort's bank fails (it appears not to be fraud, just recklessness). Mr. Beaufort is banished from New York society for a generation.
After the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, major Wall Street figures populated prisons, not presidential advisory panels. The head of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Whitney, who hailed from one of the most patrician families in America, went to Sing Sing for embezzlement.
In 1936, Roosevelt gave his famous speech listing reckless banking and speculation among the ''enemies of peace.'' These enemies hated him and he asserted, ''I welcome their hatred.''
It wasn't just rhetoric. F.D.R.'s appointees ''were neither impressed by, nor subservient to, bankers,'' said Eric Rauchway, a historian from the University of California, Davis. Roosevelt appointed people like William O. Douglas, the future Supreme Court justice, as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He threatened to nationalize the stock exchange.
No such situation for us today. Our meager lot is to celebrate when these guys change their minds.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Law to Strengthen Our Cyberdefense

BYLINE: By ASHTON B. CARTER and JANE HOLL LUTE. 
Ashton B. Carter is the deputy secretary of defense and Jane Holl Lute is the deputy secretary of homeland security.

 BODY:
Washington
OVER the last decade, the United States has built a sophisticated security system to protect the nation's seaports against terrorists and criminals. But our nation's critical infrastructure is not similarly secured from cyberattack. Although we have made progress in recent years, Congressional action is needed to ensure that our laws keep pace with the electronically connected world we live in. The bipartisan Cybersecurity Act of 2012, currently before the Senate, offers a way forward.
A disruption of our electric grid or other critical infrastructure could temporarily cripple the American economy. What's less well known is that such an attack could threaten the nation's defense as well. 
Ninety-nine percent of the electricity the military uses comes from civilian sources. Ninety percent of military voice and Internet communications travel over commercial networks. Much of the country's military logistics are handled by commercial shippers who rely, in turn, on privately managed networks.
As we protect our ports and coastlines, so must we marshal resources and techniques to mount an adequate defense of our networks. Our port security is ensured by a combination of the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, state and local governments, and private shipping companies and port operators, with the support of the Navy and the intelligence agencies. Together, they patrol American waters, scan cargo, analyze and share information about threats to our coastlines, and report suspicious behavior to the proper authorities. If any of these layers were to be removed, our defenses would be weakened.
Effective cybersecurity requires a similar multilevel approach. We have a final line of cyberdefense in the Defense Department's Cyber Command, which defends the nation against advanced cyberattacks, and we have a strong cyberintelligence system in the National Security Agency, which detects cyberthreats from overseas. But we need additional levels of defense to protect the nation's critical infrastructure.
Collective problems require collaborative solutions. The government and private sector must work together to prevent cyberdisruption, cyberdestruction and theft of intellectual property. This requires robust sharing of information between the government and private sector, aggressive prosecution of cybercriminals, and cooperation among federal agencies.
Simply put, the Cybersecurity Act would help by enabling the government to share information about cyberthreats with industry. The legislation would also permit the private sector to report cyberintrusions to the government or private companies. That ability would increase awareness of cyberthreats, while leaving the private sector in control of which information is shared. It would do all of this while protecting privacy and civil liberties, through robust oversight and accountability measures.
None of us want to see heavy government regulation, especially of the Internet, the fount of so much innovation and economic productivity. The legislation would provide meaningful baseline cybersecurity standards for industry, developed and adopted through a joint industry-government process.
Although the American economy needs effective cybersecurity measures to function and prosper, many providers of critical infrastructure have not invested in basic strategies to defend themselves against cyberthreats. Meaningful standards will help drive companies to invest and help fill the gaps in our nation's cyberdefenses.
Finally, the Cybersecurity Act would ensure that the Department of Homeland Security has the ability to protect federal networks and assist the private sector effectively and efficiently, by strengthening the department's legal authority.
The Department of Defense stands ready to support the Department of Homeland Security and any other agency in protecting the nation's critical infrastructure. Together, our two departments can bring our technical ability to bear and improve the nation's stock of cybersecurity tools and technology.
This legislation is a critical step for defending America's infrastructure against the clear and present cyberthreats we face. We're not going to solve this problem overnight; it will involve a learning experience for both the private sector and the government, but we must learn fast, and develop solutions as quickly as possible. The legislation will help pave the way to American security and prosperity in the information age. It deserves the full support of Congress and the American people.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Sector Falls for a Second Straight Month

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Manufacturing in the United States contracted for a second consecutive month in July, further evidence of an economy growing at a sluggish pace.
At the same time, a private survey showed that businesses kept hiring at a modest pace in July, suggesting a possible improvement in the job market. 
The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said Wednesday that its index of manufacturing activity ticked up to 49.8, from 49.7 in June, but a reading below 50 indicates contraction. In June, the survey showed manufacturing contracted for the first time in three years.
The reading points toward more slow growth, but not another recession. The trade group says the index needs to fall below 43 to signal that a recession is likely.
The July report also showed factories hired at a slower pace than in June, while new orders declined more slowly. And export orders fell to the lowest level since April 2009, evidence of slower global economic growth.
Manufacturing has been a main source of growth in the United States since the recession ended in June 2009. But in recent months, factory activity has weakened along with the broader economy.
Job growth has slumped and American consumers and businesses have reduced spending, lowering demand for factory goods. Europe's economic difficulties and slower growth in China, India and Brazil have reduced demand for American exports.
Jeremy Lawson, an economist at BNP Paribas, said in a note to clients that the softness in manufacturing ''does not bode well for growth in the second half of the year.''
Separately, the payroll services provider ADP said in a report on Wednesday that businesses added 163,000 jobs in July. That is a modest gain and slightly below the company's estimate of 172,000 in June.
The report covers hiring in the private sector only, which excludes government job growth. The Labor Department will offer a more complete picture of July hiring on Friday.
The ADP National Employment Report offered some hope that hiring was picking up. But it has often deviated sharply from the government report.
In June, the Labor Department said employers added just 80,000 jobs, less than half the figure reported by ADP.
Economists are forecasting that the July employment report will show that employers added only 100,000 jobs, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate will probably remain stuck at 8.2 percent.
A gain of 100,000 jobs would be an improvement from the monthly average of 75,000 added from April through June. But it would still be far below the healthy pace of 226,000 jobs a month from January through March.
Also on Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose for a third consecutive month in June.
Construction spending rose 0.4 percent in June following an upwardly revised 1.6 percent gain in May that was the biggest one-month increase since December.
The June advance pushed construction spending to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $842.1 billion, up 12.9 percent from a 12-year low hit in February 2011. Still, the level is approximately half of what economists consider to be healthy.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Still Grows in China, but More Slowly

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's economy continued to show signs of slowing Wednesday after an important measure of the nation's economic growth weakened.
China's official factory purchasing managers' index slipped to 50.1 points in July, a slight drop from June's reading of 50.2 points and the lowest figure in eight months, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. 
The figures showed that while factory output was growing slightly, new orders and exports were declining. A reading above 50 points indicates growth; one below 50 signals contraction.
''This is not the bump that the authorities are looking for,'' analysts at IHS Global Insight said in an economic report issued early Wednesday.
Concerned about the stagnating economy -- the world's second largest after the United States -- China's leaders have moved in recent weeks to shore up growth by using policy-easing measures and increasingly strident rhetoric.
The government has cut interest rates twice in the last two months and announced a series of bold spending packages aimed at reviving construction and government projects, such as the nation's high-speed rail system.
Beijing has also allowed its currency, the renminbi, to weaken against the dollar in recent months, in what seems to be an effort to aid struggling exporters. However, that has not helped exports to Europe, as the renminbi has not weakened against the euro and demand on the Continent remains soft.
Beijing is also supporting new local government spending proposals, pushing the state sector back into a role it played after the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis.
Back then, an extensive government-backed economic stimulus package drove a surge in state construction projects and buoyed the Chinese economy.
But a year into the recovery that followed, there were growing concerns among state officials and economists that China had spent too aggressively, and may have damaged its long-term prospects by encouraging a huge buildup in local government debt and feeding a property bubble.
Even with worries that China's banks may have been damaged by that lending spree, the government seems to be returning to the surest way to spur growth: pump up government spending.
As the country prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition in Beijing, President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao -- who are both expected to step down -- have become more vocal in their support of government spending initiatives.
Analysts, though, have warned that such efforts could aggravate longstanding imbalances in the economy. But in a nation where government spending is the leading driver of growth, policy makers seem to think there is no other option.
In recent months, China's industrial profits have slipped and capital has been flowing out of the country, putting greater pressure on local governments and the banking sector. And while property prices have begun to rebound, that seems unlikely to revive growth or stabilize the labor market.
Factories in the biggest export zones have begun laying off workers. Also on Wednesday, in a separate measure of manufacturing activity, a purchasing managers' index published by HSBC showed that while overall July output increased slightly from June, new manufacturing orders declined.

HEADLINE: Needles, Threads and New York History

BYLINE: By JEAN APPLETON. 
Jean Appleton is a jewelry historian.

 BODY:
THE garment district, a roughly rectangular swatch of Manhattan between West 35th and 42nd Streets and Seventh and Ninth Avenues, was once the bustling epicenter of America's clothing design and manufacturing industry. While its boundaries fluctuated over the decades, the garment district, as a culture and as an idea, had resonance in areas much larger than its physical size: its hundreds of thousands of workers -- including my father, David Dubinsky, the long-serving president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union -- were the living embodiment of New York's working-class economy, whose sweat and long hours draped the shoulders of the rest of the country.
Sadly, thanks to outsourcing and technological progress, there are few garment workers in today's garment district. The area's business leaders have proposed changing the district's name -- which appears on maps, city documents and signs and in the everyday chatter of the city -- to something trendier in order to attract designers, high-tech companies and other ''creative'' sectors. 
But dumping ''garment district'' would be a mistake. Not only would it denigrate the city's history, but it would also make New York less attractive in all the ways that draw new people, companies and ideas to the city in the first place.
The garment district, in its heyday, was much like the theater district along nearby Broadway. ''Curtain going up'' was the challenge faced every season by the gamblers and risk takers who owned the firms that ''showed'' four times a year, if not more.
It was a place where glamour met the factory floor. You could see a legendary movie star exiting one building just as an emissary from the first lady entered, both with a similar mission.
The toniest address in the district was 550 Seventh Avenue, known to insiders simply by its street number. ''550'' meant the top, the stars: Trigere, Simpson, Norell, McCardell. The building next to it was occupied mainly by coat and suit producers, some as elite as the ''550'' designers, and the row continued down to the more anonymous producers in more anonymous buildings.
The real action, though, was on the side streets, populated by the myriad businesses needed to produce a garment, making everything from fabric to pins and needles. There machines and people worked day and night filling the orders left by buyers from across the country.
I remember pushing my way through the hundreds of master cutters and patternmakers who crowded the sidewalk along 38th Street at lunchtime, dodging the hand trucks carrying stylish garments that later appeared on the backs of women from east coast to west.
This is what the words ''garment district'' meant. Every one recognized the garment district not just as a geographic designation, but also as a living entity.
All that hard work meant something, far beyond the production of clothing and profits. It meant political power, labor power. My father, as the president of the I.L.G.W.U., could insist that presidential spouses wear ''Made in the U.S.A.'' labels -- and they'd listen.
When John F. Kennedy ran for president in 1960, he made sure to stop by the garment district, where he addressed tens of thousands of union workers along 38th Street, with stars like Tallulah Bankhead and Janet Leigh beside him on the podium.
These days, there aren't enough garment workers remaining in the district to justify a presidential whistle-stop, and it's rare to see men pulling racks of samples down 38th Street. City Hall would like to see other, more lucrative industries move in, while the Fashion Center Business Improvement District, the neighborhood business association, is soliciting suggestions for a new name for the area and has suggested calling it the ''fashion district.''
Doing so, however, would eviscerate the pulsating history of the place. It would pretend that the district was only ever about the final product, about the retail shops along Madison Avenue. Today ''fashion'' is the red carpet, Conde Nast, it is Schiaparelli and Prada at the Metropolitan Museum. The phrase ''garment district,'' by contrast, evolved from the blood and muscle of labor's bodies.
Renaming the garment district would do more than offend our city's history. It would dissociate this historic entity from its unique qualities and significance in the life of New York City. It would erase a vital part of New York's past.
The garment district, even after the last fabric store has closed shop, should keep its name, so that it can inspire New Yorkers for years to come.

HEADLINE: A Budget Crisis Averted, for Now

 BODY:
Members of Congress used to be embarrassed when they could not perform their basic job of passing spending bills and instead had to finance the government with a series of short-term resolutions. But such patchwork has now become commonplace, and it is a sign of Washington's profound dysfunction that the short-term agreement reached on Tuesday came as a relief to both sides. 
House and Senate leaders settled on a deal to keep the government running through March, preventing it from shutting down when the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. With Congress polarized and paralyzed by the coming election, no regular appropriations bills have been enacted, and none will be before the deadline.
The prospect of a shutdown was a real one because House Republicans broke an agreement that they had reached with the Senate last year on the size of the federal budget for the 2013 fiscal year. In settling the debt-ceiling crisis last year, the two chambers passed a measure setting discretionary spending at $1.047 trillion for 2013. But to make one of its periodic points about excessive spending, the House recklessly chopped $20 billion off that amount in March, much of which would have come out of Head Start, Pell grants and state aid.
At the time, many House conservatives said that they relished a confrontation with the Senate, hoping the threat of a shutdown would give them the cuts they wanted. After all, it worked the year before when Republicans cynically used the deadline to wring nearly $40 billion in cuts from the 2012 budget. The withdrawal of that much spending helped neutralize the stimulative effects of the previous year's payroll tax cut, keeping the economy stagnant.
The difference this year is the November election. Wiser Republican leaders knew that a shutdown crisis in September would leave a bad taste with voters, many of whom (correctly) tend to blame these kinds of things on their party. So the lawmakers agreed on a continuing resolution that will keep the spending limit at $1.047 trillion -- far lower than it should be when the economy needs a boost, but at least it's not making things worse. The White House signed on, and the resolution is supposed to be passed after the August recess.
Both parties are hoping the outcome of the election will give them an advantage when the agreement has to be renegotiated next year. But stalemate is still the most likely outcome as long as voters keep electing Republican lawmakers who are unwilling to compromise on spending and taxes. Representative Steven LaTourette of Ohio, one of the few moderate Republicans left in the House, made that clear on Tuesday when he said he couldn't take it anymore and would not seek re-election after nine terms.
''There are people on the right and the left who think that if you compromise you're a coward, you're a facilitator, you're an appeaser,'' he said, adding that ''people are more interested in fighting with each other than they are in getting the no-brainers done and governing.''
That kind of common sense will be missed.

HEADLINE: A Doctor Shortage and the Health Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Doctor Shortage Likely to Worsen With Health Law'' (front page, July 29) raises the timely issue that we are quickly spiraling toward a physician shortage. One thing that must be done is increase the number of residency positions in American hospitals.
Physician training has two distinct stages: medical school followed by a residency in a teaching hospital or academic medical center. But in 1997, Medicare capped compensated training positions. Hospitals that train more doctors than their cap pay the full cost, and this, coupled with reductions in reimbursement for charity care and other factors, is growing unaffordable. 
Furthermore, Medicare pays for only about a third of the full cost of training, so the financial stress is intensified.
While the article points out that medical schools are opening and will produce more graduates, this will only worsen the problem, as these promising young students graduate to find that there are not enough residencies for them to complete their training.
Congress and the Obama administration should increase financing for residency positions immediately. As the article points out, it takes 10 years to train a new physician, so there isn't a moment to lose.
STEVEN J. CORWIN New York, July 30, 2012
The writer, a cardiologist and internist, is chief executive of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.
To the Editor:
You do an excellent job of highlighting the problems in access to health care aggravated by the Affordable Care Act, and you correctly recognize that the problem is not limited to primary care. Indeed, a 2008 federal study of the physician work force projected a far more probable and extensive shortage of specialists than of primary care doctors.
Similarly, state medical association surveys demonstrate that the access to specialty care is usually just as marginal as in primary care. Again defying popular wisdom, surveys of graduating medical students show little correlation between student debt and specialty choice, casting doubt on the importance of earning disparities in driving students to the specialties.
Economics are still important, and the extensive provider cuts in the health care law and reliance on underfinanced Medicaid programs threaten the newly insured with the empty promise of coverage without care.
ALEXANDER A. HANNENBERG Newton, Mass., July 29, 2012
The writer is an anesthesiologist.
To the Editor:
Severe physician shortages have already hit children.
Children are struggling to get timely medical care, with some waiting almost four months for subspecialist appointments even in communities served by a children's hospital. These wait times, documented in a recent survey by the Children's Hospital Association, are a result of vacancies of 12 months or longer among key pediatric specialties.
Shortages of specialists affect the ability of families to obtain timely medical care for children in communities across the country.
The good news? Worsening shortages in pediatric care are not inevitable. Federal policy makers have the power -- and legislation on their desks -- to support needed training for tomorrow's pediatricians. Combined with efforts to protect Medicaid, it's possible to ensure that every child hears ''the doctor will see you now'' when she needs to most.
MARK WIETECHA President and Chief Executive Children's Hospital Association Alexandria, Va., Aug. 1, 2012
To the Editor:
Nurse practitioners can play a critical role in addressing the country's growing physician shortage.
With advanced degrees, they are skilled diagnosticians and clinicians who treat acute and chronic illness and prescribe medications.
Four decades of research show that nurse practitioners provide high-quality, cost-effective, comprehensive, patient-centered primary health care with excellent outcomes.
In a growing number of states, a nurse practitioner can own and operate an autonomous, independent practice, not requiring any physician involvement. But in too many states, antiquated laws prevent us from practicing to the full extent of our advanced education and clinical training.
Elected officials in affected states should work to remove these unnecessary barriers. Doing so will instantly increase access to quality health care, improve outcomes and make health care more affordable for all Americans.

HEADLINE: Local Finances in Peril, State Comptroller Warns

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Local governments across New York State are collecting less in taxes, burning through their cash reserves and running up deficits, according to a report released Wednesday by the state comptroller.
The report by the comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, cast long-term doubt on the financial health of many municipalities in the state, which are faced with anemic revenues and fewer remaining ways to cut costs.
And it offered another sobering prospect to local officials who have worried aloud in recent months that some of the state's largest city governments may soon be unable to make ends meet. 
In a telephone interview, Mr. DiNapoli said local governments were facing a ''perfect storm'' of financial pressures -- including diminished state aid, falling property values and sluggish collections of sales tax.
The result, according to the report, is that balance sheets across the state are, in many cases, unsound, and are likely to remain that way or worsen in the coming years.
In many ways, the comptroller's report echoed a study released last month by a task force of budget experts that concluded that the fiscal crisis facing state governments would linger even after the nation's economy recovered. Mr. DiNapoli said the same was true of local governments in New York State.
''The challenges that are being faced now are not just a short-term cycle that's going to turn around quickly,'' Mr. DiNapoli said. ''At least for the foreseeable future, there is a new reality, in terms of diminished revenues, and it's affecting every level of government.''
More local governments, the report said, are struggling to pay their bills on a day-to-day basis. Almost 300 local governments ended the 2010 or 2011 fiscal year -- or both -- with a deficit, and more than 100 do not currently have enough cash on hand to pay even three-quarters of their liabilities, Mr. DiNapoli's office found.
Even a city that is not facing immediate issues of solvency, the report said, is ''having a hard time maintaining the services its residents want and need'' as a result of widespread spending cuts over the past few years.
''No matter how you measure it, almost all cities in New York are stressed and have to work hard to keep their fiscal houses in order,'' the report said.
Mr. DiNapoli's study focused in part on the challenges facing local governments in coming up with the revenue they need. Peter A. Baynes, the executive director of the New York State Conference of Mayors and Municipal Officials, said mayors were increasingly desperate for new sources of revenue, like additional aid from the state or increases in local sales tax rates.
''They've done just about all they can do on the spending side of the equation, in terms of reining in expenses, consolidating departments and using attrition to not fill positions,'' Mr. Baynes said. ''All that's left for cities is to lay off employees that provide essential services.''
As he has in the past, Mr. DiNapoli urged local governments on Wednesday to embrace multiyear financial planning and to resist fiscal trickery as they seek to balance their budgets in the short term. The report said that poor record-keeping and other questionable accounting practices were serving, in some cases, to mask the extent of the governments' financial distress.
But Richard L. Brodsky, a former assemblyman who was a writer of a recent report on the troubled finances of Yonkers, said cities that had improved their financial planning and forsaken gimmicks found that within the next few years, they would be unable to close their projected budget gaps.
Mr. Brodsky predicted that ''New York will see what California has already seen,'' with localities simply unable to make the budget math work.
''You've got an unsolvable problem,'' he said, ''which logically takes you to the consequences of that, which are bankruptcy, bailout or control board. That's where the mayors are. That's the conversation they're having.''

HEADLINE: Fleet Sales Stall, And Automakers Report Results That Are Mixed

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Auto sales in the United States cooled off in July as the two biggest American carmakers, General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, reported declines that they attributed partly to lower sales to rental car fleets.
The drop in sales at G.M. and Ford were offset by strong performances at Toyota and Honda, which a year ago were struggling to overcome inventory shortages because of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
Over all, the industry reported sales on Wednesday of 1.15 million vehicles during July, which was an 8.9 percent improvement over the same period a year ago. 
That lags the 14.8 percent increase the industry recorded during the first six months of 2012. While sales are still on track to top 14 million vehicles for the entire year, analysts said growth appeared to be slowing somewhat.
''The good news is that demand is stable and it is not fueled by incentives and discounts,'' said Jesse Toprak, chief market analyst for the auto research Web site TrueCar.com. ''On the other hand, we're not seeing that blockbuster month.''
Industry incentives remained flat in July compared with the previous month, with an average discount per vehicle of about $2,200, according to Edmunds.com, an auto information site that compiles incentive data.
Most automakers said that truck sales slipped during July and car sales increased. Executives noted that consumers continued to be heavily influenced by the fuel economy of vehicles they purchase.
G.M., which will report quarterly earnings on Thursday, turned in the worst performance of any major automaker, selling 201,000 vehicles during the month, down 6.4 percent from a year ago.
Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze, a hot subcompact last July, plunged amid a surge of interest in the Honda Civic.
G.M. said its sales to retail customers rose slightly, but sales to rental car fleets fell 41 percent.
G.M. executives said that rental car deliveries dropped because more cars had been ordered earlier in the year. But the company is not expecting the falloff to be repeated.
''This was a one-month issue,'' said Alan Batey, who took over this week as G.M.'s interim head of global marketing.
Mr. Batey replaced Joel Ewanick, who resigned this week after the company said he had failed to meet its standards in negotiating a sponsorship deal with an English soccer club. Mr. Ewanick's departure raised questions about how G.M. might alter its marketing strategy to recoup lost market share.
''Fleet sales are part of the reason for G.M.'s lackluster results in July, but not the only reason,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''Some of their biggest sellers have lost momentum in the marketplace.''
However, Mr. Batey said G.M. would not change its marketing plans, including a recently introduced program that allows Chevrolet buyers to return new vehicles if they are not satisfied. ''There is no change in direction,'' he said. ''It's all about execution.''
Ford said its United States sales declined by 3.8 percent during the month to 173,000 vehicles. The company also cited soft rental car fleet sales as a prime reason for the drop.
Sales of Ford pickups fell 9 percent during the month, but the company enjoyed healthy sales of small cars and the new version of its Explorer S.U.V. ''Fuel economy continues to be a top consumer purchase driver across our lineup,'' said Ken Czubay, head of Ford's United States sales and marketing.
Other automakers were not as affected by cutbacks in rental car orders. Chrysler, the smallest of the Detroit automakers, said its sales in July increased 12.6 percent to 126,000 vehicles, as consumers continued to buy popular models like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler 200 sedan.
''July was another solid month for Chrysler as we again demonstrated our disciplined and methodical approach to growing sales and profits,'' said Reid Bigland, head of United States sales for Chrysler.
The big foreign automakers continued to gain market share with new models and improved inventory levels.
Toyota said its American sales climbed 26.1 percent during the month to 164,000 vehicles, and Honda reported a 45.3 percent increase to 116,000 vehicles. A year ago, both companies were hard-pressed to fill showrooms because of manufacturing and supplier problems in Japan.
The German carmaker Volkswagen reported a 27.5 percent increase in sales for its VW and Audi brands combined. The company is increasing production at its new plant in Tennessee to keep up with demand for popular products like the Passat sedan.
The auto companies generally agreed that sales would increase slightly this fall, particularly in pickup trucks.
''Signs of a housing recovery and good news on consumer confidence and household income should keep the light vehicle selling rate in the 14 million range and drive seasonally higher truck sales as we move toward fall,'' said Kurt McNeil, a senior United States sales executive at G.M.

HEADLINE: Tuning Out Olympic Edict

BYLINE: By ANDREW DAS and ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
LONDON -- One by one, the swimmers emerge poolside from behind a wall, making their way to the starting blocks at the Olympic aquatics center in a procession that combines the drama of sport, the staging of prime-time TV and the posturing of a fashion-show catwalk. This conspicuous scene, playing out many times a day at the London Games, has also become an international advertising bonanza for a product not usually associated with water sports: headphones.
Some swimmers dance or showboat as they walk across the pool's deck. Most acknowledge the crowd with a wave. But many more strut out coolly toward their lanes wearing headphones. These are rather massive headgear that, when twinned with mirrored goggles and the pounding beats of artists like Lil Wayne and Cash Money Millionaires, shut out all outside stimuli in the pursuit of perfect prerace concentration. 
Olympic officials are famously relentless in snuffing out any appearance of an unofficial sponsor at the Games; athletes are prohibited from posting Twitter messages about their individual sponsors, and even the brand logo on toilet-paper dispensers is covered with black tape lest anyone think Bay West is an official partner of the London Games. But the headphones on display at the aquatics center have so far evaded the brand police, surely to the delight of the companies that did not have to pay for their logos to be seen by millions of viewers around the world.
''It has enormous value,'' Mike Lescarbeau, chief executive of Carmichael Lynch, an advertising firm in Minneapolis, said about Olympic athletes being seen wearing the headphones. ''It's kind of the new world order. You are doing placement in real time.''
Many of the biggest names in the sport now walk to the starting blocks in headphones: Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps of the United States, Sun Yang of China and Park Tae-hwan of South Korea. Perhaps the most popular brand is Beats by Dr. Dre, which is from a company created by the rap star Dr. Dre, who was born Andre Young, and the music producer and entrepreneur Jimmy Iovine. The American Cullen Jones wears a hefty pair. Sun's Beats are a China red, though, one Chinese reporter said, he wears them only because he is copying his idol, Park.
The visibility of Beats by Dr. Dre at the London Games was no accident. The makers of the headphones created customized Union Jack headphones that were provided to many of the British Olympic athletes and provided standard models to athletes from many other teams, ensuring that viewers of everything from swimming to tennis to gymnastics would get long, repeated looks at them on television.
The buzz spread quickly on social media. A goalkeeper on Britain's soccer team, Jack Butland, wrote on Twitter, ''Loving my new GB beats by Dre,'' and later advised a fellow British athlete that the company's representatives were passing them out in the athletes' village. Phelps wears a futuristic pair made by an Oregon company, Sol Republic, that has also drawn covetous praise on social media.
Kevin Lee, chief executive of Sol Republic, said he did not know that Phelps would be wearing his company's headphones during the Games. He said he was thrilled, but not surprised, that so many Olympians were using premium models.
''I think they are wearing headphones because it sounds good and would put them in that zone,'' Lee said. ''They are getting their game face on through music.''
Iovine, the chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M, said in an interview that he was delighted to see so many athletes wearing Beats headphones. He said Beats had always had a close relationship with athletes, and he said he gave a pair of headphones to LeBron James before they were in stores.
''We realized that athletes need headphones and proper emotional sound as much as they need great sneakers and equipment,'' he said. ''We figured that out.''
It helps that the company supplied headphones to athletes from 19 countries, including the United States, Brazil, China, Germany and Russia.
''It's a really good thing, especially when they haven't been paid'' to wear them, said John Patroulis, chief creative for the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the ad agency, adding that he did not think it mattered that Beats sent free headphones to athletes.
''They don't have to wear them,'' he said. ''I think these guys get a lot of things. I think they are just showing that they think they are great.''
In creating the brand, Dr. Dre and Iovine essentially created a mass market for high-end headphones, which had previously been a small niche for audiophiles. They did so by combining celebrity cachet and sleek design with a sound that they maintain closely matches the recording studio (though some critics disagree).
Nonetheless, Beats headphones, which cost from $200 to $400, have been a runaway success even in a sluggish economy, and the company's fortunes have spawned a growing number of celebrity-endorsed competitors.
Premium headphones were 3 percent of the overall market in the United States, in units, in the second quarter of 2010; they were 8 percent in the second quarter of this year, according to Ben Arnold, director of industry analysis for the NPD Group, a market research firm.
''Beats has done a pretty good job of aligning itself not just with music artists but athletes,'' said Arnold, noting that professional and college athletes are often photographed with Beats dangling around their necks. ''That type of unofficial endorsement is hugely important. Whether it's intentional or not, it's very effective.''
Not everyone has been thrilled. Ella McSweeney, a television host for the Irish broadcaster RTE, wrote on Twitter that the headphones were an unnecessary barrier between the Olympians and the crowd. ''Take them off and soak up the atmosphere,'' she implored the swimmers.
''It's not a good look for all the fans who have traveled,'' McSweeney said Tuesday in a Twitter exchange with The New York Times, though she was quick to add that she considered it merely an irritant, not a problem.
''I'm a sports fanatic, and I just think there was something a bit depressing about it,'' she said. ''The stakes are so high, they are so young, but it's also important to remember the spirit of what sport is about: spreading the joy a bit.''
There has been speculation that the headphones could run afoul of the International Olympic Committee's Rule 40, which prohibits athletes from promoting unofficial sponsors during the Games. Athletes have long chafed at the rule, contending that it prohibits them from cashing in on two of the most high-profile weeks of their lives. Members of the American track and field team, including the sprinters Sanya Richards-Ross and Allyson Felix and the hurdler Lolo Jones, took part in a Twitter campaign this summer to protest the rule, but there seems to be little the I.O.C. can do to police something as personal as a pair of headphones.
Still, Jacques Rogge, the committee's president, said it was an important point of emphasis.
''We have to be careful because without these measures, there could be no sponsorships, and without sponsorships, there would be no Olympics,'' he told reporters.
His victory may be a pyrrhic one. When the track and field competition opens this week, fans will turn their attention from the pool to the track, and almost certainly to the sprinter Usain Bolt. Bolt has been known to favor Soul by Ludacris headphones adorned with the Jamaican flag.
They, too, were customized, perhaps with a wink at the I.O.C. rule book, with an image of Bolt on each ear, posing triumphantly.

HEADLINE: Riding Herd on G.O.P. Effort to Produce a Farm Bill in the House

BYLINE: By REBECCA BERG; Ron Nixon contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Representative Frank D. Lucas arrived in Washington in 1994, he was less concerned with building a name for himself around the Capitol than with quietly shaping the agricultural policy that is the bread and butter of his constituents in rural western Oklahoma.
Nearly two decades later, Mr. Lucas is the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and has found himself thrust squarely into the national spotlight. He is in the middle of an intraparty standoff between agriculture-centric Republicans like himself and those, like Speaker John A. Boehner, who think the farm bill passed by Mr. Lucas' committee could put some fellow Republicans on the spot over spending. 
As a result, Mr. Boehner has refused to bring the farm bill to the floor, and the House instead on Thursday is expected to consider an emergency drought relief package, delaying the bill until September at the earliest.
Across the rotunda, Senator Debbie Stabenow, the Michigan Democrat who is chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, took a proactive approach to working with the leadership and ferrying the Senate version of the legislation to passage.
Mr. Lucas, whose plan would overhaul parts of the nation's agriculture policy and cut spending on food stamps, has been comparatively patient with his party's leadership, whom he refers to as ''the management.''
''There will be a farm bill,'' he said Tuesday, smiling and apparently unconcerned. He added, ''I'm just trying to enlighten everybody as I go along.''
Not all of his colleagues have agreed with that approach.
''He's got a big problem with his leadership,'' said Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, the senior Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, who has worked closely with Mr. Lucas on the farm bill. ''I wouldn't be anywhere near as nice as he's being if they were doing this to me.''
The emergency drought bill would provide loan and disaster assistance to cattle, pork, poultry and other livestock producers. Producers of honey and farm-raised fish are also covered under the programs. The United States Department of Agriculture said it had paid out more than $4 billion to producers in previous disasters, but could not provide assistance to farmers during the current crisis because the program had expired.
Though he wanted to move ahead with his farm bill rather than settle for the emergency aid, Mr. Lucas, himself a farmer and rancher from the small town of Cheyenne, Okla., is not the type to stir up trouble.
''People can be resolute in different ways, and Frank's not going to go pound the table and be confrontational, but he'll still meet his objectives and move people in his direction,'' said Allen Wright, who worked previously as Mr. Lucas's chief of staff in Congress and met Mr. Lucas when they attended the same high school in Cheyenne.
Even before then, Mr. Lucas was raised in an environment that melded agriculture and politics. His father, a farmer and the owner of a lumber yard, was a county chairman for Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964 and ran for county commissioner thereafter. In college, Frank Lucas became actively involved in politics himself, participating in student government and working as the county chairman for the Republican Party.
''Frank's had a plan for a long time,'' Mr. Wright said. ''He's been moving political chess pieces for as long as I've known him.''
It came as no surprise, then, when shortly after he graduated from Oklahoma State University with a degree in agricultural economics, Mr. Lucas began his first bid for the state House of Representatives. After he lost two races, he tried again at the urging of Gov. Henry Bellmon. On his third attempt, in 1988, Mr. Lucas won.
His office in the Statehouse was a low-ceilinged vault that had formerly been used by the state treasurer, and Mr. Lucas, at 6-foot-4, had to duck whenever he entered. He shared the office with Jim Reese, who works today as the secretary and commissioner of agriculture in Oklahoma.
Even then, Mr. Lucas was ''just very steady,'' Mr. Reese said. ''He's not a showboat. He just goes about doing his work and tries to work with everybody and is not about getting credit for himself. He's just about getting the job done.''
When Mr. Lucas was elected to Congress in 1994, Mr. Reese said, ''at the time I don't think being the Agriculture Committee chairman was his only priority, but agriculture was all that he was interested in.''
Today, Mr. Lucas and his wife, Lynda, own 480 acres of land in Roger Mills County, Okla., where they grow wheat and run a cow-calf operation. When Oklahoma was hit hard last year by drought, Mr. and Mrs. Lucas were forced to sell off some of their herd, which Mr. Lucas said makes him well-attuned to farmers' concerns in the Midwest.
''Watching my wife agonize over her mama cows, that's never any fun,'' he said. ''When you're compelled by drought to sell, it's a very traumatic experience.''
The opportunity now to craft a five-year farm bill is of personal significance to Mr. Lucas, for whom farming is a family tradition stretching back 100 years to Oklahoma's Dust Bowl, a story he compares to John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath.''
''I want to make sure the mistakes that inflicted such pain on my grandparents' and parents' generations, that we avoid those things,'' Mr. Lucas said. ''I can't make it rain, but I can make sure that we have good, comprehensive federal farm policy.''

HEADLINE: House Approves One-Year Extension of the Bush-Era Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House on Wednesday easily approved a one-year extension of all the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire in January, but in the Senate, presidential politics are complicating efforts to extend a tax credit for wind power.
The House votes pitted a straight extension of all the expiring Bush tax cuts against a Democratic plan, passed by the Senate, that would allow taxes on income, capital gains and dividends to rise on earnings over $250,000, increasing revenues by around $100 billion. It was not close. The Democratic plan failed 170-257, with 19 Democrats voting no. The Republican plan passed 256-171, again with 19 Democrats throwing in their support. One Republican, Representative Timothy V. Johnson of Illinois, who is retiring, opposed it. 
''It's time to put the rhetoric aside,'' said Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio. ''It's time to put the politics aside. I know we're in an election year, but my goodness, raising taxes at this point in this economy is a very big mistake.''
The House vote Wednesday and Senate passage of the Democratic plan give the parties some political cover during an August recess when each will blame the other for an economic crisis expected in January when more than $500 billion in tax cuts are set to lapse.
''I implore my colleagues, don't propel us over this abyss,'' said Representative John B. Larson, Democrat of Connecticut.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers say the work to resolve the so-called fiscal cliff will begin in earnest only after the November election.
But before then, senators are scrambling for a bipartisan agreement to extend a raft of business and individual tax breaks that they hope could ease the economic pain if a larger deal eludes them. Senate Finance Committee members reached tentative agreement on a Wednesday two-year package of tax extensions worth nearly $152 billion.
However, a longstanding tax credit for wind power that has broad bipartisan support was snagged on presidential politics after Senate Republicans removed it to show their loyalty to their presumed presidential nominee, Mitt Romney.
Mr. Romney on Monday came out in favor of letting the tax credit for wind production lapse at the end of the year, just as Senate Finance Committee members were nearing completion of a package of business tax breaks they hope to pass out of the committee on Thursday. Those negotiations were largely about paring back the package, which routinely passes without much scrutiny.
Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, plans to put the credit back when the committee takes up the plan, at a one-year cost to the Treasury of about $3.3 billion. Ultimately, even Republicans believe he will prevail.
But for now, according to committee aides, Republicans who had favored the credit felt that they needed to unite against it for Mr. Romney's sake.
President Obama's re-election campaign has been using Mr. Romney's announcement to pummel him in the swing state of Iowa, where wind power is a growing industry. Conservatives, however, have praised Mr. Romney's position as a stand for fiscal rectitude and against corporate welfare.
The tax package, known as ''extenders,'' has wins for both parties. Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the second-ranking Republican, is expected to secure the inclusion of a longstanding, often-ridiculed tax break for Nascar track owners. He and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, also beat back efforts by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, to enlarge the package with an expanded tax break for tuition and higher education costs, which was included in the 2009 stimulus law but is set to lapse.
But in its place, Mr. Schumer demanded -- and got -- inclusion of a $92 billion provision to stave off the expansion of the alternative minimum tax, a parallel income tax system intended to force the rich to pay more but which is encroaching on the middle class. That provision alone should ease worries about an economic crisis next year driven by a sudden increase in taxes, Mr. Schumer argued.
''Bit by bit, we are turning the fiscal cliff into more of a slope,'' he said.
The two-year package would cost nearly $152 billion, but most of that cost was the one-year minimum tax ''patch.'' Other big-ticket items are continuing the research and development tax credit for businesses, allowing small businesses to write off investments, a deduction for state and local sales taxes for residents of states without income taxes, and extending an existing tax deduction for education tuition.
The package was pared back from 73 provisions to 49, at a saving of around $32 billion. Jettisoned provisions included the tax credit for ethanol production, a credit for plug-in electric motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles, charitable deductions for computer and book inventories and a credit for extracting more energy from depleted oil wells.
Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, is moving to scale it back much further, with 61 amendments to eliminate or limit dozens of tax breaks, including deductions for mass transit and parking benefits, tax incentives for investments in low-income neighborhoods, the District of Columbia and the Gulf Coast, and tax breaks for film and television production.

HEADLINE: Obama Says Romney's Tax Plan Favors Wealthy Only

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
AKRON, Ohio -- President Obama assailed Mitt Romney for ''top-down economics'' in his ninth trip this year to this battleground state, brandishing a new study showing that Mr. Romney's plans would mean additional large tax cuts for millionaires at the expense of other Americans.
Mr. Obama's appearances in north-central Ohio, first in Mansfield and then here, came as new polls continue to show voters split over his stewardship of the economy. He will take his case to Florida on Thursday, but on Friday the release of the monthly unemployment report could do more than any presidential words to shape voters' views. 
Facing an estimated 3,000 people at a convention center here, Mr. Obama was fired up as he explained what his campaign characterizes as the fundamental differences between him and Mr. Romney over tax and spending priorities at a time of rising debt.
''Pay attention here,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Folks making more than $3 million a year -- the top one-tenth of 1 percent -- they would get a tax cut under Mr. Romney's plan that is worth almost a quarter of a million dollars.''
''Hold on, it gets worse,'' he added to a chorus of boos. ''My opponent says he's going to pay for this $5 trillion plan. But under this plan, guess who gets the bill for these $250,000 tax cuts? You do. And you don't have to take my word for it.''
Mr. Obama cited a new study from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, two centrist Washington-based policy research organizations. The analysis concluded that the sort of tax code that Mr. Romney has proposed ''would provide large tax cuts to high-income households, and increase the tax burdens on middle- and/or lower-income taxpayers.''
In Akron and earlier before about 2,000 supporters in Mansfield, Mr. Obama singled out the study's finding that if Mr. Romney reduced or eliminated other tax breaks to offset the revenue loss of his tax cuts -- as he has promised, without specifics -- the changes would shift $86 billion of the tax burden away from the high-income taxpayers and onto everyone else. Americans would lose some or all of existing tax breaks for mortgages, college tuition and health insurance.
''This wasn't my staff, this wasn't something we did -- an independent group ran the numbers,'' Mr. Obama said.
The Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee quickly dismissed the study as partisan, noting that one of its three authors had been on the staff of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Perhaps in response to the criticism, at his second appearance Mr. Obama noted that another author was on the economic staff of the first President George Bush. The Tax Policy Center is widely respected in both parties, and its director was an economic adviser to President George W. Bush.
Mr. Obama literally flew into a separate controversy here: Air Force One first landed at a Mansfield air base that is home to the 179th Air National Guard Wing, whose C-27J aircraft would be mothballed under the administration's proposed reductions in Pentagon spending. Republicans led by Senator Rob Portman of Ohio drew reporters' attention to local coverage of the issue before the president arrived.
Mr. Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, told reporters on Air Force One that the Pentagon would work to find a new mission for the roughly 800 Guard members at the base -- news that Ohio's other senator, Sherrod Brown, a Democrat running for re-election, trumpeted in a news release but that the Romney campaign attacked as a politically motivated flip-flop.
The president has an advantage of six percentage points over Mr. Romney among likely voters in Ohio, according to new polls for Quinnipiac University/The New York Times/CBS News.
While independent voters strongly support Mr. Obama in next-door Pennsylvania, those in Ohio and in Florida split. Just over half of independents in Ohio and Florida disapprove of Mr. Obama's job performance. But Ohio voters were more likely than not to say that Mr. Romney's experience as a private-equity manager was too focused on earning profits for investors and not enough on creating jobs.
That finding most likely reflects the abundance of negative ads that the Obama campaign has run in swing states. It began broadcasting a new ad here and in five other states drawing parallels between Mr. Romney's agenda for increased military spending and tax cuts for the wealthy and that of Mr. Obama's predecessor, Mr. Bush.
Mr. Romney's campaign also had a new ad in Ohio, seeking to turn against Mr. Obama an issue that has played to his advantage: the auto industry rescue that Mr. Romney opposed. The ad featured a man whose auto dealership was among those closed under the industry consolidation.

HEADLINE: Fed Defers New Action, But Growth Has Slowed

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve took no new steps to support the economy Wednesday, but it said in a statement that it was ready to act if job growth did not improve.
The statement, released after a meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, said that the rate of economic growth had slowed in recent months and was likely to remain ''moderate over coming quarters.'' As a result, the Fed said it expected the unemployment rate to decline ''only slowly.''
But the central bank deferred any effort to improve the situation at least until the committee's next scheduled meeting in mid-September.
''The committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability,'' it said. 
That was stronger language than it used after its previous meeting in June, when it said that it was ''prepared'' to act.
And the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said that the Fed is ''committed to ensuring, or at least doing all we can to ensure'' that unemployment continues to decline, suggesting officials may simply be waiting to see the government's estimates of job growth in July and August, which will be released before the committee reconvenes Sept. 12 and 13.
The absence of action appeared to disappoint some equity investors. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4 points, or 0.29 percent, Wednesday, to 1,375.32. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped sharply after the Fed's announcement, and then traded erratically before closing near its session low. It fell 37.62 points, also 0.29 percent, to 12,971.06.
But much of the market's attention already has turned to the September meeting, when the Fed also will update its economic projections.
''This statement will at least raise some new doubts about whether the Fed will be easing again this year,'' Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ''We still expect they will, assuming that growth remains fairly sluggish, but for now at least the statement keeps the debate open.''
Mr. Bernanke will have an opportunity to clarify his views when he speaks at an annual monetary policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., at the end of August.
Some Fed officials suggested recently that the weak rate of growth required new action. They said that the unemployment rate had stagnated above 8 percent since January, and that the most recent economic forecasts by Fed officials, published in June, projected the rate would decline slightly, if at all, during the second half of the year.
But there were no votes for action at the meeting that ended Wednesday. Among the 12 officials who vote on monetary policy, the only dissent from the decision to stand pat came from an official who has consistently pressed for the Fed to do less, Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.
The Fed already is engaged in a wide-ranging effort to spur growth by cutting interest rates, punishing savers and rewarding borrowers. The central bank has held its benchmark rate near zero since late 2008, and said that it planned to maintain that policy at least until late 2014. It has put further pressure on long-term rates by amassing a portfolio of almost $3 trillion in long-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. And it said in June that it would keep buying bonds through the end of the year.
But those efforts have proved insufficient to set off a strong recovery. The economy has slogged along somewhere between crisis and prosperity for more than three years now. Unemployment remains pervasive; more than 23 million Americans cannot find full-time jobs. And the Fed, while insisting that it could do more, has so far declined to prove it.
Some Fed officials remain uncertain that the economy needs help. Economic indicators are imprecise, particularly in times of turbulence. Some officials also doubt the Fed can help. Cheap loans are at best an indirect means of addressing problems like the decline in government spending, tight credit standards and high levels of household debt.
Vincent Reinhart, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, said that the Fed appeared ''resigned to subpar economic performance'' because it lacked confidence in the available tools. ''If it were more confident, it would have done more,'' said Mr. Reinhart, who worked as the Fed's chief monetary policy staff member under Mr. Bernanke.
The uncertain state of Europe also figures in the Fed's decision-making. The Continent's struggles are weighing on the American economy, and an intensification of the euro zone crisis could destabilize financial markets. But the European Central Bank meets Thursday, and it could diminish the Fed's sense of urgency by acting more forcefully.
Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, raised expectations last week when he said he would do ''whatever it takes'' to preserve the euro.
And some analysts suggest that the Fed will wait, if possible, until after the presidential election, to avoid inevitable criticism from Republicans who have pressed the central bank to forswear new steps. Mr. Bernanke has said repeatedly that the Fed will make decisions without regard to political considerations.
He told Congress last month that the Fed would consider a new round of asset purchases if the economy did not improve. The policy, often described as ''quantitative easing,'' uses scarcity to reduce borrowing costs, pushing investors to accept lower bond yields and to move money into riskier investments. A number of Fed officials have said any Fed asset purchases should include mortgage bonds, to help the housing sector, which the Fed said Wednesday ''remains depressed.''
But some officials are concerned about the consequences of additional purchases, including the potential that it will distort and disrupt financial markets.
Mr. Bernanke also referenced the possibility that the Fed could extend its prediction that it would hold its benchmark interest rate near zero at least until late 2014.
In making such predictions, known in central bank parlance as ''forward guidance,'' the Fed is trying to reduce borrowing costs by convincing investors that it is safe to accept lower returns. But the effect is limited because officials have made clear that it is a prediction, not a commitment. The Fed is simply saying that interest rates will remain low if the economy remains weak.
A study published in March, examining the influence of guidance by the Fed and central banks in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, found ''little or no convincing evidence that forward guidance actually improves markets' ability to forecast future rates.''
Markets might be particularly skeptical in this case because Mr. Bernanke's term as Fed chairman ends in January 2014.

HEADLINE: Adviser Draws Attention to Romney Mideast Policy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Michael Barbaro and Richard A. Oppel Jr. contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Moments after making remarks in Jerusalem about Middle East culture that enraged Palestinians and undermined the public relations value of his trip to Israel, Mitt Romney looked around the room for Dan Senor, one of his campaign's top foreign policy advisers.
It was Mr. Senor's book about entrepreneurs in Israel that informed his comments, Mr. Romney explained to the group of Jewish-American donors he had assembled at the King David hotel. The book, ''Start-up Nation,'' is among Mr. Senor's writings that Mr. Romney frequently cites in public. 
Mr. Senor (pronounced See-NOR) has become one of the key people shaping Mr. Romney's increasingly hawkish views on the Middle East. A television-savvy former spokesman for the American government in Iraq, Mr. Senor blends a foreign policy background, high-volume punditry and ties to wealthy hedge fund investors in the United States to become a triple threat as an insider in Mr. Romney's presidential campaign.
His presence in the tight orbit of advisers around the Republican candidate foreshadows a Romney foreign policy that could take a harder line against Iran, embrace Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move away from being the honest broker in the conflict with Palestinians.
But his views and influence have drawn new scrutiny to Mr. Romney's Mideast positions, particularly after Mr. Senor said last week that Mr. Romney respected Israel's right to pre-emptively strike Iran's nuclear facilities. Campaign aides conceded that Mr. Senor got ''a little ahead'' of Mr. Romney on Iran, but said it had not diminished his role at the campaign.
''Dan is a long-term friend and adviser of Mitt,'' said Beth Myers, one of Mr. Romney's top strategists. ''He's consistently been a part of his foreign policy advising world. Mitt appreciated his advice and counsel on that trip and he remains a close adviser.''
By tapping Mr. Senor, 40, as his principal adviser on the Israel leg of his foreign trip this week, Mr. Romney passed over more seasoned strategists, some of them veterans of the Middle East peace efforts that have bedeviled presidents and diplomats for decades.
In Mr. Senor, Mr. Romney turned to an advocate of neoconservative thinking that has sought to push presidents to the right for years on Middle East policy. (His sister, Wendy Senor Singer, runs the Jerusalem office of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential lobbying organization.)
''Mr. Senor is a pragmatic hawk who clearly has an acute sensitivity and sensibility toward Israeli security interests,'' said Aaron David Miller, a former adviser to Democratic and Republican secretaries of state. ''That's clearly a filter through which he, and should he get to be president, Romney, sees the whole panoply of issues in the Middle East.''
The plan for Mr. Romney's overseas trip called for him to mix delicate global diplomacy with high-dollar campaign fund-raising, all on foreign soil. It would take an adviser accustomed to maneuvering effortlessly through the worlds of politics, money and news media.
Enter Mr. Senor, who has become one of Mr. Romney's closest foreign policy advisers, having traveled three times to Israel with him. Mr. Senor began visiting Boston in 2006 to brief Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, on foreign policy, and has had his ear since. In the acknowledgments of his book ''No Apology,'' Mr. Romney wrote that Mr. Senor sharpened his ''appreciation of the dangers presented by the shift in our foreign policy.''
Mr. Senor declined to comment for this article.
But in Israel last week, the carefully laid plan was quickly consumed by negative attention. Gushing comments about Mr. Romney by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were initially overshadowed by Mr. Senor's comments to reporters about Iran. When that died down, Mr. Romney's assertion that cultural factors helped account for the wide Israeli economic edge over the Palestinians drew condemnation from Palestinian leaders.
For all the furor, Mr. Senor has proved to be a resilient public figure, often finding new success after public criticism.
At the start of the Iraq war, Mr. Senor served as the spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority, often delivering rosy accounts of the war's progress to reporters whose on-the-ground view of the crisis there was anything but. Rajiv Chandrasekaran, a Washington Post reporter who wrote a critical book about the authority, once described Mr. Senor's office as doing ''a masterful job of spinning the media.''
Mr. Senor's departure from Iraq was followed by a stint running a private equity firm that made him wealthy. He married Campbell Brown, a former anchor for CNN, formed a conservative research organization and secured invitations to appear on Fox News and MSNBC's ''Morning Joe'' program.
''He is intrigued by the game of politics,'' said William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard and a longtime friend. ''But he is genuinely public spirited.''
Mr. Romney's relationship with Mr. Senor began just after his honeymoon in 2006, when Ms. Myers asked if he would meet with Mr. Romney, then a likely presidential candidate.
Before long, Mr. Senor was regularly visiting Boston for briefings and setting up visits by other foreign policy hawks in Washington. He accompanied Mr. Romney to Israel in January 2007 and went with him on a trip to Afghanistan, Jordan, Israel and Dubai last year.
''I believe they are genuinely close and personal,'' Mr. Kristol said.
Perhaps the best evidence of that is the frequency with which Mr. Romney talks about Mr. Senor's book. Acquaintances of both men said Mr. Romney frequently mentions it. The slim book argues that Israel's entrepreneurial spirit contributes to its success -- a message that resonates with Mr. Romney's background in business.
''He goes through some of the cultural elements that have led Israel to become a nation that has begun so many businesses and so many enterprises,'' Mr. Romney said at his Jerusalem fund-raiser.
Looking around a room filled with wealthy Americans, including Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate who has donated tens of millions of dollars to Republicans, Mr. Romney noted Mr. Senor's absence and his success at hitting such people up for campaign cash.
''I saw him this morning. I don't know where he is,'' Mr. Romney said. ''He's probably out twisting someone's arm.''

HEADLINE: An Urgent Plea for Money

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
Each plea for money from President Obama and his allies has become more urgent and desperate than the last.
His campaign's chief operating officer said Monday that ''we've gotten our behinds handed to us.'' 
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. warned on the same day that Mr. Obama would lose if ''the other side spends us into oblivion.''
Michelle Obama worried aloud about waking up on Election Day ''wondering if I could have done more.''
The remedy, according to all of them? A donation of $3 (or more) by midnight on Tuesday.
The urgent and repeated appeals, sent to millions of Mr. Obama's supporters via e-mail and text messages, are a vivid reminder that the president's campaign probably raised significantly less than Mitt Romney and Republicans for the third month in a row in July.
The presidential campaigns are required to report fund-raising totals for the month to the Federal Election Commission by Aug. 15. In the meantime, Democrats are trying to portray a sitting president as a financial underdog whose ability to stay in the White House depends on the largess of his army of everyday supporters.
The dire hand-wringing is partly tactical for a campaign that is likely to have more than enough money to execute its strategy.
But in fact, Mr. Obama is facing a quandary his 2008 campaign team never even contemplated: a rival whose fund-raising operation appears better positioned to tap into both the deep pockets of wealthy donors and the economic frustrations of average Americans.
The appeals for donations occasionally recall the ''Everything 80 percent off! Going out of business!'' sales that try to entice customers into stores. And yet, Mr. Obama's campaign team has clearly calculated that it is willing to risk leaving that kind of impression if it means raising more money.

HEADLINE: Romney Hasn't Done His Homework

BYLINE: By JARED DIAMOND. 
Jared Diamond, a professor of geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, is the author of the forthcoming book ''The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn From Traditional Societies?''

 BODY:
Los Angeles
MITT ROMNEY'S latest controversial remark, about the role of culture in explaining why some countries are rich and powerful while others are poor and weak, has attracted much comment. I was especially interested in his remark because he misrepresented my views and, in contrasting them with another scholar's arguments, oversimplified the issue.
It is not true that my book ''Guns, Germs and Steel,'' as Mr. Romney described it in a speech in Jerusalem, ''basically says the physical characteristics of the land account for the differences in the success of the people that live there. There is iron ore on the land and so forth.'' 
That is so different from what my book actually says that I have to doubt whether Mr. Romney read it. My focus was mostly on biological features, like plant and animal species, and among physical characteristics, the ones I mentioned were continents' sizes and shapes and relative isolation. I said nothing about iron ore, which is so widespread that its distribution has had little effect on the different successes of different peoples. (As I learned this week, Mr. Romney also mischaracterized my book in his memoir, ''No Apology: Believe in America.'')
That's not the worst part. Even scholars who emphasize social rather than geographic explanations -- like the Harvard economist David S. Landes, whose book ''The Wealth and Poverty of Nations'' was mentioned favorably by Mr. Romney -- would find Mr. Romney's statement that ''culture makes all the difference'' dangerously out of date. In fact, Mr. Landes analyzed multiple factors (including climate) in explaining why the industrial revolution first occurred in Europe and not elsewhere.
Just as a happy marriage depends on many different factors, so do national wealth and power. That is not to deny culture's significance. Some countries have political institutions and cultural practices -- honest government, rule of law, opportunities to accumulate money -- that reward hard work. Others don't. Familiar examples are the contrasts between neighboring countries sharing similar environments but with very different institutions. (Think of South Korea versus North Korea, or Haiti versus the Dominican Republic.) Rich, powerful countries tend to have good institutions that reward hard work. But institutions and culture aren't the whole answer, because some countries notorious for bad institutions (like Italy and Argentina) are rich, while some virtuous countries (like Tanzania and Bhutan) are poor.
A different set of factors involves geography, which embraces many more aspects than the physical characteristics Mr. Romney dismissed. One such geographic factor is latitude, which has big effects on wealth and power today: tropical countries tend to be poorer than temperate-zone countries. Reasons include the debilitating effects of tropical diseases on life span and work, and the average lower productivity of agriculture and soils in the tropics than in the temperate zones.
A second factor is access to the sea. Countries without a seacoast or big navigable rivers tend to be poor, because transport costs overland or by air are much higher than transport costs by sea.
A third geographic factor is the history of agriculture. If an extraterrestrial had toured earth in the year 2000 B.C., the visitor would have noticed that centralized government, writing and metal tools were already widespread in Eurasia but hadn't yet appeared in the New World, sub-Saharan Africa or Australia. That long head start would have let the visitor predict correctly that today, most of the world's richest and most powerful countries would be Eurasian countries (and their overseas settlements in North America, Australia and New Zealand).
The reason is the historical effect of geography: 13,000 years ago, all peoples everywhere were hunter-gatherers living in sparse populations without centralized government, armies, writing or metal tools. These four roots of power arose as consequences of the development of agriculture, which generated human population explosions and accumulations of food surpluses capable of feeding full-time leaders, soldiers, scribes and inventors. But agriculture could originate only in those few regions endowed with many wild plant and animal species suitable for domestication, like wild wheat, rice, pigs and cattle.
In short, geographic explanations and cultural-institutional explanations aren't independent of each other. Of course, not all agricultural regions developed honest centralized government, but no nonagricultural region ever developed any centralized government, whether honest or dishonest. That's why institutions promoting wealth today arose first in Eurasia, the area with the oldest and most productive agriculture.
What does this mean for Americans? Can we assume that the United States, blessed with temperate location and seacoasts and navigable rivers, will remain rich forever, while tropical or landlocked countries are doomed to eternal poverty?
Of course not. Some tropical and subtropical countries have become richer despite geographic limitations. They've invested in public health to overcome their disease burdens (Botswana and the Philippines). They've invested in crops adapted to the tropics (Brazil and Malaysia). They've focused their economies on sectors other than agriculture (Singapore and Taiwan).
Conversely, geographic advantages don't guarantee permanent success, as the growing difficulties in Europe and America show. We Americans fail to provide superior education and economic incentives to much of our population. India, China and other countries that have not been world leaders are investing heavily in education, technology and infrastructure. They're offering economic opportunities to more and more of their citizens. That's part of the reason jobs are moving overseas. Our geography won't keep us rich and powerful if we can't get a good education, can't afford health care and can't count on our hard work's being rewarded by good jobs and rising incomes.
Mitt Romney may become our next president. Will he continue to espouse one-factor explanations for multicausal problems, and fail to understand history and the modern world? If so, he will preside over a declining nation squandering its advantages of location and history.

LENGTH: 1081 words

HEADLINE: A Republican Voice With Tea Party Mantle And Intellectual Heft

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- As a teenager, Ted Cruz was an intense and eloquent parser of free-market economics, dazzling Rotary Clubs here in Houston by reciting the Constitution. At Princeton, he was a champion debater and an intellectual leader of a band of conservative students. He was a star at Harvard Law School and clerked for the chief justice of the United States.
But few may have imagined Mr. Cruz, 41, in his newest role, as the Tea Party favorite and Republican candidate for the United States Senate, trading verbal orchids with the likes of Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck. Mr. Cruz earned the nomination on Tuesday in a runoff election after more than a year of sweaty street campaigning, drawing national attention for beating Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the more experienced nominee of the Texas Republican establishment.
''I'd have predicted that he would be a professor, not a politician,'' said Robert P. George, Mr. Cruz's adviser at Princeton in the early 1990s. Professor George, a noted social conservative, said that Mr. Cruz stood out even among his Ivy League peers as ''intellectually and morally serious,'' writing his thesis on the separation of powers. 
''But he's certainly not a shrinking violet,'' Professor George quickly added in an interview on Tuesday -- to which, Mr. Dewhurst, a wealthy conservative who had the support of Gov. Rick Perry, can attest.
Mr. Cruz's victory in November is all but assured in this heavily Republican state and marks a shift to the right in the already conservative party here. Political elders and experts who have watched him during his time here as state solicitor general and on the campaign trail predict that he will be an intellectual force in Congress on behalf of constitutional limits on federal power. He is expected to join Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina and other Tea Party icons as an uncompromising irritant of mainstream Republicans and Democrats alike.
It helps, of course, that Mr. Cruz has the smooth good looks and practiced speech of a television host and is able to channel his knowledge into sound bites.
''He has the potential to be a national figure,'' said Mark P. Jones, a political scientist at Rice University, noting Mr. Cruz's intellect and oratorical skills.
''He'll be a senator from the second-largest state in the nation,'' Mr. Jones said, ''and he's very good on television, a perfectly designed politician for today's 24-hour news cycle.''
Speaking to the Values Voters Summit in Washington in October, Mr. Cruz drew a standing ovation as he repeated the themes of the political and religious right, sometimes sounding more ideologue than intellectual. He called President Obama the country's ''most radical president,'' railed against the ''gay rights agenda'' and warned against new threats to ''religious liberty.'' Within days, National Review anointed him ''the next great conservative hope.''
On Tuesday, as he greeted supporters in sweltering heat outside a polling station, Mr. Cruz and his wife, Heidi, were picture-perfect, not a wrinkle on their clothes nor a hair out of place.
Mr. Cruz said that his first dive into electoral politics had left him feeling ''invigorated and inspired.''
''Every day, I come home with a spring in my step,'' he said to the wildly enthusiastic group of grass-roots volunteers and to the cameras. ''We've got to work together to stop the Obama agenda and take this country back.''
Rafael Edward Cruz was born on Dec. 22, 1970, in Calgary, Alberta, where his parents worked in the oil business.
Mr. Cruz's parents are central to the personal narrative he tells, how he got so devoted to his conservative brand of freedom. His father, also Rafael, now a Baptist pastor, fled Cuba in 1957 with $100 sewn into his underwear and worked his way through the University of Texas. His mother, Eleanor, was the first in her family to finish college, at Rice, and ran an energy company. They returned to Texas when he was a child, and he graduated from a Baptist high school in Houston.
His father told him as a child, Mr. Cruz often says, that ''if we lose our freedom here, where do we go?''
Tuesday night, Mr. Cruz was joined on the victory stand by his parents, his wife and two small, blond daughters who held their hands over their ears as the large crowd cheered wildly.
Mr. Cruz tends to spend any spare time with his daughters, said his friend Kelly Shackelford, president of the Liberty Institute, an evangelical Christian legal group based in Texas.
Mr. Cruz worked in private law practice in the late 1990s and then began his turn into politics, working on the presidential campaign of George W. Bush and then working at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department.
In 2003 he returned to Texas as solicitor general, giving him a direct chance to press for his ideals in the courts.
Mr. Cruz argued before the Supreme Court nine times and has trumpeted his successes. In his most notable victory, the court affirmed the right of Texas to ignore instructions from the International Court of Justice and the Bush administration to review an illegal immigrant's death sentence.
He also helped argue that Texas could have a monument to the Ten Commandments at the Capitol, and keep the words ''under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance. But critics say that in the campaign he took too much credit for his own role in those cases, which are red meat for his evangelical supporters. Since 2008 he has worked in a private law firm here, Morgan Lewis, often representing corporate clients.
In the runoff campaign, Mr. Cruz scorched his opponent with charges that he was a conciliator, too quick to compromise. But Mr. Cruz has yet to grapple with the seemingly impossible choices faced by Congress as it seeks to balance the budget without gutting Medicare or Social Security, for example.
In the last few days of the campaign -- perhaps in a last-minute effort to attract mainstream Republicans, or perhaps in a preview of the tasks ahead -- Mr. Cruz sounded a bit more conciliatory himself, suddenly talking about ''reaching across the aisle.''
In a brief interview on Tuesday, he said that his role model in this respect was Ronald Reagan. ''President Reagan stood for conservative principles in a way that brought people together,'' he said.
Republicans have too often had it backward, he said, ''making hateful attacks but then compromising on basic principle.''
''But I am not willing to compromise on allowing the government to keep growing and expanding our debt,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Societe Generale's Profit Falls Below Expectations

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
PARIS - Societe Generale, the big French bank, reported second-quarter results on Wednesday that fell short of analysts' estimates as it struggled against a downturn in Europe. 
Net profit in the second quarter fell 42 percent, to 433 million euros ($530 million), compared with 747 million euros in the period a year earlier. Analysts were expecting the bank to earn 764 million euros in the latest quarter. The bank also said it was making progress in bolstering its capital cushion.
''Despite a challenging environment, the Societe Generale Group has progressed, quarter after quarter, with its transformation strategy, in line with its objectives,'' Frederic Oudea, the bank's chief executive, said in a statement.
Societe Generale took a series of write-downs related to past acquisitions, including 250 million euros on Rosbank in Russia and 200 million euros on TCW Group, a fund firm in Los Angeles. Analysts are waiting to see whether Societe Generale sells TCW as part of a broader plan to raise money.
Like the results of its peers, the report raised concerns that financial weakness could persist as the debt crisis drags on.
The bank said growth in Europe slowed significantly in the second quarter, crimping some of its profitability from retail operations. Its international retail banking revenue fell nearly 2 percent, to 1.24 billion euros.
The bank signaled that it also continued to face financial challenges with its Greek subsidiary, Geniki Bank. In a statement, Societe Generale said its operations in Central and Eastern Europe ''excluding Greece'' did well, but it did not provide figures for the Greek unit. Societe Generale has recently cut financing to Geniki to a minimum as the Greek economy shrinks.
French banks have been reducing their exposure to Greece by selling much of the nation's sovereign debt, and those with subsidiaries there are scrambling to figure out how to cope with the worsening situation. One of Societe Generale's French rivals, Credit Agricole, said recently that it was in talks to sell its Greek subsidiary, Emporiki Bank, as soon as possible.
The debt crisis is also wreaking havoc on the investment banking business. The bank said customers remain reticent as policy makers struggle to find ''durable solutions to the sovereign debt crisis.'' Corporate and investment banking revenue fell more than 30 percent, to 1.22 billion euros.
Societe Generale also noted deteriorating conditions in France, which has the largest economy in the euro zone after Germany's. So far, France has avoided the worst of the debt crisis that first engulfed Greece and now Spain. But the economy has been softening, and the government's share of the bill for cleaning up the crisis is likely to grow.
The bank's French retail operations remained flat at 2.04 billion euros.
Shares of Societe Generale rose 0.5 percent in Paris, to 18.11 euros.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HIGHLIGHT: The fourth picture essay in "Smoke-Filled Rooms" - a serial documentary by Stephen Crowley. 

 BODY:
With a mere 99 days left until the presidential election, the candidates continue to poll at a statistical tie. Unemployment and economic stagnation continue to weigh on the nation's psyche and the campaigns have turned negative, hoping to appeal to voters who are still undecided.
In the fourth installment of the "Smoke-Filled Rooms" series, Stephen Crowley, a staff photographer at The New York Times, continues to look beyond the restrictions, spin and control of the contemporary American political process. With an unorthodox presentation of photographs and text, Mr. Crowley examines the forces that influence the presidential campaign.

HEADLINE: The Breakfast Meeting: Hunting for Leakers, and Olympic Spotlight on Headphones

BYLINE: NOAM COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: The F.B.I.'s hunt for leaks among national security agencies has cast a chill over media coverage, Sony reports declining profit in the quarter, and a look at branded headphones used by Olympic competitors. 

 BODY:
The F.B.I.'s hunt for leakers among the government's national security agencies has cast a chill over media coverage of those issues, Scott Shane reports, with the agencies declining interview requests or background briefings. At the same time, the Senate is considering legislation meant to limit intelligence officials' exchanges with reporters; that bill has been criticized by intelligence veterans and civil libertarians fear as counterproductive and raising constitutional questions. The criminal investigation was prompted by, among others, recent media disclosures on American cyberattacks on Iran and the so-called "kill list" of terrorist suspects approved for drone strikes. The reports were published by The New York Times, The Associated Press, Newsweek and other outlets, as well as in recent books by reporters for Newsweek and The Times.
A new YouTube channel run by the Center of Investigative Reporting - I Files - will host investigative journalism videos from a wide range of sources, including The New York Times, ABC, BBC, Al Jazeera and Investigative News Network. The channel is being supported by an $800,000 grant from the Knight Foundation is seeding the channel, which will share revenue with its content partners, TechCrunch reports.
Sexual harassment has long been accepted in the male-dominated world of virtual gaming communities, Amy O'Leary writes, but a number of highly publicized examples have caused executives in the $25 billion-a-year industry to take note. The harassment of the only woman among a team competing in Cross Assault tournament - by her coach, no less - has become a rallying cause. Said Tom Cannon, a prominent figure in the "fighting game" community: "The nasty undercurrent in the scene isn't a joke or a meme. It's something we need to fix."
Sony on Thursday reported a 77 percent decline in operating profit for the quarter that ended in June, far below expectations, Reuters reported. The reasons cited included the weak global economy and exchange rate shifts, but more generally, it showed the challenges facing the new chief executive of Sony, Kazuo Hirai, who has vowed to revive the fortunes of the company.
The prominent use of branded headphones thus far has evaded Olympics officials, who are relentless in blocking unofficial sponsors from coasting on the publicity of the Games, Andrew Das and Andrew Martin report. At the swimming center, it is common to see competitors like Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps of the United States, Sun Yang of China and Park Tae-hwan of South Korea come to the starting blocks with headphones. Perhaps the most popular brand is Beats by Dr. Dre, they write, which provided free sets to many athletes; Phelps, however, wears a futuristic pair made by an Oregon company, Sol Republic, which was news to the company.

HEADLINE: Beware the Jobs Report of July

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: For a month when the economy routinely sheds a large number of jobs, seasonal adjustment is likely to provide a far different picture. 

 BODY:
The American economy almost certainly shed more than a million jobs last month, just as it does every July. But that's not the "jobs number" that will get most of the attention when the Bureau of Labor Statistics speaks Friday morning.
No, the number we care about will be much smaller. Indeed, it is very likely to be modestly positive. And that is because of something called "seasonal adjustment."
Every month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the number of jobs based on a survey of businesses. Then it adjusts the number to eliminate recurring fluctuations - such as from teachers going on summer break - so long-term trends are more visible.
In June, for example, the bureau estimated that the economy added 391,000 jobs. But the headline number, after seasonal adjustment, was just 80,000 jobs.
This is a good and important idea. But right now we have a problem: Some economists believe economic turbulence has disrupted the calibration of those adjustments, undermining the accuracy of the bureau's estimates. 
Federal Reserve officials have cited doubts about the accuracy of the monthly jobs number as one reason for their uncertainty about the health of the economy.
As my colleague Floyd Norris explained last month, one possible distortion that has arisen in recent years, thanks to the weakness of the economy, is that "seasonal adjustments make things look better than they are in the winter, when fewer workers are being let go than the government expects, and worse in the spring and summer, when the workers who were not let go cannot be rehired."
The issue will loom particularly large on Friday, because the report for July is annually adjusted by a larger amount than for any other month save January, when holiday workers lose their jobs.
In the last 10 July jobs reports, dating back to 2002, the agency has added an average of 1.33 million jobs to its original estimate. Last year, for example, the agency estimated that payrolls declined by 1.3 million jobs in July, but it reported a seasonally adjusted increase of 96,000 jobs.
That places a huge premium on the accuracy of the adjustment: A 5 percent error in the adjustment would have shifted the reported total last July by two-thirds.
And even in the best of times, the bureau's estimates are rarely that accurate.
The government has estimated an average change of 149,700 jobs in the last 10 July jobs reports, but it has since revised those estimates by an average of 92,900 jobs per year. In other words, the initial estimate is generally off by about 62 percent.
In three of those 10 years - 2002, 2003 and 2007 - the agency wasn't even correct about whether the economy gained or lost jobs.
So take Friday's report with a measure of caution.
And one more thing: The other headline number, the unemployment rate, is derived from a separate household survey. It's also adjusted seasonally. And it has its own problems. But that's a blog post for another month.

HEADLINE: Lithuania, the 'Other Dream Team' at the '92 Games

BYLINE: JIM CAVAN


HIGHLIGHT: In its first Olympic Games after throwing off Soviet shackles, Lithuania fielded its own team of stars - financed with the help of the Grateful Dead - and capped a magical run with a victory over the Russian team to capture the bronze medal. 

 BODY:
Between Jack McCallum's stellar retrospective (the aptly titled "Dream Team," released last month), a 90-minute NBA TV documentary and myriad articles raising pointed cross-decades comparisons, memories of the Dream Team's dominance, personality and global influence continue to ring true two decades on.
Meanwhile, 1,400 miles due east of London, in a country just entering its third decade free of the yoke of Soviet Russia, memories of Barcelona take on a somewhat different - though no less important - meaning.
By the summer of 1992, it had been a little over two years since Lithuania, a country of just over three million people nestled between Belarus, Poland and Latvia along the Baltic Sea, had officially declared independence from a fast-faltering Soviet Union.
Despite a series of Soviet-spurred economic blockades and military incursions designed to weaken its collective will, Lithuania persevered, and by that summer had seen its breakaway become almost universally recognized on the global stage.
Independence fully secure, Lithuania was finally permitted to field its own Olympic teams, clad in the country's now iconic yellow, green and red. And that meant a chance to field its own basketball team. With basketball having long been one of the country's most popular sports, for decades Lithuania had supplied the Soviet national team with much of its firepower.
In 1988, two years before a rule barring professionals from competing in the ostensibly amateur Olympics was lifted, paving the way for the Dream Team phenomenon, Russia took home the gold in Seoul, South Korea, thanks in large part to a core of four Lithuanian-born players: Valdemaras Chomicius, Rimas Kurtinaitis, Sarunas Marciulionis and Arvydas Sabonis.
Those four would once again prove integral in Barcelona. Donning tie-dyed warm-ups designed and supplied by the Grateful Dead - the proceeds helped Lithuania, mired in a crippling economic recession, finance the team's Olympic trip - and showcasing a brand of basketball in many ways ahead of its time, Sabonis and company quickly endeared themselves to the crowds at Pavell Olympic.
After notching a 6-2 mark in group play, the team blew by Brazil in the first round of the knockout stage to set up a meeting with the United States - , in the eyes of many Lithuanians. As with every roadblock along their path to coronation, the United States would dismantle the overmatched and undersized Lithuania, en route to recapturing the gold.
Even in defeat, Lithuania knew its true championship - its gold, in a sense - lay ahead. Two days later, in front of what politics and good will had transformed into a veritable home crowd, Lithuania squared off against the Russian National Team in the bronze medal game.
The game, like the struggles that had defined the independence pangs of so many since 1988, was hotly contested throughout. But in the end, buoyed by Barcelona good will, the Lithuanians hung on for an 82-78 victory. A few hours later, the team would join those of the United States and Croatia, another country well versed in the pains of bloody internal strife, on the medal podium.
As legend has it, Sabonis, long known as something of a party animal, had gotten into a shot-drinking contest and was passed out somewhere in the Olympic Village, and thus ended up being the only Lithuanian player to miss the ceremony. Of course, he did eventually get his medal, along with a solid seven-year National Basketball Association career. In the estimations of many, and knowing the singular dominance he had exhibited abroad since the early '80s, his time in the N.B.A. had begun far too deep in career twilight.
Still, Sabonis's most famous escapade - in a career that featured many - was to become, in a strange way, something of a harbinger for Lithuania's basketball future. Twenty years, six international medals and more than a dozen N.B.A.-level players after their Barcelona triumph, the country's now legendary fan base is known for being one of the rowdiest, cheeriest and most dedicated in the world.
Like the American Dream Team, Lithuania's '92 medal winners boast their own feature-length documentary. Like their American counterparts, the Lithuanians have had gallons of ink spilled on their behalf. And, like Barkley, Magic and Bird, they have their hardwood icon, their Pied Piper, in the mythic Sabonis. All the while, a country that once saw its best athletic talent siphoned off for the glory of an alien empire, formed an identity.
And while their chances for an Olympic medal are seen as something of a long shot this time around, any team boasting four current and former N.B.A. players, as Lithuania does with Linas Kleiza, Sarunas Jasikevicius, Darius Songaila and the soon-to-be rookie Jonas Valanciunas, cannot be counted out completely.
Twenty years after finding a reason to cheer in their newfound freedom, Lithuania's basketball identity, like the country's culture, continues to flourish. And 20 years after its most recognizable player partied past the podium, it is as if the celebration never really stopped.

HEADLINE: Readers Debate Trade-Offs Between Security and Civil Liberties

BYLINE: SCOTT SHANE


HIGHLIGHT: Who decides what liberty is "essential"? And is protection from terrorism just "a little temporary safety," or something more crucial? Readers weigh in. 

 BODY:
Does more liberty necessarily mean less security, and vice versa?
Absolutely not, according to some of the readers who commented on my post on the security trade-offs of the post-9/11 decade for The Agenda, our continuing discussion of fundamental issues getting less than full debate in the presidential campaign. I talked about how the government's beefed-up counterterrorism measures have led to a calculated erosion of privacy and civil liberties. I asked whether the next president should consider a recalibration, since there has been nothing like a repeat of the Sept. 11 attacks, or whether the government's current surveillance programs and other intrusive measures should be maintained to protect the public.
But Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, was among several readers who thought the question was posed incorrectly.
"Giving up civil liberties does not enhance security in a constitutional democracy," Mr. Rotenberg wrote. "It transforms the character of the society, making it less open, less resilient, and more prone to the illusions of security theater."
Some readers cited variants of the classic Benjamin Franklin epigram: "They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."
But who decides what liberty is "essential"? And is protection from terrorism just "a little temporary safety," or something more crucial?
Some who wrote responses argued that security from terrorism is an essential precondition for liberty. Francine from Massachusetts wrote that "Freedom and liberty are assured by security." She added: "I'm not a huge fan of either the Patriot Act or Homeland Security. But the idea of coordinating information among various agencies and speeding up the process by which emergencies can be dealt with was an idea long overdue."
Air travel, she wrote, "is a privilege, not a right. I would rather not die in a terrorist attack, thank you very much."
R.L.K. from Chappaqua, N.Y., doesn't get those who complain about security measures: "Other than some small delay getting on planes, I hardly notice much difference between the way I ran my life pre-9/11 and now." In fact, R.L.K. added, "I am grateful for the added security. There really has been very little or no diminishing of my rights or my freedom. And I am thankful, rather than resentful, for that."
Jon from New York City, was still more blunt: "Stare a real terrorist in the eyes in combat, and then tell me we don't need these measures."
But other readers are more skeptical about the government's huge security build-up since the 2001 attacks. Those who attribute the absence of major terrorist attacks in the years since to government actions "confuse correlation with causation," wrote Bradley Bleck from Spokane, Wash. "We have given up liberty for the illusion of security."
Pribilof of Denver agreed: "I think we have gone too far in giving up liberty for 'security,'" Pribilof wrote. "Do you really want the government wiretapping and gathering your G.P.S. data without a warrant or judicial review? Do we really want habeas corpus suspended, even for terrorism suspects? What a terrible precedent to set."
Cameron Bedard, of Providence, R.I., connected the government's increased surveillance measures and those of private companies, whose databases the government often acquires. "Suppose you are a law abiding citizen and you have 'nothing to hide'. You are comfortable with the increasing number of surveillance cameras lining your streets, the expanding powers given to law enforcement officials to monitor your emails and electronic communications without warrant and you do not have an issue when subjected to more rigorous security checks at rail stations, airports or on public transportation."
But Cameron asks: "How would you feel if an affair were disclosed to your significant other after a private investigator requested your driving record from Microdesign's Electronic Toll Collection database? That is the company that aggregates data on automobiles passing through toll booths across the country. They also sell that information for profit, not only to the state but to restaurateurs. The point is, we all have something to hide."
Scott H., from New York, concluded that the government was unlikely to give up any of the powers it has obtained over the last decade: "Assuming the next president is Obama or Romney, I see no evidence of either one of them heading toward conclusion B" - that is, downsizing the security measures.
Another reader using the screen name Angry Panda echoed that view: "Power, once gained, is not easily surrendered, whether by the White House (extrajudicial killings, etc.), the Pentagon (enemy combatant rules), or the national security complex (warrantless wiretaps, etc.)." Today, this reader wrote, "There are huge economic and political interests in play here, not to mention a very convenient expansion of the security state as far as the elite are concerned. Why would this change now?"
In the next few weeks, we will try to move from this animated but general debate to some more focused posts on striking developments in security, surveillance, the technology that drives them and the laws that enable them.

HEADLINE: DirecTV Reports Its First Drop in U.S. Subscribers

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: The company said it more than made up for the loss by adding subscribers in Latin America. Over all, DirecTV reported a 1.4 percent increase in net income, to $711 million, for the second quarter. 

 BODY:
DirecTV on Thursday reported its first drop in net subscribers to its service in the United States, highlighting the challenges for pay television providers in a saturated marketplace.
The company said that it more than made up for the decline by adding a record number of subscribers in Latin America. Over all, DirecTV reported a 1.4 percent increase in net income, to $711 million, or $1.09 a share, in the second quarter of the year, from $701 million, or 91 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
Michael White, the chief executive of DirecTV, said in a statement that the growth in operating profit was "an early indication of successfully executing on our long-term strategy of striking a more optimal balance between growth and profitability."
In recent months, Mr. White has said that the company wants to focus on making more money from current subscribers in the United States, rather than on recruiting new ones. DirecTV is already the country's largest provider of satellite television service, with nearly 20 million subscribers. It lost 52,000 net subscribers in the United States in the second quarter, after having gained 81,000 a quarter earlier.
Analysts had expected a decline in the number of subscribers, though they thought it would be somewhat smaller. They also expected DirecTV to increase the average amount of revenue per subscriber - and there the company outperformed, with a year-over-year gain of 4 percent, to a total of $94.40 per subscriber per month.
DirecTV "appears to be benefiting from wise, economic consumer retention efforts - a long-term positive," wrote Vijay Jayant of the ISI Group in a note to investors on Thursday.
In Latin America, a much newer market, the company sacrificed gains in the average amount of revenue per subscriber to expand its base. In the second quarter, the company gained 645,000 net subscribers there, its best single-quarter result ever, a reflection in part of cheaper rates for packages of TV channels. In his statement, Mr. White pointed to "20 percent revenue growth in the quarter" in the market.
DirecTV's headline-making spat with Viacom over a new contract for its cable channels was not a factor in the earnings because the contract did not expire until the end of the quarter. Viacom's channels were blacked out for more than a week in July, and it is unclear whether DirecTV's subscriber totals were affected by the absence. DirecTV, like other TV providers, has been trying to contain programming costs in recent years.

HEADLINE: Under Pressure, Biggest Banks Rely on 3 Myths

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Megabanks are defending themselves by perpetuating myths and are trying to dismiss their increasing number of critics as populists, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Global megabanks have had a tough summer.
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and a vociferous opponent of restrictions on reckless risk-taking by big banks, presided over large losses because of exactly such behavior in the company's London office.
HSBC, which prided itself on a uniquely decentralized management model, was found to have violated - on a vast scale, over many years and in a uniquely decentralized manner - United States laws on money laundering and other actions; its head of global compliance resigned in July while on the witness stand during a Senate hearing.
And Barclays - which had bulked up on the strength of its capital-market activities - acknowledged that traders from that part of the company had conspired to rig Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate), a crucial benchmark for global interest rates. In the ensuing public outcry, its top two executives were forced out.
And last week Sanford I. Weill, who amassed a vast fortune building Citigroup and pushing to dismantle the constraints on such megabanks' activities, acknowledged that the entire exercise had been a mistake: "I'm suggesting that they be broken up so that the taxpayer will never be at risk, the depositors won't be at risk, the leverage of the banks will be something reasonable."
According to American Banker (whose coverage is available by subscription only), former top executives calling for the biggest banks to be broken up now include Philip J. Purcell, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley; John Reed, the former chairman of Citigroup; and David Komansky, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch.

Backed into a corner, representatives of these too-big-to-fail banks and their allies are forced to fall back on perpetuating three myths.
First, their critics are "populists" who do not understand banking or economics. But this is belied by the credentials of the people raising serious issues with how global megabanks currently operate.
American Banker highlights the critiques of Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and an experienced financial industry executive; Thomas Hoenig, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and now the No. 2 official at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and Sheila C. Bair, former head of the F.D.I.C. and now the chairwoman of her own Systemic Risk Council (of which I am a member).
As I wrote here last week, Sarah Bloom Raskin, a governor of the Federal Reserve, has emerged as an important voice calling for rethinking crucial aspects of big banks, including why they should have implicit government backing for their securities and trading operations. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, and Jon Huntsman, the former Republican presidential candidate, have also expressed articulate and well-informed proposals for making big banks less dangerous - primarily by forcing them to become smaller.
In this context, you should read Neil Barofsky's new book, "Bailout," a compelling critique of how the bailout was handled, including the treatment afforded to banks and the relative lack of effort that went into directly addressing problems with mortgages.
The pushback from the Obama administration is that Mr. Barofsky is some form of populist, in contrast to the supposedly responsible professionals of the Treasury Department (many of whom were previously or have subsequently become employees of large financial companies).
But a close reading of Mr. Barofsky's narrative and analysis confirms what was evident to anyone who studied the reports he produced when he was special inspector general overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Mr. Barofsky, a distinguished law-enforcement professional, was given the job of preventing fraud and abuse in the Congressionally mandated bailout program, and his efforts to ensure that TARP was run effectively and more in line with taxpayer interests were opposed by senior Treasury officials at almost every turn.
The true issue is not populism versus responsible bankers. Big banks have become a dangerous special interest with powerful friends. It is the reformers who are responsible. Executives who run megabanks - and anyone who supports their continued existence - are the ones who have become reckless and damaging to society.
The second myth is that a "cost-benefit analysis" would show that the Dodd-Frank financial reforms are not worth pursuing. This is actually a clever - or perhaps devious - legal strategy that is being pursued in a low-profile but effective manner. Even well-informed people in Washington frequently have no idea how much damage this myth can still cause within the rule-writing process.
Fortunately, Dennis Kelleher and his colleagues at Better Markets are fighting hard against this myth. In a report released this week, Mr. Kelleher, Stephen Hall and Katelynn Bradley point out that the industry never wants to take into account the real costs of the crisis - millions of jobs lost, growth derailed, lives disrupted and enormous damage to our public finances.
We had a frank discussion of this report at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics on Monday, and I was struck by how many people have a hard time getting their minds around the scale of the damage wrought by large financial institutions that got out of control.
This relates also to the third myth - the assertion that financial reform will hurt our growth prospects. Again, as laid bare by Better Markets, it was reckless risk-taking at the heart of our financial system that led to the largest crisis since the 1930s; the damage will be with us for a long time.
Some decisive government actions helped to reduce the impact on the real economy, and we avoided a second Great Depression.
But, as Mr. Barofsky makes clear, there is almost nothing about these bailout measures that should make you feel good. Putting the big banks back on their feet, with essentially no conditions requiring real change, was a mistake - reinforcing the moral hazard and implicit government subsidies that are now at the heart of our financial system.
Today's global megabanks are too big to manage. It is not "the market" in any sense that keeps these companies at their current scale; this is the largest and most dangerous government subsidy scheme on record. Such subsidies can only be ended by government action.
It is time to break up the largest banks. Make them small enough and simple enough to fail.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Taxing

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
Seizing on the results of a nonpartisan policy study, President Obama criticized his Republican rival Mitt Romney on Wednesday for offering a tax plan that would return to top-down policies that benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor and the middle class. Jackie Calmes writes that Mr. Obama was referring to a joint study by the Tax Policy Center of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, whose analysis concluded that a tax plan like the one Mr. Romney has offered would not offer relief to the vast majority of Americans.
The House voted on Wednesday to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for all incomes, pitting the Republican plan against a Senate-passed Democratic plan that would allow rates to rise on earnings over $250,000. Jonathan Weisman writes that the maneuvering gives both parties some political cover for the economic calamity expected in January, when the cuts are expected to expire, an event that will coincide with deep automatic spending cuts if lawmakers do not reach an agreement.
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta issued a strong warning to Iran over its nuclear program on Wednesday in Israel. Elisabeth Bumiller and Jodi Rudoren write that tough talk from Israel in recent days has raised concerns within the Obama administration that Israel might be planning to launch a military strike against Iran as early as this fall.
Scott Shane reports that the F.B.I.'s sweeping criminal investigation of intelligence disclosures hascrippled news media coverage of national security issues as the Senate considers legislation intended to curb officials' interactions with reporters. In the battle over government secrets, Republicans including Mr. Romney have seized on the leak issue to criticize Mr. Obama's security record.
Rebecca Berg profiles Representative Frank D. Lucas of Oklahoma, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, who finds himself in the spotlight as House Republicans try to resolve an intraparty dispute over the farm bill.
Around the Web:
Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts is now a colonel in the National Guard, The Sun Chronicle reported. Mr. Brown, who has been in the guard for 32 years and had previously been a lieutenant colonel, said he did not know if he would ever become a general.
Happening in Washington:
Economic data expected Thursday include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed by the Chamber of Commerce's quarterly economic briefing at 9. June factory orders and weekly mortgage rates are expected at 10.
The House will convene at 9 a.m and lawmakers are expected to consider a disaster assistance bill.
At 10 a.m., the Senate Finance Committee will meet to mark up a package of expired or expiring tax breaks.
At 3 p.m., the oversight subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee will examine how corruption affects the development of Afghanistan's security forces.

TOP STORIES 
As Banking Titans Reflect on Their Errors, Few Pay Any Price | Like a defecting Syrian colonel or converted climate-change denier, Sanford I. Weill has been heartily welcomed among those on the right side of history, Jesse Eisinger writes in his column, The Trade.
The sheer inappropriateness of the vessel, the breathtaking audacity of the messenger, can oddly confer authority on an idea. If even the creator of Citigroup now believes that the giant banks should be broken up, who could not believe it?
His belated conversion is only the latest from the "corner office to Zuccotti Park" banking crowd. The former merger aficionado Philip J. Purcell, who headed up the pithily named Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover, wrote a recent Wall Street Journal opinion article suggesting that shareholders should break up the banks. Sallie Krawcheck, a former top-ranking Wall Street executive, recently criticized big banks. Two other former top executives, David H. Komansky and John S. Reed, have attacked the current financial system.
These converts tend to have followed a similar path. They participated in the merger frenzy and pushed deregulation when the getting was good. They departed from finance's sweet embrace sometimes involuntarily, ousted in power struggles. And they stayed quiet, or did little, throughout the debates on how to fix the system when the nation was struggling over the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul.

MF Global Trustees Differ Over Amount Customers Will be Repaid | An MF Global trustee damped hopes that customers would recover all of their missing money from the bankrupt brokerage firm, telling lawmakers on Wednesday that a $1.6 billion gap remained.
In testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee, James W. Giddens predicted that clients could recoup in the "90 percent range" of their cash. Mr. Giddens, the trustee tasked with plugging the gap in customer money, has so far retrieved about 80 percent of the funds.
"We'd very much like to pay every customer 100 percent, however, it will be a time-consuming, difficult and uphill battle," he told lawmakers. Mr. Giddens also updated lawmakers on his concern about wrongdoing at the top rungs of MF Global.

HEADLINE: Aug. 1: Obama Extends Electoral College Advantage

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Barack Obama's standing in the FiveThirtyEight forecast reached its strongest position to date on Tuesday as a result of favorable polls in a set of swing states. 

 BODY:
Barack Obama's standing in the FiveThirtyEight forecast reached its strongest position to date on Tuesday as a result of favorable polls in a set of swing states. The forecast model now gives Mr. Obama a 70.8 percent chance of winning the Electoral College, up from 69.0 percent on Monday and from 65.0 percent last Tuesday.
Three of the polls were conducted by Quinnipiac University in conjunction with The New York Times and CBS News. The polls gave Mr. Obama leads of 6 points in each of Ohio and Florida, and an 11-point lead in Pennsylvania.
In each state, the polls are at the high end of the range of numbers produced by other polling firms. As we frequently advise, no one set of polls -- no matter how reputable the pollster -- should be read as gospel. Differences in the numbers from survey firm to survey firm often reflect sampling error or methodological differences rather than any fundamental change in the condition of the race.
Nevertheless, Ohio and Pennsylvania polls are part of a consensus of polls showing Mr. Obama ahead in these states by varying margins. Mr. Obama has led 11 of the 13 polls in Ohio since May 1, and he has led all 11 polls conducted in Pennsylvania during this period.
The Florida polls have been more equivocal: Mr. Obama has held 10 leads, versus six for Mitt Romney. Still, Florida is typically a somewhat Republican-leaning state. In an election that was truly even-money, you'd expect Mr. Romney to be leading in more of the Florida polls rather than the other way around.
Ohio, for that matter, is also typically Republican-leaning relative to the rest of the country, although only by a point or two. One can debate the merits of different polling methodologies -- but in Ohio, it has been a debate between polls showing Mr. Obama ahead by a narrow margin, and those showing him on top by a somewhat larger one.
In another swing state poll, by the firm EPIC/MRA in Michigan, Mr. Obama held a 6-point lead. That poll was broadly consistent with our model's prior take on Michigan, which also gave him about a 6-point lead there -- although the polling firm in question had previously shown relatively good numbers for Mr. Romney, including a slim lead in a poll it conducted of the state in June.
Most of the polls in these states, including the most recent set by Quinnipiac and The New York Times, were conducted among likely voters, which are generally less favorable to Democrats than those conducted among all registered voters. That makes Mr. Obama's leads there a bit more robust.
Mr. Obama's polls in less competitive states -- and in national tracking numbers -- have been less strong. He received relatively weak numbers on Tuesday in polls of Arizona and Connecticut, for instance. But these states are unlikely to be decisive in the Electoral College.
Our forecast model is starting to calculate a gap between the swing state polls and those elsewhere. As a result, it gives Mr. Obama a 4.6 percent chance of winning the Electoral College despite losing the national popular vote, but just a 1.2 percent chance to the same happening for Mr. Romney.
Most of the advantage comes from Mr. Obama's numbers in a few particular swing states, including Ohio and Florida. In the table below, I've listed a comparison between the model's forecast in each state as of Tuesday, and that on June 7, when we debuted this year's forecast model.
The most noticeable change has been in Florida, where Mr. Obama has gone from being 2.3 points down in the forecast to 0.8 points ahead. Correspondingly, his chances of winning the state have improved to 55 percent from 38 percent, according to the forecast.
In Ohio, meanwhile, Mr. Obama's projected margin of victory has improved to 3.4 points from 1.1 points. His numbers have also improved in Nevada and, to a lesser extent, Colorado.
Other swing states, including Michigan, Wisconsin and New Hampshire, have shifted slightly to Mr. Romney during this period. But these states are not quite as important to the electoral math as the ones where Mr. Obama has made gains.
In Michigan and Wisconsin, Mr. Romney has improved his position somewhat -- but he started from behind in those states, and most polls continue to show him behind there by a margin in the mid-single digits. New Hampshire, meanwhile, contains only four electoral votes.
What accounts for Mr. Obama's numbers in Florida and Ohio is hard to say - I personally am a bit surprised by the numbers, especially in Florida where the economy remains quite weak.
Advertising spending is one potential culprit. Although advertising spending is hard to track, especially with the proliferation of "SuperPACs," most analyses suggest that Mr. Obama's campaign has spent more on advertising in these states in recent weeks.
The effects of advertising can be ephemeral, however, which is one reason to take a longer view of the polls, and the other factors that are pertinent in the state, rather than to fixate on the most recent set of numbers. Meanwhile, it is far from clear that Mr. Obama's campaign and his affiliated "Super PACs" can sustain an advertising advantage throughout the balance of the campaign. If so, Mr. Romney might poised to rebound in them.
Nevertheless, Mr. Romney's campaign is not working from the position of strength in these states that it might have envisioned. It's the vote in November that counts - not the polls in August - but they represent the most conspicuous sign that incumbent presidents are hard to defeat, and that Mr. Romney has some work left to do to win the Electoral College.

HEADLINE: Prepaid Cellphones Are Cheaper. Why Aren't They Popular?

BYLINE: BRIAN X. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Prepaid phone plans, where you pay the full price for a cellphone and then pay cheaper monthly rates without a contract, seem to offer what most budget-conscious people want. So why haven't they really caught on? 

 BODY:
 Prepaid phone plans, where you pay the full price for a cellphone and then pay lower monthly rates without a contract, seem to offer what most budget-conscious people want. So why haven't they really caught on?
Contract-free phone plans account for only 23 percent of the wireless customers in the United States phone market, according to the research firm Ovum. The rest are subscribers locked into contracts and paying higher monthly fees.
That's despite the fact that prepaid phone plans are generally a better deal for most people, who can save hundreds of dollars over the course of two years compared to a contract plan.
The iPhone with a two-year contract on AT&T, for example, costs $200 for the handset and then upward of $90 a month for the plan; over two years, including the cost of the phone, customers pay at least $2,360. With a prepaid plan on Virgin Mobile, which is owned by Sprint, the iPhone costs $650 for the handset, and then $30 a month, including unlimited data (the type of data plan that people are happier with, according to J.D. Power). Over two years, that would cost about $1,370.
So why aren't more people going prepaid?
The bait that reels most people into more expensive contracts is the subsidized price of a phone, said Tero Kuittinen, an independent analyst and a vice president of Alekstra, a company that helps customers manage their cellphone bills.
"Right now, consumers don't do the math, and they have a lot of resistance to paying $500 to $600 upfront, and they'd rather pay $100 upfront and then overspend," he said. "That psychology has worked for hundreds of years, and it's still working."
There are less obvious reasons, too. Another factor is that carriers aren't marketing prepaid plans as heavily because they want more customers on contract plans.
"They deliberately don't market their prepaid plans," said Jan Dawson, an Ovum analyst. "They want you on postpaid plans that deliver higher revenue per user, on contracts that are going to lock you in."
Sprint, for instance, hasn't begun marketing the iPhone on Virgin Mobile's prepaid plans, even though that offering was introduced in June, (though it says it does plan to eventually).
Mr. Dawson added that smaller carriers that offer prepaid plans, like Leap Wireless or MetroPCS, have tiny marketing budgets compared to the big carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless, so their cheaper phone plans simply aren't as well known.
Finally, until recently, prepaid phone companies haven't offered handsets that are as compelling as the ones you can get with a contract. Only in the last few months did the iPhone and some big Android phones become available through prepaid phone companies.
Prepaid plans don't seem as cool now, but because phones on prepaid plans are generally getting better, and because people are always looking for ways to cut costs in a bad economy, Ovum says it expects American prepaid customers to increase to 29 percent of overall wireless subscribers by the year 2016.

HEADLINE: For Wall Street, Real Pain When the Fed Fails to Act

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: A lack of new stimulus moves by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank this week may have a direct and painful impact on the chief source of revenue at investment banks on both sides of the Atlantic. 

 BODY:
Looks like the central bankers just destroyed Wall Street's 2012 bonus season. 
Both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank decided this week to hold off on any big new initiatives to stimulate markets and the sluggish economies of the United States and Europe. The lack of action may have a direct and painful impact on the chief source of revenue at investment banks on both sides of the Atlantic. Since the 2008 financial crisis, banks' bond trading profits have soared when the Fed and the European Central Bank have announced, and then executed, radical moves to revive economic conditions. As that stimulus wanes, that trading income drops off.
The link between Fed stimulus and Wall Street earnings became apparent soon after the financial crisis of 2008. Faced with jittery markets and an economy that was not responding well to meeker modes of stimulus, the Fed bought $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed bonds, mostly in 2009. In that year, Wall Street bond trading operations, which provide the bulk of profits at such firms, produced some of their strongest results ever. The five biggest trading banks in America together reported $78 billion of bond trading revenue in 2009, the year of "quantitative easing," the term used for the Fed's bond buying spree. Goldman Sachs' fixed-income division reported revenue of $21.9 billion in 2009, up from $9.3 billion in 2008. But in 2010, as the Fed magic wore off, Goldman Sachs' fixed income revenue fell to $13.7 billion. 
 Big trading banks are particularly well positioned to profit when central banks act aggressively. The firms help make markets in bonds and derivatives. When the banks' clients see the Fed take bold steps, they feel encouraged and come off the sidelines to buy more bonds. This increases the amount of business that flows through Wall Street, but it also lifts the prices of the bonds the banks hold, creating profits for the traders. The banks also deliberately increase the size of their bond holdings when they are convinced that central bank actions will lift markets.
Since 2009, the Fed has carried out two additional, but lesser, monetary initiatives. The next time central bank stimulus appeared to have a strong impact on trading profits was in the first quarter of this year. To help European banks fund themselves, the European Central Bank provided cheap, emergency credit to the Continent's lenders, first in December 2011 and then in February of this year. Investor sentiment rebounded, bonds rallied, and, on cue, fixed-income traders were soon racking up big profits. 
Deutsche Bank's fixed-income revenue was $3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2012, up 225 percent from the fourth quarter's $1 billion. Socit Gnrale's jumped 150 percent over the same period. In the United States, Morgan Stanley did particularly well in the first quarter. But soon the markets decided the European Central Bank had not done enough. Bonds sagged, and banks' fixed-income revenue flagged. Morgan Stanley's second-quarter fixed-income revenue was down 70 percent from the first quarter, while Socit Gnrale's halved.
Still, the central banks may yet act with force this year. Both the Fed and the European Central Bank made it clear this week that more forceful initiatives could happen later if economic and market stresses worsen. Many on Wall Street will be hanging on those assurances.

HEADLINE: Japan Widens Inquiry Into Insider Trading

BYLINE: HIROKO TABUCHI and PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A Japanese investigation into insider trading has extended onto the trading floors of some of Wall Street's largest companies, including Goldman Sachs. 

 BODY:
TOKYO - A government investigation into insider trading in Japan has extended onto the trading floors of some of the largest Wall Street companies, including Goldman Sachs, UBS and Deutsche Bank.
A governing party committee has asked regulators to scrutinize suspicious trading activity before at least 12 public offering announcements over the past three years, said Tsutomu Okubo, head of the financial affairs committee of the Democratic Party. The committee has been working with regulators to stiffen insider trading laws in Japan.
Among the trades being investigated are those made by Goldman clients who bet against All Nippon Airways just days before the airline's stock offering last month. A company's share price tends to drop when a new share issuance is announced, especially by a struggling company, because it dilutes shares without much prospect of a boost to business from the capital that is raised.
The push for more disclosure came as Japan's Financial Services Agency metered out a strikingly lenient censure of Nomura for leaking sensitive information to clients ahead of public share offerings.
Nomura has been issued a business improvement order under which it would be required to take measures to bolster its internal compliance, and periodically report to regulators on its progress, the agency said in a statement Friday.
Two top executives of Nomura, the largest investment bank in Japan, have already resigned after acknowledging that in three cases, its sales staff had tipped off its mutual fund customers about stock offerings that the bank was handling for its corporate clients.
Some experts had called for far stricter measures, including temporary termination orders for Nomura's offending businesses.
The country's financial services minister, Tadahiro Matsushita, said that while he called on Nomura to ''bear heavy responsibility'' over its repeated leaks of information, the agency also saw Nomura's management reshuffle as a sign the firm was prepared to clean up its act.
He strongly hoped Nomura ''will press ahead with reforms to rebuild its company structure fundamentally,'' Mr. Matsushita told reporters.
The Nomura scandal has further undermined faith in Japanese stock markets, experts say, which remain some of the world's most depressed after the global financial crisis.
''The reckless pursuit of short-term profits by a handful of actors is destroying the reputation and value of the entire market,'' said Mr. Okubo, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley.
 Governments across the globe are cracking down on insider trading. In Britain, the Financial Services Authority has become far more aggressive, bringing a rising number of insider trading cases, while U.S. government prosecutors in New York City have charged at least 70 people with illegal trading over the past three years.
In Japan, Mr. Okubo said that his committee was interested in trades made by funds, brokerage firms and asset managers before a string of public share offerings, beginning in 2009. The committee obtained data from the Tokyo exchange on short-selling - in other words, betting against stocks - that occurred before a list of public offerings. Mr. Okubo said he had forwarded that list to the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission.
Among the offerings on the list is the $2.6 billion issuance announced by All Nippon Airways on July 3. Filings made with the Tokyo exchange show short-sale positions on the stock taken out in the name of Nomura, starting June 25, eight days before the announcement, and in the name of Goldman beginning a day before.
In approximately three years before the All Nippon offering, neither Goldman nor Nomura made filings of short-sale positions on All Nippon shares. The trading volume of those shares jumped before the issuance announcement, reaching a three-month high the day before, according to separate Tokyo Stock Exchange data.
Both Goldman and Nomura, who were underwriters for All Nippon's issuance, confirmed that the trades had been undertaken on behalf of clients but declined to comment further. They denied that information on the issuance could have leaked from their investment banking divisions to those clients.
 Also on Mr. Okubo's list are short positions taken in the name of Deutsche Bank and UBS on shares of Nippon Sheet Glass before its $500 million stock offering, announced Aug. 24, 2010. Both Deutsche and UBS first filed short positions, most likely on behalf of clients, starting Aug. 6, according to Mr. Okubo and the exchange filings. Neither bank filed short positions on Nippon Sheet Glass in the year before that, the data show. The banks declined to comment. Neither bank was involved in underwriting the offering.
Analysts warn against assuming that all shorting activity made before a public offering is based on insider information. ''It is not rocket science to pick out companies that are in danger of issuing equity,'' Nicholas Smith, Japan strategist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, wrote in a note to clients in May.
''Shorting stocks on credit analysis that indicates that an offering is in the offing is a legitimate - and valuable - part of the pricing mechanism of financial markets,'' Mr. Smith said. ''What is not legitimate is trading on leaks of nonpublic information.''
But Mr. Okubo insisted that many of the trading patterns were suspicious. He said it was crucial that regulators learn who was behind the short-selling leading up to recent offerings, much of which remained unaccounted for.
Nomura has not faced any insider trading charges because, unlike the United States, Japan does not punish tipsters, as long as they do not trade on the information. But a string of the bank's clients have decided to take their business elsewhere since the scandal, prompting the bank to reshuffle its management and promise an overhaul of its internal compliance in a bid to regain the confidence of investors.
Nobutoshi Yamanouchi, a partner at the Tokyo office of the law firm Jones Day, said financial regulators badly needed to convince global investors that the authorities had the power to break into the cushy inner circle of Japanese finance and root out insider trading. The extent of regulators' actions against Nomura was crucial, and little short of a business termination order could convince investors that Japanese regulators were serious about a crackdown, he said.
''They need to be able to show that they can make Japanese markets attractive for everyone again, not just for a select group of insiders,'' Mr. Yamanouchi said.

HEADLINE: Ad Watch: Obama Campaign Seeks to Recast Romney as Tax Raiser

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: "He pays less. You pay more" is the theme of a new Obama campaign ad, which seeks to trumpet the results of a new study of Mitt Romney's tax plan. 

 BODY:
5:40 p.m. | Updated The Obama campaign is wasting no time getting an ad on the air touting a new study showing that Mitt Romney's plans would mean additional large tax cuts for millionaires at the expense of other Americans. The spot, titled "Stretch" takes a double-barreled approach, beginning by reminding viewers of Mr. Romney's own tax history, before pivoting to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, two centrist Washington-based policy research organizations. The ad will air in eight battleground states.

0:06 Higher Taxes Than Romney
Mr. Romney and his wife paid an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent on $21.6 million in adjusted gross income in 2010, a rate typical of households earning about $80,000, because his income came largely from investments, which are taxed at a lower rate than salaries and wages. 
0:17 Tax Breaks for Millionaires
Mr. Romney's plan would cut income tax rates by 20 percent among other tax breaks; he promises to make the plan "revenue neutral," meaning that the lost revenue would be offset so it would not increase the deficit, but he has not said specifically how he would do that. The Tax Policy Center, filling in the gaps, assumed that he would have to eliminate various tax breaks like mortgage deductions that would result in a net tax increase for 95 percent of taxpayers while the wealthiest 5 percent pay less. 
0:21 Taxing the Middle Class
He has not proposed raising taxes on middle class families by $2,000 as the ad suggests, but that is what the campaign argues would be the effect of the plan he has outlined, citing a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Those in middle income brackets would pay on average $546 more a year, according to the study, and upper-middle class taxpayers would pay $1,880 more, while the taxes of the richest 1 percent would be cut by $29,282. Mr. Romney's advisers said the study was flawed because it did not account for economic growth they believe would be stimulated by a separate plan to restructure corporate taxes and by lowered deficits. Moreover, they said Mr. Romney would not necessarily pick the same measures to draw in more tax revenue as the center chose. And they called the study biased because one of the three co-authors, Adam Looney, worked for Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Another, William G. Gale, worked for the elder President George Bush but has publicly supported ending the tax cuts enacted by President George W. Bush in favor of a broader tax code overhaul. Still, the director of the Tax Policy Center, Donald Marron, was a member of the younger Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.
Scorecard
Mr. Obama is trying to turn the tax argument around. The Supreme Court recently upheld his health care law by defining its penalty for not buying insurance as a tax, and he has supported letting tax rates rise back to their level in the 1990s on income over $250,000. With this ad, he paints his opponent as a tax increaser and skewers him for seemingly favoring the rich over the middle class.

HEADLINE: More on Gas Drilling, Peer Review and Public Health

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A closer look at the debate over the health impacts of gas drilling. 

 BODY:
 Aug. 3, 9:34 a.m. | Updated with reply from Sandra Steingraber | 
A recurring focus here of late has been the fractious nexus of policy, politics and science related to the nation's gas drilling boom.
In this arena, the main disagreements between industry and drilling opponents have centered on the risk of chemicals or gasescaping from drilling operations and any risks these activities pose to public health. (Much more is being debated, of course, including the use and handling of water, the extent of beneficial or harmful impacts on local economies and the nation's economic prospects, the pace and extent of federal and state regulation and more.)
Here are two updates on the health debate.
One is Sandra Steingraber's defense of the decision, discussed here last week, by the Cornell University doctoral candidate Elaine Hill to discuss at a Democrat-organized anti-fracking forum her unpublished conclusion that the health of newborns appeared to be affected by the proximity of their mothers to wells in Pennsylvania. Steingraber is a much-lauded environmental* campaigner and public health analyst at Ithaca College who has become a prominent critic of New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for signaling that he is going to approve limited fracking in the state. 
The other update comes from the most important journalist in gas country in the Northeast, Tom Wilber, whose book, "Under the Surface," and Shale Gas Review blog are essential reading these days.
Wilber dug in on some of the assertions made about breast cancer in the "The Sky is Pink," the latest video produced by the filmmaker and anti-gas-drilling campaigner Josh Fox.
Read below, after excerpts from Steingraber's piece on Elaine Hill (and a link to the full piece), for an excerpt from Wilber's most recent post, in which he calls Fox's approach to Texas cancer data "rhetorical recklessness." 
I also encourage you to read Wilber's preceding post, which provides a thorough look at the Environmental Protection Agency's final chemical analysis of water issues in Dimock, Pa., which has become one of the prime focal points in the fracking fight. The agency found that 5 of 64 homes tested had levels of several chemicals in their water that were sufficiently high to justify intervention (filtering).
Here's Sandra Steingraber:
Your recent blog compares and contrasts the claims made by industry-funded reports on the risks of fracking with those made by academic scientists who speak about their data in advance of publication. In so doing, you imply there is an equivalency of bias or motivation.
There is not.
Polluting industries have long ministered to their particular public relations problems and sought to delay regulatory action (or outright prohibition) by underwriting studies and reports - and sometimes entire university-based institutes. The resulting publications almost never find serious evidence for harm. In the field of environmental health, we refer to these efforts as "cigarette science."
Throughout several decades of the 20th century, for example, the lead paint industry funded researchers to investigate the effect of their product on the brain development of children. Not surprisingly, this research uncovered few serious problems. At the same time, the industry denounced independent research that did find serious problems as anti-lead propaganda. (At one point, the industry argued, based on its research, that the problem was not that the consumption of lead paint made children stupid but that stupid children ate paint.)
I think filmmaker Josh Fox is exactly right to say, as he does in "The Sky is Pink," that gas industry denials of harm fit into the narrative template of the tobacco story. (We could also call it the lead paint story. Or the asbestos story. Or the PCB story. Or the DDT story. See David Gee, Late Lessons from Early Warnings .)
On the other hand, academic researchers who are not on the payroll of industry and who are trying in good faith to understand the possible public health effects of a new technology - which is being unrolled without advance demonstration of safety - can sometimes find results that are frightening enough to warrant immediate public conversation.
This is the story of Elaine Hill, the young Ph.D. student from Cornell who has conducted the first population-based, observational study of the public health effects of fracking. Andrew, I would like you to place yourself in her shoes for a minute.
Suppose you took a close look at hospital data on newborn health before and after drilling and fracking operations arrived in communities (in states where the shale gas boom is booming away). Suppose you mapped the locations of individual gas wells, looked at the distance between the wells and the homes where the mothers of those babies lived during their pregnancies. Suppose you analyzed the data carefully. Suppose you found significant effects - bigger even than the impact of cigarette smoking on newborn health. Suppose you took every care to eliminate confounding variables and still believed that you had evidence to suggest that newborn babies were being harmed by fracking operations. At the very least, your research seems to raise serious questions in urgent need of answers.
Now suppose that you happen to live in a state where fracking is not allowed. Suppose it appears, however, that the governor of your state is giving every indication that he is preparing to life the moratorium - even though no a priori attempt has been made to evaluate the impact of fracking on public health.
Suppose it becomes clear that the governor is going to make his decision before your research can wend its way through the peer review process and get published.
Suppose you've already presented your findings at two academic conferences and in one poster presentation and that it has been warmly received by your academic colleagues.
Suppose you have an opportunity to present your research to the public - and to your state's senators - in advance of the governor's decision.
Would you take it? Could you look at yourself in the mirror if you did not? And would you sabotage your academic career if you did?
Let me say clearly - as I did in my own Senate testimony - that I was the one who suggested to Elaine that she consider testifying. As you quoted me in saying, I think she made a brave and ethical decision.
At the same time, let me also say - and I think I speak for Elaine Hill as well - that I'm a big believer in peer review. Most academic researchers are. But there can't be double standards. If peer review is required for all public utterances and assertions about the possible environmental and health effects of fracking, then let's strip all the non-peer review studies from the 1,537-page planning document for fracking - the supplemental generic environmental impact statement (sGEIS) - that is the science on which will rest Governor Cuomo's upcoming decision to permit or prohibit fracking.
If we need to wait for data to be peer reviewed before we act on it - which is a great idea - then we need to maintain New York's moratorium on fracking while Hill's data, and the other health effects studies now in the planning stage, make their way into a peer-reviewed journals. The sGEIS itself needs to be sent out for peer review.
If the Governor permits fracking on the basis of an sGEIS full of unvetted, un-peer-reviewed data, then he can't say the decision was based on science.
There's much more to her comment. To read it in full please upload or view the piece on Slideshare here. I've also posted Steingraber's relevant statement at the Senate Democrats' Manhattan fracking forum last month.
In his post on Josh Fox, cancer and fracking, Wilber credits the filmmaker for exposing established issues related to the integrity of wells and hazards from migrating gas, then swings to a critique of Fox's discussion of cancer risk:
Had Fox left it at that, "The Sky is Pink" would have been an effective and persuasive spotlight on the industry's attempt to cloud the facts. But he doesn't. After making analogies between the tobacco and drilling industries, Fox states this:

In Texas, as throughout the United States, cancer rates fell. Except in one place: in the Barnett Shale. The five counties where there was the most drilling saw a rise in breast cancer throughout the counties.

Without further exploration or analysis, Fox ridicules a pink drilling rig. Presented in the context of the film, it's emblematic of the disingenuousness of the industry's attempts to solve everything with public relations, (which is indeed is an easy target for lampoon).
The approach is cinematically effective; the pink rig juxtaposed with the reference to the cancer registry data is sure to elicit a gasp from industry cynics. It also plays off the title of the film - "The Sky is Pink" - suggesting the preposterousness of the industry's capacity to give a damn about the facts. These are deft executions by Fox as a filmmaker. But Fox also presents himself as a journalist; and the breast cancer reference has opened his entire work to a critical offensive not only from the industry scholars and discerning students of public and environmental health, but from the mainstream media.
Fox's primary source of information, as noted in a follow-up defense of his work, was a report in the Denton Record Chronicle by Peggy Heinkel-Wolfe. The story, August 31, 2011, reports that the average rate of breast cancer in six counties rose from 58.7 cases per 100,000 people in 2005 to about 60.7 per 100,000 in 2008. The story adds that the rates are below the national average, and that researchers did not attribute a cause, although it might involve "many factors."
Public records compiled from cancer registry data give a snapshot of cancers diagnosed in given places at given times. (I learned this from years of fist hand reporting on several statistically significant leukemia clusters over industrial TCE plumes under several neighborhoods in Broome County New York.) But they are not a tool intended for or capable of accounting for myriad risk factors and demographics necessary for a meaningful epidemiology study. Cancer exposures typically must be accounted for over time (prior to diagnosis). So patients' histories, life styles, occupations, and migrations need to be factored in. Also, how can one risk be separated from another? Smoking? Diet? Age? Health Care access? Poverty level? Are people moving into the area with these risk factors from another area?
When taking into account all these kinds of factors, sometimes patterns emerge from cancer registry data that are invisible in the vagueness of the big picture; and sometimes patterns that seem significant on face value disappear. Yet Fox's film - highlighting a map showing blocks of red over the Barnett Shale representing elevated breast cancer rates - fails to mention, much less account for, any of this. It's the very kind of rhetorical recklessness that Fox blames on the industry, and it has prompted similar kinds of criticism.
"Saying something causes breast cancer is like yelling fire in a theater. It should be only said when true," states John Hanger, who headed Pennsylvania's efforts to regulate the shale gas industry under Gov. Ed. Rendell. (Hanger was a primary pursuer of the ultimately unsuccessful attempt to order Cabot Oil and Gas to build a waterline to Dimock to compensate residents for an aquifer damaged by drilling-related methane migration.) You can read hisblog on the Sky is Pink here.
Sandra Steingraber, an ecologist, author, and fracking opponent, defended Fox by noting that, just because something is not known conclusively to cause cancer, doesn't mean that it should be excluded as a suspect. In her view, the numbers in Fox's film warrant a closer look:

The larger point made in "The Sky is Pink" that there is something unusual about the longer-term breast cancer incidence patterns in the counties overlying the Barnett Shale where gas drilling is most intense. These patterns clearly need to be investigated further. 
But does fracking cause cancer? The back and forth between those for and those against was predictable. Less predicable was backlash from an Associated Press reporter Kevin Begos, who called Fox on his lack of methodology. In his July 22 report, Begos cites, among others, Simon Craddock Lee, a professor of medical anthropology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas who characterized Fox's reading of breast cancer rates as way off base. Lee called the claims of an increase "a classic case of the ecological fallacy" because they falsely suggest that breast cancer is linked to just one factor. In fact, diet, lifestyle and access to health care also play key roles.
I believe that Begos' report reflects healthy (and growing) pressure from the mainstream news media to raise the bar of accountability on both sides for readers growing tired of a partisan back and forth and looking for more sophistication in reporting. Weighing the long-term environmental consequences of spills, water consumption, methane migration, waste production and disposal, truck traffic etc. is not simple - it requires manpower, reporting, transparency, and enforcement. Gauging effects on public health is even more problematic. Researchers must test changes in an elusive and migrant human population with logistical and cultural barriers to examination. The tools of epidemiology - statistics and probability - are abstractions that defy the craving for black and white arguments that easily suite the rhetorical purposes of either side of the argument. Assigning responsibility for dead fish, unhealthy air, biological fragmentation - can be politically charged. Epidemiology studies that connect human disease and mortality to industrial factors are sure to grab even more attention.
As Fox may (or may not) be learning, using incomplete data to make sweeping observations may do his cause more harm than good. That said, pressing for more information is a worthwhile pursuit. Lack of a clear picture of public health risks from fracking should not dampen public discussion that provokes the kind of study that eventually leads to answers.
Click here for the rest of Wilber's thorough post. I couldn't agree more.
Here's an addendum that brings together these two discussions. In reviewing information on cancer in drilling zones, I noticed that a letter on health risks and gas drilling sent by Steingraber and other signatories to Gov. Cuomo last December used far more definitive language than that in Fox's new video to describe the cancer question in Texas:
Preliminary evidence points to high rates of cancer in intensively drilled areas. In Texas, breast cancer rates rose significantly among women living in the six counties with the most intensive gas drilling (Heinkel-Wolfe, 2011). By contrast, over the same time period, breast cancer rates declined within the rest of Texas. 
The reference is not a scientific study, but a news article that, as Wilber's piece shows, says nothing of substance about a link between drilling and cancer. 
I spoke on the phone last week to Simon Craddock Lee, the cancer analyst at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center cited above, about breast cancer in Texas and he pointed to the reality that raw rates of cancer incidence and deaths say nothing about causality, given the mix of social and environmental factors in play. He added, "It would be really hard to hide a cancer cluster if there was one. "
I also asked for input from Texas's Department of State Health Services on the findings of the news article cited by Fox and Steingraber and the general state of understanding of cancer rates in the state. A spokeswoman, Christine Mann, provided a helpful and detailed reply that I'm adding as a comment below to conserve space here.
I sent a note to Steingraber a couple of days ago asking whether - given what's been said about breast cancer and gas drilling by Texas cancer experts - she had any reservations about the way the Cuomo letter was worded. She said she'll reply once this post is up. 
 Aug. 3, 9:27 a.m. | Updated | Sandra Steingraber has sent a long response to my question about the definitiveness of the language she used in the letter to Gov. Cuomo to describe breast cancer trends in the Barnett Shale region of Texas. Have a look at the Cuomo letter and the reply here (posted as a separate document because of its length) and judge the merits of her argument:
 5:22 p.m. | Updated above | A commenter noted appropriately that my initial descriptor for Steingraber - anti-cancer campaigner - was, well, silly, at best. I have changed it to environmental campaigner.

HEADLINE: Japan Widens Inquiry Into Insider Trading

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI and PETER LATTMAN; Hiroko Tabuchi reported from Tokyo and Peter Lattman from New York.

 BODY:
TOKYO - A government investigation into insider trading here has extended onto the trading floors of some of Wall Street's largest companies, including Goldman Sachs, UBS and Deutsche Bank.
Regulators are scrutinizing suspicious trading activity ahead of at least 12 public offering announcements over the last three years, said Tsutomu Okubo, head of the ruling Democratic Party's financial affairs committee. The committee has been working with regulators to stiffen insider trading laws in Japan.
Among the trades being investigated are those made by Goldman clients who bet against All Nippon Airways just days before the airline's stock offering last month. A company's share price typically drops when a new share issuance is announced. 
Mr. Okubo's push for more disclosure comes as Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission is set to discipline Nomura on Friday for mismanaging confidential information on share offerings. The commission is expected to issue an order and call for fundamental changes in the way the company, which is based in Tokyo, handles information, the Nikkei business daily reported.
Two top executives of Nomura, Japan's largest investment bank, have already resigned after acknowledging that in three cases, its sales staff tipped off its mutual fund customers about stock offerings that the bank was handling for its corporate clients.
The Nomura scandal has further undermined faith in Japanese stock markets, experts say, which remain some of the world's most depressed after the global financial crisis.
''The reckless pursuit of short-term profits by a handful of actors is destroying the reputation and value of the entire market,'' said Mr. Okubo, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley.
The hard line taken by Japanese regulators comes as governments across the globe continue to crack down on insider trading. In Britain, the Financial Services Authority has become far more aggressive, bringing a rising number of insider trading cases, while federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged at least 70 people with illegal trading over the last three years.
In Japan, Mr. Okubo said that his committee was interested in trades by funds, brokerage firms and asset managers ahead of a string of public share offerings since 2009. The committee obtained data from the Tokyo bourse on short-selling activity - in other words, betting against stocks - ahead of a list of public offerings. Mr. Okubo said he had forwarded that list to the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission.
Among offerings on the list is the $2.6 billion issuance announced by All Nippon Airways on July 3. Filings made with the Tokyo bourse show short-sale positions on the stock taken out in the name of Nomura from June 25, eight days before the announcement, and in the name of Goldman from a day before.
In approximately three years before the ANA offering, neither Goldman nor Nomura made filings of short-sale positions on ANA shares. Trading volume of those shares jumped ahead of the issuance announcement, reaching a three-month high the day before, according to separate Tokyo Stock Exchange data.
Both Goldman and Nomura, who were underwriters for All Nippon's issuance, confirmed that the trades had been undertaken on behalf of clients but declined to comment further. They denied that information on the issuance could have leaked from their investment banking divisions to those clients.
Also on Mr. Okubo's list are short positions taken in the name of Deutsche Bank and UBS on shares of Nippon Sheet Glass before its $500 million stock offering, announced on Aug. 24, 2010. Deutsche and UBS both first filed short positions, likely on behalf of clients, starting on Aug. 6, according to Mr. Okubo and the exchange filings. Neither bank filed short positions on Nippon Sheet Glass in the year before that, the data shows. The banks declined to comment.
Analysts warn against assuming that all shorting activity made before a public offering is based on insider information. ''It is not rocket science to pick out companies that are in danger of issuing equity,'' Nicholas Smith, Japan strategist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, wrote in a note to clients in May.
''Shorting stocks on credit analysis that indicates that an offering is in the offing is a legitimate - and valuable - part of the pricing mechanism of financial markets,'' Mr. Smith said. ''What is not legitimate is trading on leaks of nonpublic information.''
But Mr. Okubo insisted that many of the trading patterns were suspicious. He said it was crucial that regulators got to the bottom of who was behind the short-selling leading up to recent offerings, much of which remained unaccounted for.
Nomura has not faced any insider trading charges because, unlike the United States, Japan does not punish tipsters as long as they do not trade on the information. But a string of the bank's clients have decided to take their business elsewhere after the scandal, prompting the bank to reshuffle management and promise an overhaul of its internal compliance in a bid to regain investor confidence.
Nobutoshi Yamanouchi, a partner at the Tokyo branch of the law firm Jones Day, said financial regulators needed badly to convince global investors that they had the power to break into the cushy inner circle of Japanese finance and root out insider trading. The extent of regulators' actions against Nomura would be crucial, he said.
''They need to be able to show that they can make Japanese markets attractive for everyone again, not just for a select group of insiders,'' Mr. Yamanouchi said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: That Old Piano: Pass It On!

 BODY:
To the editor:
Re ''For More Pianos, Last Note Is Thud in the Dump'' (front page, July 30): 
Swimming against the tide, my great-grandmother's 1903 Knabe upright piano was recently restored. Its mahogany is beautiful and it sounds quite fine. Those Germans built a quality instrument, rewarded by its new lease on life.
That said, restoration costs certainly exceeded market value, but it is priceless to me. It was acquired by income from a piece of Illinois farmland; its restoration was financed by the same land. The piano still has family. So, thank you great-grandparents and grandparents and parents. Legacy -- be it musical, economic, cultural, intellectual or spiritual -- is a gift, and it matters. So please thoughtfully pass on something you value, tangible or intangible. Your great-grandchildren will appreciate it.

HEADLINE: Casino Boom Has States Looking to the Internet For Gambling Dollars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Cash-hungry states have long tried to poach business from one another. Now many are stepping up their efforts to lure gamblers from their neighbors to their growing ranks of slot machines, leaving states like Delaware, which embraced gambling early, struggling to keep up in what has become a feverish one-armed-bandit arms race.
Gambling revenue accounts for more than 7 percent of Delaware's general fund budget, making it the state's fourth biggest revenue stream, ahead of its corporate income tax and gross receipts tax. But when new casinos in Maryland and Pennsylvania began to attract the gamblers who once fed quarters into Delaware's machines, the state acted. First it legalized a form of sports betting. Then it allowed table games including blackjack, craps and roulette. But its gambling revenues have continued to fall. 
So at the end of June, Gov. Jack Markell, a Democrat, signed a law that could make Delaware the first state to offer Internet gambling -- giving its residents the chance to bet on video lottery games and online versions of games like poker, blackjack and roulette without leaving their homes.
The law takes advantage of a recent Justice Department ruling that reversed the federal government's long-held opposition to many forms of online gambling. The law will also expand sports betting and Keno games, and give its three racetrack casinos -- which lost 15.9 percent of their jobs last year, the biggest such drop in the nation -- more money for capital improvements and advertising.
''If we had not approved gaming along these lines this year and put ourselves at the forefront, other states would have moved ahead of us and we would have been back in a year or two playing catch-up,'' said Tom Cook, Delaware's secretary of finance. He said that intense competition from Maryland and Pennsylvania was projected to drive down Delaware's gambling revenues to $206.4 million in the year that began in July, from $248.8 million in the 2011 fiscal year.
The rapid expansion of gambling, as recession-racked states have searched for new sources of money, has transformed the industry. States that once enjoyed near-monopolies on gambling -- including Delaware, which legalized slotlike machines at its racetracks in 1994, and New Jersey, which opened the nation's first casinos outside of Nevada in 1978 -- have been suffering the most in the new casino-dotted national landscape.
Atlantic City's casino revenues have fallen by more than a third in recent years, according to an analysis by the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Pennsylvania, which opened its first casino in 2007, is overtaking New Jersey by some measures: over the past year Pennsylvania has taken in more slot machine revenue than New Jersey, according to Shawn K. McCloud, the vice president for analysis at Spectrum Gaming Group, a gambling research and professional services firm.
''The driving factor here is location,'' said William R. Eadington, a professor of economics and director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada, Reno. ''Other things being equal, people will choose the most accessible or convenient casino outlets. People who used to travel some distance no longer do.''
The competition between the states can be fierce.
After New York City opened its first casino last year at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, Atlantic City hotels began advertising in New York's subways. The Mount Airy Casino Resort, in the Poconos, broadcasts commercials on New Jersey cable channels and has billboards in Atlantic City and in the New York City area. One says ''Less Time In Traffic, More at the Wheel,'' and shows a roulette wheel.
''The billboards are strategically placed as you exit the tunnels and bridges out of New York City into New Jersey,'' said John Culetsu, the Mount Airy resort's executive vice president and general manager. He said that 52 percent of the players in the casino's loyalty program come from New York or New Jersey.
But some of Pennsylvania's new casinos are now facing newer competition: Cleveland opened its first casino in May, competing for some of the same players who now gamble in Erie, Pa., less than two hours away. More competition is on the horizon: a special session of the Maryland legislature will consider expanding casino gambling, adding table games at existing casinos and allowing a new one to open near Washington -- which state officials say could bring in millions of dollars in new revenues. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has proposed expanding gambling. In New England, Massachusetts' plan to open several casinos is worrying the operators of casinos in Rhode Island and Connecticut.
The endless one-upmanship among states has some analysts wondering at what point the market will become saturated, and whether the industry has reached a point of diminishing returns. Casinos are using other come-ons to try to lure gamblers -- some Atlantic City ads remind people that its casinos are, in fact, on the beach, while Mount Airy plays up its Poconos location, large spa and restaurants.
Some fiscal analysts wonder about the long-term benefits of casinos for state finances. ''Gambling legalization and expansion during tough times produces significant short-term revenue increases in some jurisdictions,'' a report by the Rockefeller Institute of Government found last year. ''But if experience is a guide, such growth will not continue over time.''
Casinos in Delaware continue to warily eye the expansion in neighboring states. One of its casinos, Dover Downs, said in its 2011 annual report that 42 percent of its winnings came from Maryland residents.
Delaware's move online will focus only on state residents -- there is some debate over whether the Justice Department ruling allows Internet gambling only within states that approve it or between states. Given Delaware's population -- it has fewer than a million residents -- the pool of potential online gamblers is on the small side. But some gambling experts say the reverberations could be big.
I. Nelson Rose, a professor at Whittier Law School in California who writes a blog called Gambling and the Law, predicted that it would spur other states to follow suit, and he noted that Nevada has also taken steps toward online gambling. ''I think Delaware's move really pushes New Jersey to legalize,'' he said. ''And when you have Delaware, New Jersey and Nevada, then next year Iowa will legalize.''

HEADLINE: A Brooklyn Hospital, Low on Cash, Says It May Need a State Bailout

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
A small community hospital in Brooklyn is running out of cash and fears it will not be able to make its payroll or pay its vendors by September without a state bailout, the hospital's administrators said this week.
The hospital, Interfaith Medical Center, serves a largely Caribbean-American and poor population in Bedford-Stuyvesant and north-central Brooklyn. Interfaith's chief executive, Luis Hernandez, said this week that while the hospital was making payroll and paying vendors, it had only 18 days to 20 days of cash on hand and it had not been able to pay interest on its state-backed mortgage since November. 
The chairman of Interfaith's board of trustees, Nathan M. Barotz, blamed another Brooklyn hospital, Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, in Bushwick, for Interfaith's plight; he accused Wyckoff's administration of dragging its heels on a plan to shore up operations by combining the operations of Interfaith, Wyckoff and Brooklyn Hospital Center, in Fort Greene.
''Because it took so long to figure out where Wyckoff stood in this formula,'' Mr. Barotz said, ''we lost an incredible amount of time, and we as an institution don't want to be penalized for that.''
In November, a Cuomo administration panel proposed integrating the operations of Wyckoff and Interfaith, which the panel described as being in danger of immediate financial collapse, with those of Brooklyn Hospital, which was considered more stable. The panel said that combining the three hospitals in a group led by Brooklyn Hospital would strengthen the two weaker institutions and could reduce costs by pushing patients toward primary care rather than hospital care and eliminating the duplication of some specialized services among the three.
The state promised some financial support to accomplish the changes.
Mr. Barotz said that Interfaith -- which has 287 beds, 120 of them psychiatric -- needed $10 million to $30 million to keep going, depending on how long it had to wait for a reorganization. He said Interfaith officials recognized that the state, given its own financial constraints and policy mandates for less hospital-centered care, was loath to subsidize ailing hospitals, as it did with St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan before it went bankrupt and closed in 2010. But he contended that if an infusion of cash would keep Interfaith open until it could be reconfigured, ''that would be a relatively inexpensive price to pay.''
James Introne, the Cuomo administration's deputy secretary for health, said that the State Health Department had been watching the situation at Interfaith closely, and that he believed the hospital would be able to hold on until a plan to integrate with Brooklyn Hospital was developed.
''It's a question of when they're going to run out of cash,'' Mr. Introne said. ''Neither the Health Department nor they have indicated to me that there's an urgent situation there.''
In a twist, one member of the Cuomo administration panel was Ramon Rodriguez, a former managed-care executive and a former State Parole Board chairman in the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's father, Mario. In late December, after the panel made its recommendations, Wyckoff's trustees ousted their chief executive, who had been caught up in a conflicts-of-interest investigation, and replaced him with Mr. Rodriguez.
Asked if he was repudiating the plan he had supported as a panel member, Mr. Rodriguez said that ''people make mistakes,'' and that he had since been ''educated'' by his trustees and medical staff. He said he was interested in collaborating on some operations, like psychiatry, with Interfaith, but believed that Brooklyn Hospital Center served a different market and would steal market share from Wyckoff without offering enough in return. But he said he would not rule out working with Brooklyn Hospital.
Mr. Rodriguez said that Wyckoff had increased its cash flow by recapturing some billings from doctors and by recruiting new doctors, and that his focus was on attracting more middle-class, insured patients from Queens, which already accounts for half of Wyckoff's business. The hospital is close to the Queens border.
As if contemplating a marketing slogan, Mr. Rodriguez suggested that the area around Brooklyn Hospital was a good place to eat Junior's cheesecake and to go to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, but that Wyckoff was the place where people in Bushwick and south Queens would go to get health care. ''Geography is destiny,'' he said.
Dr. Richard Becker, the chief executive of Brooklyn Hospital Center, declined to comment on whether he could see integrating with Interfaith but not with Wyckoff. As to whether Brooklyn Hospital was trying to steal from Wyckoff's market share, he said: ''I guess everybody's entitled to their own perspective. It's a very dynamic market.''
Mr. Barotz said that at a meeting in May between state officials and hospital executives, Mr. Rodriguez declared that he was not interested in combining operations with Brooklyn Hospital and Interfaith. At that point, Mr. Barotz said, ''Jim Introne said, in essence, 'We wish you the best,' and he started to get out of his chair,'' and Mr. Rodriguez relented.
But since then, Mr. Barotz said, Mr. Rodriguez has expressed opposition to Brooklyn Hospital's being the lead hospital and has balked at sharing financial information, making it all but impossible to come up with a realistic plan.
''They won't come to the table,'' Mr. Barotz said. ''They're off on their own.''
Mr. Introne said Wyckoff's decision was ''unfortunate,'' adding, ''The prospects for assuring the viability of all of those institutions would have been enhanced to the extent that Wyckoff was willing to participate in seeking a common solution, but they declined.''

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
- 'Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry' (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)
'The Amazing Spider-Man' (PG-13, 2:16) Five years after Sam Rami directed his third ''Spider-Man'' installment, Marc Webb returns this lucrative franchise to its origins with Andrew Garfield as the spider-teenager and Emma Stone as the girl. Painless but unnecessary. (Dargis) 
- 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' (PG-13, 1:33) A blast of joyful, chaotic emotion from the bayou, Benh Zeitlin's dazzling film is a homegrown magic-realist fable of defiance in the face of hardship. A community in a stretch of coastal Louisiana called the Bathtub is menaced by storms and government benevolence. Their ordeal is narrated by a young girl named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis ), who lives with her father, Wink (Dwight Henry), and who belongs in the tradition of Huck Finn, Scout Finch, Eloise and other indomitable American child heroes. (A. O. Scott)
- 'Bernie' (PG-13, 1:44) Richard Linklater directs this gaudily vibrant, at times morbidly funny true crime story, set in the East Texas town of Carthage, about the time when the sweet Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) murdered sour Mrs. Nugent (Shirley MacLaine) and everyone ended up rooting for Bernie. (Dargis)
- 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' (PG-13, 2:04) This staid but likable story of British retirees starting a new life in India insists that it is never too late to leave your comfort zone and explore new horizons. Besides its sterling cast (Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Smith), its ace in the hole is its pungent depiction of Jaipur's teeming streets. (Stephen Holden)
'Brave' (PG, 1:33) After 17 years of feature filmmaking, Pixar has -- ta-da! -- its first female protagonist, Merida, a brave, ginger-mopped princess who wants to chart her own fate. The animation, as might be expected, is beautiful, but the story is filled with dreary gender cliches. Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman directed and helped write the script. (Dargis)
- 'The Dark Knight Rises' (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis)
- 'Easy Money' (No rating, 2:04, in Swedish, Serbian, English and Spanish) Joel Kinnaman (''The Killing'') gives a riveting portrayal of a corrupt, social climbing business student in this Swedish gangster film about coke dealing, money laundering and ethnic warfare among international drug dealers. It is one of the finest gangster films of the last decade. (Holden)
'Falling Overnight' (No rating, 1:26) Capturing every nervous giggle, coy look and awkward silence, Conrad Jackson's authentically banal depiction of the first date between a stringy introvert (Parker Croft) and a gorgeous artist (Emilia Zoryan) is sweetly endearing but too featherweight to engage. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
- 'Farewell, My Queen' (R, 1:40, in French) Benoit Jacquot directs this tense, absorbing, pleasurably original look at Marie Antoinette (Diane Kruger) after the fall of the Bastille, a story that's told from the blinkered perspective of the doomed queen's infatuated reader (Lea Seydoux). (Dargis)
'First Position' (No rating, 1:30, in English, Spanish, French and Hebrew) The tears are often held tremulously back and the many hurts smiled away in Bess Kargman's appealing, largely upbeat documentary about young ballet dancers duking it out, sometimes on point and in tulle, for top honors at the Youth America Grand Prix. (Dargis)
'Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai' (No rating, 2:06, in Japanese) The prolific Japanese genre director Takashi Miike (''Audition,''''13 Assassins'') tries out a quiet, almost Classical style in this sad and stately tale set in a quasi-mythic 17th century. Mr. Miike's debt to an earlier cinematic tradition is evident in spite of his distracting use of 3-D, which adds nothing to the gravity of his story. (Scott)
'Headhunters' (R, 1:40, in Norwegian and Danish) The relentless adaptation of a novel by the Norwegian author Jo Nesbo follows a corporate headhunter -- and part-time art thief -- as he is chased and tormented by a potential mark who turns dangerous. (Nicolas Rapold)
'The Hunger Games' (PG-13, 2:22) Jennifer Lawrence stars as Katniss, the teenage warrior from Suzanne Collins's book trilogy. The director Gary Ross has too soft a touch, but the film is insistently watchable partly because of how the story radically revisits -- and re-sexes -- the classic figure of the American Adam. (Dargis)
'Ice Age: Continental Drift' (PG, 1:34) The further adventures of prehistoric creatures voiced by modern celebrities. As usual, Scrat is the best part. (Scott)
- 'The Imposter' (R, 1:35) Slippery, manipulative and shamelessly entertaining, Bart Layton's bizarre true-crime documentary follows the twisty tale of a missing Texas teenager and the French-Algerian con artist who stole his identity. (Catsoulis)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (Francois Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
'Jiro Dreams of Sushi' (No rating, 1:21, in Japanese) Jiro Ono, an octogenarian sushi master, and his tiny, Michelin-lauded Tokyo restaurant get a flattering spotlight in David Gelb's foodie-friendly debut documentary. (Rapold)
'Katy Perry: Part of Me' (PG, 1:33) This 3-D backstage doc follows Ms. Perry -- if you don't know, ask any 12-year-old girl -- through hundreds of costume changes and the breakup of her marriage to the British comedian Russell Brand. While the film, true to its title, does not reveal a whole lot about its subject, it does succeed in presenting her as a likable professional, serious about her craft and generous to her fans. (Scott)
'Killer Joe' (NC-17, 1:43) Matthew McConaughey plays a psycho hired by the idiot son of an idiot family in this unfunny, self-indulgent violent bore. The director William Friedkin, working from the Tracy Letts play, is consistently controlled by the story's excesses rather than in control of them. (Dargis)
'Klown' (R, 1:30, in Danish) For a film that includes not only a lot of talk about the size of a 12-year-old character's penis but also the photographing of it, this Danish comedy is surprisingly uncreepy. Frank Hvam and Casper Christensen star as two pals who take the 12-year-old along on a mancation that is intent on debauchery but ends up being one mishap after another. Mr. Hvam's sad-sack persona makes it all work. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Kumare' (No rating, 1:24) Vikram Gandhi's documentary, about his experiences posing as a swami who gathers a following in Arizona, is an intriguing if too-sketchy film about a stunt that unexpectedly became a serious mini-movement when he found himself taken seriously as a spiritual leader. (Holden)
- 'Magic Mike' (R, 1:50) At this point in his remarkable career, the director Steven Soderbergh can do just about anything, including making a funny, sly, relevant movie about a male stripper (Channing Tatum) into this summer's surprise must-see. (Dargis)
'Marina Abramovic the Artist Is Present' (No rating, 1:46) Matthew Aker's documentary, chronicling the career of Ms. Abramovic, a Yugoslav-born performance artist, is more celebratory than illuminating, but it does provide a useful overview of her work, especially the Museum of Modern Art piece -- in which she sat silently in a chair every day for three months -- that gives the film its name. (Scott)
'Marvel's The Avengers' (PG-13, 2:22) Thor, the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and a few other mighty Marvel superheroes team up under the supervision of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury in this franchise juggernaut, directed by Joss Whedon. The bantering and riffing among the characters provides some fun, but there is not much heart or imagination in the story or the action sequences. Which seems to satisfy the fans just fine. (Scott)
- 'Monsieur Lazhar' (PG-13, 1:34, in French) This story, of an Algerian teacher seeking political asylum in Quebec who takes a job as a middle-school teacher, sustains an exquisite balance between a grown-up and a child's-eye view of education, teacher-student relations and peer group interaction. The students come quirkily alive in superb naturalistic performances devoid of cuteness and stereotyping. (Holden)
- 'Moonrise Kingdom' (PG-13, 1:34) In Wes Anderson's latest, a wondrous storybook tale, a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The two are very serious -- about love, their plans, books, life itself -- and often act older than their age. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that's hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. With Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. (Dargis)
'Nuit #1' (No rating, 1:31, in French) A hot one-night stand turns into an agonized, intermittently compelling talkathon in which both partners reveal the depths of their misery and self-loathing. (Holden)
'Pina' (No rating, 1:46, in German, English, Russian, Italian, French, Slovenian, Korean, Spanish and Portuguese) Wim Wenders's 3-D documentary pays vivid tribute to the life and work of Pina Bausch, the German choreographer who died in 2009, leaving behind a corps of devoted dancers and a corpus of provocative and powerful dances. (Scott)
'Prometheus' (R, 2:03) This sort-of prequel to ''Alien,'' directed by Ridley Scott, is visually sumptuous, often spooky and suspenseful, but ultimately disappointing. Marrying the visceral punch and scrappy heroism of the original to cosmic inquiries into the nature of human existence, the film sets out large ambitions that unravel as the plot turns pedestrian and illogical. Noomi Rapace as an intrepid scientist and Michael Fassbender as a soulful robot are part of an ensemble that does what it can to sustain the credibility of the enterprise. (Scott)
- 'The Queen of Versailles' (PG, 1:40) Lauren Greenfield's documentary follows the shifting fortunes of David and Jackie Siegel, a wealthy Florida couple who dreamed of building the biggest house in America. The movie, which starts out like smirky reality television, turns into something darker and more complex as economic troubles take a toll on the Siegels and the audience becomes better acquainted with them. It's like a Theodore Dreiser novel for our new gilded age. (Scott)
'Rock of Ages' (PG-13, 2:03) A couple of unknowns and a flock of famous names (best in show: Tom Cruise) play 1980s rock hopefuls and burnouts on and off the Sunset Strip in this junky screen version of the Broadway jukebox musical. (Dargis)
- 'Ruby Sparks' (R, 1:44) In this ingenious, delightful romantic comedy -- a variation on the Pygmalion myth -- a celebrated young author (Paul Dano) falls in love with his fictional dream girl (Zoe Kazan) who comes to life with many amusing complications. (Holden)
- 'Savages' (R, 2:11) Oliver Stone's adaptation of Don Winslow's drug-war novel is violent, spacey, gorgeous and -- in the best Oliver Stone tradition -- a little nuts. Blake Lively, Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch are a weed-dealing threesome who fall afoul of narco-traffickers led by Salma Hayek. Violence, comedy and sly social commentary swirl together and produce an impressively potent head rush. (Scott)
- 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
'Snow White & the Huntsman' (PG-13, 2:06) A dark, sometimes mesmerizing retelling of the Grimm fairy tale, with some interesting feminist undertones and a vividly diabolical performance by Charlize Theron as the wickedest stepmother of them all. Kristen Stewart is Snow White, the Huntsman is Chris Hemsworth (a k a Thor), and a who's who of digitally shrunken British actors play the dwarfs. (Scott)
'Step Up Revolution' (PG-13, 1:39) How to stop a greedy developer from gutting a Miami neighborhood? The power of dance, of course. The fourth film in the ''Step Up'' franchise has some dandy flash-mob-style dance numbers, though like its predecessors it is burdened by a predictable plot and unintentionally laughable dialogue. (Genzlinger)
'Take This Waltz' (R, 1:56) Sarah Polley's second feature (after ''Away From Her'') is a story of unruly desire that manages to be both feverish and analytical. Michelle Williams is Margot, who lives more or less happily in Toronto with her husband, Lou (Seth Rogen). But her attraction to a handsome neighbor (Luke Kirby) disrupts Margot's emotional equilibrium. Ms. Polley observes the resulting confusion with sympathy, intelligence and disarmingly frank sensuality. (Scott)
'Ted' (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of ''The Family Guy,'' takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voice-over skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg), and, somewhat tangentially, the boy's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (Scott)
'That's My Boy' (R, 1:54) Fifth graders, rejoice! Here's a movie for you, with America's popular man-child (Adam Sandler) and a host of crude jokes about sex, beer, fat people, old people and every bodily fluid you can imagine. For adults, this mostly wretched movie is not without decent spots -- but they are very spotty indeed. (David DeWitt)
'To Rome With Love' (R, 1:52) Woody Allen's latest is a mild, silly collection of tales set in the Italian capital, where love is complicated and characters -- both Italian and American -- are baffled, neurotic and always articulate. Mr. Allen plays a semi-retired opera promoter, while Jesse Eisenberg plays the younger Woody Allen type, torn between loyalty to his sensible girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) and her wayward, needy friend (Ellen Page). Alec Baldwin, Penelope Cruz and Roberto Benigni also contribute to this frothy, airy romp through some of Mr. Allen's favorite themes. (Scott)
'Trishna' (R, 1:48, in English and Hindi) Michael Winterbottom's redo of Thomas Hardy's ''Tess of the D'Urbervilles,'' set in contemporary India and starring a wan Freida Pinto, owes a bit to Bollywood and too much to the director's reductive reading of Hardy's novel. (Dargis)
'Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection' (PG-13, 1:54) Tyler Perry keeps his Madea character on a leash in this latest addition to the franchise, which involves a Wall Street type (Eugene Levy) who hides out at Madea's house while waiting to testify about his company's Ponzi scheme. Madea has all sorts of chances to get crazy-funny -- dealing with a mouthy teenager, going through airport security, staying in a fancy New York hotel -- but never really lets it all hang out. (Genzlinger)
'Union Square' (NR, 1:20) Mira Sorvino and Tammy Blanchard play estranged sisters from the Bronx, awkwardly reunited in a Manhattan apartment just before Thanksgiving. The director, Nancy Savoca, relishes the complexities of the sisterly relationship, but the movie is a little too small for her insights, or for Ms. Sorvino's full-throated, comic-medodramatic performance. (Scott)
- 'Wagner's Dream' (No rating, 1:55) Susan Froemke's impressively well-organized documentary about Robert Lepage's recent staging of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle at the Metropolitan Opera argues that modern technology helped bring into being the kind of production that in the 19th century was thought to be impossible. (Holden)
'The Watch' (R, 1:41) Half unfunny potty-mouthed buddy comedy, half spoof of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' this comic washout starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn is larded with crude phallic jokes. (Holden)
'The Well Digger's Daughter' (No rating, 1:47, in French) Daniel Auteuil directs this once-upon-a-time French film about love, family and the beauty of the Provencal countryside, a remake of a 1940 movie by Marcel Pagnol. Mr. Auteuil plays an outwardly gruff patriarch; Astrid Berges-Frisbey plays the daughter who tests that love. (Dargis)
Film Series
'Rio Bravo' (Saturday) Howard Hawks's 1959 western stars John Wayne as a sheriff standing up to an organized gang -- with only a drunk (Dean Martin), a kid (Ricky Nelson), an old man (Walter Brennan) and a very resourceful lady gambler (Angie Dickinson) to help him out. One of the most purely pleasurable films ever made, ''Rio Bravo'' will be presented here in a ''digital cinema package,'' the bundle of digital files that is gradually replacing 35-millimeter film as the projection standard in theaters. At 3 p.m., Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $12. (Dave Kehr)
Claude Sautet: The Things of Life (Friday through Thursday) Claude Sautet's self-effacing, classical style was too often overlooked by critics among the stylistic fireworks of the French cinema of the 1960s and '70s, but audiences responded to his deeply felt stories of love and betrayal among the upper middle class. This nicely organized series includes some of Sautet's most successful films, like the 1972 romantic triangle ''Cesar and Rosalie'' with Romy Schneider, Yves Montand and Sami Frey (Friday at 6:15 p.m. and Saturday at 3:45 p.m.) and the 1978 divorce drama ''A Simple Story,'' again starring Schneider and mysteriously unavailable on DVD (Saturday at 8:30 p.m. and Thursday at 4 p.m.). There is also a sampling of his lesser-known thrillers, including what appears to be the United States premiere of ''The Dictator's Guns,'' a 1965 genre piece with France's favorite tough guy, Lino Ventura, on Friday at 8:30 p.m. (with an additional showing on Saturday at 1:30 p.m.). Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5601, filmlinc.org; $13. (Kehr)
Universal 100 (Friday through Thursday) Some rarities of distinction figure in this final week of Film Forum's series celebrating the 100th anniversary of Universal Studios. On Friday ''The Sleeping City,'' a thriller set and partly filmed at Bellevue Hospital by the much underrated genre director George Sherman, shares a double bill with Jules Dassin's better-known, on-location noir ''The Naked City.'' Monday brings Frank Borzage's magnificent 1934 melodrama ''Little Man, What Now?'' -- perhaps the first anti-Nazi film produced in Hollywood -- paired with the first Hollywood film, ''Ladies Must Love'' (1933), directed by the German emigre E. A. Dupont (''Variety''). And as a separate program, at 6:45 p.m. only, there will be a screening of the superb restoration of Paul Fejos's part-talkie masterpiece, ''Lonesome,'' from George Eastman House. On Thursday a mini-retrospective of the films of the Universal house director Robert Siodmak comes to a climax with a combination of one of Siodmak's most cerebral and sophisticated films, ''The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry'' (1945), with his campiest and most delirious, the Technicolor extravaganza ''Cobra Woman'' (1944), with Maria Montez. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.com; $12.50. (Kehr)

HEADLINE: Buried In Details, A Warning To Investors

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris writes on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
The bank that put together the unusual security did well. The customers who bought it suffered large losses. No one -- at least no one who traded the security -- seems to have understood the risks that were hidden deep in the prospectus.
The security in question was not a large one by Wall Street standards, and it is possible that it would have worked out well for both the bank and its customers if the Dodd-Frank law had not changed the way banks calculate their capital. But it is illustrative of what can happen when a security is packaged by a firm that intends to have a contrary interest from its customers for the life of the security, and that does not clearly explain what could go wrong.
It also shows how markets can fail. Perhaps because only $28 million worth of the security was outstanding and had been primarily sold only to customers of a small number of firms, there does not seem to have been anyone watching the trading this summer who understood the disaster that was about to befall the investors who had sought safety and assured income and wound up with a large capital loss. 
The security in question was extraordinarily complex in its name and its details, but simple in its selling points. It was marketed in $25 units, a popular price point for debtlike securities sold to individual investors, and it promised monthly interest payments for as long as 30 years, at which point the investor would get the $25 back. Those interest payments would fluctuate with interest rates on Treasury bills, but could not go below 3 percent a year or above 8 percent.
Wells Fargo, the bank behind the security, now says that anyone who had read the prospectus should have understood that disaster was looming in June, when news related to the security was disclosed. But that disclosure -- I'll get to the details in a minute -- had the opposite effect on the market. In New York Stock Exchange trading, the price leapt higher, on heavy volume, and stayed there for weeks.
The price per share was $24.88 on July 12, when trading was halted as investors learned they would get just $14.69 a share. Trading never resumed.
The difference between market expectations and realities boiled down to one fact: Wells Fargo concluded it was entitled to a payment of $10.69 a share to compensate it for the profits it would have made over the next 23 years had the security not been redeemed.
The security had a mouthful of a name: Floating Rate Structured Repackaged Asset-Backed Trust Securities Certificates, Series 2005-2. It was created and sold in 2005 by Wachovia Securities, then part of Wachovia Bank, which was renamed Wells Fargo Advisors after Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia. The bank called the securities Strats, a quasi-acronym.
Underlying that security was another one, a ''trust preferred'' security issued by JPMorgan Chase and sold to institutional investors. That security paid annual interest of 5.85 percent and matured in 2035. Trust preferreds were hybrid securities that appealed to banks because bank regulators treated them as capital but the Internal Revenue Service allowed banks to deduct the interest paid.
JPMorgan could not redeem the security early -- unless tax laws or bank capital rules changed. But when the capital rules were changed by the Dodd-Frank law, JPMorgan gained the right to redeem the security at face value, something it was all but sure to do given the current low level of interest rates. On June 11, it announced plans for the redemption.
Investors in the Wells Fargo security owned a proportionate amount of the JPMorgan security, but they also were the counterparties to Wells Fargo in an interest rate swap. That bank would collect the 5.85 percent coupon from JPMorgan and pay out 3 to 8 percent interest to investors in the security. The bank would suffer if interest rates went up, and profit if they fell. If JPMorgan redeemed the security when rates were low, the Strats investors would have to pay to terminate the hedge.
That was disclosed, on Page S-12 of the prospectus supplement, and investors were warned that ''this loss could be quite substantial.'' Wells Fargo thinks that was perfectly adequate disclosure, even though no examples were given to indicate the possible magnitude of the termination payment.
When the redemption took place, JPMorgan paid out the equivalent of $25.6541 per Strat share, including some accrued interest. Wells Fargo kept $10.9683 to compensate it for the early cancellation of the interest rate swap, and paid out what was left, $14.6857, to the public investors.
The effect was devastating. An investor who owned this security since it was created in 2005 collected about $6.70 in interest per share, and had a capital loss of $10.31 from an investment that was pitched as offering a modest but safe yield.
''It was a very conservative security,'' said one investor, a computer science professor who lost money on an investment he had thought was ''a very nice, Grandma type'' of security. The professor, who asked that his name not be used because he would not like the publicity, said the prospectus did not make the risks clear. With better disclosure, he said, he would have invested his money elsewhere.
Wells Fargo did much better. While there were some months in 2006 and 2007 when it paid more in interest than it was collecting, over all it took in about $3.32 per Strat share more from JPMorgan than it paid out to investors over the life of the security. Add in the $10.97 the bank received for canceling the swap, and it seems to have done very well.
Not so, says Elise Wilkinson, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman. The bank had hedged its own exposure to that swap, she said, and it lost money on that hedge. ''Substantially all of that payment was used in connection with unwinding hedges,'' she said of the $10.97 a share Wells Fargo received. She said the ''securities were structured to meet investor demand at the time'' they were issued, ''and the circumstances governing termination were fully disclosed to investors.''
She added that Wells Fargo might have had to pay money to investors on the swap if it had been terminated when interest rates were high, meaning the investors could have gotten a windfall instead of large losses. That strikes me as protesting too much. Under those circumstances, JPMorgan would not have wanted to redeem its security, and would not have done so.
I am told that one way to describe the Wells Fargo security is as follows: ''Effectively, it was as if the investor entered into a floating rate hedge overlay on top of the JPMorgan preferreds.'' If that makes sense to you, then you were sophisticated enough to invest in this security.
Ed Hall, a lawyer and blogger who has written on Strats -- and who brought the security to my attention -- says he thinks it is obvious that the investors had no understanding of the risks. ''Wells needed to place a clear warning at the start of the prospectus, rather than buried deep in the prospectus,'' he said.
I checked data on short sales of the Strat security. The already small short position declined during the last two weeks of June, as the share price rose. Any speculator who understood what was happening could have stepped in and made a short sale that was sure to be richly rewarded. But no one did so.
Wells Fargo says that when the security was redeemed, more than $2 million of it was held by Wells Fargo retail customers. They evidently were given no warning of the implications of what was happening. No Wells Fargo analyst covered the security, and there is no indication that any of its advisers understood what the bank says it believes should have been clear to anyone reading the prospectus.
Did the disclosures in the prospectus comply with securities laws? Perhaps they did. Did they actually provide the information that investors needed, in a way they could understand? They did not.

HEADLINE: DirecTV Reports a Decline In Subscribers in the U.S.

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
DirecTV on Thursday reported its first drop in net subscribers to its service in the United States, highlighting the challenges for pay television providers in a saturated marketplace.
The company said that it more than made up for the decline by adding a record number of subscribers in Latin America. Over all, DirecTV reported a 1.4 percent increase in net income, to $711 million, or $1.09 a share, in the second quarter of the year, from $701 million, or 91 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. 
Michael White, the chief executive of DirecTV, said in a statement that the growth in operating profit was ''an early indication of successfully executing on our long-term strategy of striking a more optimal balance between growth and profitability.''
In recent months, Mr. White has said that the company wants to focus on making more money from current subscribers in the United States, rather than on recruiting new ones. DirecTV is already the country's largest provider of satellite television service, with nearly 20 million subscribers. It lost 52,000 net subscribers in the United States in the second quarter, after having gained 81,000 a quarter earlier.
Analysts had expected a decline in the number of subscribers, though they thought it would be somewhat smaller. They also expected DirecTV to increase the average amount of revenue per subscriber - and there the company outperformed, with a year-over-year gain of 4 percent, to a total of $94.40 per subscriber per month.
DirecTV ''appears to be benefiting from wise, economic consumer retention efforts - a long-term positive,'' wrote Vijay Jayant of the ISI Group in a note to investors on Thursday.
In Latin America, a much newer market, the company sacrificed gains in the average amount of revenue per subscriber to expand its base. In the second quarter, the company gained 645,000 net subscribers there, its best single-quarter result ever, a reflection in part of cheaper rates for packages of TV channels. In his statement, Mr. White pointed to ''20 percent revenue growth in the quarter'' in the market.
DirecTV's headline-making spat with Viacom over a new contract for its cable channels was not a factor in the earnings because the contract did not expire until the end of the quarter. Viacom's channels were blacked out for more than a week in July, and it is unclear whether DirecTV's subscriber totals were affected by the absence. DirecTV, like other TV providers, has been trying to contain programming costs in recent years.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Shares Continue Losing Streak for Week As Europeans Fail to Act on Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell for a fourth consecutive day on Thursday after the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, disappointed investors hoping for immediate action to contain Europe's debt crisis.
The losses on Wall Street, at less than 1 percent, were not as severe as those in the euro zone markets, where declines ranged from 2.2 percent in Germany to 5.2 percent in Spain.
Although the markets were focused mostly on the European Central Bank, traders were also looking ahead to Friday's closely watched employment report in the United States, which could bring a volatile end to an eventful week. 
Mr. Draghi said the central bank was willing to start buying Italian and Spanish government bonds to hold down borrowing costs, but it would act only after euro zone governments moved first. The announcement surprised traders, who had thought that central bank action was imminent after Mr. Draghi pledged last week to do ''whatever it takes'' to save the euro.
''People were looking for concrete steps and an outline of exactly what path the E.C.B. would take to do that, and there weren't any,'' said Brian Gendreau, market strategist with the Cetera Financial Group. ''Just as the market went up on the 'whatever it takes' comments, it is coming down on the lack of specificity.''
Wall Street rallied late last week in part on hopes for new economic stimulus from the Federal Reserve but mostly as expectations grew that the European Central Bank would finally take action to protect the euro. But the Fed took no new steps to support the economy on Wednesday, although it said it was ready to act if needed.
Friday's employment report could give a stronger indication whether the Fed, which has a freer hand than the European Central Bank, will act soon.
The government reported on Thursday that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week and that manufacturers suffered an unexpected drop in orders in June, suggesting that the economy is struggling to break out of a soft patch.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 92.18 points, or 0.71 percent, to 12,878.88. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 10.14 points, or 0.74 percent, to 1,365. The Nasdaq composite index lost 10.44 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,909.77.
Shares of the Knight Capital Group, one of Wall Street's top market makers, plunged after a trading glitch that spread turmoil in the stock market on Wednesday wiped out $440 million of the company's capital. The stock closed down 62.8 percent at $2.58, its lowest level since early October 1998.
Among other issues, General Motors slipped 2.6 percent, to $19.14, after it posted a smaller-than-expected loss in Europe that helped it report a better-than-expected second-quarter profit.
Gap jumped 12.8 percent to $33.17 after the clothing retailer posted its July and second-quarter sales, but the rival Aeropostale plummeted 32.8 percent to $13.08 after cutting its second-quarter forecast.
In the credit markets, the Spanish government's 10-year bond yield rose above 7 percent again after the European Central Bank failed to take immediate action.
Investors instead turned once more to the perceived safety of the United States government debt. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 13/32, to 102 15/32, while its yield fell to 1.48 percent from 1.52 percent late Wednesday

HEADLINE: U.S. Manufacturing May Be Softening; Factory Orders Fell in June

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- New orders for factory goods unexpectedly fell in the United States in June, a fresh sign that the slowdown in the country's manufacturing sector will probably stretch into the second half of the year. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that new orders for manufactured goods dropped 0.5 percent during the month. Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast a rise of 0.5 percent.
American factories appear to be one of the sectors most vulnerable to Europe's festering debt crisis. The trend in American manufacturing has appeared softer and has added to concerns the economic recovery is losing steam. The decline in new orders in June will probably mean softer output down the road, which could weigh on economic growth.
New indications of the depth of the slowdown may emerge Friday, when the government is expected to report that employers added 100,000 new workers to their payrolls last month, according to a Reuters survey. That is up from 80,000 in June but a sharp deceleration from the average monthly increase of 226,000 in the first three months of the year.
On Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose less than expected last week, but the data continued to be influenced by distortions from seasonal auto shutdowns.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 365,000. The previous week's figure was revised up to 357,000 from the previously reported 353,000.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 370,000 last week. The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, fell 2,750 to 365,500, the lowest in four months.
Temporary plant shutdowns by automakers for annual retooling cause wide swings in claims data in July, which makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the labor market's health.
Thursday's report on manufacturing orders in June showed broad weakness across industries making everything from machinery and appliances to cars and electronics. New machinery orders dropped 2.1 percent and orders for motor vehicles and parts gave up 0.7 percent.
The overall decline was tempered by a 14.2 percent increase in new orders for civilian aircraft. Outside transportation, orders were down 1.8 percent.
New orders have declined in three of the last four months. In June, shipments of factory goods fell 1.1 percent.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft -- seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans -- slipped 1.7 percent in June.
On Wednesday, the private Institute for Supply Management said activity in the manufacturing sector contracted in July for the second consecutive month.

HEADLINE: Shame and Indignation in China as Its Olympians Come Under Fire

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Patrick Zuo contributed research. Dan Levin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Even as it revels in a mounting heap of gold medals at the London Games, China has been troubled by a maelstrom of emotions: pride in its athletes' achievements mixed with shame and disappointment that a pair of badminton players were disqualified for blatantly throwing a game, and indignation over what many here say are unfounded accusations that a record-breaking swimmer may have been fueled by performance-enhancing drugs.
On Thursday, as the news sank in that the Chinese badminton players, Yu Yang and Wang Xiaoli, were among four two-player teams of women disqualified a day earlier for intentionally losing a match, some Chinese bloggers heaped blame on what they said was an imperfect Olympics system. Others expressed shame that their team had subverted the rules -- losing in order to play a weaker opponent in the next round -- in the hopes of winning another medal. Some found fault with their coach. Not a few criticized the nation's state-directed sports system and its obsessive quest for gold. 
Hu Xijin, the editor of the nationalistic tabloid Global Times, called the players' behavior a disgrace, adding a stinging kicker. ''How pathetic!'' he wrote.
The disappointment was compounded when Yu appeared to bow out of the sport for good. ''Farewell my beloved badminton,'' she wrote Thursday on her microblog account. ''You have heartlessly shattered our dreams. It is just unforgivable.'' It was not exactly clear whom she was blaming for her early retirement.
But any regret and introspection over the badminton scandal was largely subsumed by the outrage over suggestions, first raised by a prominent American coach, that the 16-year-old female swimmer, Ye Shiwen, could not have pulled off her record-shattering victory in the 400 individual medley on Saturday without some chemical assistance.
Even if Olympic officials pronounced Ye clean, the innuendo -- blithely repeated earlier this week by sports commentators, coaches and swimmers -- snowballed into a gargantuan national insult. And the official news media, in what was clearly an orchestrated campaign, responded in kind.
People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, described the accusations as a ''provocation'' and said they represented the widespread hostility that Westerners feel toward a rising China. ''It is due to their deep-rooted bias, an unwillingness to accept Chinese achievements,'' the newspaper said.
The state-run Xinhua news agency called the accusations irresponsible and said they revealed Western envy at the nation's growing economic might. ''Apart from sports, the West has always shown a similar dark psychology and mentality toward the rise of China,'' it wrote.
The Global Times also framed the suspicions about Ye as an orchestrated attack on the Chinese people. ''The abnormal media reaction should be questioned more than Ye's new record,'' the newspaper wrote in its English-language edition.
If Ye, seemingly bewildered by the doubts about her victories, gently scolded her accusers, her father was far less constrained. ''The Western media has always been arrogant and suspicious of Chinese people,'' he told reporters.
The popular magazine Titan Sports was one of the few publications to find humor in the situation. ''Ye Shiwen, the dual winner, has become the stimulant of the Chinese people,'' it wrote in a headline on Wednesday.
The former head of the Chinese Olympics medical team lobbed a few incendiary insults of his own, accusing Michael Phelps and other American athletes of doping their way to Olympic glory. ''The Americans have made many extraordinary performances but, without evidence, we have kept silent,'' the doctor, Chen Zhanghao, told an Australian newspaper.
By Thursday, such sentiments had become all-consuming, clogging Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, and inspiring a celebrity businessman, Kai-Fu Lee, to post the phone number and home address of John Leonard, the executive director of the World Swimming Coaches Association, who first described Ye's win as ''impossible'' and ''unbelievable.'' Lee, the former chief of Google in China, suggested that his 10 million followers use a ''civilized and factual approach'' to persuade Leonard he had erred. He later deleted the post, however, and apologized.
Jiang Yi, the managing editor of Sports Illustrated China, acknowledged that many of the responses were overwrought but said excess was understandable given the psychic battering Chinese had endured in recent years over successive doping scandals.
Although many non-Chinese sports commentators have glibly described Ye as having come out of nowhere, sports fans in China have been avidly following her career. Two years ago, Jiang noted, the magazine splashed her face on its cover after she won a pair of gold medals at the Asian Games. ''We knew she was great then and that it was only a matter of time before she hit the international stage,'' he said. ''So the accusations were a shock to everyone.''
Still, he said the suspicions that reverberated this week were not entirely illogical, given the scandals that have dogged Chinese athletes in recent years. In the 1990s, dozens of Chinese swimmers were caught using banned substances and as recently as March, one of Ye's teammates tested positive for the blood-boosting drug EPO.
History aside, Jiang urged reporters and commentators to think twice before tarring athletes with unsubstantiated accusations that could destroy a hard-earned reputation.
''We did lot of things in the past, and that gave us not quite a perfect image,'' he said. ''It's a shame because a lot of Western media see China that way, but I hope it can get better.''

HEADLINE: Near 'Happiest Place on Earth,' Fury After Shootings Reveals Deep Divisions

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA; Ian Lovett contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Visitors to Disneyland pull off the freeway here and drive along dense rows of palm trees on pristine streets, past dozens of hotels beckoning them to stay. It is, the park's marketing material says, ''the Happiest Place on Earth.''A few blocks away, though, a deep fury has boiled over. There have been days of protests, at times violent, with the police responding in combat gear and placing sharpshooters to guard their headquarters. The mayor says he has never seen such mistrust and anger in two decades in the city.
The latest frustrations began last month when the police killed an unarmed man and then another man a day later. An Anaheim neighborhood, just five miles north of Disneyland, quickly erupted. Protests continued. A community meeting is scheduled for next Wednesday. It is expected to draw about 1,000 residents.
There have always been divides in this city south of Los Angeles, where Disneyland and professional hockey and baseball teams bring in millions of visitors each year. The money generated by the resort area makes up roughly a third of the city's annual income. But few visitors ever see the poor neighborhoods just beyond Disneyland Drive. As the protests exploded last week, the park's nightly fireworks continued just a few miles away. 
While most of the city's population of nearly 350,000 lives on the west side of the bowtie-shaped city, in recent decades a wealthy enclave known as Anaheim Hills has flourished to the east. The hills are about 15 miles away from downtown, more like a separate town than a part of this mostly working-class and largely Latino city. There, household income is roughly twice as much as in the flatlands, as the rest of the city is known.
Like most of the City Council, Mayor Tom Tait lives in Anaheim Hills. Last week, he asked federal investigators to look into the Police Department's practices. This week, trying to grapple with how the city could move on, he called a meeting with executives from Disney, as well as the Los Angeles Angels and the Anaheim Ducks, asking them to help come up with programs to help the most struggling neighborhoods in the city.
In those neighborhoods, the mostly Latino residents have grappled with unemployment, poverty, crime and gangs for years. Now, suddenly, those longstanding problems are being thrust into wider view.
''The problem is in that in some of these neighborhoods, there's really a lack of hope from people, and they turn to gangs and crime,'' said Mr. Tait, who has lived in the city since 1988. ''We need people to go into the areas that lack hope and find ways to help.''
Spokesmen for Disney and the sports teams declined to comment about the meeting.
Across much of the flatlands, for now at least, there is a widespread suspicion of the city's elite. Young men complain about being unfairly singled out by the police. Mothers worry that their children are not getting enough support in schools to stay out of trouble. Activists charge that city officials have focused on development around Disneyland and in Anaheim Hills at the expense of the rest of the city.
For more than a generation, Disney has been the power center of the city. The park draws millions of visitors each year and is the city's largest property tax payer and employer.
In 2007, when a developer proposed a high-rise building with affordable housing, Disney spent more than $2 million to back a group called Save Our Anaheim Resort Area, which opposed the plan and successfully persuaded the city to abandon the idea. Since then, the group changed the verb in its name from ''save'' to ''support'' and has created a political action committee that funneled thousands of dollars to candidates, largely money collected from Disney and businesses near the resort, while Disney has continued to donate millions directly to candidates. Disney officials point out that they donate millions of dollars to local nonprofit groups every year.
''Our political action committee is focused on electing resort-district-friendly officials, not just at City Hall but also county supervisors and state senators, anyone voting on matters that would affect the district,'' said Jill Kanzler, the executive director of the group.
Earlier this year, tensions flared when the City Council approved a tax incentive to a developer for a $283 million project to build two luxury hotels across from Disneyland. Typically, the city collects a 15 percent tax for every stay in the city. The incentive plan will allow the developers to keep the money from the tax for the next 15 years, an amount estimated to be $158 million.
''Throughout the city people are facing real problems with working poverty and struggling to get the resources and attention that others parts of town get routinely,'' said Eric Altman, the executive director of Orange County Communities Organized for Responsible Development, an advocacy group that has been critical of city government. ''There is the basic question of why is it in a city with those kind of resources can we have such extreme poverty?''
Mr. Altman said the most recent tax deal is ''essentially the city printing money'' for investors in the resort area.
Harry Sidhu, the mayor pro tem, who has been on the Council for eight years, said that without such subsidies, developers would choose to build in other cities, costing Anaheim jobs and tax dollars. But he dismisses charges that other parts of Anaheim have suffered and that the current election system, which elects members citywide rather than from geographic districts, is unfair. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit on the process, saying it underrepresents Latinos.
''If they don't elect their own people, you can't say we are at fault,'' Mr. Sidhu said. ''We look at the city as one place, we all get the same police services and community services.''
Mr. Sidhu and other city officials frequently say that Anaheim is one of the safest cities of its size in the country. Yet last year, as crime dropped nationally, the city had one of the biggest spikes in violent crime in the state. Few of those episodes were in Anaheim Hills.
Like much of northern Orange County, Anaheim has changed drastically in the years since Disneyland opened in 1955. It grew rapidly through the 1990s, and as the Latino population nearly doubled, it became one of the largest cities in the state. Today, the city is more than half Latino.
Many residents are grandchildren and great-grandchildren of immigrants, some raised on the history of the city's complicated relationship with Latinos. An explosive conflict between the police and residents in 1978 led to several changes in the department. A once gang-infested neighborhood just across from Disneyland was knocked down and renamed. At one point, a city official tried to stop a Mexican supermarket from opening. In the late 1990s, a chief of police ordered background reports on Latino activists who accused the department of misconduct.
Sgt. Juan Reveles has been with the department's gang unit for nearly a decade. The unit has grown to 11 officers, more than double the size it was two years ago. Now, the city has roughly 30 active gangs and all but one are Latino, he said, with about half made up of relatively recent immigrants.
During a community meeting after a police shooting earlier this year, Sergeant Reveles called the gangs ''a failure of the Hispanic community.''
''You would have thought I threw a grenade in the crowd,'' he said in an interview. ''But I am going to call it what it is, not pretend it's different.''
''The anti-police attitude now is at a level I have never seen before,'' he said. But, he continued, ''If officers start to say there's just too much of a headache and we're not going in there, it's the residents who suffer. You can't measure the quality-of-life differences when people are too scared to go downstairs to their own laundry room because gang bangers are kicking back there.''

HEADLINE: President Again Blasts Tax Proposal Of Romney's

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Leesburg, Va.

 BODY:
WINTER PARK, Fla. -- President Obama on Thursday continued his swing-state offensive against Mitt Romney's tax-cut plans, deriding them as a boon to the rich at the expense of everyone else -- ''trickle-down tax-cut fairy dust,'' he called them at a college here.
As for everyone else, Mr. Obama stopped short of repeating a first-term promise: that households making less than $250,000 a year would not see their income taxes increase ''by a single dime'' for the next four years. On Friday, when the monthly unemployment report will come out, the president will meet at the White House with middle-income voters to press Republicans in Congress to extend the expiring Bush-era tax rates except on annual incomes above that threshold. 
In Florida, the president spoke at Rollins College, a small liberal arts campus here, to about 2,400 spirited supporters, before heading to another event in Northern Virginia. As he had at rallies the day before in a third battleground state, Ohio, Mr. Obama seized on an analysis of Mr. Romney's $5 trillion tax cut proposal by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center to argue that his rival's plan would mean big reductions in income taxes for the wealthy and an increase for 95 percent of American taxpayers.
''He's asking you to pay more so that people like him can pay less,'' Mr. Obama said. ''So that people like me pay less.''
While the tax study has emerged as a major component of the economic debate at the core of this year's presidential campaign, Mr. Romney did not allude to the analysis to contest its conclusions as he campaigned in Colorado on Thursday. But in an interview with conservative Fox host Sean Hannity, Mr. Romney said ''my plan is very similar to the Simpson-Bowles plan.'' The Romney proposal, however, has little in common with that bipartisan deficit-reduction proposal from a majority on the fiscal commission that Mr. Obama created in 2010. The Simpson-Bowles plan called for reduced income tax rates, but it would have raised about $2 trillion more in tax revenues over 10 years, mostly from high-income taxpayers, and cut spending to reduce the federal debt.
Separately, a senior Romney aide dismissed the Tax Policy Center study as ''a joke,'' and an economic adviser told reporters on a conference call that the analysis did not sufficiently account for the economic growth that Mr. Romney's proposed 20 percent reduction in all income tax rates would prompt.
Mr. Obama, egged on by his audience, mocked the Romney campaign's response to the study. Citing Romney aides' complaint that the Tax Policy Center, a joint operation of two centrist research organizations, the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, is a liberal entity, Mr. Obama noted ''the fact that it's headed by an economist who worked for George Bush.''
''Then they said that the study failed to fully take into account the massive economic boom that would come from cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations,'' Mr. Obama said, adding, ''because we all know how well that worked out the last time we tried it.''
He continued: ''They have tried to sell us this trickle-down tax-cut fairy dust before. And guess what? It didn't work then. It will not work now. It's not a plan to create jobs. It is not a plan to reduce the deficit. It is not a plan to build our middle class. It is not a plan to move our economy forward. It takes us back to a place we don't need to be.''
As he usually does, Mr. Obama said he had kept his promise from 2008 to cut taxes for the middle class, by an average of $3,600 a year for families. This time he added, ''If you're a family that makes under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families do, you won't see your income taxes increase by a single dime next year.''
In 2012, the president has not yet explicitly repeated the 2008 promise for another four-year term. Many nonpartisan budget analysts have criticized Mr. Obama for that promise since he first made it four years ago, saying the vow would be impossible to keep and still bring the projected growth of the federal debt under control.
But administration officials at the White House said Thursday that Mr. Obama in a second term would continue to work to ensure that tax rates would not increase for people with annual incomes below $250,000 (for couples) or $200,000 (for individuals). They said that Mr. Obama showed the way to do so in the plan he outlined last fall to reduce annual deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years through a combination of spending reductions and tax increases on the wealthy.
The president has a six-point lead in Florida, according to a new poll of battleground states for Quinnipiac University/The New York Times/CBS News.

HEADLINE: The Manana Bankers

 BODY:
How bad do conditions have to get before the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank take new steps to support economic growth? We are about to find out.
Despite ample evidence that the economy is weakening, the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, and the Fed policy committee decided on Wednesday not to undertake any additional monetary stimulus. Then, on Thursday, the E.C.B. also punted. Its president, Mario Draghi, not only failed to deliver on the bold action he signaled last week when he said that he would do ''whatever it takes'' to save the euro, he failed to deliver on any action, even a token clip in the E.C.B.'s benchmark interest rate.
Instead, he said that central bank purchases of government bonds in Spain and Italy would depend on those countries' adherence to commitments to restructure their budgets and economies -- an echo of the self-defeating austerity arguments advanced by Germany in the face of deepening recession. While Mr. Draghi expressed readiness to intervene, he did not outline how or when the aid would be delivered, sowing doubt instead of confidence. 
The markets were generally calm on Wednesday after the Fed announced its wait-and-see approach, in part, because the Fed dampened investor disappointment by strongly indicating that it would act soon. But markets were rocked on Thursday by Mr. Draghi's perceived flip-flop, with stocks dropping and bond yields rising again to dangerous levels on Spanish and Italian debt.
That means trouble for everyone. The euro crisis is arguably the biggest threat to the United States economy, as recession in Europe saps growth here and imperils globally interconnected banking systems. Even short of calamity, rocky stock markets are bad for growth and jobs, in large part because corporate executives often tie their plans for expansion and hiring to the company's stock price.
All of which raises the question: What are Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Draghi waiting for? Slower growth? Higher unemployment? Lower output?
In the United States, growth in the second quarter of the year came in at 1.5 percent, down from 2 percent in the first quarter and 4.1 percent at the end of 2011. Joblessness is stuck above 8 percent, and that figure understates the weakness of a job market that is also plagued by low-wage and part-time work. Manufacturing has slowed, while housing -- the traditional linchpin of economic recovery -- is, by the Fed's own analysis, still depressed. Europe is in even deeper trouble, with several countries in or near recession and unemployment in double digits.
Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Draghi are justifiably concerned that their crisis-fighting tools -- which boil down to various ways to lower borrowing costs -- will, at best, only ameliorate rather than reverse the current economic slowdown. Even so, that could make a positive difference.
Of course, they are right that full recovery will require action by elected government officials. In the United States, Mr. Bernanke has told Congress repeatedly that near-term stimulus measures should be coupled with longer-term plans for deficit reduction. Congressional Republicans, who do not seem to want the economy to improve before Election Day, have refused to heed the advice. In Europe, Mr. Draghi has stressed to little effect that monetary policy cannot substitute for Europeanwide institutional reforms that are needed to hold the euro zone together, including a banking union.
It would, indeed, be better if monetary policy were combined with fiscal policy and structural reforms. But elected officials are balking, and, in the meantime, the entire global economy is slowing given weakness in both the United States and Europe. Central bankers have the autonomy to act and the tools to help the recovery. It is past time to use them.

HEADLINE: Now for Some Real Hurdles

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Hi, everybody. Bob Costas here at the International Broadcast Center, welcoming you to our sixth night of Olympic coverage on NYCNBC. To those who have been watching our exhaustive, turgid coverage of the London Games on NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, Bravo and any other unclaimed bandwidth we could find, thank you for joining us.
NYCNBC, as many of you already know, is where we use computer projections to bring you the likely Olympic results if New York City rather than London had been awarded the 2012 Games. You may recall that New York's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, had put in a bid for the Games that featured a snazzy promotional video and everything, but lost out to London because he refused to leap out of a helicopter in a pink dress during the opening ceremonies. 
The imaginary Olympic Village in New York was still buzzing today about Thursday's decision by the Rules Committee to declare a do-over in the men's time trial cycling event after the great British cyclist Bradley Wiggins, who was leading the race, was stopped by three different New Yorkers asking where their takeout orders were. Just hours later the same committee stripped Jinjie Gong of China and Virginie Cueff of France of their medals in the women's five-kilometer pedicab event for complaining about small tips.
This morning, in a stunning upset, the team gold medal in gymnastics was awarded to the cast of ''Bring It On,'' the Broadway cheerleading musical, which several of the judges had seen in previews last week. Also in gymnastics, the city's effort to save money by using one of those police barricade things as the Olympic balance beam proved disastrous for almost every competitor, although, in a bright note for the economy, the New York chapter of the American Association of Orthopaedic Medicine reported that business was booming.
Yet another equestrian event was canceled this afternoon as the dressage horses joined their jumping counterparts in a strike to protest the New York Police Department's use of mounted officers. ''Have you seen the size of some of those cops?'' a spokesman for the horses said.
In somewhat better news, it appears that the men's and women's 1,500-meter races and 400-meter hurdles will go forward as scheduled tomorrow, despite the fact that the promised Olympic Track and Field Stadium never did get past the mandatory competing-designs-and-lawsuits stage. Officials will relocate the races to the High Line, the popular strolling park on Manhattan's West Side, though because of public-access requirements, the park will remain open to pedestrians during the contests.
Diving continued today at the McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn, which became the default site for swimming events after budget problems forced the city to abandon plans to build a watersport stadium. Qin Kai and Luo Yutong of China won gold this morning in men's synchronized diving, despite having to purge their routine of all somersaults, back flips, pikes, twists and tucks, all of which are forbidden by pool rules, which are rigidly enforced by lifeguards.
Tennis matches, meanwhile, were slowly getting back on track this evening after being delayed for days because no one remembered to sign up for a court on the Parks Department waiting list.
We'll bring you highlights of these and other events after the break, along with an interview with the Italian archer whose ill-advised decision to ride the subway to his match caused 6,423 people to call the if-you-see-something-say-something hot line.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Governors Gather To Rally Around Romney

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
BASALT, Colo. -- After a rocky trip to Europe and Israel in which his remarks drew complaints from British and Palestinian leaders, Mitt Romney flew Thursday to Colorado, an important swing state, to try to regain his footing and refocus his campaign on his core message of renewing the economy.
It was a day to rally the Republican troops around him. At a high school auditorium here, near Aspen, he was backed by 10 Republican governors, including one vanquished rival -- Rick Perry of Texas -- and several politicians who have been subject of vice-presidential speculation, including Govs. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Chris Christie of New Jersey and Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina. 
Mr. Perry, who endorsed Newt Gingrich when he dropped out of the nominating fight in January, said to Mr. Romney that ''I'm proud to stand with you on this stage,'' and told the crowd of a few hundred that Colorado's energy industry would get a much better shake from Mr. Romney.
''The difference between the current president of the United States and the next president of the United States is that this man trusts you,'' Mr. Perry said.
Earlier on Thursday, Mr. Romney struck back at Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, who has suggested that Mr. Romney spent a decade not paying taxes.
''It's time for Harry to put up or shut up,'' he told Sean Hannity of Fox News. ''It's untrue, dishonest and inaccurate,'' he said, demanding that ''Harry reveal his sources.''
Mr. Romney, who shied away from directly criticizing President Obama while overseas, wasted no time in assailing the president back on their home turf, saying Mr. Obama had had plenty of time to get the country's economy back on track. And he later pledged that he would balance the budget by the last year of his second term, though he did not elaborate on how he would do that, given that his proposed tax cuts would, according to studies, increase the deficit.
Mr. Romney asserted that sweeping improvements promised by Mr. Obama three years ago never happened. ''Jobs, the number unemployed, the unemployment rate, home prices, the budget deficit, family income,'' Mr. Romney said. ''On every single one of those measures, he took America in the wrong direction.''
On the most politically critical of those issues -- jobs -- Mr. Romney prefers to focus on job losses under Mr. Obama beginning in January 2009, the month the president was inaugurated. By that measure, the country lost about a half-million jobs through June of this year.
But Mr. Obama and his aides say it is more fair to start in March 2010, after Mr. Obama's signature stimulus law had been passed and new White House policies began to take effect. By that measure, the economy had added more than four million private-sector jobs by June of this year.
Other Republican governors who spoke on behalf of Mr. Romney here were Bob McDonnell of Virginia, Matt Mead of Wyoming, Gary R. Herbert of Utah, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Jan Brewer of Arizona.
Earlier in the day, at an event in Golden, Colo., Mr. Romney tried to strike a conciliatory tone, suggesting that he would work to reach across the aisle to find common ground with Democrats.
''We've got to have someone that goes to Washington that buries the hatchet and says, 'You know what, there are good Democrats, there are good Republicans that care about America -- let's work together to get the American people working, get some growth again,' '' Mr. Romney said, alluding to his time as governor of Massachusetts, where he had to work with Democrats in state government.
In fact, while he trumpeted that experience on Thursday -- ''I worked in a state, I found a way to work across the aisle'' -- his record in Massachusetts is much more mixed, according to lawmakers who worked with Mr. Romney there. Some have described him as aloof or awkward, struggling to remember names and poor at the backslapping and glad-handing skills that are useful for lubricating the legislative process in a state capitol.

HEADLINE: Obama Campaign Seeks to Recast Romney as a Raiser of Taxes on the Middle Class

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
President Obama takes the offensive by presenting Mitt Romney's tax-cutting plan as something that will actually raise taxes on the middle class so the wealthy can pay less. Seizing on a new study, Mr. Obama is trying to convince voters that his opponent will do exactly what he says he will not.
THE SCRIPT A male narrator says: ''You work hard. Stretch every penny. But chances are you pay a higher tax rate than him. Mitt Romney made $20 million in 2010 but paid only 14 percent in taxes, probably less than you. Now he has a plan that would give millionaires another tax break, and raises taxes on middle-class families by up to $2,000 a year. Mitt Romney's middle-class tax increase: He pays less. You pay more.'' 
ON THE SCREEN Images of families paying bills are juxtaposed with photos of Mitt Romney, including a picture of him with Donald J. Trump's plane in the background. Superimposed on the images are various numbers making the point of the ad.
ACCURACY Mr. Romney and his wife paid an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent on $21.6 million in adjusted gross income in 2010, a rate typical of households earning about $80,000, because his income came largely from investments, which are taxed at a lower rate than salaries and wages. He has not proposed raising taxes on middle-class families by $2,000 as the ad suggests, but that is what the campaign argues would be the effect of the plan he has outlined, citing a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute.
Mr. Romney's plan would cut income tax rates by 20 percent, among other tax breaks; he promises to make the plan ''revenue neutral,'' meaning that the lost revenue would be offset so it would not increase the deficit, but has not specified how he would do that.
The study, filling in the gaps, assumed that he would have to eliminate various tax breaks like mortgage-interest deductions that would result in a net tax increase for 95 percent of taxpayers, while the wealthiest 5 percent would pay less. Those in middle-income brackets would pay on average $546 more a year, according to the study, and upper-middle class taxpayers would pay $1,880 more, while the taxes of the richest 1 percent would be cut by $29,282.
Mr. Romney's advisers said the study was flawed because it did not account for economic growth they believe would be stimulated by a separate plan to restructure corporate taxes and by lowered deficits. And they called the study biased because one of the three co-authors worked for Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Another worked for the elder President George Bush but has publicly supported ending the tax cuts enacted by President George W. Bush in favor of a broader tax code overhaul. The director of the Tax Policy Center, Donald Marron, was a member of the younger Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, however.
BOTTOM LINE Mr. Obama is trying to turn the tax argument around. The Supreme Court recently upheld his health care law by defining its penalty for not buying insurance as a tax, and he has supported letting tax rates rise back to their level in the 1990s on income over $250,000. With this ad, he paints his opponent as a tax increaser and skewers him for seemingly favoring the rich over the middle class.

HEADLINE: Debt, Depression, DeMarco

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
There has been plenty to criticize about President Obama's handling of the economy. Yet the overriding story of the past few years is not Mr. Obama's mistakes but the scorched-earth opposition of Republicans, who have done everything they can to get in his way -- and who now, having blocked the president's policies, hope to win the White House by claiming that his policies have failed.
And this week's shocking refusal to implement debt relief by the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency -- a Bush-era holdover the president hasn't been able to replace -- illustrates perfectly what's going on. 
Some background: many economists believe that the overhang of excess household debt, a legacy of the bubble years, is the biggest factor holding back economic recovery. Loosely speaking, excess debt has created a situation in which everyone is trying to spend less than their income. Since this is collectively impossible -- my spending is your income, and your spending is my income -- the result is a persistently depressed economy.
How should policy respond? One answer is government spending to support the economy while the private sector repairs its balance sheets; now is not the time for austerity, and cuts in government purchases have been a major economic drag. Another answer is aggressive monetary policy, which is why the Federal Reserve's refusal to act in the face of high unemployment and below-target inflation is a scandal.
But fiscal and monetary policy could, and should, be coupled with debt relief. Reducing the burden on Americans in financial trouble would mean more jobs and improved opportunities for everyone.
Unfortunately, the administration's initial debt relief efforts were ineffectual: Officials imposed so many restrictions to avoid giving relief to ''undeserving'' debtors that the program went nowhere. More recently, however, the administration has gotten a lot more serious about the issue.
And the obvious place to provide debt relief is on mortgages owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored lenders that were effectively nationalized in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration.
The idea of using Fannie and Freddie has bipartisan support. Indeed, Columbia's Glenn Hubbard, a top Romney adviser, has called on Fannie and Freddie to let homeowners with little or no equity refinance their mortgages, which could sharply cut their interest payments and provide a major boost to the economy. The Obama administration supports this idea and has also proposed a special program of relief for deeply troubled borrowers.
But Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the agency that oversees Fannie and Freddie, refuses to move on refinancing. And, this week, he rejected the administration's relief plan.
Who is Ed DeMarco? He's a civil servant who became acting director of the housing finance agency after the Bush-appointed director resigned in 2009. He is still there, in the fourth year of the Obama administration, because Senate Republicans have blocked attempts to install a permanent director. And he evidently just hates the idea of providing debt relief.
Mr. DeMarco's letter rejecting the relief plan made remarkably weak arguments. He claimed that the plan, while improving his agency's financial position thanks to subsidies from the Treasury Department, would be a net loss to taxpayers -- a conclusion not supported by his own staff's analysis, which showed a net gain. And it's worth pointing out that many private lenders have offered the very kinds of principal reductions Mr. DeMarco rejects -- even though these lenders, unlike the government, have no incentive to take into account the way debt relief would strengthen the economy.
The main point, however, is that Mr. DeMarco seems to misunderstand his job. He's supposed to run his agency and secure its finances -- not make national economic policy. If the Treasury secretary, acting for the president, seeks to subsidize debt relief in a way that actually strengthens the finance agency, the agency's chief has no business blocking that policy. Doing so should be a firing offense.
Can Mr. DeMarco be fired right away? I've been seeing conflicting analyses on that point, although one thing is clear: President Obama, if re-elected, can, and should, replace him through a recess appointment. In fact, he should have done that years ago. As I said, Mr. Obama has made plenty of mistakes.
But the DeMarco affair nonetheless demonstrates, once again, the extent to which U.S. economic policy has been crippled by unyielding, irresponsible political opposition. If our economy is still deeply depressed, much -- and I would say most -- of the blame rests not with Mr. Obama but with the very people seeking to use that depressed economy for political advantage.

HEADLINE: The Billionaire Versus the Little Guy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Donald Trump, the archvillain of Anthony Baxter's documentary polemic, ''You've Been Trumped,'' is a man many people love to hate. In this unabashedly hostile portrait of a billionaire developer in action as he embarks on a grandiose new project in Scotland, Mr. Trump comes across as an insensitive, lying bully who will do whatever it takes to realize his dream of creating what he promises will be the world's greatest golf resort.The $1.5 billion project involves building two 18-hole golf courses (the first one opened last month), a 450-bedroom luxury hotel, and a complex of apartments and golf villas on the North Sea coast. Environmental protection was pushed aside for economic development, and the government supported the project, which Mr. Trump declared would bring 6,000 jobs to the area.
Like Michael Moore in ''Roger and Me,'' Mr. Baxter is a persistent gnat who hovers around Mr. Trump and his entourage, camera in hand, and refuses to be brushed off. At one point in the film he is arrested and charged with breach of the peace. But whereas Mr. Moore was the star of his own film, Mr. Baxter, who was born in eastern Scotland not far from the development area, maintains a low profile in a documentary that has no narrator. 
There is also a big difference between Roger Smith, the General Motors chief executive officer whom Mr. Moore was never able to interview in his film, and the publicity-loving Mr. Trump, who broadcast his ambitions on late-night television and on the Golf Channel. ''You've Been Trumped'' lards in excerpts from Bill Forsyth's 1983 fillm, ''Local Hero,'' in which a Texas oil baron wants to build a refinery in a fictional Scottish coastal town.
Once construction begins on the 1,400-acre Menie Estate, which Mr. Trump bought in 2005, the lives of the farmers and fishermen in nearby Balmedie, a town of 3,000, are disrupted.
The arrival of Mr. Trump and his overbearing ways is an affront to many residents, especially Michael Forbes, a farmer who refuses to sell his property, which Mr. Trump describes as a slum and a pigsty. The film delves into the problems encountered by Mr. Forbes and neighbors who band together to protest the development. Mr. Forbes loses his electricity and water. Enormous piles of dirt and sand are dumped near cottages, blocking their ocean views, and homeowners are taken to court in petty boundary disputes. At one point the use of ''compulsory purchase orders,'' the Scottish equivalent of eminent domain, to force them to sell, is threatened.
After the heavy machinery arrives and begins leveling the ground, the police and security guards block Mr. Baxter as he attempts to enter the area. He gives cameras to two of the villagers to film the day-by-day destruction of the dunes and the surrounding grassland.
What they record is the transformation of part of an area that one environmentalist describes as a fragile and irreplaceable ''mosaic of habitats'' into a muddy building site. Mr. Trump publicly insists that he has the approval of most environmental groups. There are moments when the film's concern for the environment tilts toward sentimentality and even hysteria.
Most galling to Mr. Baxter is Mr. Trump's receipt of an honorary degree in business administration from Robert Gordon University in nearby Aberdeen. It prompts a protest from a previous honoree, the Scottish environmentalist David Kennedy, who ostentatiously returns his degree.
''You've Been Trumped'' ends indecisively. Last year Mr. Trump said he would not construct the promised hotel unless plans were scrapped to build an offshore wind farm that he said would destroy the ocean view. So far both sides of this David and Goliath battle are still standing.
You've Been Trumped

Errant Stock Trades Reveal a Risk That Few Anticipated | The trading firm Knight Capital recently rushed to develop a computer program so it could take advantage of a new Wall Street venue for trading stocks. But the firm ran up against its deadline and failed to fully work out the kinks in its system, according to people briefed on the matter. In its debut Wednesday, the software went awry, swamping the stock market with errant trades and putting Knight's future in jeopardy.
The fiasco, the third stock trading debacle in the last five months, revived calls for bolder changes to a computer-driven market that has been hobbled by its own complexity and speed. Among the proposals that gained momentum were stringent testing of computer trading programs and a transaction tax that could reduce trading.
In the industry, there was a widespread recognition that the markets had become more dangerous than even specialists realized."What is starting to become clear is that the costs in terms of these random shocks to the system are occurring in ways that people never anticipated," said Henry Hu, a former official at the Securities and Exchange Commission and a professor at the University of Texas in Austin.
Knight, founded in 1995, is a leading matchmaker for buyers and sellers of stocks, handling 11 percent of all trading in the first half of this year, according to the data firm Tabb Group. Knight lost three-quarters of its market value in the last two days, in addition to losing $440 million from the errant trades, and was scrambling to find financing or a new owner.

HEADLINE: A Give-and-Take on Jobs

BYLINE: ECONOMIX EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: The latest figures on jobs and unemployment have led to adjustments in The Times's weekly election-year jobs tracker. 

 BODY:
Friday's monthly jobs report easily beat expectations, with the United States adding 163,000 jobs in July. Still, the unemployment rate, based on a separate survey, stayed essentially unchanged - and with rounding figured in, it even edged up to 8.3 percent from 8.2 percent a month earlier.
The reports led to adjustments in The Times's weekly election-year jobs tracker. Economists at Moody's Analysts now forecast a greater average growth in jobs in the six months before the election than they did a month ago - 137,000 instead of 129,000. Yet for the first time since The Times began the tracker, Moody's is not forecasting an unemployment rate on Election Day below 8 percent. 
More from Moody's on Friday's numbers:
Given the headwinds from Europe and elevated uncertainty, the improvement in July is respectable. Underlying job growth appears to be running around 150,000 a month, better than this spring but not sufficient to make a significant dent in the unemployment rate.
Payroll gains in July were broad-based across industries. Other details were not as encouraging, however, as the average workweek was unchanged. Also, average hourly earnings for private sector workers was up 1.7 percent on a year-ago basis, the slowest since December 2010. Sluggish consumer spending is apt to persist unless income growth picks up soon.
Both of Moody's forecasts - for the average job growth and the unemployment rate -- would suggest a close presidential election. As The Times's Nate Silver said on Thursday, the economic reality already appears largely baked into how voters feel about the economy and President Obama. These jobs reports, though above expectations, do not seem to deviate from the norm in a large enough degree to swing the electorate's feeling in a major way.

HEADLINE: Boomers and Entitlements: The Next Round


HIGHLIGHT: James K. Galbraith and Jim Kessler continue the debate around Social Security. 

 BODY:
My proposal that the baby boomer generation take on the cause of rescuing entitlements from their unsustainable course - setting aside a share of the savings to invest in infrastructure, education and basic research - continues to draw a lot of mail, pro and con. Today I'm kicking up my feet and cranking up the Beach Boys while two more authoritative advocates go at it. 
James K. Galbraith is a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, and a prolific critic of American capitalism and foreign interventions. He articulates the view of many readers that Social Security and Medicare are secure. In particular, he attacks the findings of Third Way, a think tank of centrist Democrats, whose work on this subject I have cited as enlightening and alarming.
I invited Jim Kessler, the senior vice president for policy at Third Way, to defend the group's work. He's a co-founder of the group, and a former legislative director for Senator Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. 
Not that it matters, but both Galbraith and Kessler are baby boomers.
Readers will not be surprised that I continue to find Kessler's arguments more persuasive. But I welcome a chance to keep the conversation going. It doesn't seem to be taking place where it SHOULD be taking place: in Washington and on the campaign trail.

Dear Mr. Keller:
I am writing this at the request of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, which directed my attention to your recent Op-Ed on "entitlements." As a former Executive Director of the Joint Economic Committee, and as an economist with experience studying budget and military matters, your column immediately engaged my interest.
The nub of your essay on why Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid must be cut is a graph - taken from a report by a group called Third Way - that compares federal "investments" with "entitlements," showing that one is in decline and the other is on the rise.
But note, as you acknowledge, that the federal budget counts as "investments." Back in the 1960s, that was mainly what federal investment was. We were building nuclear bombers, submarines, missiles and warheads; today we are downsizing that arsenal, happily unused. Do you really think that those "investments" had anything much to do with economic growth? If so, you are misinformed.
Even today, military procurement is around 40 percent of total federal "investment" - $221 billion out of about $540 billion in 2011, according to the in the Budget. Whatever you think of the F-35 and F-22, it's silly to add that number to (say) federal aid to education. The sum is not a gauge of anything.
On the budget, you go on to assert that "the arithmetic simply doesn't work." If you mean that the federal fiscal position is unsustainable - a widely-held view - you are again misinformed. How do we know? Partly, because the markets clearly have full confidence in the US fiscal position - as evidenced by the record low long-term interest rates at which people with money are willing to lend to the US Government. And if you don't trust the markets, you can also look at the numbers, as I do here: http://tinyurl.com/6edmaxp Either way, the conclusion is the same. Contrary to repeated scare- mongering, the United States public debt position is not unsustainable.
In reality, an older population results partly from the success of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid over the years. Since the early 1970s these programs have protected elderly Americans from destitution. So protected, they live longer. And as the old become more numerous, the payout of the programs that support them must rise. There is nothing wrong with this, and nothing unsustainable. The right measure is the share of total spending on this population in total GDP; for Social Security (OASDI), which was under 4.5 percentage points in 2009 and projected to rise to 6.5 percent ** Plainly we can afford that. Your proposal for a higher retirement age deserves a word. Today, a very large share of Social Security recipients take the early retirement option, beginning at 62. Raising the "retirement age" is just a benefit cut for these, most vulnerable, lowest-paid workers - especially those who take the option because they are already unemployed. It's the cruelest and most dishonestly-presented of all so-called Social Security "reforms." I would strongly urge you to repudiate it.
We agree that health care costs should be controlled. But to attack Medicare specifically is to target the elderly for cuts, simply because they happen to have a public insurance program. Again, there is no reason for this. Your actual proposals would (mostly) apply to Medicare and non-Medicare funded care alike, which is better. But since they apply to private as well as public insurance programs, they obviously aren't a case for "entitlement reform".
These are simple points, whose validity I believe anyone can judge. The FERI will publish a blog post closely related to this letter on its site, at http://tinyurl.com/c4zowz5 . I invite you to respond there, and to make appropriate corrections in a future column.
Yours sincerely, (s/)
James K. Galbraith 
** For a detailed discussion of the question of "burden" see my testimony to the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, February 25, 2009, co-authored with Warren Mosler and Randall Wray, available on request: Galbraith@mail.utexas.edu
The response:
Mr. Galbraith has made important contributions to the discourse about the economy, but we simply don't share his optimistic view about the financial health of Social Security and Medicare. In his testimony before the Bowles-Simpson commission, he called solvency arguments "complete nonsense" (http://bit.ly/aw0nFX). His criticism of Third Way's paper (http://bit.ly/MXhAxA) is a continuation of his belief that these programs are doing fine and that in general, "there is no economic justification for deficit reduction." We disagree and appreciate the opportunity to respond to Mr. Galbraith's letter.
Mr. Galbraith's first critique is that we included military investment in our overall measure of America's federal investment spending. But we simply defined investments as the United States Government does. Had we chosen our own definition, it would have been criticized, fairly or unfairly, for being biased. 
Moreover, does Mr. Galbraith really believe there is no economic value at all to any military investment spending? Here are just a few discoveries out of defense the internet, Google earth, GPS, prosthetics, medical technology to treat wounds and administer trauma care, much of aerospace, high end computing (originally used for code breaking), satellite phones, SONAR, the device used to disarm the explosives in the killer's apartment in Aurora, graphite bicycles, tennis rackets and golf clubs, digital watches, and so forth. Sure not all military investment spending benefits the economy, but neither does some domestic investment spending. 
But let's take Mr. Galbraith's assumption at face value. By any measure, investment spending has cratered. If military investment spending is eliminated from the calculation and only domestic spending is included (as Mr. Galbraith suggests), the peak year is 1966, followed by 1965, followed by 1967. Between 1963 and 1981, non-defense investment spending represented between 10.6 and 14.5 percent of all federal spending. After 1981 it never reached 10% again. That's 31 consecutive years of domestic investment spending below 10% of federal outlays, following 19 consecutive years of plus-10%. That's not good.
Mr. Galbraith next argues that deficits don't matter and as proof he points to Treasury rates: "The markets have full confidence in the U.S. fiscal position - as evidenced by the record low long-term interest rates" for U.S. Treasuries. We cannot imagine a more dangerous way to judge our fiscal health. Look, we hate comparisons between the U.S. and Europe because they are overly simple, but .here it is anyway. Spain's and Germany's interest rates were essentially the same in 2008, only one-point apart in 2009 and 2010, and then they shot to three-points apart in 2011, growing to as much as 6 in 2012. Was everything fine in Spain in one year and off the rails the next? Of course not. The capital markets, in that case, had yet to recognize that Spain was in trouble. When they did the ballgame was over. 
Our interest rates are low because 1) our economy is stuck right now, and 2) we are the calmest port in very stormy seas. Do we really want an economic strategy based on the belief that no other country or region (Europe or China) will ever get their act together? In 1992, America fielded the Dream Team and won the gold through lopsided victories. By 2008, through complacency, we won the bronze. Don't bet on other countries not filling the vacuum.
The heart of Mr. Galbraith's argument revolves around his view that entitlement spending is on a healthy trajectory. We believe this is wrong:
 On Medicare: Neither the column by Mr. Keller nor the Third Way paper attack Medicare or Medicaid (as Mr. Galbraith writes), but rather they both state the obvious - the rising cost of these programs is outstripping the ability to pay for them. By any measure, Medicare and Medicaid spending is growing too quickly. From 1975 to 2010, per person Medicare spending grew at roughly GDP plus 2 percent. That is far, far faster than inflation. Over a short period of time that's sustainable. Over a long period of time it's strangulation. Couple that with the fact that our Medicare population essentially doubles over the next several decades this is a financial crisis for the U.S. government. As we have said many times, the best way to reduce Medicare spending is not to slash benefits but to reward quality not quantity. For example, twenty-seven percent of all Medicare spending is on the last year of a person's life. While some of that is necessary, a great deal is spent on procedures that don't meaningfully extend people's lives and many actually reduce the quality of their final weeks. This is just one reform idea to make the program perform better and cost less; it's hardly an attack on the overall program. 
 On Social Security I: There is a net-present-value shortfall of $8.6 trillion over the next 75 years, according to the Social Security actuaries. Let's not pretend that this is chump change. The actuaries estimate that if Congress acts right away, they could close this shortfall by hiking payroll taxes by 21%, cutting benefits by 16%, or some combination of both immediately. Again, let's not pretend this isn't a ton of money. The payroll tax hike is close to $200 billion per year. In addition, every year Congress waits they have to reach that $8.6 trillion over a shorter time horizon. That means bigger tax increases or bigger benefit cuts. The only question, then, is when Congress fixes the problem and how much of the fix tilts toward benefit cuts versus revenue increases. Mr. Galbraith disagrees, but many believe it should be a balance between new revenue and cuts, and we should spread the solution over all 75 years, not a shorter time horizon. Many believe that people earning very high incomes should receive fewer benefits in retirement. Many believe that just as we gradually raised the retirement age in 1986 so that retirement ultimately reaches 67 by the next decade, we need to gently increase it again for those who are young today so that the amount of time that a typical person spends collecting Social Security stays constant - about 18 years. And many people think we should find solutions now so the next generation doesn't have to do it alone.
 On Social Security II: Mr. Galbraith is correct that over the next 75 years, SS's projected rise as a share of GDP goes from "under 4.5 percentage points in 2009" to "6.5 percent over the next 75 years." He says "plainly we can afford that." Let's be clear that this measly little two-point bump is actually a 45% rise in the cost of Social Security relative to the size of our economy. To translate further, this is a 45% rise relative to the size and ability of working age people's capacity to produce and pay for it. To translate further, 2 percent of GDP in today's economy totals $300 billion. These are enormous sums of money masquerading as a point here and there.
Mr. Galbraith doesn't believe that deficits matter and he believes that Social Security and Medicare are doing just fine. We disagree. Entitlements are growing by leaps and bounds; investments by any measure are not keeping pace, and the future shows an accelerating trend in the wrong direction. We need to be concerned about this.

HEADLINE: What the Jobs Numbers Mean for Fed Policy

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: While the July jobs numbers were better than forecast, they do not seem to have been sufficiently spectacular to change analysts' expectations for Fed action. 

 BODY:
Before the July jobs report was released on Friday, Wall Streeters assumed that the Federal Reserve would deliver more stimulus as soon as its next meeting in September. While the latest report turned out to be better than economists had forecast, it was probably still not sufficiently spectacular to change those expectations of the Fed.
There are a few reasons to believe the Fed is still on the same track that it was on a day earlier. Chief among them is that despite the rosy headline payroll number, many of the underlying details of the July report were very weak -- especially those coming from the Labor Department's survey of American households.
The Labor Department draws its jobs numbers from two surveys, one sent to employers and one sent to households. The one sent to employers was the survey that delivered an upside surprise -- the net gain of 163,000 nonfarm jobs. The household survey, however, showed the opposite trend: that the number of people who were working actually in July rather than rising.
It showed a pretty sharp decline, too, of 195,000 fewer people working. It also reported that the number of people in the labor force -- that is, the people who were working or actively looking for work -- fell as well, indicating that more people may be giving up on looking for jobs.
The decline in the number of Americans who are working brought the unemployment rate a tick higher to 8.3 percent in July, from 8.2 percent in June (although the difference between the two rates is not statistically significant). That means the jobless rate has basically stagnated since January.
A broader measure of unemployment -- one that includes people working part time who want to be working full time, and people who have given up looking for work because they're discouraged -- has been rising steadily since April. It is now 15 percent.
The household survey is much more volatile than the payroll survey because the sample size is much smaller. The household survey showed that the labor force grew by 156,000 in June and then immediately shrank by 150,000 in July, for example.
Even so, the Fed measures its mandate more in terms of the household survey than the payroll survey, my colleague Binyamin Appelbaum (who covers the Fed) tells me, because the household survey measures workers rather than jobs and includes a broader range of occupations.
For example, the household survey includes workers who are self-employed, and the payroll survey does not.
The household survey is also more likely to capture job growth that is being created by new businesses, which are relatively unlikely to be included in payroll surveys since the Labor Department doesn't know they exist yet.
Even given the household survey's expected volatility, the unemployment rate has remained remarkably consistent since January. That steady rate of around 8.2 percent is also at the upper end of the central tendency that the Fed reported in its June forecast for economic conditions this year.
Many of the other numbers from the payroll survey, I should note, were likewise lackluster, if not outright bad.
The length of the work week was unchanged, and hourly earnings barely moved. In fact, year over year, the percent change in hourly earnings is at record lows.
None of these indicators suggest that the economy is headed right back into recession. Nonetheless, put together, economists believe that the latest data portray an recovery that's slow enough to warrant more Fed intervention.

HEADLINE: The McClellan Problem

BYLINE: RICHARD SLOTKIN


HIGHLIGHT: What does a president do when his general is also his enemy? 

 BODY:
On Aug. 3, 1862, Gen. George C. McClellan received orders to begin withdrawing the Army of the Potomac from its position in front of Richmond, Va. The new Union general in chief, Henry Halleck, had given McClellan a choice: to renew his offensive against Richmond or ship his army back to Washington. McClellan resented and resisted Halleck's authority, and stubbornly refused to advance, thinking Halleck would eventually recognize the folly of a withdrawal. 
And folly it was, McClellan's obstinacy and lack of battlefield success notwithstanding. Once McClellan's troops were in transit, half the Union forces in the Virginia theater were out of action. With the threat to Richmond removed, Gen. Robert E. Lee was free to stage a bold counter-offensive into northern Virginia, which would lead to the near destruction of the Union Army under General John Pope at the Second Battle of Bull Run, the invasion of Maryland, the bloody Battle of Antietam and the Confederacy's best chance to win the war outright.
The root of this tactical blunder was the radical and absolutely necessary transformation of Federal strategy initiated by President Abraham Lincoln in July 1862. At the start of the war, he had hoped that aggressive military action, coupled with a "conciliatory" policy on slavery, would induce the South to negotiate a return to the Union in short order. But a year of costly fighting had proved that the Confederacy's military strength and political will could not be overcome without a far longer and more destructive war. By the summer of 1862, the situation was clear: Union troop strength had to be greatly increased - Lincoln was asking for 300,000 new volunteers - and offensives had to be pressed with greater energy. 
But Lincoln had also concluded that the elimination of slavery must become a Federal war aim. He had always believed slavery was morally wrong and incompatible with democracy. It was the motive for secession and the basis of the South's economic and military strength. So long as slavery existed it would remain a source of conflict between the states. Lincoln concluded that the longer, costlier war for the Union that now seemed necessary could be justified only if it removed the root cause of conflict. 
To carry out such a strategy he needed a general whose determination and commitment matched his own. What he had instead was General McClellan, who was both a balky and reluctant field commander and the symbolic champion of the opposition Democratic Party. On July 8, 1862, he met with McClellan at the general's headquarters, to see whether he was able and willing to fight the long war. 
McClellan was a highly respected West Point professional, who had been put in command of the Army immediately after the disaster at Bull Run in July 1861. For the first months of his tenure he received universal acclaim, and was given a free hand in organizing the Federal armies. But the accolades went to his head: he believed the outpouring of public support he enjoyed during his first six months in command was a kind of symbolic election, which gave him moral authority comparable to the president's. Although he saw himself as a disinterested military professional, he was in fact a partisan Democrat "of the Stephen A. Douglas school," who maintained close contact with the leaders of the Democratic Party and pressed Lincoln to adopt the "conservative" policies favored by his party. 
He thought antislavery Republicans were just as responsible as secessionists for the outbreak of war, and that if he was to restore the Union he had to defeat both the Southern armies on his front and the Radical Republicans who would stab him in the back. He even flirted with idea of a Congressionally sanctioned "dictatorship," which would give him control of war policy, leaving Lincoln as a figurehead. From the start of his tenure he had waged a series of political and bureaucratic battles, trying to make himself the dominant voice in the president's councils. "I have no choice," he told his wife. "The people call upon me to save the country - I save it & cannot respect anything that stands in the way." 
His illusions flourished in the hothouse of his headquarters, where he was surrounded by loyalists who mirrored and even exaggerated his moods. He saw himself as the agent of Divine Providence, chosen by God to save the Republic - and visit judgment on his enemies. Even his defeat by Lee in the Seven Days battles was a sign that God was on his side. "I think I begin to see His wise purpose in all this," He wrote his wife on July 10. "If I had succeeded in taking Richmond now the fanatics of the North might have been too powerful & reunion impossible." 
Most dangerously, McClellan was utterly contemptuous of Abraham Lincoln's character, intelligence, social origins and morals. He dismissed the president as "the original Gorilla," a well-meaning but weak-minded "baboon" surrounded by fools and traitors. He believed that his July 8 meeting was his opportunity to impress his will and his ideas on the president. 
They met on the deck of Lincoln's steamer, where a canvas awning shaded them from the day's insufferable heat. Lincoln asked McClellan when he planned to resume the offensive. Instead of answering, McClellan begged leave to submit a letter detailing his views, which he handed the president. Instead of taking it and leaving, Lincoln read it right there. But if its contents astonished him he gave no sign. 
The letter said nothing about the Army's defeat, nor did it propose a plan for renewing the offensive. It was instead a political manifesto, laying out McClellan's grand design for the future civil and military policy of the country. McClellan demanded a "conservative" approach to three basic policies: the legal consequences of secession, the status of slavery and the division of power between civil and military authorities. He denied the basic premise of Lincoln's policy, that secession was an act of rebellion. Instead, he declared that the government had no right to "subjugate" the seceded states. So when their districts were occupied by Union forces, the "political rights" of Southerners must be automatically restored. As McClellan well knew, such a policy would slowly restore the Democratic Party's national majority. 
McClellan also warned that "A declaration of radical views, upon slavery, will rapidly disintegrate our present Armies." Coming from the commander of the nation's most powerful army, which was imbued with his cult of personal loyalty, that warning had threatening implications. Finally, McClellan wanted Lincoln to delegate control of all war-related policy to "a Commander in Chief of the Army; one who possesses your confidence, understands your views and who is competent to execute your orders." McClellan was clearly nominating himself for the post. 
In effect, McClellan was demanding that Lincoln abandon the responsibilities of his office and the platform of his party, and turn power over to the general who had just lost the war's greatest battle at the time. 
Lincoln pocketed the letter and kept his poker face, but the meeting had crystallized his strategic ideas. In the two weeks that followed he made a series of decisions which radically transformed Federal strategy. On July 11 he ordered Gen. Henry Halleck, commander of Federal armies in the West, to assume command, under the president, of all Federal armies - thus making him McClellan's superior.
Then, on July 12, in a private conversation with Secretary of State William Seward and Navy Secretary Gideon Welles, Lincoln declared his intention to issue an emancipation proclamation, freeing all slaves in the rebellious states; and on July 22 he presented a draft proclamation to an astonished cabinet. He acted with full awareness that such a proclamation would end all hope of conciliation and commit the Union to an all-out war. 
First, however, he had to deal with McClellan. Indeed, Halleck's first task would be to force General McClellan to resume the offensive - but McClellan was immovable, confident that his popular prestige and political support gave him sovereign immunity. On July 11, the very day of Halleck's appointment, he boasted to his wife, "I have commenced receiving letters from the North urging me to march on Washington & assume the Govt!!" 
Fearful of removing him outright, Halleck and Lincoln chose the half-measure of shipping McClellan's Army north without him. They thus set the stage of Lee's invasion of Maryland, and McClellan's return to command for the Antietam campaign.

HIGHLIGHT: London Live: Coverage of swimming, tennis and soccer at the Olympics in London. 

 BODY:
The battle of distance powerhouses Ethiopia and Kenya was won by the Ethiopians in the first medal event of the track and field competitions, as Tirunesh Dibaba pulled away from her Kenyan competitors to claim gold with a time of 30:20.75. 
Tennis's men's semifinals got started with an epic match between Roger Federer and Juan Martin del Potro, which Federer won, 19-17, and were capped by a victory by Andy Murray in the other semifinal, 7-5, 7-5, over Novak Djokovic. Murray will again carry Britain's hopes on Centre Court at the All-England Club in the final on Sunday.
Serena Williams made quick work of Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, winning their semifinal, 6-1, 6-2. Maria Sharapova beat Maria Kirilenko in a semifinal battle of Russian women, setting up a final between Williams and Sharapova.
Michael Phelps is capping his remarkable Olympic career in incredible style and leading a huge American effort. Phelps won his 21st career Olympic medal and 17th gold in the 100-meter butterfly on Friday, coming from far behind in the final 50 meters to win. He came from seventh place at the turn to beat Chad Le Clos of South Africa and Evgeny Korotyshkin of Russia, who tied for silver.
Swimming got started with a bang Friday afternoon when 17-year-old Missy Franklin reeled in another gold medal for the United States team, winning the 200-meter backstroke in world record time. An even younger American swimmer, 15-year-old Katie Ledecky, grabbed a gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle.
The U.S. women's soccer team beat New Zealand, 2-0, in the quarterfinals. 
London Live will be covering all of these events (and more) throughout the day.
5:12 P.M. | Ethiopian Dibaba Pulls Away to Win 10,000 Meter Gold
The battle of distance powerhouses Ethiopia and Kenya was won by the Ethiopians in the first medal event of the track and field competitions, as Tirunesh Dibaba pulled away from her Kenyan competitors to claim gold with a time of 30:20.75.
Kenya did claim the other two spots on the podium, however, with Sally Kipyego taking silver and Vivian Cheruiyot claiming bronze.
After the bell for the final lap, Dibaba turned on her afterburners to widen what had been a lead of roughly five meters to roughly 50.
Dibaba's finish looked nearly effortless, and though her time was well off the world record of 29:31.78 she still managed to win by some distance due to her excellent race management.
- 
4:55 P.M. | Kenyans, Ethiopians Take Over Women's 10,000 Meters
After a slow start in which runners largely clumped with others from their country, a trio of Japanese women emerged to lead the pack, led by Hitomi Niiya. With the pack trailing well below world record pace nearing the halfway mark, Kenyan standout Sally Jepkosgei Kipyego took over the lead just before the 5,000 meter mark, soon overtaken by Ethiopian Werknesh Kidane.
There are still plenty of laps to go, but it would seem that the medals (unsurprisingly) will be dominated by East African runners once again.
- 
4:44 P.M. | American Medalists Out in Men's Beach Volleyball
The Beijing gold medalist pair of Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhausser were knocked out of the beach volleyball competition in London by the Italian pair of Paolo Nicolai and Daniele Lupo, losing in straight sets by the score of 21-17, 21-19.
The aging Americans (38 and 32, respectively) had won their group by going undefeated in round robin preliminary rounds, and were favored to contend for a medal, but lost in the first round of the 16-team knockout draw.
The second American pair of Jacob Gibb and Sean Rosenthal remains in contention.
-

3:45 P.M. | Murray's Triumph
3:38 P.M. | Murray Upsets Djokovic for Spot in Gold Medal Match
Andy Murray has earned himself a rematch of the Wimbledon final, beating Novak Djokovic 7-5, 7-5 to earn a spot in the Olympic gold medal match against Roger Federer.
Murray only broke Djokovic twice in the match, each time in the final game of the set. The two embraced at the net, and Murray then walked out to the center of the court to soak up the roars of the crowd.
- 
3:34 P.M. | Murray Holds For 6-5
The service games are getting more and more competitive, but Andy Murray staved off a break point to hold for 6-5 in the second set. After getting away with a fairly poor drop shot on the break point, Murray pulled off an Agnieszka Radwanska-esque squatting shot to give himself game point, which he won to the delight of the partisan crowd.
Djokovic will again have to hold to keep his gold medal hopes alive.
- 
3:24 P.M. | Djokovic Survives Early Scare, Holds For 5-5
Andy Murray was only three points from the win after getting out to an 0-15 start on return, but Djokovic steeled himself and won several long rallies to hold for 5-5. There has still only been one break in this match, coming in the final game of the first set with Djokovic serving at 5-6.
Should Murray hold, there will be an opportunity for deja vu.
- 
3:20 P.M. | Four Events, Five Medals for U.S. Team
In the four swimming finals Friday, Americans grabbed five medals, three gold, a silver and a bronze. It is quite a haul, in a year when many suspected the Americans might have a dip in their success.
- 
3:14 P.M. | Manaudou Wins 50 Freestyle
Florent Manaudou of France won the frantic finish that is the 50-meter freestyle, touching just ahead of Cullen Jones of the United States to win gold. Manaudou's time of 21.34 seconds was just ahead of Jones at 21.54. Brazil's Cesar Cielo, the defending Olympic gold medalist, was third in 21.59.
- 
3:17 P.M. | Murray Leads Djokovic 5-4 in the Second
Andy Murray is just a game from what would be a remarkable gold medal match appearance in his home Olympics.
Murray and Djokovic have remained on serve the entire second set, but Murray had to save a break point in the last game. He did so with several big serves to Djokovic's backhand, the last of which was reflected well long causing Murray to scream "come on!" as the crowd roared its approval.
- 
3:10 P.M. | Franklin's Triumph
3:07 P.M. | French Win Another Tennis Marathon
The second-seeded French pairing of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Michael Llodra outlasted Spaniards David Ferrer and Feliciano Lopez 6-3, 4-6, 18-16 to reach the gold medal match in the men's doubles competition.
Both men on the ground in joy after winning match point on a Ferrer return error, and kissed and hugged after, both then declining to shake the chair umpire's hand.
They will play the top-seeded Bryan Brothers of the United States in the final. Ferrer and Lopez will play another French team, Julien Benneteau and Richard Gasquet, in the bronze medal match.

Katie Ledecky, who is 15 years old, won the gold medal in the women's 800-meter freestyle, the youngest swimmer ever to win the event. The favorite, world record holder Rebecca Adlington of host Britain, won the bronze. Mirela Belmonte Garcia of Spain won the silver.
- 
2:00 P.M. | Emotional Ending
2:52 P.M. | Wide Margin
Phelps's victory by .23 seconds could be considered a blowout in the 100 butterfly. In Beijing, he won by .01 and in Athens, the margin was .04.
- 
2:47 P.M. | Le Clos, Korotyshkin Tie for Silver
Ties are definitely in fashion these days, with Chad Le Clos of South Africa and Evgeny Korotyshkin of Russia tying for second behind Phelps in the 100 butterfly. They had matching times of 51.44 seconds. Phelps won in 51.21. It was a very large margin considering he was in seventh place at the turn.
- 
2:43 P.M. | Phelps Wins 100 Butterfly
Coming from behind in the final 50 meters, Michael Phelps added his 21st Olympic medal and his 17th gold in his final individual event, the 100-meter butterfly. Phelps was in seventh place at the halfway mark and had to make up a bunch of ground on a touch field, including Chad Le Clos of South Africa, who touched Phelps out for gold in the 200 butterfly.
- 
2:38 P.M. | Franklin Sets World Record in Backstroke
Missy Franklin of the U.S. won a gold medal and set a world record in the women's 200-meter backstroke on Friday in London. Her time: a stunning 2:04:06. Anastasia Zueva of Russia won silver, and Elizabeth Beisel of the U.S. won the bronze.
- 
2:33 P.M. | Murray Takes First Set 7-5
Andy Murray is one set from Great Britain's first tennis medal in the modern era (since 1988) of Olympic tennis, taking the first set 7-5 over Novak Djokovic.
The first break of the match came in the final game of the set, with Murray sweeping a cross-court forehand past Djokovic to claim set point. Murray did not face a break point in the set, holding with far more ease than the uncertain-looking Djokovic.
- 
2:24 P.M. | Britain Adds Two Cycling Golds
Both men's team pursuit and women's keirin were decided today in the velodrome.
With a world record time, Britain's four-man team of Edward Clancy, Geraint Thomas, Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh won the pursuit event in 3:51:659. Australia came in second in 3:54.581 while the bronze medal race was won by the New Zealand team in 3:55.952.
Victoria Pendleton of Britain won the gold medal in women's keirin with an average speed of
65.663 miles per hour and a time of 10.965 seconds.
Guo Shuang of China clinched the silver, and Lee Wai Sze of Hong Kong won
the bronze.
Many events are being held in track cycling tomorrow, including multiple
rounds of men's sprint, men's omnium and the women's team pursuit finals.

1:43 P.M. | Murray-Djokovic Semifinal Underway
Third-seeded Andy Murray and No. 2 Novak Djokovic have just begun their men's singles semifinal, with both players holding to open the match at 1-1. After holding easily Murray had two break points on Djokovic's serve, but the Serb fended them off much to the audible deflation of the British crowd.
The winner will face Roger Federer Sunday in the gold medal match, and the loser will battle Juan Martin del Potro for the bronze.
Murray is also alive in the mixed doubles with partner Laura Robson.

The only American in the field, 22-year-old Steve Gluckstein, did not reach the final after faltering after his first skill in his second routine.
"Going into my 2nd trick I kicked out early to show my lines but landed short. I tried to correct it, but wasn't able to," Gluckstein said, according to USA Gymnastics.
Trampoline events continue Saturday with women's competition.

1:25 P.M. | China Wins, and Loses, Badminton Final
Not much drama over what anthem would be played after the badminton mixed doubles finalbetween two Chinese teams. Zhang Nan and Zhao Yunlei, the top-ranked team, won over Xu Chen and Ma Jin, 21-11, 21-17.
- 
1:23 P.M. | Williams Cruises to First Olympic Singles Final
No. 4 Serena Williams routed No. 1 Victoria Azarenka 6-1, 6-2 in just 62 minutes to reach her first career singles final at the Olympics.
Williams hit her 16th ace of the match on her fifth match point, doing it on a second serve to achieve a higher degree of difficulty.
Williams will play Maria Sharapova in the gold medal match tomorrow. Williams has not lost to Sharapova since 2004. Both will be going for the career "golden slam" in singles, having each won all four Grand Slam tournaments. Williams has previously won doubles gold with sister Venus in 2000 and 2008.
Before the singles final comes a doubles semifinal for the Williams sisters to begin in less than an hour, taking on the tough Russian pair of Nadia Petrova and Maria Kirilenko.

1:05 P.M. | Serena Continues Rout, Up 3-0 in Second Set
Serena Williams has been steamrolling top-ranked Victoria Azarenka with incredible ease, leading 6-1, 3-0 after only 40 minutes.
The current WTA No. 1 only has one career win over Williams, and that came when Williams was injured.
- 
12:59 P.M. | Tough Hair Day
12:42 P.M. | Riner Finally Wins Judo Gold
Teddy Riner of France - not the country you might have guessed based solely on his name - completed his collection of Olympic judo medals with a gold in the 100-kilogram division. 
Riner, who won bronze in Beijing, has five world championship titles. He beat Alexander Mikhaylin in the gold medal match, in which Mikhaylin tried only to avoid any Riner attacks and made no moves of his own.
- 
12:29 PM | Serena Cruising, Leads Azarenka 6-1
Serena Williams is a set from her first career singles gold medal match, racing through a comfortable 6-1 first set over Victoria Azarenka in just 27 minutes.
Williams would face Maria Sharapova in the final, a player whom she has not lost to since 2005.
Williams has extra incentive to finish this match quickly - she still has a doubles semifinal match with sister Venus coming up.

12:12 PM | Williams Opens Acefully, Breaks for 2-0
Serena Williams held to love open her women's singles semifinal, hitting three aces in the four points. If she keeps that ratio up she should have little trouble with the top-ranked Azarenka, but it might be an ambitious goal even for her.
Azarenka, as she is wont to do, is dressed in leggings and a long sleeved white shirt, feeling an entirely different climate than any other player in action today. The insulation didn't help her serving, and Williams broke to 15 to race out to a 2-0 lead.
- 
11:59 AM | Serena and Azarenka on Court
Federer-del Potro is a tough act to follow, but if anyone knows how to put on a show it's Serena Williams. After a very long wait, she has now walked onto court for her semifinal match against top seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. 
Odds are this match will be shorter.

11:47 AM | Federer Wins 19-17 in Epic Over Del Potro
Federer seemed to be in control of that first match point, but del Potro sent a backhand into Federer's body which he awkwardly jammed into the net.
But Federer converted the second on a del Potro backhand into the net, finally ending the marathon set and putting himself into his first career gold medal match.
The two men embraced at the net, with the much taller del Potro resting his head on Federer's shoulder. Del Potro teared up as he sat in his chair, tears that continued as he walked off the court.
Asked by Justin Gimelstob if the accomplishment of securing a medal for Switzerland had yet sunk in, Federer's voice cracked.
"It has," he said. "It has."
- 
11:37 AM | Federer Breaks for 18-17, Will Serve for Match (Again)
Federer dictated with his forehand to go up 0-30, then won a battle of forehands when del Potro sent one just long to extend his lead to 0-40. 
Federer went for a running forehand passing shot on the first break point, but slipped and fell to the ground after it hit the net. 
But on his second break point Federer came good, keeping the rally alive with a forehand squash shot that drew a del Potro backhand into the net.
Federer will now serve for the victory for a second time-he was meekly broken at love on his first attempt.
- 
11:33 AM | Del Potro Holds for 17-16
Another game another hold. del Potro now leads 17-16. 
Win or lose, this is the best match he's played since winning the U.S. Open in 2009. He suffered wrist and elbow injuries after that and had never quite seemed the same player, but this effort is massively impressive.
- 
11:25 AM | Del Potro Digs Out Hold, Federer Holds for 16-16
Del Potro started slowly in the 31st game of the third set, falling behind 0-30 before reeling off four straight points to hold for 16-15. 
Federer then ran off with four quick points of his own, holding for 16-16.
- 
11:29 A.M. | U.S. Defeats New Zealand, 2-0
Longo comes on at the death for Hoyle. Just long enough, in fact, for the referee to blow the final whistle. The United States progresses to Monday's semifinal, where they'll face either
Hope Powell's Team GB or Concacaf neighbor Canada. This was a solid enough display by the Americans, who were rarely troubled by New Zealand.
- 
11:19 AM | Federer Holds for 15-15
Del Potro threatened on Federer's serve as he has done sporadically, pushing Federer to 30-all and deuces as the Swiss favorite fought to hold at 14-15. But del Potro never made it all the way to match point, and Federer held to level the epic at 15-all.
- 
11:23 A.M. | Four Minutes of Stoppage Time
Amy Rodriguez gets ready to come in for Lauren Cheney. There are four minutes of stoppage time to be played. Cheney sprints off; U.S. Coach Pia Sundhage tells her to slow down.
- 
11:22 A.M. | A Goal for LeRoux
Sydney LeRoux has some serious wheels on her. She's not a bad finisher either. A long ball from a deep postiion is met by LeRoux on the left, who burns the defender and shoots the ball near-side on the between the legs of Bindon. Game over.
- 
11:14 AM | Federer Has Three Break Points But Del Potro Holds
Federer had a great look at another break in the 29th game of the set, racing out to a 0-40 lead of the set.
But del Potro saved the first with some very carefully placed forehands, the second with a quick forehand winner up the line, and the third with a whipped cross-court forehand that Federer couldn't get his racket fully around. Del Potro held two points later with yet another forehand winner.
Federer will yet again have to serve to stay alive. This match has been pretty entertaining for something that has essentially been copy-paste for the last hour.
- 
11:07 AM | Federer-del Potro 14-14
Easy holds for both have advanced the final set to 14-all.
This match is causing problems throughout the day's schedule. Not only does del Potro have a mixed doubles match later, so do both Victoria Azarenka and Serena Williams, who have been waiting for this match to end to begin their singles semifinal.
That doesn't seem to bother USA basketball star Kobe Bryant, who has been cheering enthusiastically from the stands.

11:10 A.M. | Soccer, 80th Minute
Carli Lloyd gets a yellow card for a challenge on Hassett, 45 yards out. The free kick is completely wasted - lots of jostling at the edge of the area, but the ball sails toward Solo for an easy grab. Alex Morgan goes off, replaced by Sydney LeRoux.
- 
11:05 AM | Federer Returns, Levels Third at 13-13
Picking up where he left off, Federer easily held to 15 to level the third set once again at 13-all. 
The longest fifth set Federer ever played came against Andy Roddick on this same court in the 2009 Wimbledon final, eventually beating the American 16-14.

11:06 A.M. | Soccer, 76th Minute
New Zealand finally gets a shot on target. Percival hits a powerful shot straight at Solo. UCLA's Rose White replaces Wilkinson.
- 
11:02 AM | Federer Off Court
Federer has taken a bathroom break down 12-13 in the third set. The match has been going for over three and a half hours, so it seems merited if uncharacteristically human.

11:05 A.M. | Soccer, 70th Minute
Heather O'Reilly replaces Megan Rapinoe, who looks as if she's run out of gas. The New Zealand players are looking busier down the left flank. But wait ... Morgan is sent clean through and she's bundled over at the edge of the arc by goalkeeper Bindon, who gets royally clobbered in the head with Morgan's knee as the attacker follows through. The referee gives a drop ball to restart play.
- 
10:57 AM | Del Potro Holds for 13-12
Another game, another hold. This time it was del Potro's turn to hold easily, and so he did to put himself up once again at 13-12. 
Federer seems to be experimenting more with some strange returns, either out of frustration, boredom, or just delirium. This has been an absurdly long set, in his defense.

10:55 AM | Federer Serves His Way to 12-12.
Del Potro got his best look at the Federer serve in some time with the Swiss No. 1 serving at 11-12, capitalizing on early errors to take a 0-30 lead. 
But Federer's serve bailed him out completely. He hit an ace past del Potro's forehand on the first point, a service winner up the "T" on the second, a big serve that drew a short reply on the third, and another unreturnable serve out wide on the fourth.
12-all now, a dozen games each.

10:53 AM | Sharapova Advances Past Kirilenko Into Final
No. 3 Maria Sharapova has secured herself a very nice medal on her first trip to the Olympics, advancing to the gold medal match with a 6-2, 6-3 win over countrywoman Maria Kirilenko. 
Sharapova has a chance to complete an elusive career "golden slam" in the final, having already won the "career slam."
- 
10:55 A.M. | Soccer, 62nd Minute
Comedy defending by New Zealand here. Heath makes a great run down the right flank and her low ball is intended for Morgan. Bindon beats her to the ball, but she fumbles it. The ball falls invitingly for Wambach, whose shot hits Morgan (she's now offside) and rolls just wide of the goal.
- 
10:49 AM | Del Potro Leads 12-11
Another game, another easy hold as del Potro holds to 15 to extend his lead to 12-11. Federer will once again try to hold to level the set.
- 
10:47 AM | Federer Holds for 11-11
Business as usual for Federer on serve once again, holding at love with an effortless dropshot winner to push the scoreline along to 11-11.
It's almost as if that major hiccup never happened now. 
This third set alone has now lasted more than 100 minutes.

Wambach wins a free kick wide on the left. Rapinoe sends in a powerful ball that the New Zealand defense completely fails to clear. Morgan pokes the loose ball at Bindon. Meanwhile, Moorwood has come on for Yallop - the first New Zealand substitution.
10:44 AM | Del Potro Holds for 11-10
Del Potro held to 15 for an 11-10 lead in the third, putting the pressure on Federer to serve to stay in the match. That had never previously posed any major problem, but it will be interesting to see how Federer rebounds from that major collapse in his previous service game.
- 
10:39 AM | Federer Can't Close Out Win; 10-All
Reciprocal choking is now the name of the game.
After finally breaking for a 10-9 lead to give himself a chance to serve for a medal, Federer turned in a tight, sloppy service game for the first time in hours, not winning a single point as del Potro broke at love. The completeness of the collapse was especially striking given the ease with which Federer has been holding throughout the third set.
Del Potro will now serve at 10-all.
- 
10:41 A.M. | Soccer, Second Half
The second half kicks off at St. James' Park, with a trio of rampaging runs by Alex Morgan, who looks very lively here.
- 
10:30 AM | Federer Breaks on Del Potro Shank
A disastrous game for del Potro. Two double faults, a bad backhand error and a horrific forehand shank on break point gave Federer his first break of the match. 
Federer will now serve for a medal (silver at worst) with a 10-9 lead in the third.

10:26 AM | Del Potro Dives to Hold for 9-8
Federer got off to his best advantage in some time, racing out to an 0-30 lead with a crisp backhand passing shot down the line.
Del Potro then dove for a spectacular backhand volley winner to pull within 15-30, and after some wincing and hip grabbing he jogged back to the baseline, and promptly won three more points to dig out an ultimately convincing hold for 9-8.
Federer will yet again try to hold to keep his gold medal chances alive.
- 
10:22 AM | Federer Quickly Holds for 8-8
Roger Federer has been getting the better looks of the two on return, even if he's not converting them. Federer again held easily to level the set at 8-8.
- 
10:14 AM | del Potro Saves Another Break Point, Holds for 8-7
Federer made headway into del Potro's serve with the third set knotted at 7-7, gaining a 15-30 lead. But at that score del Potro forehand clipped the tape and landed in, leaving Federer screaming in anguished frustration. 
Down break point at 30-40 del Potro again clipped the tape, but this time Federer was in position to reach the ball in plenty of time. However he sent his backhand reply into the net, squandering the opportunity.
del Potro held two points later, and now Federer again must hold to stay in the match.
- 
10:21 A.M. | Soccer, Haltime
The teams troop off the field after two minutes of stoppage time. This has been a solid opening 45 minutes from the United States players, who have yet to fully capitalize on some wobbly central defensive work by New Zealand. Another goal or two should come as the game wears on.
- 
10:17 A.M. | Soccer, 40th Minute
Abby Wambach picks up a retroactive yellow card for a pretty crude chop on Hoyle in the center circle. This has been a pretty impressive half for the Americans. The midfield is working incredibly hard, denying the New Zealanders time and space to piece moves together. And the defense, a speculative 45-yarder aside, has been fairly solid, too.
- 
10:11 AM | Federer Holds for 7-7
With so few breaks in this match, even a 0-15 lead for the returner becomes noteworthy. That was the case for del Potro on Federer's serve, but the Swiss survived the scare to level proceedings at 7-7.
- 
10:06 AM | Del Potro Leads Federer 7-6
Another easy hold for the Argentine and Roger Federer is again down, now 6-7, but still on serve. 
A second round match between Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Milos Raonic didn't end until 25-23 in the third set, so we could be here a while.
- 
10:04 AM | Federer, Del Potro Tied
With a cheeky drop shot off his backhand wing, Federer holds at love to level the second set at 6-6.
Federer, the top seed in singles, was the defending champion from 2008 in men's doubles with partner Stan Wawrinka, but lost in the second round.

Juan Martin del Potro faced another break point at 4-4 but saved it with an overhead smash (despite a screaming fan trying to distract him mid-swing).

09:36 AM | Del Potro Battles to Hold for 4-3 Lead
It was feast or famine for Juan Martin del Potro and his forehand in the crucial seventh game of the third set. He used it to save break points with bold winners, but also sent it into the net to allow Federer more break point opportunities.
Federer is now 0-5 on break points in the match. There is no final set tiebreak, so he will have to break the Argentine's serve eventually if he's going to win this match.

The U.S. women's team is in the northeastern city of Newcastle Upon Tyne this afternoon, taking on New Zealand in the Olympic soccer quarterfinals (kickoff: 9:30 a.m Eastern).
The Americans are heavily favored to progress to the semifnals, but will need to find a way to unpick a stubborn New Zealand defense (for whom veteran keeper Jenny Bindon has been a standout) that ended up on the wrong end of 1-0 losses to England and Brazil in the group stages. The Kiwis are here on the strength of a 3-1 win over Cameroon in their final group game that enabled them to qualify as one of the best third-place finishers.
Here's a look at today's starting lineups:
United States: Solo, Rampone, O'Hara, Leipelbet, Buehler, Lloyd, Rapinoe, Heath (replacing O'Reilly), Cheney, Morgan, Wambach.
New Zealand:  Bindon, Percival, Hoyle, Erceg, Smith, Riley, Hearn,Gregorius, Yallop, Hassett, Wilkinson.
Referee: Jesica di Iorio (Argentina).
In earlier action, France defeated Sweden, 2-1, all the goals coming from corners.

09:30 AM | Federer Battling Del Potro in Third Set of Semifinal
Roger Federer has found himself in a dogfight in the men's singles semifinal, dropping the first set to 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro and needing a tiebreak in the second set to force the best-of-three match into a third set. 
The final frame is currently on serve, tied 3-3 with del Potro about to serve.
Federer might not have expected this much of a challenge from del Potro. Grass has been Federer's best surface and del Potro's worst, and Federer has a 12-2 record against the lanky Argentine (5-0 this year)
There is even more pressure on Federer than usual because Switzerland has failed to earn a single medal thus far in London.

8:53 A.M. | A Tough Moment for Qatar
LONDON - Lost amid the cheers of a full stadium was a bittersweet moment for Qatar.
The nation is among those sending female athletes as part of its Olympic delegation for the first time. The nation, along with Brunei and Saudi Arabia, has long avoided sending women as part of their delegation, but under pressure from international organizations and human rights groups, said they have changed course on developing women athletes in their countries.
With clouds hanging overhead, Qatar's Noor Hussain Al-Malki took her place in the starting blocks of the third heat of the women's 100 meters. 
Wearing maroon running clothes and a white long-sleeved undershirt, she started off, but shortly after the gun went off, she fell with what appeared to be a hamstring injury. As the rest of the runners sped off toward the finish line, she sat on the track, tears in her eyes. She did not complete the race.
Soon thereafter, Al-Malki made her way to the medical tent.
Al-Malki and the Qatar Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It's fascinating to watch Federer being overpowered, at times, by del Potro. 
Federer is trying to take pace away from del Potro, by changing speeds and angles. Del Potro, who stands 6-foot-6, is a tough customer to get stuff by. He has long arms, and seems to be moving quickly enough to get to some of Federer's better stuff.

8:12 A.M. | Belarus Wins First London Gold
Sergei Martynov won the first gold medal for Belarus in the London Olympics, setting a world record in the 50 meter Rifle (Prone Position).
Martynov scored 600 in qualifying and 105.5 in the final round for a total of 705.5. His dominant score was a full 4.3 points ahead of second place-less than that separated second from eighth (and last) place in the final.
Martynov has dominated the discipline recently, which is perhaps the only competition that allows a gold medal to be won while lying down on one's stomach. Perhaps not surprisingly given that fact, the podium is likely to be the oldest one of the Olympics. Martynov, 44, is joined by 31-year old silver medalist Lionel Cox of Belgium and 49-year old bronze medalist Raymond Debevec of Slovenia.

HEADLINE: In July Jobs Report, Something for Everyone

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Democrats moved quickly on Friday to highlight evidence of surprisingly strong jobs growth in July even as Republicans seized on a small uptick in the overall unemployment rate as a further indictment of President Obama's policies. 

 BODY:
The two-part nature of the monthly jobs report often provides political parties an opportunity to cherry-pick their favorite parts - and the release on Friday of the July numbers was no exception.
Democrats moved quickly to promote the surprisingly strong jobs growth for the month, while Republicans seized on a small uptick in the overall unemployment rate as a further indictment of President Obama's economic policies.
Austan Goolsbee, a former chairman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, summed up the Democratic response shortly after the report was released, calling the addition of 163,000 jobs in July "a solid, encouraging number."
And, in a statement, the White House stressed that "it is important not to read too much into any one monthly report," but concluded that Friday's report "provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression."
The statement, from Alan B. Krueger, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, went out of its way to note that the unemployment rate was "essentially unchanged, rising from "from 8.217% in June to 8.254% in July."
Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the House minority leader, wrote on Twitter that "today's jobs report is small step in the right direction. But more needs to be done."
Meanwhile, Republicans focused instead on the 8.3 percent unemployment rate, up from 8.2 percent the previous month. 
"Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a hammer blow to struggling middle-class families," Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential hopeful, said in a statement. "My plan will turn things around and bring the economy roaring back, with 12 million new jobs created by the end of my first term. President Obama doesn't have a plan and believes that the private sector is 'doing fine.'"
The Drudge Report, a conservative Web site, captured the Republican sentiment: It showed a grim-faced Mr. Obama with "8.3%" in big, bold letters underneath the picture. In tiny type to the left, it added: "JULY JOBS: +163,000."
A few minutes later, even that concession to good news was removed, replaced with: "41 straight months above 8%..."
Other top Republicans followed with the same message.
"Last week President Obama said, 'We tried our plan, and it worked.' With the unemployment rate going up again, it's obvious that plan didn't work at all," Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement.
House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio welcomed "any new job creation" in a statement. But he zeroed in on "unemployment still above 8 percent and rising" to condemn Mr. Obama's economic policies.
These attack targets were reversed in previous months, when the unemployment rate ticked lower even as job growth was sluggish. In April for example, when the unemployment report fell to 8.2 percent from 8.3 percent, Republicans focused on the slower job growth numbers, while Democrats touted the falling rate.
Left unclear is which argument will move voters, many of whom may be more affected by their own personal situations than any of the statistics describing the country's overall economic health.
The addition of 163,000 jobs gives the White House the ability to argue that the economy continues to grow - albeit more slowly than it would like - and allows the administration to make the case that job growth is headed in the right direction.
But the unemployment rate is headed in the wrong direction, an argument that Republicans hope will provide an easy benchmark against which voters can judge the president.

HEADLINE: Top Regulatory Adviser to Depart White House

BYLINE: PETER BAKER and JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: Cass Sunstein, President Obama's often provocative regulatory czar, is leaving the White House after more than three years and returning to Harvard Law School. 

 BODY:
Cass Sunstein, President Obama's often provocative regulatory czar, is leaving the White House after more than three years and returning to Harvard Law School.
Mr. Sunstein, a controversial figure in the perennial battles between left and right over the role of government in American society, led an administration review intended to get rid of antiquated or counterproductive rules as part of a cost-benefit analysis.
Mr. Obama credited Mr. Sunstein with putting in place a regulatory system that still protected Americans while eliminating "tens of millions of hours of paperwork burdens" for businesses and citizens.
"Cass has shown that it is possible to support economic growth without sacrificing health, safety and the environment," the president said in a written statement issued Friday.
During his tenure, Mr. Sunstein often argued that the old paradigm over regulation was stale and irrelevant. "My view is that the Republican claim that 'job-killing regulation' is a redundancy is as ridiculous as the left-wing view that 'job-killing regulation' is an oxymoron," he told The New York Times last year. "Both are silly political claims that have no place in a serious discussion." 
Mr. Sunstein, a prolific author who met Mr. Obama at the University of Chicago, is a proponent of both cost-benefit analysis and behavioral economics, which seeks to find low-cost incentives for individuals and businesses to act both in their own interests and those of the broader economy. When Mr. Obama won the presidency, he offered Mr. Sunstein a range of possible jobs but Mr. Sunstein chose the little known Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs because he thought it would be the best place to test his academic theories.
At the time, Republicans saw what they considered a liberal Harvard professor and Obama pal and were deeply skeptical. But his actions in office were often met with hostility by environmental activists, who argued that he placed too much emphasis on the cost of environmental regulations rather than their health benefits. Mr. Sunstein also took a skeptical view of some workplace safety rules as the administration tried to deflect criticism from business leaders and Republican officials who accused them of putting undue burdens and costs on employers.
Mr. Sunstein's wife, Samantha Power, also works at the White House as a senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights, a position she used to advocate for better responses to genocide around the world. Ms. Power recently had a baby and said Friday that she still plans to return to the White House after maternity leave.

HEADLINE: In July Jobs Report, Something for Everyone

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Democrats moved quickly on Friday to highlight evidence of surprisingly strong jobs growth in July even as Republicans seized on a small uptick in the overall unemployment rate as a further indictment of President Obama's policies. 

 BODY:
The two-part nature of the monthly jobs report often provides political parties an opportunity to cherry-pick their favorite parts - and the release on Friday of the July numbers was no exception.
Democrats moved quickly to promote the surprisingly strong jobs growth for the month, while Republicans seized on a small uptick in the overall unemployment rate as a further indictment of President Obama's economic policies.
Austan Goolsbee, a former chairman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, summed up the Democratic response shortly after the report was released, calling the addition of 163,000 jobs in July "a solid, encouraging number."
And, in a statement, the White House stressed that "it is important not to read too much into any one monthly report," but concluded that Friday's report "provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression."
The statement, from Alan B. Krueger, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, went out of its way to note that the unemployment rate was "essentially unchanged, rising from "from 8.217% in June to 8.254% in July."
Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the House minority leader, wrote on Twitter that "today's jobs report is small step in the right direction. But more needs to be done."
Meanwhile, Republicans focused instead on the 8.3 percent unemployment rate, up from 8.2 percent the previous month. 
"Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a hammer blow to struggling middle-class families," Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential hopeful, said in a statement. "My plan will turn things around and bring the economy roaring back, with 12 million new jobs created by the end of my first term. President Obama doesn't have a plan and believes that the private sector is 'doing fine.'"
The Drudge Report, a conservative Web site, captured the Republican sentiment: It showed a grim-faced Mr. Obama with "8.3%" in big, bold letters underneath the picture. In tiny type to the left, it added: "JULY JOBS: +163,000."
A few minutes later, even that concession to good news was removed, replaced with: "41 straight months above 8%..."
Other top Republicans followed with the same message.
"Last week President Obama said, 'We tried our plan, and it worked.' With the unemployment rate going up again, it's obvious that plan didn't work at all," Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement.
House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio welcomed "any new job creation" in a statement. But he zeroed in on "unemployment still above 8 percent and rising" to condemn Mr. Obama's economic policies.
These attack targets were reversed in previous months, when the unemployment rate ticked lower even as job growth was sluggish. In April for example, when the unemployment report fell to 8.2 percent from 8.3 percent, Republicans focused on the slower job growth numbers, while Democrats touted the falling rate.
Left unclear is which argument will move voters, many of whom may be more affected by their own personal situations than any of the statistics describing the country's overall economic health.
The addition of 163,000 jobs gives the White House the ability to argue that the economy continues to grow - albeit more slowly than it would like - and allows the administration to make the case that job growth is headed in the right direction.
But the unemployment rate is headed in the wrong direction, an argument that Republicans hope will provide an easy benchmark against which voters can judge the president.

Jeffrey Zients, the director of the Office of Management and Budget who oversaw the regulatory office, said Mr. Sunstein was responsible for streamlining that will save $10 billion over five years and helped design new rules to reduce distracted driving, increase fuel economy of cars, reduce air pollution, make food supplies safer and combat discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or disability.
"We are grateful to Cass for his years of public service and for his leadership and dedication in assisting the president in overseeing the nation's regulatory program," Mr. Zients wrote on the White House Web site.
Mr. Zients tapped Boris Bershteyn, the budget office's general counsel, to step in as acting administrator of the regulatory office.
In returning to Harvard Law School, Mr. Sunstein will direct the new Program on Behavioral Economics and Public Policy. 
Mr. Sunstein's wife, Samantha Power, also works at the White House as a senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights, a position she used to advocate for better responses to genocide around the world. Ms. Power recently had a baby and said Friday that she still plans to return to the White House after maternity leave.

HEADLINE: July Jobs Report Likely to Preserve Status Quo

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The jobs report released on Friday ought to mostly reinforce pre-existing impressions about the economy: that the recovery is slow, but that the nation is probably not on the verge of a double-dip recession. 

 BODY:
The government reported that 163,000 payroll jobs were created in July. But the unemployment rate -- which is calculated through a separate survey -- ticked up to 8.3 percent from 8.2 percent.
The payrolls number taken alone is a decent one; it beat the market's expectations of about 100,000 jobs being created.
But it is important to take the number in context. Forecasts of the payrolls numbers are quite inaccurate; they miss, on average, by 68,000 jobs in one direction or another. In this case, the miss was to the upside -- and better for job-seekers than the other way around.
Still, it is hard to calculate the number of jobs in the economy at any given time, let alone to forecast it accurately. That is why, as Jonathan Bernstein advised on Thursday, and as I suggested on TimesCast, we ought to have a fairly high threshold for what qualifies as a newsworthy jobs report.
Mr. Bernstein argued that any payrolls number between 50,000 and 150,000 jobs was not likely to have much effect politically. The actual gain of 163,000 jobs sits right on the brink of that.
So it is worth looking toward tiebreakers. For instance, were there substantial revisions to the previous numbers? In this case, they were a wash; the May jobs number was revised up, but the June figure was revised down.
And you can certainly look at the unemployment rate. The survey from which those numbers are calculated is subject to more statistical noise than the payrolls numbers, but that does not mean that it is meaningless. In this case, the unemployment numbers were poor.
So I think this report ought to mostly reinforce pre-existing impressions about the economy: that the recovery is slow, but that the nation is probably not on the verge of a double-dip recession.
Politically, the status quo appears to favor President Obama. If the election were held today, he would have a 77 percent chance of winning the Electoral College, according to our forecast model's "now-cast," although the victory would almost certainly be by a slim margin -- possibly even a victory in the Electoral College that is not reflected in the national popular vote.
By November, Mr. Obama is less certain to win, since there is more uncertainty about the economy, and other factors come into play. Our model figures that there is about a 70 percent chance that he does so.
The July jobs numbers might reduce that uncertainty slightly. Whatever impressions Americans had about the economy are likely to be reinforced by the report; Democrats will cite the relatively favorable payrolls numbers, and Republicans will trumpet the increase in the unemployment rate. There are just three more jobs reports between now and the election.
The number is favorable for Mr. Obama in the sense that no news qualifies as good news for him if he is ahead right now. But the report is not a game-changer, economically or politically.

HEADLINE: A Split-Screen Debate Over Jobs and Taxes

BYLINE: PETER BAKER and RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: In speeches delivered simultaneously thousands of miles apart, the candidates quarreled over the import of the latest jobs report and who would do a better job of keeping down taxes. 

 BODY:
President Obama and his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, engaged in a split-screen debate over jobs and taxes on Friday as they presented starkly different views of the state of the economy and starkly different visions for the way forward.
In separate speeches that by happenstance were delivered simultaneously thousands of miles apart, the two presidential contenders effectively quarreled over the significance of the latest jobs report and who would do a better job of keeping down taxes so that the economy can grow more robustly than it has over the last three years.
Mr. Obama appeared with families invited to the White House complex to pressure Congress to extend tax cuts for the middle class while letting taxes rise for the wealthy. Mr. Romney visited a trucking business in Las Vegas to make the point that the president does not understand how the private sector works. Both were responding to a report with mixed news showing 163,000 new jobs created last month, more than expected, but the unemployment rate ticking up to 8.3 percent. 
"I knew when I started in this job that this was going to take some time," Mr. Obama said in his speech. "We haven't had to come back from an economic crisis this deep or this painful since the 1930s, but we also knew if we were persistent, if we kept at it, if we kept working, we would gradually get to where we need to be."
To get there, though, the president said, Congress should renew the Bush-era tax cuts but not on income above $250,000 a year. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, passed a tax extension as Mr. Obama wanted but the House, run by Republicans, voted to extend all of the Bush-era tax cuts, including for the wealthy.
"They want to give millionaires and billionaires and folks like me tax cuts that we don't need and that the country can't afford even if middle class families have to pick up the tab for it," Mr. Obama said. "Those are their priorities. And this week we learned that there are some in the Republican Party who don't want to stop even there."
He then raised, as he has for the last couple days, anew study suggesting that Mr. Romney's tax-cutting plan would actually result in tax increases for 95 percent of Americans if it were to be "revenue neutral," as he has said. The Romney campaign has disputed the study, noting that one of its authors used to work for Mr. Obama and that its conclusions were based on assumptions that the former governor of Massachusetts does not share.
Speaking at the same time on the other side of the country, Mr. Romney on Friday slammed Mr. Obama, saying he was presiding over an economy that is failing to recover from a devastating recession.
"The president does not understand how the economy works," he said. "He does not understand how the private sector works."
The new unemployment report, Mr. Romney said, was "another hammer-blow to the struggling middle-class families of America." And then he sought to contrast his experience as a leveraged-buyout executive with Mr. Obama's experience in academia.
To laughter from a crowd of several hundred supporters, Mr. Romney said his recipe for renewing the economy "is not based on spending years in academics, coming up with theories."
"I know how to do that," he said, describing what he said would be his ability to foster job creation. "This is not a mystery to me. This is not theory -- this is practice."

HEADLINE: New York Fed Faces New Scrutiny on Rate-Rigging Scandal

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: In a letter to the New York Fed and the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, Senator Sherrod Brown challenged the regulators to defend their response to the rate-rigging scandal. 

 BODY:
The Congressional scrutiny of the Federal Reserve intensified this week, as the regulator faced new questions about failing to prevent banks from manipulating interest rates.
In a letter to the New York Fed and the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, Senator Sherrod Brown challenged the regulators to defend their response to the rate-rigging scandal. Mr. Brown has questioned why the New York Fed, despite knowing that some banks were reporting false rates, pushed for broad reforms of the rate-setting process rather than penalizing the illegal behavior. 
For their part, Fed officials have argued that they lacked the power to pursue the issue further. Mr. Brown, an outspoken critic of lax regulation, was unconvinced. 
"It is difficult to accept the argument that the board has no authority to address this problem," he wrote. Mr. Brown also outlined a series of questions for the regulators, asking them detail what attempts, if any, they made to thwart the wrongdoing. 
An Ohio Democrat who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Brown is the latest lawmaker to scrutinize the New York Fed's role in the rate-setting conspiracy. But unlike most of the past lawmakers who have voiced concerns in recent weeks, Mr. Brown is a Democrat. 
Republicans seized on the issue in recent hearings with Timothy Geithner, the current Treasury secretary who ran the New York Fed at the time of the rate-rigging. Mr. Geithner was grilled on the scandal, which received focus in June when authorities in the United States and London snared a $450 million settlement from Barclays.
The British bank was accused of trying to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a key benchmark that affects the cost of trillions of dollars in loans. The case against the British bank was the first action to stem from a global investigation into more than a dozen banks. 
Following the Barclays case, House Republicans demanded that the New York Fed detail its knowledge of the wrongdoing at Barclays. 
In releasing e-mails and transcripts of phone calls, the regional Fed bank revealed that it learned in April 2008 that Barclays was artificially depressing its Libor rates to deflect concerns about its health. "We know that we're not posting um, an honest" rate, a Barclays employee told a New York Fed official at the time. 
In response, Mr. Geithner pushed changes to the Libor process. He did not, however, refer the illegal actions to the Justice Department. 
The various revelations, Mr. Brown said in the letter, raise "troubling questions regarding regulators' willingness to supervise and regulate the world's largest banks."
The Fed did not respond to a request for comment. 
"The board clearly has policies requiring banks to have effective controls, yet, in spite of these policies, it appears that Barclays escaped any meaningful supervision over its U.S. activities," Mr. Brown wrote.

The British bank was accused of trying to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a key benchmark that affects the cost of trillions of dollars in loans. The case against the British bank was the first action to stem from a global investigation into more than a dozen banks. 
Following the Barclays case, House Republicans demanded that the New York Fed detail its knowledge of the wrongdoing at Barclays. 
In releasing e-mails and transcripts of phone calls, the regional Fed bank revealed that it learned in April 2008 that Barclays was artificially depressing its Libor rates to deflect concerns about its health. "We know that we're not posting um, an honest" rate, a Barclays employee told a New York Fed official at the time. 
In response, Mr. Geithner pushed changes to the Libor process. He did not, however, refer the illegal actions to the Justice Department. 
The various revelations, Mr. Brown said in the letter, raise "troubling questions regarding regulators' willingness to supervise and regulate the world's largest banks."
The Fed did not respond to a request for comment. 
"The board clearly has policies requiring banks to have effective controls, yet, in spite of these policies, it appears that Barclays escaped any meaningful supervision over its U.S. activities," Mr. Brown wrote.

BYLINE: BILL KELLER


HIGHLIGHT: James K. Galbraith and Jim Kessler continue the debate around Social Security. 

 BODY:
My proposal that the baby boomer generation take on the cause of rescuing entitlements from their unsustainable course - setting aside a share of the savings to invest in infrastructure, education and basic research - continues to draw a lot of mail, pro and con, as I noted in my last post. Today I'm kicking up my feet and cranking up the Beach Boys while two more authoritative advocates go at it. 
James K. Galbraith is a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, and a prolific critic of American capitalism and foreign interventions. He articulates the view of many readers that Social Security and Medicare are secure. In particular, he attacks the findings of Third Way, a think tank of centrist Democrats, whose work on this subject I have cited as enlightening and alarming.
I invited Jim Kessler, the senior vice president for policy at Third Way, to defend the group's work. He's a co-founder of the group, and a former legislative director for Senator Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. 
Not that it matters, but both Galbraith and Kessler are baby boomers.
Readers will not be surprised that I continue to find Kessler's arguments more persuasive. But I welcome a chance to keep the conversation going. It doesn't seem to be taking place where it SHOULD be taking place: in Washington and on the campaign trail.

Dear Mr. Keller:
I am writing this at the request of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, which directed my attention to your recent Op-Ed on "entitlements." As a former Executive Director of the Joint Economic Committee, and as an economist with experience studying budget and military matters, your column immediately engaged my interest.
The nub of your essay on why Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid must be cut is a graph - taken from a report by a group called Third Way - that compares federal "investments" with "entitlements," showing that one is in decline and the other is on the rise.
But note, as you acknowledge, that the federal budget counts as "investments." Back in the 1960s, that was mainly what federal investment was. We were building nuclear bombers, submarines, missiles and warheads; today we are downsizing that arsenal, happily unused. Do you really think that those "investments" had anything much to do with economic growth? If so, you are misinformed.
Even today, military procurement is around 40 percent of total federal "investment" - $221 billion out of about $540 billion in 2011, according to the in the Budget. Whatever you think of the F-35 and F-22, it's silly to add that number to (say) federal aid to education. The sum is not a gauge of anything.
On the budget, you go on to assert that "the arithmetic simply doesn't work." If you mean that the federal fiscal position is unsustainable - a widely-held view - you are again misinformed. How do we know? Partly, because the markets clearly have full confidence in the US fiscal position - as evidenced by the record low long-term interest rates at which people with money are willing to lend to the US Government. And if you don't trust the markets, you can also look at the numbers, as I do here: http://tinyurl.com/6edmaxp Either way, the conclusion is the same. Contrary to repeated scare- mongering, the United States public debt position is not unsustainable.
In reality, an older population results partly from the success of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid over the years. Since the early 1970s these programs have protected elderly Americans from destitution. So protected, they live longer. And as the old become more numerous, the payout of the programs that support them must rise. There is nothing wrong with this, and nothing unsustainable. The right measure is the share of total spending on this population in total GDP; for Social Security (OASDI), which was under 4.5 percentage points in 2009 and projected to rise to 6.5 percent ** Plainly we can afford that. Your proposal for a higher retirement age deserves a word. Today, a very large share of Social Security recipients take the early retirement option, beginning at 62. Raising the "retirement age" is just a benefit cut for these, most vulnerable, lowest-paid workers - especially those who take the option because they are already unemployed. It's the cruelest and most dishonestly-presented of all so-called Social Security "reforms." I would strongly urge you to repudiate it.
We agree that health care costs should be controlled. But to attack Medicare specifically is to target the elderly for cuts, simply because they happen to have a public insurance program. Again, there is no reason for this. Your actual proposals would (mostly) apply to Medicare and non-Medicare funded care alike, which is better. But since they apply to private as well as public insurance programs, they obviously aren't a case for "entitlement reform".
These are simple points, whose validity I believe anyone can judge. The FERI will publish a blog post closely related to this letter on its site, at http://tinyurl.com/c4zowz5 . I invite you to respond there, and to make appropriate corrections in a future column.
Yours sincerely, (s/)
James K. Galbraith 
** For a detailed discussion of the question of "burden" see my testimony to the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, February 25, 2009, co-authored with Warren Mosler and Randall Wray, available on request: Galbraith@mail.utexas.edu
The response:
Mr. Galbraith has made important contributions to the discourse about the economy, but we simply don't share his optimistic view about the financial health of Social Security and Medicare. In his testimony before the Bowles-Simpson commission, he called solvency arguments "complete nonsense" (http://bit.ly/aw0nFX). His criticism of Third Way's paper (http://bit.ly/MXhAxA) is a continuation of his belief that these programs are doing fine and that in general, "there is no economic justification for deficit reduction." We disagree and appreciate the opportunity to respond to Mr. Galbraith's letter.
Mr. Galbraith's first critique is that we included military investment in our overall measure of America's federal investment spending. But we simply defined investments as the United States Government does. Had we chosen our own definition, it would have been criticized, fairly or unfairly, for being biased. 
Moreover, does Mr. Galbraith really believe there is no economic value at all to any military investment spending? Here are just a few discoveries out of defense the internet, Google earth, GPS, prosthetics, medical technology to treat wounds and administer trauma care, much of aerospace, high end computing (originally used for code breaking), satellite phones, SONAR, the device used to disarm the explosives in the killer's apartment in Aurora, graphite bicycles, tennis rackets and golf clubs, digital watches, and so forth. Sure not all military investment spending benefits the economy, but neither does some domestic investment spending. 
But let's take Mr. Galbraith's assumption at face value. By any measure, investment spending has cratered. If military investment spending is eliminated from the calculation and only domestic spending is included (as Mr. Galbraith suggests), the peak year is 1966, followed by 1965, followed by 1967. Between 1963 and 1981, non-defense investment spending represented between 10.6 and 14.5 percent of all federal spending. After 1981 it never reached 10% again. That's 31 consecutive years of domestic investment spending below 10% of federal outlays, following 19 consecutive years of plus-10%. That's not good.
Mr. Galbraith next argues that deficits don't matter and as proof he points to Treasury rates: "The markets have full confidence in the U.S. fiscal position - as evidenced by the record low long-term interest rates" for U.S. Treasuries. We cannot imagine a more dangerous way to judge our fiscal health. Look, we hate comparisons between the U.S. and Europe because they are overly simple, but .here it is anyway. Spain's and Germany's interest rates were essentially the same in 2008, only one-point apart in 2009 and 2010, and then they shot to three-points apart in 2011, growing to as much as 6 in 2012. Was everything fine in Spain in one year and off the rails the next? Of course not. The capital markets, in that case, had yet to recognize that Spain was in trouble. When they did the ballgame was over. 
Our interest rates are low because 1) our economy is stuck right now, and 2) we are the calmest port in very stormy seas. Do we really want an economic strategy based on the belief that no other country or region (Europe or China) will ever get their act together? In 1992, America fielded the Dream Team and won the gold through lopsided victories. By 2008, through complacency, we won the bronze. Don't bet on other countries not filling the vacuum.
The heart of Mr. Galbraith's argument revolves around his view that entitlement spending is on a healthy trajectory. We believe this is wrong:
 On Medicare: Neither the column by Mr. Keller nor the Third Way paper attack Medicare or Medicaid (as Mr. Galbraith writes), but rather they both state the obvious - the rising cost of these programs is outstripping the ability to pay for them. By any measure, Medicare and Medicaid spending is growing too quickly. From 1975 to 2010, per person Medicare spending grew at roughly GDP plus 2 percent. That is far, far faster than inflation. Over a short period of time that's sustainable. Over a long period of time it's strangulation. Couple that with the fact that our Medicare population essentially doubles over the next several decades this is a financial crisis for the U.S. government. As we have said many times, the best way to reduce Medicare spending is not to slash benefits but to reward quality not quantity. For example, twenty-seven percent of all Medicare spending is on the last year of a person's life. While some of that is necessary, a great deal is spent on procedures that don't meaningfully extend people's lives and many actually reduce the quality of their final weeks. This is just one reform idea to make the program perform better and cost less; it's hardly an attack on the overall program. 
 On Social Security I: There is a net-present-value shortfall of $8.6 trillion over the next 75 years, according to the Social Security actuaries. Let's not pretend that this is chump change. The actuaries estimate that if Congress acts right away, they could close this shortfall by hiking payroll taxes by 21%, cutting benefits by 16%, or some combination of both immediately. Again, let's not pretend this isn't a ton of money. The payroll tax hike is close to $200 billion per year. In addition, every year Congress waits they have to reach that $8.6 trillion over a shorter time horizon. That means bigger tax increases or bigger benefit cuts. The only question, then, is when Congress fixes the problem and how much of the fix tilts toward benefit cuts versus revenue increases. Mr. Galbraith disagrees, but many believe it should be a balance between new revenue and cuts, and we should spread the solution over all 75 years, not a shorter time horizon. Many believe that people earning very high incomes should receive fewer benefits in retirement. Many believe that just as we gradually raised the retirement age in 1986 so that retirement ultimately reaches 67 by the next decade, we need to gently increase it again for those who are young today so that the amount of time that a typical person spends collecting Social Security stays constant - about 18 years. And many people think we should find solutions now so the next generation doesn't have to do it alone.
 On Social Security II: Mr. Galbraith is correct that over the next 75 years, SS's projected rise as a share of GDP goes from "under 4.5 percentage points in 2009" to "6.5 percent over the next 75 years." He says "plainly we can afford that." Let's be clear that this measly little two-point bump is actually a 45% rise in the cost of Social Security relative to the size of our economy. To translate further, this is a 45% rise relative to the size and ability of working age people's capacity to produce and pay for it. To translate further, 2 percent of GDP in today's economy totals $300 billion. These are enormous sums of money masquerading as a point here and there.
Mr. Galbraith doesn't believe that deficits matter and he believes that Social Security and Medicare are doing just fine. We disagree. Entitlements are growing by leaps and bounds; investments by any measure are not keeping pace, and the future shows an accelerating trend in the wrong direction. We need to be concerned about this.

HEADLINE: Romney Calls Reid's Tax Claims a Diversion From Jobs Report

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney suggests that either the White House or Obama campaign officials could be behind what he characterized as false accounts of him not paying taxes for years. 

 BODY:
NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. - Mitt Romney on Friday said that he had paid "a lot of taxes" every year and accused the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, of falsely claiming that he had not - saying the senator did so as a tactic to draw attention away from lackluster employment and economic numbers under President Obama.
Mr. Romney also suggested that either the White House or Obama campaign officials could be behind what he characterized as false accounts of him not paying taxes for years.
"Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up," Mr. Romney said. "So Harry, who are your sources? Let's have Harry explain who that is."
Mr. Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said in a statement on Thursday that "I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years." But the senator has provided no evidence to back up the assertion.
Mr. Romney has said he is likely to pay a total of $6.2 million in taxes on $45 million in income over the two tax years of 2010 and 2011; he has released his 2010 return and says he will release his 2011 return when it is completed.
But he declined again on Friday to disclose more than those two years, a refusal that has drawn attacks from Democrats - who argue he must be hiding something - and criticism from many Republicans who fear his unwillingness to adhere to a more detailed and customary tax disclosure is distracting from the Romney campaign's message.
Mr. Romney said that Mr. Reid's attacks and the call for more of his tax returns was really an effort to divert attention away from poor jobs numbers and the unemployment rate, which has ticked up to 8.3 percent, according to a new government report on Friday.
"By the way Harry, I understand what you are trying to do here," Mr. Romney said. "You are trying to deflect the fact that jobs numbers are bad, that Americans are out of work, and you're trying to throw anything up on the screen that will grab attention away from the fact that the policies of the White House haven't worked to put Americans to work, and the policies of the Senate haven't even got a budget in place."
"Now let me also say categorically: I have paid taxes every year, and a lot of taxes, a lot of taxes," Mr. Romney added. "So Harry is simply wrong, and that's why I'm so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who have put this forward."
"I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign, or who knows where they are coming from," he said.

HEADLINE: Aug. 3: A Good Week for Obama in Forecast

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: This week's polling and economic data were mostly good news for President Obama. 

 BODY:
The past week of polling and economic data was relatively newsworthy by our forecast model's standards, and most of the news was good for President Obama.
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama was helped in the forecast by a report showing an increase in personal income -- one of the economic variables that the forecast model uses, and a reasonably good predictor of voter preferences in past elections. On Wednesday, he polled strongly in a number of swing states. And on Friday, Mr. Obama got a respectable -- although by no means wonderful -- employment report, which estimated that 163,000 jobs were created in July.
The forecast model uses the jobs number directly in its forecast. It also incorporates the S&P 500 index, which was up sharply on Friday -- partly on the jobs news and partly because investors were in a better mood about the situation in Europe. Mr. Obama's probability of winning the Electoral College increased slightly on the economic news, to 71.1 percent from 70.2 percent.
Mr. Obama's lead in the popular vote is quite narrow: the forecast projects him to win 50.7 percent of the vote, against 48.3 percent for Mitt Romney. (Interestingly, this is the exact margin by which George W. Bush defeated John Kerry in 2004.) Mr. Obama has some chance of winning the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote -- but the reverse outcome is less likely.
Meanwhile, the comparatively encouraging economic reports of the past week make it less likely that there is another shoe to drop on Mr. Obama in the form of a further economic downturn. The economy is bad enough as it is, but voters in past elections have judged incumbents by the amount of progress in the economy, rather than how productive it is in an absolute sense.
So far, Mr. Obama seems to have persuaded a slim plurality of voters that there are enough hopeful signs to warrant another term for him. Mr. Romney still has plenty of ammunition to make the counterargument, but the flow of economic data this week made it a little harder for him.

HEADLINE: With a Unibody Design, the 2013 Nissan Pathfinder Strikes a Sleeker Pose

BYLINE: NICK KURCZEWSKI


HIGHLIGHT: Nissan revamps the 2013 Pathfinder's construction to appeal to a change in consumer taste and to keep up with competing vehicles riding on unibody platforms. 

 BODY:
Amid the crunching of nacho chips and the clicking of high heels navigating cobblestone streets, Nissan unveiled the 2013 Pathfinder in Lower Manhattan on Thursday.
The setting for the global introduction, a bustling Mexican restaurant in the heart of the meatpacking district, is a strong indicator that Nissan wants to change the Pathfinder's image.
The slab sides and jutting fenders of the old Pathfinder have given way to a smoother and more contemporary design. The exterior is sleek and aerodynamic. A chrome-edged grille framed by wide, swept-back headlights dominates the front end, while the shape is less boxy than the outgoing model.
The previous version employed a body-on-frame design, a common type of vehicle construction for pickup trucks and heavy-duty sport utilities.
The new seven-passenger Pathfinder now rides on a unibody platform, which is generally lighter and offers more a carlike ride and handling characteristics.
According to Nissan, the switch to a unibody design shaved roughly 500 pounds from the curb weight. As a result, the combined city-highway fuel economy is expected to improve about 25 percent. The 2013 Pathfinder is estimated at 20 m.p.g. in town and 26 on the highway for front-wheel-drive models and 19/25 city/highway when equipped with the optional four-wheel-drive system.
"The change in consumer taste" and the desire for "better ride comfort and torsional stiffness" are some of the crucial factors that drove Nissan to revamp the Pathfinder's construction, said Adam O'Shaughnessy, a senior product planner for Nissan North America.
The move also follows the lead of competing vehicles, like the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander, all of which ride on unibody platforms.
The Pathfinder shares the same platform as the recently introduced Infiniti JX utility wagon, though Mr. O'Shaughnessy says the two vehicles do not share any body panels.
Under the hood of the Pathfinder is a 260-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine coupled to the latest version of Nissan's Xtronic continuously variable transmission.
Available in front- and four-wheel-drive formats, when properly equipped, the Pathfinder has a towing capacity of up to 5,000 pounds. That should allow it to tackle moderately rugged chores, even if its days of tackling the Rubicon Trail seem to be over.
Nissan has also upgraded the cabin for a premium feel, with higher quality plastics used throughout the interior - though the faux wood trim on the center console isn't fooling anyone.
Options include a 13-speaker Bose audio system, heated and cooled front seats and the Around View parking monitor.
In a nod to consumer demands for more flexible seating arrangements, Nissan has installed its EZ Flex seating system. This allows the split-folding (60-40) second-row seats to slide forward and back by 5.5 inches. And sure enough, clambering into the rear seats required only minimal dexterity.
The seating system also permits access to the third row even with a child safety seat installed in the second row.
When the Pathfinder goes on sale this fall, it will be available in four trim levels: S, SV, SL and Platinum. Pricing will be revealed closer to the sale date. The current Pathfinder ranges from $33,000 to $44,000, depending on trim and options.

HEADLINE: Golf Course vs. Dunes: A Rebellion That Failed

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: Talking with the director of a film about Donald Trump's new golf course in Scotland, constructed on dunes that local fought to protect. 

 BODY:
It's been six years since Donald Trump flew to northeastern Scotland to announce plans to build a $1 billion golf course. Permission was initially denied by the local Aberdeenshire Council but was then granted by the Scottish government on the ground that it was in the nation's best interests. 
On July 15, Trump International Golf Links finally opened. But not everyone was delighted to see one of Britain's last stretches of coastal wilderness transformed into a putting green. 
"You've Been Trumped," a documentary film by the British director Anthony Baxter that opens on Friday in at the Angelika Film Center in New York, tells the story of the dunes that Mr. Trump thought should become "the greatest golf course in the world" and the locals who fought the project. 
This week we chatted with Mr. Baxter about the golf course and his experience making the film. Following are excerpts, edited for brevity and clarity:
Q.
A.
I live in a town called Montrose, on the east coast of Scotland, which is just down the road from where Donald Trump announced he would be building the golf course. I had recently made a documentary for the BBC on man-made erosion on the beach in Montrose, and that got me interested in the environment of the coast and dune systems. So when I heard of Mr. Trump's plans, I was interested in the very unique dune ecosystem of the Menie estate, where he intended to build.
It struck me as extraordinary that both of the two newspapers in Aberdeen completely ignored the environmental impacts this would have. Instead, they were raving about how this is going to be great for Scotland and bring lots of jobs -- welcoming Donald Trump with open arms, as were the local politicians to a large extent.

I would watch the evening news and see the local people being caricatured as country yokels getting in the way of economic progress and not being given a voice by the people who were supposed to represent them. I just felt very strongly that there was a job to be done here. 
My first move was to go up and speak with the local residents. I found them to be an extraordinary group of people who were very aware of just how important the landscape they lived in was. They were people who knew those dunes incredibly well. They had raised their families there and cared passionately about the environment. They just couldn't bear the thought of its being destroyed. 
I tried to go the traditional route and get funding for the film from broadcasting cooperations and art agencies. No one would touch it. I ended up remortgaging my house and raised the rest of the money online. 
Q.
A.
There was not one credible environmental group that supported this development. Friends of the Earth Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Ramblers Association of Scotland -- all of these groups were dead set against this development. 
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds actually issued a press release when Mr. Trump was given the go-ahead saying that Scotland's green policy had been sold down the river by this decision. Not a single expert was standing up and saying that it made sense to tamper with this very unique sand dunes system. 
I hadn't realized when I set out just how important these dunes are/were. They tell scientists a great deal about the interaction between the ocean and the coast and they are a site of particular scientific interest for studying climate change. That shouldn't be expected to trouble Mr. Trump, though, as he has told the BBC that he doesn't believe in man-made climate change. 
As the scientist said in the film, this is the Amazon rainforest of Scotland -- the dunes are the crown jewels of our national heritage. We just cannot afford to lose these kinds of important sensitive sites, and our planet cannot afford it, whether it is in Scotland or elsewhere in the world. 
Q.
A.
What stays with me is the day when hundreds of people marched across the dunes in support of local residents who were objecting to the development, who were being threatened with eminent domain, afraid they were about to be forced out of their homes to make way for Mr. Trump's golf course. That was a magnificent display of people rallying behind them. 
Then again, any time I spent with the locals was incredibly memorable. They are an extraordinary and inspirational group. They have been branded a national embarrassment to Scotland by the Trump organization, but they have stood up against a great deal of bullying and have stood up for the environment. 
They are incredibly dignified people who stood firm even when their water and electricity was cut off without explanation or when enormous banks of earth were piled up around their homes because Mr. Trump didn't want to have to see them from his putting green. 
Q.
A.
I was up there just a couple of weeks ago when the golf course officially opened. Mr. Trump made it clear I wasn't welcome at the event, so I instead spent the day with the local residents. There was a great deal of sadness but also a weird kind of humor at just how ridiculous things have gotten. 
All the houses of the people who held out are still surrounded with either huge banks of earth or strategically planted trees to try to block their homes from the view of golfers. They all say they are staying where they are -- they have no intention of moving. 
But it has had a huge effect on them. They didn't ask for any of this. They didn't ask to be thrown into the media spotlight. They just wanted to get on with their lives and live peacefully on these dunes. And now they're being stopped all the time by Mr. Trump's security, essentially forced to live in a guarded compound. 
The days when you can just stroll out of your house and go down to the beach are long gone. 
Q.
A.
Well, the big news now is that Mr. Trump is objecting to a proposed wind farm slated to be built off the coast from his golf course, saying it will spoil the view. He is threatening not to build his hotel if it goes through, but it's clearly an excuse, because he realizes that the economics of his venture aren't adding up. 
In the end, only one golf course and a temporary club house have been finished. The 450-room hotel, the second course, the hostel for workers, the 1,500 houses -- none of that has been built and it almost certainly won't be. 
So what's happened? We've destroyed the unique dune system, we've practically made people prisoners in their own homes, and there aren't even any significant economic benefits to show for it. Six thousand jobs was the promise made by Mr. Trump to the Scottish government. 
There are just a smattering of part-time jobs, mowing the grass, caddying and serving up the odd cocktail. I went to a jobs fair held recently, and there were only 50 jobs being offered, and they were just part-time, low-paying jobs - not the sorts of things people can afford to take. The economic claims just don't stand up under scrutiny. 
Q.
A.
I was consistently refused interviews with the police, government officials and, of course, Mr. Trump. I think the Scottish government and the local police still have a lot of questions to answer. You can say that Mr. Trump does what Mr. Trump does, but the Scottish government is supposed to stand for more. 
Q.
A.
Recently, speaking to the Scottish Parliament, Mr. Trump branded the film a failure, although he admits he hasn't actually seen it. We haven't had any other response from him, besides the statement from the Trump organization calling the local people a "national embarrassment." 
Q.
A.
A number of communities around the world have asked us to screen the film in their town or city. They say the same thing is happening in their area -- this story keeps on repeating itself. In Dubrovnik, Croatia, we're seeing a strikingly parallel story unfold. A tycoon is coming in, the local newspaper and media are backing it, and the government is throwing out the red carpet to welcome this wealthy business person who promises all these jobs in return for developing one of the last open spaces in the area. 
Everyone is blinded by the ludicrous claims of how much money will be brought into the community. I'm not sure if I will embark on another similar big documentary right now, but there is a job for journalists: to make sure that people know what the real impact of these developments will be.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Gets Encouragement From Jury That Ruled Against It

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The jury that acquitted a former Citigroup executive in the S.E.C.'s case against him included with the verdict a statement supporting financial investigations. 

 BODY:
As Beau Brendler sat in the jury box listening to the government's case against a former Citigroup midlevel executive, the same question kept entering his mind.
"I wanted to know why the bank's C.E.O. wasn't on trial," said Mr. Brendler, who served as the jury's foreman. "Citigroup's behavior was appalling."
Despite that sentiment, Mr. Brendler and his fellow jurors - a group that included a security guard, a lab technician and a full-time musician in a rock 'n' roll band - cleared the former Citigroup executive, Brian Stoker, of wrongdoing over his role in selling a complex $1 billion mortgage bond deal during the waning days of the housing boom.
 But even as the jury reached a consensus that the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to prove its case, it was left with an uneasy feeling that the verdict inadequately described its feelings about Citigroup's conduct.
"We were afraid that we would send a message to Wall Street that a jury made up of regular American folks could not understand their complicated transactions and so they could get away with their outrageous conduct," Mr. Brendler said. "We also did not want to discourage the government from investigating and prosecuting financial crimes."
So the jurors did something extremely rare: They issued a statement alongside their verdict.
"This verdict should not deter the S.E.C. from continuing to investigate the financial industry, review current regulations and modify existing regulations as necessary," said the statement, which was read aloud by Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Tuesday.
Mr. Brendler, a 48-year-old freelance writer, wrote the sentence after soliciting input from the seven other jurors. He scratched it out on a yellow sheet ripped from a legal pad, wrapped it around the verdict form and put both in a sealed envelope that was delivered to the judge.
"It wasn't a particularly eloquent statement, but we hoped it would get a point across," Mr. Brendler said.
In an informal survey of 11 defense lawyers and prosecutors, not one could recall a case when a jury had issued a statement like the one that the Stoker jury did. Dennis M. Kelleher, a former litigator at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, said that the jury's admonition underscored the nation's prevailing sentiment about the financial services industry.
"These eight ordinary citizens believed what the polls tell us most Americans believe," said Mr. Kelleher, who now serves as president of Better Markets, a lobbying organization pressing for regulatory reform. "They still would be delighted to see the government hold these banks and some of their executives accountable for misconduct during the financial crisis."
Mr. Stoker's trial was one of the few cases related to the financial crisis that has gone to a jury. The case was brought alongside a civil fraud lawsuit accusing Citigroup of misleading clients about a 2007 investment in a collateralized debt obligation, or C.D.O. Citigroup was among the leaders in structuring these complex securities, which were pools of mortgages sliced up into pieces and sold off to investors. The bank marketed more than $20 billion worth of C.D.O.'s, earning enormous fees.
It is widely acknowledged that C.D.O.'s were a root cause of the financial crisis, stoking the demand for subprime mortgages and inflating the housing bubble. The securities also ended up on balance sheets of the large banks, saddling them with crippling losses when the housing market collapsed.
A questionable tactic used by Citigroup and several other banks was at the heart of the Stoker case. Some banks stuffed C.D.O.'s with risky mortgage securities, sold them to unsuspecting customers and then bet against them.
Regulators said that Mr. Stoker, who prepared marketing materials for the deal, knew or should have known that he was deceiving investors by not disclosing that Citigroup helped pick the underlying mortgage bonds in the C.D.O. and then bet that its value would decline. When the housing market collapsed, Citigroup's clients lost money while the bank made a bundle.
"Citi is a fundamentally different company today than it was before the crisis," said Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for the bank. "We continue to work hard to instill a culture of responsible finance."
Now under new management, Citigroup agreed to pay the government $285 million to resolve its role in the case, but the settlement has yet to receive court approval. Mr. Stoker, however, took his case to trial.
Travis Dawson, 23, a student at Baruch College, also served on the Stoker jury. Before the trial, Mr. Dawson, a lifelong Bronx resident, had been largely uninformed about the ways of Wall Street.
"Where I'm from, you hear Wall Street is an evil place but you really have nothing to base that on," Mr. Dawson said. "But after sitting on the jury I thought, 'Wow, greedy, reckless behavior really does happen there.' "
In explaining the verdict, both Mr. Dawson and Mr. Brendler said that they believed that Mr. Stoker was made a scapegoat for the industry's sins. In his closing statement, Mr. Stoker's lawyer, John W. Keker, hammered away at that point, arguing that his client "shouldn't be blamed for the faults of banking any more than a person who works in a lawful casino should be blamed for the faults of gambling."
Mr. Keker underscored this point by showing the jury an illustration from "Where's Waldo?," the children's book in which readers are challenged to find the hidden title character. He likened his client to Waldo, suggesting that Mr. Stoker, 41, was merely a blip in Citigroup's vast C.D.O. universe.
"Most of this trial had nothing to do with Brian Stoker," Mr. Keker said.
Mr. Dawson said that the "Where's Waldo?" allusion resonated.
"I'm not saying that Stoker was 100 percent innocent, but given the crazy environment back then it was hard to pin the blame on one person," Mr. Dawson said. "Stoker structured a deal that his bosses told him to structure, so why didn't they go after the higher-ups rather than a fall guy?"
With the trial now finished, the foreman, Mr. Brendler, who lives in Patterson, N.Y., in northeast Putnam County, is back looking for full-time work. He has been a freelance writer since 2009, when Consumer Reports laid him off.
He was heartened to see that the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement issued a statement after the verdict that it respected the jury's decision and would continue to pursue misconduct arising out of the financial crisis. And on Thursday, the S.E.C. lawyers who tried the case called him to ask how they could be more effective.
"I'm glad they're taking this seriously because the industry seemed completely out of control with no oversight," Mr. Brendler said. "Wall Street's actions hurt all of us and we badly need a watchdog who will rein them in."

HEADLINE: Where 'Socialized Medicine' Has a U.S. Foothold

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Opponents of a greater government role in health care seem to overlook the system for military veterans, which has all the hallmarks of a socialized medicine program, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
Last Friday's exuberant celebration of Britain's National Health Service during the opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympics, directed by the Oscar-winning filmmaker Danny Boyle, got me thinking about American attitudes about socialized medicine. 
As might be expected, the event elicited a few tut-tuts from Conservative members of Parliament, and more stern rebukes from the commentariat in the United States, most vehemently by Rush Limbaugh. 
Bashing the N.H.S. has become a favorite ritual during any debate on health care reform on this side of the Atlantic. As the disgraceful treatment of Dr. Donald Berwick, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services, illustrates, any American remarking positively on the N.H.S. runs the risk of being declared unfit to serve in government and vehemently attacked in the blogosphere.

The most humorous illustration of American N.H.S.-bashing was supplied during the heated health reform discussions in 2009 by Investor's Business Daily. In an editorial, the paper asserted, "People such as scientist Stephen Hawking wouldn't have a chance in the U.K., where the National Health Service would say the quality of life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless." 
Dr. Hawking, who has lived and worked in Britain all of his life, responded: "I wouldn't be here today if it were not for the N.H.S. I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived." 
Eventually, Prof. Ara Darzi, a former minister of health, head of surgery at Imperial College in London and Britain's ambassador for health and life sciences, and Tom Kibasi of McKinsey & Company, an honorary lecturer at Imperial College, gently lectured American readers on this amusing episode and on the actual modus operandi of the N.H.S. The episode also opened a lively and sometimes bemused blog traffic in Britain. 
Although I personally have never advocated adopting an N.H.S.-style approach to health reform in the United States, I have been puzzled for decades by the almost instinctive habit among many Americans of incessantly running down every other country's approach to health care and health insurance. 
Is this habit born of the deep-seated insecurity that might naturally arise from the cognitive dissonance of boasting "ours is the best health system in the world," all the while beholding daily the travails and hand-wringing over the sometimes glaring shortcomings of the American health care system? 
I have found that one effective way I can stop N.H.S.-bashing dead in its track is to ask bashers this simple question: "Why don't you like my son?" I posed that question to a congressman who had berated "socialized medicine" during a hearing on health insurance reform at which I testified.
In response to the stunned look this question invariably elicits, I go on: "You see, our son is a retired captain of the U.S. Marine Corps. He is an American veteran. Remarkably, Americans of all political stripes have long reserved for our veterans the purest form of socialized medicine, the vast health system operated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (generally known as the V.A. health system). If socialized medicine is as bad as so many on this side of the Atlantic claim, why have both political parties ruling this land deemed socialized medicine the best health system for military veterans? Or do they just not care about them?"
I must note that there is a widespread confusion in this country over the terms "social health insurance" and "socialized medicine."
Among policy wonks, "social health insurance" is understood to be health insurance to which the individual makes contributions on the basis of ability to pay, rather than on the basis of health status. Such a system can be coupled, and often is, with purely private health care delivery systems, including for-profit enterprises. Canada, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland come to mind.
Socialized medicine refers to systems that couple social health insurance with government-owned and operated health care facilities, such as Britain's N.H.S. or the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, a still-appreciated legacy of British colonialism. Socialized medicine also typified the health systems operated by the former socialist countries in the Soviet orbit. Evidently, the V.A. health system perfectly fits the definition of socialized medicine. 
Occasionally one does come across an American politician who mutters something about privatizing the V.A. health system. I doubt this idea would have much political traction, either as part of a party's platform or in the presidential candidates' campaign repertoire. 
In fact, I would dare presidential candidates professing a distaste for socialized medicine to call openly for abolition of the V.A. health system in favor of a purely privatized system - e.g., a defined contribution system such as that advocated for Medicare by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee. 
So far I have not received a satisfactory answer from detractors of "socialized medicine" to my question of why we have the V.A. health system when socialized medicine putatively is so evil. Perhaps some commentators on this blog will enlighten me.
Before responding, however, readers might consider these readings, which can be found in an Internet search on "V.A. Health Care and Quality": a book by Phillip Longman, "The Best Care Anywhere: Why V.A. Health Care Is Better Than Yours"; an article on V.A. health care in the American Medical Association's amednews.com, and, finally, from the Rand Corporation's nationally recognized team of experts on the quality of health care in the United States this eye-opening report.

HEADLINE: Germany's Jobless Numbers Buck Euro Zone Trend

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
IN unemployment, as in many other areas, Germany stands alone at the top of the euro zone.
The European Union's statistical agency, Eurostat, reported this week that the unemployment rate among German adults fell to 5.1 percent in June, the lowest figure since the country was unified in 1991. 
Among workers under 25 years old, the German unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.9 percent, the lowest level since 1993.
But in most of Europe, unemployment rates are rising, and unemployment rates among the young are hitting highs that would have been unthinkable only a couple of years ago.
The accompanying charts show the trends since 2006, before the financial crisis brought on a world recession, in the four largest economies in the euro zone -- Germany, France, Italy and Spain, as well as in the United States and in the total euro zone, excluding Germany.
In the United States, as in Germany, unemployment rates have been trending lower for more than a year. In July, the government reported on Friday, the adult rate in the United States was unchanged at 6.9 percent, while the rate for young workers fell a tenth of a percent to 16.4 percent.
But adult rates have been rising in most of Europe. The unemployment rate for young people has also been climbing in many countries, although it is declining in France.
Germany's overall gain in employment reflects the strength of its export-oriented economy, which has benefited from the fact that many of its European neighbors have lost competitiveness. The relatively low jobless rate among young people has also been helped by German social policies that encourage many young people to enter paid apprenticeships when they finish school.
In September 2008, the month that Lehman Brothers failed, the adult unemployment rate in Germany was 6.7 percent, precisely the same as the rate in the rest of the euro zone. Now, the rest of the euro zone has an adult rate of 11.9 percent, more than double the German rate.
Nowhere has the reversal of fortune been sharper than in Spain. Before the financial crisis, the country was booming, largely because of a property bubble that held the seeds of its own destruction. The government was running budget surpluses and unemployment was lower for both adults and young people than it was in neighboring France.
Now, the adult unemployment rate exceeds 22 percent, meaning that one in five workers cannot find a job. Among youth, fewer than half are able to find employment. Those out-of-work people can expect little help from within the country. The Spanish government is barely able to finance itself, and its banking system, devastated by bad property loans, needed to be bailed out by Europe.
Things are not as bad in Italy, at least for adult workers. The unemployment rate has been rising and is estimated to be above 9 percent. But more than one-third of the young people looking for work are unable to find it.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: In Jobs for Young, Germany Stands Alone: The unemployment rate for people under age 25 has fallen below 8 percent in Germany, even as it has approached 30 percent in the rest of the 17-nation euro zone. The difference between youth and adult unemployment rates is also smaller in Germany than in other countries. (Sources: Eurostat

HEADLINE: Closer Scrutiny of For-Profit Schools

 BODY:
The last several weeks have not been particularly restful for the lucrative for-profit education industry.
A federal judge upheld the Department of Education's right to regulate unscrupulous for-profit schools that leave students with big debts and valueless credentials. 
A Senate committee released a blistering report showing that many of these schools pocket huge profits, even though most students leave without degrees.
A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that people who started in programs awarding an associate degree -- a big slice of the student population -- reaped significant economic rewards with degrees from public and nonprofit institutions. Those with degrees or certificates from for-profits did not.
This is all sobering news. The for-profit sector is growing rapidly and now consumes about one-fourth of all federal education loans and grants. It is essential that the federal government tighten its rules to make sure that taxpayers -- not to mention the students themselves -- get their money's worth.
The Obama administration took a stab at this last year by issuing new rules requiring both for-profit and nonprofit career-training programs to meet one of three tests to remain eligible for federal student aid. The common thread to these tests was that schools had to show, in effect, that their graduates had not been crippled by debt. The rules stipulated that at least 35 percent of graduates must be repaying their loans, or that the typical graduate's estimated annual loan payments did not exceed 12 percent of earnings, or that repayments did not exceed 30 percent of discretionary income.
Judge Rudolph Contreras said he found no convincing rationale for the 35 percent repayment rate rule, but made clear that the department had a statutory right to curb predatory schools that exploited students.
In our view, the federal government has more than a right to regulate these schools: it has a clear obligation to do so. By almost any metric, the for-profit schools are generally a bad deal for taxpayers -- and for the underprivileged students they often recruit through deceptive means. It is imperative that Washington do its part by making its rules as strong as possible.

HEADLINE: What Some Investors Are Doing to Anticipate a Tax Increase

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
ONE thing is certain this fall: there will be a lot of talk about taxes. But without a broad agreement, a series of automatic increases will take effect next year. What are investors to do?
While there are still three months until Election Day, recent action in Washington did little to suggest the spirit of compromise is in the air. The Senate has voted to raise taxes on the wealthy, while the House has voted to keep taxes low for everyone.
I was curious to see how people affected by any increases in the tax on investment income were dealing with the uncertainty. That tax is set to go up at least 3.8 percentage points -- the amount of the surtax on high earners in President Obama's health care legislation. But it could go up much more if lawmakers do not come to an agreement.
I decided to call a few wealthy investors to ask how the prospect of the increase was affecting their investment decisions. More on them in a bit. 
First, what are the increases? The 3.8 percent surtax will be levied on investment income for individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year, or $250,000 for a couple. The Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, has said he will repeal the health care law on his first day in office. But his first day, if he wins, won't be until Jan. 20, 2013, and even then, the most he could do would be to send legislation to Congress. So it is best to plan as if that tax will be levied. The more difficult taxes to estimate are on capital gains and dividends. The capital gains tax is 15 percent and is set to go to 20 percent next year if the tax cuts from the George W. Bush administration expire. (Counting the 3.8 percent surtax, the capital gains tax will be either 18.8 percent or 23.8 percent for high earners.)
The dividend tax is also 15 percent, but it could go as high as the income tax rate. If the Bush tax cuts expire, the rate for the highest earners would be 39.6 percent. But those people would also be subject to the additional 3.8 percent surtax, bringing the total dividend tax to as much as 43.4 percent. (Until 2003, dividends were taxed as income.)
It is easy to see how the dividend tax could quickly wipe out the benefit of holding dividend-paying stocks. The capital gains tax is trickier because it is paid only when someone sells an investment that has appreciated. Still, the addition of the 3.8 percent to the existing capital gains tax can be a big number on any transaction that results in a large capital gain. Michael E. Goodman, a certified public accountant and president of Wealthstream Advisors in New York, said he had a client who was trying to sell an apartment in Manhattan for a price that would result in a taxable gain of $2 million. This year, she would pay $300,000 in capital gains taxes.
But if she cannot sell the apartment until next year, she would pay at least an additional $76,000 because of the 3.8 percent surtax. If the capital gains rate goes up to 20 percent as well, her total tax bill on the sale of the apartment would be $476,000, or nearly 60 percent more than today.
So what should people do? I spoke to several members of Tiger 21, an investment club that requires its members to have a minimum net worth of $10 million. Tiger 21 members have substantial wealth, and they spend time each month going over one another's portfolios. They raised three points that could help any affluent person.
One strategy is to use the prospect of increased taxes to examine all long-held investments and sell any with big gains before the end of the year.
That is what Leslie C. Quick III says he is doing. His wealth came from the sale of Quick & Reilly, the discount brokerage firm that was started by his family and bought by Fleet Financial Services in 1997. After subsequent mergers, his Fleet stock is now Bank of America stock. That stock peaked at nearly $55 in late 2006 but is now trading around $7 per share.
''Our basis was zero, so even at $7 you still have a gain,'' he said. ''You keep hoping against hope that it's going to recover, but it's going to be a long slog.''
Mr. Quick said he was focusing on cleaning up various portfolios of securities that he had neglected over the years. ''Some have done well, so I'm thinking before the end of the year I should sell some of these positions before taking another 3.8 percent hit,'' he said.
The Tiger 21 members also recommended that the wealthy modify their investments to reduce the impact of the increase.
Randy R. Beeman, who made his fortune buying and selling businesses and is now a financial adviser with Baird, a wealth management firm, said he was looking to buy more municipal bonds. For the last couple of years, he has owned more taxable corporate bonds because their yields were high enough to offset the tax-free benefits of municipal bonds. Now, he said, the tax increase makes municipal bonds more attractive.
He is making a bigger change with his real estate holdings. Mr. Beeman said his wife would start to actively manage the properties they rent out. He says he believes that by doing this, the rents will no longer be categorized as passive income, which is subject to the surtax.
''If you have one town house generating a couple of thousand dollars a year, it's probably not worth it,'' he said. ''If you have 10 properties and each one is generating $15,000 in net income, then it is worthwhile. It's a matter of size and if you have the time and ability to do it.''
For the most part, though, the Tiger 21 members said their bigger concern was finding investments that actually rose in value, regardless of what tax they might eventually pay.
Reginald K. Brack, the former chairman and chief executive of Time Inc., said he was now more focused on making long-term investments.
''I sell these investments when there is a profit to be made,'' he said. ''Now, if the capital gains tax is changed dramatically, that might change things. But it was higher at one time. We'll live through it.''
Michael Sonnenfeldt, who became wealthy in real estate before starting Tiger 21, said a poll of the group's 192 members after the second quarter found that, on average, they had increased their allocation to private equity by four percentage points. He interpreted this as meaning members were more concerned about getting a return on their money than about any tax they might later pay.
Personally, he said, the increased investment tax would affect his thinking only on investments that had a low return or that he was hesitant about in the first place.
''If someone came to me and said, 'I have a software program that rivals Facebook and you can put $1 million into it today and we'll have one billion customers in eight years,' the 3.8 percent doesn't matter,'' Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. ''But when you get down to investments where the risks are lower and the returns are lower, then the 3.8 percent will make more of a difference.''
How any tax increases will cause investors to act is, in many ways, anyone's guess. Taxes on capital gains and dividends have been much higher in the past. The wild card is the weak economy.
''There is some evidence that when you raise the capital gains rate, people hold on to assets longer,'' said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group. ''Fifteen to 18.8 percent is not a big deal; 23.8 is somewhat bigger. But, in historical terms, it's not a particularly big tax.''
Mr. Goodman noted that people could lose out on high returns if they fixated on taxes. Real estate investment trusts, for one, pay out high dividends, but they are taxed at the income tax rate. He recommends that people put high-tax assets into tax-deferred retirement accounts.
In reality, most people are better at complaining about taxes than calculating the actual impact on their lives. So their reaction to the increases may not register until 2014, when the taxes come due.
''Some people are saying, 'Oh, it's only 3.8 percent,' '' Mr. Goodman said. ''But if you have a large portfolio and you get that call next year from your accountant saying you owe $15,000, $20,000 more, I think it's going to surprise people.''

HEADLINE: E-Mails Show Long Island Man Faked His Own Death, Wife Says

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD; Ann Farmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The tangled case of the Long Island man who was feared drowned last weekend in the waters off Jones Beach -- but who turned up speeding down the highway in South Carolina five days later -- took a new twist on Friday, when his wife said he had staged it all without her knowledge.
The man, Raymond Roth, 47, an unemployed telecommunications manager from Massapequa, was reported missing from the beach by his son, Jonathan, 22, touching off an exhaustive air, water and land search by the police and other agencies. 
At a news conference at her lawyer's office on Friday, Mr. Roth's wife, Evana Roth, said she had been preparing for her husband's funeral until she found e-mails on their home computer on Wednesday. The messages were from Mr. Roth to Jonathan and suggested that it was all a plot that Jonathan was privy to. Jonathan is Ms. Roth's stepson.
She said she then contacted relatives and called the authorities.
Early Thursday morning, Mr. Roth was stopped by the police in South Carolina for speeding. The New York State Park Police, which have been investigating the disappearance, spoke to him by phone and said Mr. Roth had assured them he would return to New York and clear things up.
Since the police did not charge him with anything, he was allowed to go on his way. His current location is unknown, though Ms. Roth and neighbors said they believed they had seen him driving around his neighborhood.
''There are no words to explain how sorry I am and embarrassed,'' said Ms. Roth, who works as a doctor's receptionist.
Ms. Roth said she did not know what Mr. Roth's motive might be. According to her, he was fired from his job as a manager at Level 3 Communications, a telecommunications company, on July 20, shortly after he had threatened to shoot two supervisors. Around that time, the Nassau County Police Department said that it had contacted Mr. Roth about a licensed gun that he owned and that he voluntarily turned it in on July 21.
''He got fired, and it was a downward spiral from there,'' Ms. Roth said.
She said their 12-year marriage was long troubled. She described Mr. Roth as an alcoholic who had mentally abused her for years. Their home was put up for sale last week. According to Ms. Roth, the house originally belonged to her but Mr. Roth coerced her into transferring it into both their names in April.
Ms. Roth said she had learned from Level 3 that he doubled or tripled the size of his life insurance policy in January, but added that she did not know its size or the beneficiary. She also said that just before the beach episode, he had withdrawn all their available money, and had taken out cash advances, totaling about $10,000. She also said she believed he had recently made out a new will.
Ms. Roth presented copies of three of the e-mails she said she had found. They were dated a week ago Friday and told Jonathan of Mr. Roth's need to get cash for his ''trip'' and specified a time for Jonathan to call Mr. Roth from a pay phone or borrowed phone at a time share he owned in Florida so he could ''find out how things are going.''
She also showed what Mr. Roth had left on the beach: his clothes, boat shoes, wallet and cellphone.
Ms. Roth said she felt in danger and was seeking an order of protection against both her husband and stepson.
She said she had not seen Jonathan, who lived with them, since Tuesday, when he told her he was going to New Jersey to stay with an aunt.
Neither Raymond Roth nor Jonathan Roth could be reached for comment.
The Nassau County district attorney's office said it was collaborating with the police as they investigated the matter but had not yet decided whether to file criminal charges.
Ms. Roth said Mr. Roth had been calling her and sending her text messages since Wednesday evening. While she said she had avoided most of his calls, she spoke to him early Friday morning. She said that she asked him why he had done it, and that he replied, ''It didn't work out as I thought it would be.''
On the way to the news conference, Ms. Roth said, she heard from him again. She said he told her to ''be nice'' and asked if she was trying to send her stepson to jail.

HEADLINE: A Jury's Message for Wall Street

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
As Beau Brendler sat in the jury box listening to the government's case against a former Citigroup midlevel executive, the same question kept entering his mind.
''I wanted to know why the bank's C.E.O. wasn't on trial,'' said Mr. Brendler, who served as the jury's foreman. ''Citigroup's behavior was appalling.''
Despite that sentiment, Mr. Brendler and his fellow jurors - a group that included a security guard, a lab technician and a full-time musician in a rock 'n' roll band - cleared the former Citigroup executive, Brian Stoker, of wrongdoing over his role in selling a complex $1 billion mortgage bond deal during the waning days of the housing boom.
But even as the jury reached a consensus that the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to prove its case, it was left with an uneasy feeling that the verdict inadequately described its feelings about Citigroup's conduct. 
''We were afraid that we would send a message to Wall Street that a jury made up of regular American folks could not understand their complicated transactions and so they could get away with their outrageous conduct,'' Mr. Brendler said. ''We also did not want to discourage the government from investigating and prosecuting financial crimes.''
So the jurors did something extremely rare: They issued a statement alongside their verdict.
''This verdict should not deter the S.E.C. from continuing to investigate the financial industry, review current regulations and modify existing regulations as necessary,'' said the statement, which was read aloud by Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Tuesday.
Mr. Brendler, a 48-year-old freelance writer, wrote the sentence after soliciting input from the seven other jurors. He scratched it out on a yellow sheet ripped from a legal pad, wrapped it around the verdict form and put both in a sealed envelope that was delivered to the judge.
''It wasn't a particularly eloquent statement, but we hoped it would get a point across,'' Mr. Brendler said.
In an informal survey of 11 defense lawyers and prosecutors, not one could recall a case when a jury had issued a statement like the one that the Stoker jury did. Dennis M. Kelleher, a former litigator at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, said that the jury's admonition underscored the nation's prevailing sentiment about the financial services industry.
''These eight ordinary citizens believed what the polls tell us most Americans believe,'' said Mr. Kelleher, who now serves as president of Better Markets, a lobbying organization pressing for regulatory reform. ''They still would be delighted to see the government hold these banks and some of their executives accountable for misconduct during the financial crisis.''
Mr. Stoker's trial was one of the few cases related to the financial crisis that has gone to a jury. The case was brought alongside a civil fraud lawsuit accusing Citigroup of misleading clients about a 2007 investment in a collateralized debt obligation, or C.D.O. Citigroup was among the leaders in structuring these complex securities, which were pools of mortgages sliced up into pieces and sold off to investors. The bank marketed more than $20 billion worth of C.D.O.'s, earning enormous fees.
It is widely acknowledged that C.D.O.'s were a root cause of the financial crisis, stoking the demand for subprime mortgages and inflating the housing bubble. The securities also ended up on balance sheets of the large banks, saddling them with crippling losses when the housing market collapsed.
A questionable tactic used by Citigroup and several other banks was at the heart of the Stoker case. Some banks stuffed C.D.O.'s with risky mortgage securities, sold them to unsuspecting customers and then bet against them.
Regulators said that Mr. Stoker, who prepared marketing materials for the deal, knew or should have known that he was deceiving investors by not disclosing that Citigroup helped pick the underlying mortgage bonds in the C.D.O. and then bet that its value would decline. When the housing market collapsed, Citigroup's clients lost money while the bank made a bundle.
''Citi is a fundamentally different company today than it was before the crisis,'' said Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for the bank. ''We continue to work hard to instill a culture of responsible finance.''
Now under new management, Citigroup agreed to pay the government $285 million to resolve its role in the case, but the settlement has yet to receive court approval. Mr. Stoker, however, took his case to trial.
Travis Dawson, 23, a student at Baruch College, also served on the Stoker jury. Before the trial, Mr. Dawson, a lifelong Bronx resident, had been largely uninformed about the ways of Wall Street.
''Where I'm from, you hear Wall Street is an evil place but you really have nothing to base that on,'' Mr. Dawson said. ''But after sitting on the jury I thought, 'Wow, greedy, reckless behavior really does happen there.' ''
In explaining the verdict, both Mr. Dawson and Mr. Brendler said that they believed that Mr. Stoker was made a scapegoat for the industry's sins. In his closing statement, Mr. Stoker's lawyer, John W. Keker, hammered away at that point, arguing that his client ''shouldn't be blamed for the faults of banking any more than a person who works in a lawful casino should be blamed for the faults of gambling.''
Mr. Keker underscored this point by showing the jury an illustration from ''Where's Waldo?,'' the children's book in which readers are challenged to find the hidden title character. He likened his client to Waldo, suggesting that Mr. Stoker, 41, was merely a blip in Citigroup's vast C.D.O. universe.
''Most of this trial had nothing to do with Brian Stoker,'' Mr. Keker said.
Mr. Dawson said that the ''Where's Waldo?'' allusion resonated.
''I'm not saying that Stoker was 100 percent innocent, but given the crazy environment back then it was hard to pin the blame on one person,'' Mr. Dawson said. ''Stoker structured a deal that his bosses told him to structure, so why didn't they go after the higher-ups rather than a fall guy?''
With the trial now finished, the foreman, Mr. Brendler, who lives in Patterson, N.Y., in northeast Putnam County, is back looking for full-time work. He hasn't held a steady job since 2009, when Consumer Reports laid him off.
He was heartened to see that the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement issued a statement after the verdict that it respected the jury's decision and would continue to pursue misconduct arising out of the financial crisis. And on Thursday, the S.E.C. lawyers who tried the case called him to ask how they could be more effective.
''I'm glad they're taking this seriously because the industry seemed completely out of control with no oversight,'' Mr. Brendler said. ''Wall Street's actions hurt all of us and we badly need a watchdog who will rein them in.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Another Threat in Pakistan, in Sheep's Clothing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KUGELMAN. 
Michael Kugelman is the South Asia associate at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

 BODY:
Washington
COUNTLESS threats stalk the Pakistani government, from militants in the tribal regions near Afghanistan to a backward economy teetering on collapse. In recent weeks, the focus has been on the Haqqani network, fundamentalist fighters along the border who have longstanding ties to Pakistani intelligence and have conducted deadly attacks on American troops and officials in Afghanistan.
Yet Pakistan also faces another, less publicized, challenge -- from a banned Islamist organization that does not mount spectacular attacks but is nonetheless insidious. The group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, is part of an international Islamist movement that promises to establish a caliphate through a bloodless revolution led by elite recruits. 
Hizb-ut-Tahrir is not known to have committed a violent act in Pakistan. Instead, according to analysts, it looks for turncoats, proselytizing among officials in inner circles who have the power to bring the government down from within. If they succeed, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal might fall into hands that are even less reliable than those of the military, which controls the country's security.
The organization operates in more than 40 countries, including Britain and the United States, and has been active in Central Asia for more than a decade. But special concern arose in Pakistan after an army brigadier named Ali Khan was arrested in May 2011; his six-month trial, on charges of having ties to Hizb-ut-Tahrir, and of conspiring to overthrow the government, ended in June but a verdict has not yet been announced.
Hizb-ut-Tahrir's ultimate goal is a global caliphate -- an Islamic political and religious domain -- across the entire Muslim world, and Pakistani researchers suggest that it has targeted Pakistan as a potential starting point. Several weeks before Brigadier Khan's arrest last year, Pakistani intelligence warned the government that the movement was planning an Arab Spring-style uprising.
And last March, Pakistani news organizations published a report that Brigadier Khan had said the movement was ready to take over anytime, having equipped itself with a new constitution and shadow government. The report was attributed to a prosecution witness.
The extent of the threat is difficult to judge. While the movement characterizes its tactics as nonviolent, it has used bellicose anti-Western imagery, praised attacks on American forces in the region, and spoken of global conquest. In those ways, at least, Hizb-ut-Tahrir resembles more violent South Asian militant organizations like Lashkar e-Taiba, some of which have friends and sympathizers within the Pakistani military and intelligence elite.
The number of Hizb-ut-Tahrir members in Pakistan is unknown, and officials assume it is modest. But the group's significance lies not so much in its size as in its composition. Its recruiting targets are high-ranking military officers, affluent, educated urbanites and students at prestigious private universities. A statement posted on its Pakistani Web site on Oct. 21 appealed ''To the Generals, Air Marshals and Navy Admirals and officers of the Pakistan armed forces,'' rather than to common soldiers.
''Being the real rulers of this country,'' it told the officers, ''only through you can the ummah be liberated from the current crises, hardship and calamities that she faces at the hands of the Western capitalist states.'' (The ummah refers to the global Islamic community.)
This recruitment seems to be working. Members have claimed that the group operates in major Pakistani cities, and that thousands of Pakistanis have joined. In late March, Pakistani journalists received a text message with a link to a new video accusing the army chief, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, of treachery. Hours later, intelligence agents detained more than 20 people on suspicion of helping produce the video -- at a home in one of Lahore's fanciest neighborhoods.
A former air base commander in the southern province of Baluchistan and a high-ranking security officer for Pervez Musharraf, then the president, were arrested in 2009 and accused of having connections to Hizb-ut-Tahrir. The group has also recruited army cadets trained at Sandhurst, Britain's military academy.
Even though conservatism and piety are on the rise among Pakistan's privileged classes, and recent polls find nearly two-thirds of Pakistani youths favoring an Islamic state, some analysts optimistically assume that Pakistanis as a whole would reject militant paths to that goal. Militant factions like the Pakistani Taliban are reviled for their brutality, and radical Islamist political parties have not done well in elections.
But those observations don't take into account the deviousness of Hizb-ut-Tahrir. In simultaneously rejecting the existing political system and professing nonviolence, the group deftly captures a middle ground in the Pakistani zeitgeist, since a great many Pakistanis abhor both their dysfunctional government and the prospect of more killing. But Hizb-ut-Tahrir's references to nonviolence obscure the group's apparent willingness to use coups to take power, its entreaties to fight American soldiers, and its calls for Israel's destruction.
Given the strength of Pakistan's military, attempts to pull off a putsch like the one Brigadier Khan was accused of planning could well fail. But even a botched coup could unleash devastating results: army crackdowns, a state of emergency, terrorist attacks and a suspension of civilian government.
All this makes for yet another nightmarish prospect that Americans need to worry about in one of the world's most dangerous countries.

HEADLINE: Two-Sided Jobs Report Lets Stocks Erase a Bad Week

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks surged on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining more than 200 points to end a four-day losing streak, after the Labor Department reported increased hiring last month.
Markets had been slumping all week after central banks balked at taking new action to shore up the economy, as investors had hoped.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly jobs report gave investors hope that the economy might be doing better on its own. Employers in the United States added 163,000 jobs last month, far more than the 100,000 economists expected. From April through June, the economy added just 73,000 jobs a month on average, compared with an average of 226,000 in the first three months of the year. 
''It's one step forward,'' said Joe Bell, senior equity analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''But we would like to see continued improvement in the labor market in coming months.''
There was more to cheer about from the service sector, which employs 90 percent of Americans.
The Institute for Supply Management reported that service companies grew at a slightly faster rate in July. The institute's services index rose to 52.6 from 52.1 in June, which was the lowest reading since January 2010. Any reading above 50 means business is growing for service providers.
The Dow industrial average rose 217.29 points, or 1.69 percent, to 13,096.17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 25.99 points, or 1.90 percent, to 1,390.99. And the Nasdaq composite index rose 58.13 points, or 2.0 percent, to 2,967.90. Each of the three indexes finished the week in positive territory even after falling Monday through Thursday.
The good economic news caused investors to sell low-risk assets like government debt. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 26/32, to 101 21/32, and its yield rose to 1.57 percent from 1.48 percent late Thursday.
Despite the gain in hiring, there were still enough signs of weakness in the jobs report to keep hope alive that the Federal Reserve might take more steps to invigorate the economy at its next meeting in September. A separate survey of households by the Labor Department found that the unemployment rate rose to 8.3 percent in July from 8.2 percent in June.
''I'm not ready to declare victory just yet,'' said Uri Landesman, president of the hedge fund Platinum Partners. ''Lending activity is still pretty low because banks aren't taking that much risk, and it's hard for an economy to expand when banks are on tenterhooks themselves.''
At the end of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, the Fed said it would take action ''as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery.'' On Thursday, markets fell sharply after the European Central Bank did not announce specific plans to tackle the Continent's debt crisis, as many investors had expected it would.
Several United States companies turned in strong earnings reports on Friday. Procter & Gamble, the household products maker, reported a 45 percent surge in quarterly earnings, easily beating Wall Street's forecasts. Its stock rose $1.99 to $65.50.
Shares of the trading firm Knight Capital, which was responsible for stock market disruptions on Wednesday that will cost it $440 million, rose $1.47, or 57 percent, to $4.05 on Friday. They had plummeted over the last two days.
LinkedIn rose $15 to $108.51. The social media company reported that its second-quarter revenue increased faster than analysts had expected, and it raised its full-year revenue forecast.
Kraft Foods rose $1.57 to $40.51 after reporting a 5 percent increase in its second-quarter profit. Higher prices helped offset a drag from raw materials costs and currency exchange rates.
Zipcar fell $3.88 to $6.75. The stock reached a record low Friday after cutting its full-year revenue estimates.

HEADLINE: College Town Built on Football Fears Fallout From a Scandal

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -- In the scattered towns of central Pennsylvania, Penn State football is as much an industry as a devotion, fueled by the hundreds of thousands of fans who converge here on fall weekends and spend on hotels, meals, drinks and a mind-boggling array of Nittany Lions memorabilia.
But in the wake of a child molestation scandal and resulting sanctions that will weaken the football program for years, people who do business here fear a thinning of those cheering, tailgating hordes, which could spell economic trouble for the region. 
''We really have nothing to compare this to, so nobody can make any predictions,'' said Maggie Biddle, the general manager of the stately Atherton Hotel, a block from the campus. ''Except we know it's probably going to hurt all of us.''
The canaries in this peculiar coal mine are the shops strung along College Avenue, their windows facing the campus and their shelves and racks lined with Penn State T-shirts, key chains, mugs, sweat pants, tote bags, umbrellas, posters and even jewelry.
''Those seven or eight home game weekends are a majority of our business for the whole year,'' said Caroline Gummo, the advertising manager at one store, the Family Clothesline. ''Business has definitely been affected already by everything that's happened, and we don't know how it's going to play out for the next few years.''
Nowhere else in the country is there a school anywhere near as big (45,000 students on the main campus), in a town as small (42,000 people reside here) in a place as far from population centers (Pittsburgh is more than 100 miles away, Philadelphia almost 200). More than 100,000 people attend each Penn State home game, and the typical out-of-town visitor who has a ticket is accompanied by one or two who do not, as evidenced by the tailgate parties and bars that remain busy during games.
A 2009 study commissioned by Penn State estimated that people arriving from out of state for games or other football-related events spend $34 million a year -- and they are a minority of the visiting fans, most of whom come from other parts of Pennsylvania. In all, the study said, the football program supports more than 2,000 local jobs.
Economists argue that on balance, sports make a poor economic engine, creating mostly low-wage jobs and shifting spending from one place to another. But local merchants say that whether or not this region's obsession with football is healthy, their livelihoods are at least partly built on it.
Penn State also draws visitors for conferences, alumni events, children's sports camps, arts festivals and other college athletics, which are partly subsidized by the profits generated by football.
''If there's a decline in all of that, that's a huge problem for us, and for everyone around here,'' said Kit Henshaw, who, with her husband, Harrison Schailey, owns Harrison's Wine Grill and Catering. ''How many people who organize events or go to events are going to hear everything that's gone on and say, 'We're not going there'?''
So far, the Atherton Hotel's bookings for football weekends have not declined, said Ms. Biddle, the general manager. But many of those reservations were made months ago, and she, like other businesspeople in town, said that the full economic fallout might not become clear for another year or two.
In June, Jerry Sandusky, a former Penn State assistant football coach, was convicted of sexually abusing young boys. Two high-ranking former university officials face criminal charges, accused of failing to report abuse allegations to the authorities and of lying to a grand jury.
The episode badly damaged the reputation of the legendary former head coach, Joe Paterno. A former F.B.I. director's investigation found that Mr. Paterno -- who was fired in November and died in January -- played a role in protecting Mr. Sandusky and keeping the matter secret.
Last week, the National Collegiate Athletic Association fined Penn State $60 million (the Big Ten Conference added its own fine, $13 million), barred it from bowl games for four years and imposed a four-year, 40 percent reduction in football scholarships.
The scandal, turmoil and penalties are widely expected to add up to real trouble in recruiting top players, knocking Penn State from its accustomed place among the nation's elite teams.
What that will do to those football season crowds is less clear. Season ticket sales are running only slightly behind last year's, but it is too early to gauge single-game sales.
For now, the shops are trying to tap into a mood of nervous defiance among fans, with T-shirts and posters that refer obliquely to the scandal but reassert allegiance to Penn State football. Big sellers at the Family Clothesline include a shirt bearing Mr. Paterno's profile that says, ''We Are ... Because He Was,'' a takeoff on the traditional chant ''We Are ... Penn State.''
Local merchants say they are frustrated with a story that will not go away. ''We're all angry,'' Ms. Gummo said, ''that we have to pay the consequences of the actions of just four or five men.''

HEADLINE: Growth in Services Sector Rises, But a Gauge of Jobs Shrinks

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The rate of growth in the services sector of the nation's economy edged up in July as new orders gained, but employment fell to its lowest level in nearly a year, according to an industry report released on Friday. 
The Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 52.6 last month from 52.1 in June, topping economists' forecasts for 52.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
''This is in line with the idea that longer term, we're still seeing slow but steady growth,'' said Mike Shea, a managing partner and trader at Direct Access Partners in New York.
Forward-looking new orders advanced to 54.3 from 53.3, and exports rose to 51 from 49.5, a move to expansion from contraction.
But the employment gauge shrank, falling to its lowest level since September 2011 at 49.3 from 52.3. It was also the first time the index had contracted since December.
The report came after the Labor Department reported on Friday that employers hired the most workers in five months in July, though the unemployment rate rose to 8.3 percent.
Overseas, separate data showed activity among euro zone companies contracted again last month as new orders dropped sharply, while China's services sector expanded.

HEADLINE: After Recalls And Woes, Toyota Posts Huge Profit

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.. 
James B. Stewart, whose Common Sense column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Toyota roared back to a hefty profit in the first quarter and said on Friday that it intended to build a record-breaking 9.76 million cars this year, leading a recovery by Japanese automakers after a year of natural disasters and a punishingly strong currency.
Though the strong yen continues to weigh on the bottom lines of Japanese exporters, many other things are going right for Japanese automakers. Supply chains that were severed are now up and running, and manufacturers like Toyota and Honda, racing to meet pent-up demand, are fast regaining lost ground in profitable markets like the United States. Japanese government incentives on fuel-efficient cars have revived markets at home. 
Whether Japanese automakers can keep up the momentum after these tailwinds dissipate is another question, analysts said.
''They're at the peak of their momentum, but for quite transient reasons,'' said Takaki Nakanishi, an auto analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. ''It's not party time. Japanese automakers still face tough conditions and competition, and a slowdown is likely in the second half.''
For now, however, Japan's top three automakers -- Toyota, Honda and Nissan -- can breathe a sigh of relief after weathering the disasters of 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc at car and parts factories in Japan, while widespread flooding in the manufacturing hub of Thailand paralyzed production lines. Before that, the global financial crisis -- and for Toyota, huge recalls -- made it a difficult few years for Japan's carmakers.
Toyota said net profit for the April-to-June quarter rose to 290.3 billion yen ($3.71 billion) from 1.1 billion yen in the period a year earlier, after the number of vehicles it sold nearly doubled.
The brisk sales growth prompted the carmaker to raise its global sales target by 180,000 cars, to 9.76 million cars this year, which would be a 23 percent increase from 7.95 million cars in 2011.
Including all its trucks and light vehicles, Toyota now expects to produce 10.05 million vehicles this year, which would make it the first automaker to break through the 10-million mark. The new targets could allow Toyota to win back its standing as the world's largest automaker; in the first six months of 2012, Toyota has been leading General Motors by 300,000 units.
Honda said on Tuesday that its quarterly profit rose as well, quadrupling to 131.7 billion yen. But Nissan said on July 26 that its net profit had slipped 15 percent, to 72.3 billion yen, from 85 billion yen a year earlier, partly because it was the least affected of Japan's Big Three in the disasters last year and had the least ground to gain back.
Reflecting uncertainties ahead, all three companies have modest forecasts for the year. Despite the strong first-quarter showing, Toyota said it would leave its annual profit forecast unchanged at 760 billion yen on 22 trillion yen in sales.
''The latest numbers are not necessarily reflective of our true strength,'' Takahiko Ijichi, senior managing officer, said in Tokyo. Continued turmoil in Europe, a slowdown in emerging markets like China and a still-strong yen clouded Toyota's outlook, he said. ''There are various risks, so we feel it is necessary to remain cautious,'' Mr. Ijichi said.
Still, the robust earnings and global clout of Japan's automakers are providing some comfort to a country that has seen its consumer electronics companies slammed by foreign competition.
''At a time when other manufacturers are struggling, like Sharp, Toshiba and Sony, the automakers are giving markets relief,'' said Koichi Sugimoto, an analyst based in Tokyo for BNP Paribas.
In some ways, swift recovery in the tsunami's aftermath has proved the resilience of Japanese manufacturing, he said. Automakers here made concerted efforts to patch up supply lines, dispatching workers to crucial parts makers to help them start production ahead of schedule.
And after four years in the doldrums, the North American market is finally rebounding, helping to pick up some of the slack posed by a slowdown in some emerging markets. Honda, in particular, is set to release a revamped version of its popular Accord sedan in September, which should improve sales. Nissan too, introduced a new Altima sedan last month.
United States sales at all three automakers accelerated in July, with Honda posting an increase of 45 percent from a year earlier. Sales rose 26 percent at Toyota, and 16 percent at Nissan.
Japanese automakers face an especially welcome opening in the United States market at a time when their rivals in South Korea, led by Hyundai, have no imminent new models. Hyundai made the largest gains in the United States as Japanese automakers retrenched last year.
''The Koreans have really narrowed the gap with Japanese automakers in the U.S. market, but this year, there's a big chance for the Japanese,'' said Hiroshi Kuriu, a senior investment analyst at Manulife Asset Management. ''There was nothing but bad luck for Japanese automakers over the past few years, but they're finally on an upswing.''
The Japanese are also fighting to reassert their dominance in fuel-efficient cars, after a flurry of gas-electric hybrid and fully electric challengers from rivals like Ford and General Motors were introduced. Moreover, two factors have taken the momentum away from models like the Prius, Toyota's flagship hybrid car, experts say. Advances in the fuel efficiency of conventional gasoline engine cars, and relatively stable fuel prices make Prius's price premium harder to justify.
Mr. Ijichi of Toyota said the company had few options but to shore up profit by cutting costs further, selling a better mix of more expensive cars and in some cases, moving more production overseas.

HEADLINE: A Financial Plan For the Truly Fed Up

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
Twitter: @ronlieber

 BODY:
The deck is stacked. The game is rigged. The system is unmanageable.
With each passing scandal, it gets a little bit harder to ignore this refrain from individuals who have had it with traditional financial services companies. Perhaps it's because the unfortunate events seem to be happening with increasing frequency.
This week, the funky trading programs at Knight Capital sent many stock prices scattering. While most individual investors were not hurt, the company, a major player in stock trading, is reeling.
The breakdown at Knight comes on the heels of -- well, take your pick. The trading debacle at JPMorgan? The Libor-fixing scandal? The Facebook initial public offering? The customer restitution that Capital One is paying for what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said was deceptive credit card marketing? 
It's enough to give credence to the people who want nothing to do with the profit-making players of the American financial system.
I've heard from some of them of late, and they are not fringe characters living in fantasy land. They know they need to continue to save 15 percent or more of their income and invest it in something that earns a reasonable rate of return if they're going to have any hope of retiring. But they don't want to own stocks or do business with traditional financial players to achieve their goals.
Are they crazy even to try? This week, I took up the challenge of creating a financial plan for people like this -- including the beginnings of a model investment portfolio -- to see if such a goal was even remotely possible.
STORING YOUR MONEY It all starts with your day-to-day cash flow, so for a checking account, the opt-outters will want to do business with a credit union.
As for investments (and we'll get to the specifics in a moment), store them in a brokerage firm at Vanguard, USAA or TIAA-CREF, all of which are member-owned or use profits to pay dividends to customers and lower their fees.
If your employer matches any money that you save for retirement, don't turn that down out of spite for the for-profit firm that may be administering the 401(k). Keep that savings in cash if you must, but save enough to get that match.
BONDS Just because you're trying to avoid investing with, or in, for-profit entities doesn't mean you ought to sit out the bond market.
Consider municipal bonds, which help pay for roads and schools and other local or regional projects. ''You're basically investing in your community,'' said Doug Wheat, a financial planner with Family Wealth Management in Holyoke, Mass. ''Which is one of the main tenets of being a socially responsible investor.''
Vanguard's Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund has averaged a 6.23 percent annual return over its 35 years of existence. That's no guarantee of long-term future performance in a world where interest rates may rise and cities are going bankrupt, but at least you can sell it if you need the money or wish to reallocate your portfolio for whatever reason.
Then there's a curious mutual fund offering called the CRA Qualified Investment Fund. (You'll want to look for the one that trades under the symbol CRATX.) CRA stands for Community Reinvestment Act, and the bonds it holds help banks (who buy their own shares of the CRA Qualified fund) fulfill the requirements that the act lays out.
The banks can meet the rules in part by investing a certain amount of money in affordable housing and community services for low- or moderate-income individuals, small businesses and distressed or underserved areas.
Banks now use this fund to help stay on the right side of the rules, and since 2007, individual investors have been able to as well. The annualized performance (including returns from before individual investors could play along) has been 5.16 percent.
REAL ESTATE Owning property and renting it to farmers, businesses or individuals can be a fine long-term strategy, though timing is everything, as we learned in the middle of the last decade.
But there is plenty about real estate that is nothing like owning stocks, starting with the time it takes to research a purchase. ''It's like being a vegan,'' said Michelle Maton, a financial planner with Aequus Wealth Management Resources in Chicago. ''You have to educate yourself if you're going to make that choice.'' After all, there is no Morningstar for buildings that are up for sale.
There are a few other things that make real estate at least as risky as owning stocks, even if you may feel better about the underlying asset. It's not particularly liquid, so you'd better be sure you won't need to sell quickly. The time it will take you to manage the property counts for something. Then, there are the usual tenant nonpayment and vacancy risks, plus the possibility of permanent economic decline in your region.
There is one upside: If you buy in middle age, you may pay off the mortgage just as your other savings are running out 10 or 15 years after retirement. At that point, the rental income becomes sort of an annuity.
PEER-TO-PEER LENDING In early 2011, I expressed wariness about relatively new services like Lending Club and Prosper that allow individuals to invest money in loans that other people take out. Since then, however, the services have been humming along quite nicely, delivering returns of roughly 7 percent to investors who spread their money in small bits among hundreds of loans to the most creditworthy borrowers.
Alas, regulatory hurdles prevent the companies from taking your money in some states, including Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan and Massachusetts, though residents of New York, California, Illinois and Connecticut are free to try their luck. There are other eligibility requirements, too, based on income or net worth; check the company's Web sites for more detail.
The beauty of this investment is that the two sites exist in large part to undermine big banks. At Prosper, 46 percent of recent loans were to people who were consolidating debt from elsewhere (often from credit cards), while at Lending Club, debt consolidation and paying off higher-interest credit cards account for just over 70 percent of all loans since inception.
SLOW MONEY One emerging wild card is the Slow Money movement, a cousin to the Slow Food approach to more sustainable edibles. It helps connect food producers of various sorts with nearby people who want to invest in them somehow. It's a little like bond investing, a little like real estate investing and a little like the peer-to-peer approach.
''Let's just take some of our money and invest it near where we live in things we understand, starting with food,'' as the movement's founder, Woody Tasch, puts it. He describes returns as being in the ''lowish single digits,'' ranging from roughly 3 percent to a few percentage points higher.
Jennifer Lazarus, a financial planner in Durham, N.C., and a Slow Money investor herself, said she realized that this wasn't an attractive enough return for many people. She is meeting next week with a local accountant, farmer and lawyer to discuss ways to appeal to more investors. ''There is a desire and absolutely a need,'' she said.
Higher returns mean higher risk, however, and Mr. Tasch was quick to acknowledge the concentrated bet that Slow Money investors make in any given project. ''Some people have opined that this is high-risk, low-return investing,'' he said. ''But the next question is, risky compared to what?''
That's the right question. Yet it's utterly unanswerable. For people who find most for-profit companies repulsive or who can't sleep because of fears about their stock market holdings, there is real mental health risk to investing in stocks.
But these alternatives are subject to large diversification and liquidity risks and don't all have long-term track records.
''It is hard to be pure in this world,'' said Mr. Wheat, the financial planner, who has helped many socially conscious investing clients. ''People may not like buying gas for their car, but they usually end up doing that anyway. They may want to think about it in the same way, from an investment standpoint.''
At the least, ultra-alternative investors need to consider the possibility that a swing of just a percentage point in a portfolio's average annual return can add up to hundreds of thousands of lost dollars over decades.
Perhaps that's fine with you. But before you make a risky bet on a portfolio that looks anything like the one I laid out above, think about whether you're prepared to save even more, spend less and work several years longer to make up for any shortfall in returns.
That may be the best way to figure out whether your principles are truly priceless.

HEADLINE: Ignored in America, Racewalking Is Revered to the South

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
LONDON -- Eider Arevalo is just 19, but he lives in a comfortable apartment in Bogota, Colombia. With a monthly income of about $2,500, he earns about twice as much as his father, a construction worker in Pitalito, 233 miles to the south. Arevalo's ticket to a better life has been racewalking.
''I am trying to improve myself because racewalking can open doors for me,'' Arevalo, the reigning world junior champion, said a few days before he was to compete in the men's Olympic 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) racewalk Saturday. ''You can live like a normal person, though I have to make many sacrifices.'' 
Mocked and misunderstood by outsiders, and largely an afterthought even in the world of track and field, racewalking is a serious pursuit in many parts of Latin America. Races are shown on television, high-profile coaches are recruited, and athletes are turned on to the sport at a young age.
From Mexico to Ecuador, the sport brings athletic as well as economic opportunity. Unlike, say, cycling, racewalking requires almost no equipment, and it can be done on city streets or mountain roads any time of year, and athletes can train alone or in groups.
The sport can also lift athletes out of hardship because of generous stipends and rewards that governments, athletic federations and wealthy fans often shower on up-and-comers and medal winners. Champions have become politicians and prominent businessmen, and they remain national heroes well after their retirements. For nations like Guatemala, racewalking may also be the best chance to win an elusive Olympic medal.
''Racewalking is safe, very cheap, requires no track, just time,'' said Cesar Moreno Bravo, who leads the racewalking working group at the International Association of Athletics Federations. ''Even if Latin American countries don't have the resources, they have the passion.''
The Russians have dominated the sport for decades, funneling millions of dollars into developing athletes and winning titles. Racewalking meets in cities like Saransk draw tens of thousands of fans. Valeriy Borchin, the reigning Olympic and world champion, is one of the favorites in the men's 20-kilometer race, which will be held on a two-kilometer loop near Buckingham Palace.
China and Italy will be well represented, but so will Latin America. In addition to Arevalo, the Colombian team includes James Rendon and Luis Fernando Lopez, who finished third behind Borchin and his Russian countryman Vladimir Kanaykin at the world championships in 2011. Guatemala, still searching for its first Olympic medal in any sport, is pinning its hopes on Erick Barrondo, a gold medalist at the last Pan American Games.
Colombia and Guatemala, among others, also have contenders in the men's 50-kilometer and the women's 20-kilometer races, which will be held Aug. 11.
For walkers raised on Central American farms and in Andean hill towns, the races are the culmination of long years of sacrifice. Some racewalkers started with hand-me-down sneakers and have had to stop training to return to factory jobs so they could support their families. An Olympic medal would provide them with almost unimaginable stability.
''If someone won a medal, they would improve their economic prospects,'' said Luis Rodriguez, a technical adviser to the Guatemalan Olympic team. ''It would be something that we can showcase to show that if you work hard and are disciplined, you can achieve great things.''
Latin American racewalkers have plenty of role models. Julio Rene Martinez, who set a world record in the 20 kilometers in 1999, has inspired Guatemalans. The biggest star, though, is Jefferson Perez, who won Ecuador's first-ever Olympic medal, a gold in the 20 kilometers in 1996. (He was given a parade on his return home.) A three-time world champion, Perez is the Michael Jordan of Ecuador, news wherever he goes. Now retired, he preaches the virtues of sport. Arevalo of Colombia followed Perez from the time he started racewalking when he was 11.
''Perez inspired people around Latin America,'' said Enrique Pena, who coached him before becoming the Colombian racewalking coach this year.
A competitive racewalker in the 1970s, Enrique Pena was around when the sport first caught on in Latin America. In the years before the Olympic Games in 1968, Mexico recruited coaches from around the world to improve the host country's medal chances. One of them was Jerzy Hausleber, a young Pole who liked to walk long distances. He saw an opportunity for medals in racewalking, a sport then dominated by Europeans.
The roots of the sport date to late-18th-century England, when footmen who walked astride the carriages of their aristocratic bosses began to travel the country like prizefighters taking up challenges. Their long-distance walking feats become known as pedestrianism.
As with other sports, the English codified pedestrianism by introducing the ''fair heel to toe'' rule and the imperative that the leg be fully straightened, cornerstones of modern racewalking. Various forms of racewalking have been in the Olympics since 1908.
The leading English and Europeans were typically tall men with long strides. Not unlike Dick Fosbury and his high-jumping flop, Hausleber revolutionized the sport by looking for walkers with a lower center of gravity and quicker leg speed facilitated by more hip movement, which led to a bounce in their step known as floating. Training at high elevations in Mexico also helped build endurance.
The strategy paid immediate dividends. In 1968, Jose Pedraza won the 20-kilometer silver medal, Mexico's first medal in track and field, in front of an adoring home crowd. Mexican racewalkers have won nine men's Olympic medals over all.
''Hausleber was an innovator by improving the speed and changing the old mentality of our sport,'' said Maurizio Damilano, who won three Olympic racewalking medals for Italy in the 1980s.
Suspicion followed. Older racewalkers assumed rules were being broken, and judges had to grapple with the new style. But the sport coalesced around the new style over the next decade, and Damilano and other younger racers flocked to Mexico to study with Hausleber.
''Floating used to be bad; now it's good,'' said Gary Westerfield, an international racewalking judge and coach.
The success of Hausleber's Mexican racewalkers was noticed throughout Latin America, where smaller nations want to share the spoils. ''There's a lot of jealousy politically,'' said Tim Seaman, one of America's leading racewalkers. ''The Guatemalans don't want Mexico to be the big country, and El Salvador wants to be there, too.''

HEADLINE: A Gallery Atypical To Its End

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
How long can an art gallery that has no regular hours, no staff, no windows, no air-conditioning and -- perhaps more relevant to the question at hand -- pays no rent remain open in the heart of Chelsea, one block from behemoths like the Pace Gallery and Gagosian?
The answer in today's art world, with today's High Line-spiked Chelsea real estate prices, should be that such a place does not have the slightest possibility of existing. But the correct answer, as it turns out, is 4 years 7 months 15 days, give or take a hiatus or two, and counting on everything going well until the end of September. 
That is when Honey Space, one of the city's strangest art establishments, will officially be no more, ending what Tom Beale, a sculptor who opened the space in February 2008 in a ramshackle warehouse along the West Side Highway, liked to describe as an artist-run, unattended no-profit gallery (nonprofit being far too formal), the kind that otherwise hasn't existed in Manhattan for decades.
Mr. Beale moved into the building from Bushwick, Brooklyn, in 2007 -- swimming against the tide of most young artists looking for affordable space -- when the four-story warehouse was opened as an experimental artists' cooperative called Emergency Arts. That plan fell apart. But Mr. Beale stayed on, earning a free ground-floor studio space by serving as the building's carpenter, salvage man, plumber and all-around concierge after Alf Naman, a developer who controls the property, hatched a plan to make the building temporarily into a rough-hewed event space with inexpensive rental studios for artists.
''When I first came in, they told me, 'Just go tape off your space,' '' Mr. Beale, now 34, recalled. ''And so I took this ridiculous amount of space for myself, right on the street in Chelsea, which I didn't deserve at all. And I knew that somebody was going to figure it out pretty soon and take it back.''
But then, in the summer of 2008, a funny thing happened: The economy fell off the cliff, and plans for demolishing the warehouse to develop the site commercially went onto a slow track. The building, on West 21st Street, quickly filled up with artists -- some well known, like Iona Rozeal Brown and the street artist Swoon -- and became a kind of creaky, dusty small town, with a town square in the form of a second-floor kitchen and dining hall that Mr. Beale fitted out with scrap lumber he scavenged from the building and the streets.
With so much room on the ground floor, Mr. Beale said, he decided he would regret it for the rest of his life if he didn't try to turn at least part of it into a gallery space for young artists he liked.
So in the winter of 2008, with not much more than drywall and money of his own to upgrade the electricity, he opened his first show, of paintings on Masonite by Adam Stanforth, a friend. The space had no sign and, through its existence, usually no door, except for a roll-up security gate that went up in the morning and down at night. One morning shortly after the opening, it was so cold inside the gallery that a reporter's fingers froze up, and he had trouble taking notes.
Just off the gallery was a crumbling old kitchen and, hidden past it, a darkened, '70s-inflected grotto and underground swimming pool, long dry. (Some thought the grotto was what remained of a sex club or a Mafia hangout.)The gallery's existence was never better than precarious. Mr. Naman told Mr. Beale several times that he would have to vacate the space. ''I always listened to the tense of his words rather than the meaning: 'You will have to leave.' At some point, but not this minute,'' Mr. Beale recalled in the building last week, eating lunch with Mr. Naman, who smiled intently and said little.
Mr. Beale continued to put on shows, which never got much attention in the art press but drew admiring crowds. Swoon created a work in a rubble-filled hole beneath the gallery's floor, a paper portrait of a 17-year-old girl murdered in Juarez, Mexico, in 1995. (The portrait, eerily eroded by moisture and mold, is still inside the hole, whose entrance is now concealed by a large metal plate.)
Tora Lopez and Rya Kleinpeter staged a surreal participatory burlesque performance. John Wells, an eccentric painter who came to have a studio in the building after years of wanderings through other unconventional working locales -- the Chelsea Hotel, for one -- did a show of scroll paintings in 2009 that remained up for months, most days with no one supervising the space.
''The only thing that was stolen was a pot of marigolds,'' Mr. Wells, who has also served as the building's resident chef, said proudly.
Over the recent lunch, which Mr. Wells cooked (''Our last suppers,'' he intoned gravely), Mr. Beale said he still had not made up his mind where he will go or what he will do after the building is vacated on Sept. 30, to prepare for demolition and an eventual residential development. He said he hoped he would be able to have one last show, of his own work, before the end, but permission has not been forthcoming.
''Basically,'' he said, ''we're all about to have a pretty rude awakening.''
Mr. Wells added, ''We try hard not to think about it.''
Ms. Lopez completed the thought: ''We're in total denial.''
Mr. Beale never envisioned himself running a gallery, he said, and if he ever does again, it will most certainly not be in Chelsea. ''Just because of where we were, that this crazy thing happened here, it became a kind of artwork unto itself,'' he said. ''It lasted longer than any of us thought it would.''

HEADLINE: Bread Is Staple As Syria Rebels Press Strategy

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; An employee of The New York Times reported from Aleppo, and Damien Cave from Beirut, Lebanon. Dalal Mawad and Hawaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut.

 BODY:
ALEPPO, Syria -- Just before sunrise, a select group of Syrian rebel fighters steps away from the front lines here for a task their commanders now consider a vital and urgent part of the war effort: baking bread.
The floppy moons that they produce, pita to Americans, usually go quickly to hungry residents and rebels. Bread is a mainstay of the Syrian diet -- it accompanies every meal -- and in a city paralyzed by two weeks of war, the bakery lines show that basic commerce has become a battleground of its own.
''The regime has tried to deprive our supporters of water and gas, and now they are using bread,'' said Basheer al-Hajeh, a member of Al Tawheed Brigade, one of the main rebel militias in Aleppo. But he said the rebels had learned how to fight back against the government's attempts to keep bread and other resources out of opposition-controlled areas.
''We took control of the wheat warehouses in Aleppo's suburbs,'' he said. ''We have many of them, in several areas, and they might keep us supplied for weeks.'' 
The struggle to keep bakeries operating is part of a much larger fight over the Syrian economy, especially in Aleppo, the country's commercial hub and its largest city. As the government of President Bashar al-Assad tries to project an image of normalcy, denying reports of runaway inflation, rebels say they are finding new ways to attract support from the business class and siphon off government resources.
Kamal Hamdan, a Lebanese economist who has worked extensively in Syria, said both sides were engaged in efforts to replace the peacetime economy with wartime alternatives.
''They are expecting a civil war that will take a long time and you have to sustain the daily life of the areas you are controlling,'' he said. ''It's part of the game.''
The government has a clear advantage. Its Central Bank reported foreign currency assets of about $17 billion, one month after the conflict started. According to an investment consultant in the capital, Damascus, the government now appears to be asking Russia for loans to continue propping up the economy. Many analysts also suspect that the Syrians have found a way to sell oil, despite sanctions from Europe.
But after 17 months of conflict, the opposition is becoming more and more creative. In Damascus, for example, activists say there are merchants that pretend to support Mr. Assad, only to funnel government-supplied cooking fuel, gasoline, bread and water to the other side.
''We ask them not to defect,'' said Moaz, an opposition activist in Damascus. ''They will be rewarded later.'' Like others interviewed, he would not give his full name for fear of retribution.
Rebels are also managing to create supply chains that route around government-controlled areas with the help of private businesses. In interviews, rebel commanders and opposition activists declined to name their corporate supporters, or to discuss assistance from countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, but they said the homegrown assistance came in many forms.
In some cases, merchants donate money. In others, they said, business owners support the families of rebel fighters or opposition supporters, in one case 50 families at once. And especially in Aleppo this week, more immediate acts of generosity have emerged, with fresh food suddenly appearing for those in need.
One woman, a dentist who supports the opposition, said she recently helped distribute plates of schwarma, a local grilled meat dish, to 900 displaced people in five schools near a contested area of southwest Aleppo.
As is often the case in war, food has become almost as important as bullets. Aleppo has grown especially desperate. Several videos posted online now refer to a food crisis, and some confirm that bakeries there have become opposition outposts, with long, loud lines snaking around corners as armed rebels keep order, telling customers that they are only paying what is needed to cover bakery expenses.
Abu Mohammed, a rebel baker in eastern Aleppo, said that skirmishes sometimes break out among customers, especially when there is not enough to go around. But his squad -- seven to nine rebels baking and distributing bread -- try to feed who they can and make sure no one gets preferential treatment, he said.
Mr. Hajeh, the militia member and a spokesman for the main rebel unit in Aleppo, said that top leaders have already appointed someone to run all the city's rebel-controlled bakeries, arranging grain deliveries and baker schedules. There is now at least one rebel-run bakery in every neighborhood of rebel control, he said. Usually, there are two or three.
''What we do is open the bakery with the owners' consent and our own people bake the bread,'' he said.
Other basic needs have been harder to manage. The rebels said they provide water to some areas, filling tanker trucks from wells outside the city, but milk is essentially unavailable. Gas prices have tripled to about $11 per gallon. Diesel prices and the cost of cooking fuel have skyrocketed, according to residents and black market sellers, while vegetable prices have also spiked.
Cucumber prices have more than doubled. ''We try and help with other goods, but we don't have a lot of capacity,'' Mr. Hajeh said.
Major businesses in Aleppo are suffering as well. Mr. Hamdan, the Lebanese economist, said that Aleppo usually accounted for about 30 percent of Syria's gross domestic product, slightly less than Damascus. But these days in Aleppo trade has essentially come to a standstill.
Several factory owners said in interviews that their exports have dropped to practically nothing. Abu Abdu, 60, who owns a textile factory in Aleppo with about 55 employees, said 2011 was his worst year in five decades of business. And 2012, he said, will probably be worse.
A garrulous Sunni who began working in his father's factory as a teenager, he said his own views on the conflict have changed with his fortunes. Like many other merchants, he described himself as apolitical, so when the unrest started, the future seemed headed for a version of the past: in the 1980s, the government of Mr. Assad's father violently crushed an Islamist revolt in Syria, killing thousands of people.
But over time, he said he has begun to question the government's strength. ''In the 1980s, no one in the country or the world knew what was going on with the military crackdown, but today the media and satellite channels are broadcasting and showing the live photos of the military operations,'' he said.
As a result, he said, the rebels have been tougher to portray as defeated. ''President Bashar al-Assad made big promises that everything will be finished in days, then in weeks, then in months,'' he said. ''But today, here we are after a year and half and we see and hear the same false words and statements.''
Other upper- and middle-class residents described similar conversions. Many residents of Aleppo now say Mr. Assad's enemies will multiply every day he keeps up the fight, creating more unemployment, more displacement and more hunger in a city whose business is business.
''I was supporting him because I was looking to him as a moderate, secular and liberal leader, but that was until I saw his crimes in Dara'a, Homs, Hama, Dier al-Zour and now in my city, and against my relatives,'' said Abu Fadi, 45, who owns a failing travel agency in Aleppo.
''With his crimes,'' Mr. Fadi said, ''he is buying a one-way ticket out of the country.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Embrace Once Pejorative 'Obamacare' Tag

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
LEESBURG, Va. -- As thousands of people gathered on a sweltering night outside a local high school draped with flags and bunting, the speaker talked about the president's controversial health program. ''That's why he passed Obamacare!'' she declared.
There it was, the derogatory term critics invented for President Obama's health law, more properly known as the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Republicans long ago successfully pasted the president's name on the program to deride it as a big-government boondoggle. But now an unlikely group has adopted the moniker: Democrats. 
The speaker here in Virginia the other night, introducing Mr. Obama at a campaign rally, was not using the term as an insult. And she was not the only one to do that lately. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used the word in a recent fund-raising e-mail. Even Mr. Obama has been picking up the term, reinterpreting the meaning of Obamacare.
''You know what?'' he told a crowd of supporters in Texas recently. ''They're right. I do care.''
Whether Democrats can change a pejorative into a positive is unclear, but after three years on the defensive, they have resigned themselves to the fact that ''Obamacare'' has become the popular name for the sweeping social program, and they are trying to spin it in their direction. Particularly since the Supreme Court upheld the law's constitutionality, Mr. Obama and his allies have tried to take ownership of the term.
''The right created it and spits it out as an epithet; it has that tone, a sneering quality like they're hanging it around his neck,'' said Jeff Shesol, a former White House speechwriter under President Bill Clinton. ''But it has so taken hold, it reached that level of saturation that it's very difficult for Obama or the Democrats to escape it. So why not then try to appropriate it?''
Some of those on the other side have been surprised at how the term has become the de facto name of the program.
''I never thought it would stick,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist who was among those who encouraged its use in the early days. ''People want health care personalized, not politicized, and the phrase Obamacare is an effective way to communicate the politicization of health care.''
Critics have often found catchy phrases to brand programs they opposed, from the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal to Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society, but they did not generally use the president's name as part of it. During Johnson's presidency, critics labeled Medicare ''socialized medicine.''
''That was enough to make it intrinsically un-American for many in the growing conservative movement,'' said Mark K. Updegrove, director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum.
By the 1980s, though, that had changed. Ronald Reagan's program of tax cutting and military spending was labeled Reaganomics as if to emphasize its difference from mainstream economics, but his supporters came to embrace the term. Same with Clintonomics during the 1990s. Still, Hillarycare, like Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care program itself, never was seen as a positive.
The tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush had no such shorthand name, but there is a reason Democrats even now never speak of them without calling them ''the Bush tax cuts.'' Mr. Bush himself expressed regret about that this spring amid the latest debate over whether to keep them in place, recognizing that his name made them a political target and therefore less likely to be renewed. ''I wish they weren't called the Bush tax cuts,'' he said.
The expression Obamacare first was used in early 2007, according to research by Elspeth Reeve at The Atlantic magazine, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. The first use of it by a political figure she found was actually in September 2007 by none other than former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, the Republican then as now running for president.
At the time, Mr. Romney was arguing for more incremental changes in the health care system to avoid what he saw as the more radical approach of the Democrats. ''It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare or whatever you want to call it,'' he said.
After the law passed in early 2010, the phrase took off as a conservative label, particularly in that year's midterm elections as Republicans running against the program captured the House and increased their numbers in the Senate.
By the summer of 2011, Mr. Obama made his first attempt to appropriate the term. ''I have no problem with folks saying Obamacares,'' he said on a Midwest bus tour, adding the s. ''I do care.''
But that did not last. Democrats continued to complain when the news media used the term and tried to stop House Republicans from using it in their official correspondence with constituents because they said it violated rules against partisan letters.
As this year's campaign has intensified, though, Democrats seem to have adopted it more and more. Mr. Obama has used the term at least four times in the last two months. Mr. Biden in a fund-raising e-mail urged donations because Mr. Romney ''wants to repeal Obamacare.'' The campaign's online merchandise store sells ''I Like Obamacare'' bumper stickers, buttons and T-shirts.
Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, said there was no particular decision to embrace the term, but it happened organically once Mr. Obama himself started using it. ''We describe health reform in many ways but we certainly don't run from the term Obamacare,'' he said. ''It's an accomplishment the president's proud of and talks about in nearly every speech.''

HEADLINE: For the President, A Birthday Party With a Price Tag

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
President Obama is turning 51 on Saturday, with just three months until Election Day. So he will celebrate in true political fashion: spending ''downtime,'' as an e-mail invitation put it, at a party at his Chicago home with a bunch of strangers who made campaign donations to be there.
That party, on Aug. 12, will mark another milestone in the transformation of the president and his wife, who once tried to limit the role of politics in their lives and now seem to be increasingly giving themselves over to it. Even some longtime Obama fund-raisers expressed surprise over the party's site: the Obamas have limited their schmoozing hours in Washington, sequester themselves while on vacation and seldom invite many outsiders into the White House living quarters. Until now, they have kept their Chicago home mostly sacrosanct, allowing only limited photographs of the interior. 
The party raises questions about how far the Obamas will go in mortgaging their personal appeal for political gain in the months ahead. In poll after poll, voters give Mr. Obama higher marks as a person -- a trustworthy leader, a committed father -- than as a steward of the economy. Aside from their house, how much of themselves are the Obamas willing to offer up?
Consider the shift in Mr. Obama's birthday celebrations since he arrived in office in 2009. That year, with re-election still distant, Michelle Obama gave him an entirely private surprise party at Camp David, Md., with a few old friends. His 2010 party was splashier, a basketball tournament that made news because of the professional and college stars who played.
A year later, he celebrated his 50th birthday with a fund-raising gala at Chicago's Aragon Ballroom, where Jennifer Hudson sang ''Happy Birthday.'' To scrape up extra dollars, the Obama campaign sold commemorative birthday merchandise, including party hats. Even the private party he gave at the White House mixed old friends with allies who might assist in his re-election fight, like Tom Hanks and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
Every year, some Obama supporters have gathered all over the country to ''celebrate'' his birthday -- that is, to share his message and sign up converts. But in the coming days, they will hold no fewer than 1,000 birthday-themed events, from North Carolina (knocking on 51 doors) to California (calling 51 voters).
Birthday fund-raisers are a familiar tactic that may have reached an apotheosis in 1962, when Marilyn Monroe sang to President John F. Kennedy at a Madison Square Garden rally attended by 15,000 people and broadcast on television. In 1996, President Bill Clinton filled Radio City Music Hall for a 50th-birthday fund-raiser that brought in $10 million.
But the one at the Obamas' home will have a specific 2012 spin, reflecting the illusion of intimacy on which campaigns now thrive. In recent years, win-a-visit-with-Barack (or Mitt or Ann or Joe, or Sarah Jessica Parker or Marc Anthony) sweepstakes have become a signal fund-raising tactic for both sides. A recent Obama event at George Clooney's home demonstrates why: The campaign collected $15 million, according to organizers. Less than half of that came from the Hollywood types who paid $40,000 a ticket; the rest came from a sea of supporters who made small donations and entered an online contest to win seats.
The formula has proved so lucrative that Mitt Romney's campaign advertised the chance to be introduced to Mr. Romney and his vice-presidential nominee: a contest to meet a political partner who does not yet exist. Aside from harvesting new e-mail addresses, the contests allow the campaigns to ''drive their small-dollar contributions off their big-donor contributions,'' said Anthony Corrado, a campaign finance expert at Colby College.
Months after winning the Clooney contest, Karen Blutcher, 45, a communications manager for a utility company in St. Augustine, Fla., still sounded thunderstruck that she had met the president and mingled with stars. ''The entire event was a lifelong memory,'' she said in an interview.
A warning to this month's lucky winner: The celebration at the Obama home will be considerably less cozy than the e-mailed invitations suggest. The event is not a social gathering; it is one of four fund-raisers that Mr. Obama will race through that day in Chicago. Despite a gracious invitation that the first lady e-mailed to supporters, she is not planning to attend, a campaign official said.
Donors may dream of tinkling the keys on the family piano or leafing through private photos, but much of the action will take place in the backyard. The finalists will be chosen at random, but the contest winners will be selected as reality show contestants are, to make sure their stories fit. (Ms. Blutcher comes from a hotly contested state and supports Mr. Obama's health care overhaul because she has a son with special needs.)
Even the promise of being allowed in the Obamas' house is a bit of a mirage: the first family rarely spends nights there anymore, and many Chicago friends predict they will never move back in.
Also -- and the campaign does not play up this bit of fine print -- but charging money to enter contests is illegal. So the legions of contestants who reached into their own pockets may not know it, but they could have entered free.

HEADLINE: Reid Has Long History Of Going After Romney

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Harry Reid's decision this week to hurl a taunting, unsubstantiated accusation at Mitt Romney is hardly out of character for the cantankerous Democratic leader of the Senate, who revels in provocative comments and once called Mr. Romney ''kind of a joke.''
On a personal level, Mr. Reid has long been publicly contemptuous of Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee and a fellow Mormon. In 2008, he said Mr. Romney would have been ''a tremendous drag'' on the Republican ticket. Last year, he said Mr. Romney ''doesn't stand for anything.'' And in the last month, he has said that Mr. Romney could not be confirmed as a dogcatcher or a cabinet secretary.
But Mr. Reid's latest series of tart-tongued volleys -- in which he cited an unnamed source who claims Mr. Romney has not paid taxes for a decade -- have generated more than the usual outrage from his Republican colleagues and from Mr. Romney himself, who on Friday spent a second day condemning the remarks. 
''Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up,'' Mr. Romney said as he campaigned in Mr. Reid's home state, north of Las Vegas. ''I have paid taxes every year, and a lot of taxes, a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong, and that's why I'm so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who have put this forward.''
The testy exchange between the two men is the latest manifestation of the broader Democratic strategy to highlight Mr. Romney's wealth and offshore accounts as the party's leaders seek to disqualify him in the eyes of middle-class voters. The Republican candidate has refused to release more than two years of his tax returns, prompting sarcastic television ads from President Obama and his allies.
The outcome of the Democratic strategy could hinge on its ability to keep the pressure on Mr. Romney. In a statement Friday, Mr. Reid, who has provided no evidence to back up his assertions, said that Mr. Romney's message to Nevada voters was: ''He won't release his taxes, but he wants to raise yours.''
Mr. Romney accused Mr. Reid of trying to deflect attention from Friday's jobs report, in which the unemployment rate increased to 8.3 percent. And he said he believed Mr. Reid was in cahoots with Mr. Obama's White House.
''I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign,'' Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Reid and Mr. Romney share a common faith and deep connections to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But Mr. Reid's attacks do not appear to be driven by any private history between them, and Mr. Reid has repeatedly said he does not know Mr. Romney.
''I've never met the man. I'm sure he's a nice person,'' he told Charlie Rose in a 2007 interview.
Instead, Mr. Reid appears to be once again reprising a rhetorical technique he has mastered over 25 years in the Senate: repeatedly needling his Republican adversaries in ways that often push the boundaries of political propriety.
During the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Reid repeatedly taunted Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, saying he should show leadership. He was quoted in a Las Vegas newspaper saying, ''I can't stand John McCain.''
In 2005, Mr. Reid said of President George W. Bush: ''This guy is a loser.'' He later apologized for that remark, but stood by another claim that Mr. Bush had been ''a liar'' while in office.
Mr. Reid called Senator Bill Frist, the Republican leader from 2003 to 2007, ''amateurish,'' and said in 2007 that Gen. Peter Pace, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was ''incompetent.'' Mr. Reid once said that Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, was ''one of the biggest political hacks we have in Washington.''
Coming to Mr. Romney's defense, Mr. McCain accused Mr. Reid on Thursday of sometimes displaying ''rather erratic behavior'' and said, ''Harry might've gone over the line here.'' And on Friday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Mr. Reid had once again used the Senate ''as a forum for his baseless accusations.''
''Frankly, it's beneath the dignity of his office,'' Mr. McConnell said.
But in the Democratic offensive against Mr. Romney on taxes, Mr. Reid is only the tip of the spear as Democrats in the House and Senate use their offices to keep up the drumbeat about Mr. Romney's refusal to release more than two years of his tax returns.
Top Democrats in the House on Thursday mentioned Mr. Romney in a letter to Treasury and Labor Department officials on reports that tax-preferred retirement accounts, like individual retirement accounts, are sometimes misused as tax shelters for the rich.
Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, promised legislation in July mandating that presidential candidates release 10 years of tax returns, along with the location, value and economic purpose of all offshore bank accounts and investments.
That followed legislation introduced in late March by Senators Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, that would require members of Congress and candidates for federal office to include in their financial disclosure filings an accounting of any financial interest in a country considered a tax haven.
''It's a boxer's instinct,'' Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said on Friday afternoon. ''You find your opponent's weak spot, and until he finds a defense, you keep pounding it.''
Mr. Jentleson said that Mr. Reid has no intention of backing down from his comments. But the senator also has no intention of providing more information about his sources for the allegation.
''He's not making this up,'' Mr. Jentleson said. ''This is what he believed to be true based on the conversation he had.''
At his stop in Las Vegas, Mr. Romney addressed Mr. Reid directly, saying, ''So, Harry, who are your sources?'' and trying to shrug off the accusations as nothing more than political spin in an election year.
''By the way, Harry, I understand what you are trying to do here,'' Mr. Romney said, noting the increase in the unemployment rate. ''You are trying to deflect the fact that jobs numbers are bad.''

HEADLINE: Treasury to Cut Stake in A.I.G. To 55% in $5 Billion Share Sale

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The Treasury Department said on Friday that it expected to raise $5 billion from a sale of shares in the American International Group, cutting the government's stake in the company to 55 percent. 
The insurer, which received multiple bailouts under the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, intends to buy approximately $3 billion of the offering, which was priced by the Treasury at $30.50 a share, just below its closing price on Friday of $31.34 a share.
The closing price was more than 9 percent above the $28.72 needed for the government to break even on its investment in A.I.G.
The Obama administration has been unwinding its position in the politically unpopular bailout programs from the financial crisis. More than 300 small banks have yet to repay taxpayers.
The Treasury Department said it would sell 163.9 million shares of A.I.G.'s stock, reducing its holding to 55 percent from 61 percent.
The government hired Citigroup, Deutsche Bank Securities, Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan Securities and Morgan Stanley to coordinate the offering and said it expected to add other underwriters.

HEADLINE: Powerful Shaper of U.S. Rules Quits, Leaving Critics in Wake

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Annie Lowrey and Ian Urbina contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Cass R. Sunstein, who wielded enormous power as the White House overseer of federal regulation, came to Washington to test his theories of human behavior and economic efficiency in the laboratory of the federal government. Now he is departing with a record that left many business interests disappointed and environmental, health and consumer advocates even more unhappy.
Mr. Sunstein, 57, who projected an air of disheveled academic detachment while becoming one of the Obama administration's most provocative figures, announced Friday that he was leaving government to return to Harvard Law School.
Applying a cost-benefit analysis to his reviews of proposed rules, he said his goal was simply to make the nation's regulatory system ''as sensible as possible.'' 
His critics saw it differently.
''Cass Sunstein is the most well-connected and smartest guy who's ever held the job,'' said Rena Steinzor, president of the Center for Progressive Reform and a professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law. ''But he's also done untold damage.''
As administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, he reviewed the rules implementing President Obama's health care act and the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform law. He backed major environmental initiatives, including higher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks and new toxic emissions rules for power plants. He approved the revamping of the decades-old food pyramid (it is now a ''plate''), the tightening of salmonella rules for eggs and a crackdown on prison rape. He midwifed a deal between appliance manufacturers and the Department of Energy to make refrigerators more energy efficient.
A close friend of President Obama's from their days on the University of Chicago Law School faculty, Mr. Sunstein had his choice of high-profile positions in the administration. He opted for the obscure Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (familiarly known as OIRA, pronounced ''oh, Ira''), a unit of the White House Office of Management and Budget that reviews every regulation proposed by an executive branch agency.
Few proposed rules escaped his gaze or his editor's pen. Of the hundreds of regulations issued by the administration as of late last year, three-quarters were changed at OIRA, often at the urging of corporate interests, according to an analysis from the Center for Progressive Reform, a liberal-leaning group that monitors federal regulation. For rules from the Environmental Protection Agency, the figure was closer to 80 percent, the group found. In virtually every case, the rule was weakened, the group claimed.
Professor Steinzor cited Mr. Sunstein's role in the killing of the E.P.A.'s proposed tightening of the standard for ozone pollution, the indefinite delay of rules governing coal ash disposal and the withdrawal earlier this year of a proposed update of child agricultural labor standards.
Mr. Sunstein's recommendations carry extraordinary weight, White House officials said, but the ultimate decisions in those cases were made by the president, his senior political advisers or cabinet officers.
The White House offered no explanation for the timing of Mr. Sunstein's departure. He declined to comment for this article.
Under Mr. Sunstein, the Obama administration has issued fewer regulations at this point in the president's term than George W. Bush or Bill Clinton did. But compared with Mr. Bush's first term, the Obama administration has finalized roughly 30 more ''economically significant'' regulations -- those costing $100 million or more.
Mr. Sunstein emphasizes the economic benefits of the regulations he has vetted, saying the net benefits have exceeded $91 billion, a figure he says far surpasses the benefits of rules issued by previous administrations.
''Careful analysis of costs and benefits can help show when regulation is good, and when regulation isn't so good,'' he said in a recent interview. Any cost-benefit analysis, of course, includes subjective judgments about costs and difficult calculations, like the value of a human life.
These statistics can be misleading because the raw number of regulations an administration implements does not necessarily indicate whether the administration is more or less in favor of restraints on business.
Mr. Obama credited Mr. Sunstein with putting in place a regulatory system that protected Americans while eliminating ''tens of millions of hours of paperwork burdens'' for businesses and citizens.
''Cass has shown that it is possible to support economic growth without sacrificing health, safety and the environment,'' the president said in a statement on Friday.
In addition to reviewing proposed rules, Mr. Sunstein's office also conducted a ''look back'' at every regulation already on the books, with an eye toward slashing outdated rules and streamlining the system. The initiative has already started to bear fruit. Federal agencies have so far proposed 500 changes, with 100 enacted or close to being finalized.
Business lobbies and Republicans in Congress complain frequently about ''job-killing'' regulations, citing rules like the E.P.A.'s new standard for carbon emissions from power plants (recently upheld by a federal appeals court) and the Department of Labor's new worker-safety rules. But Mr. Sunstein won grudging praise from conservatives, who said he was more approachable and realistic about the costs of doing business than many top officials in federal agencies.
''Cass Sunstein appeared to recognize the harm overly burdensome regulations inflict on economic growth and job creation -- although he was not able to stop the tsunami of regulations enacted by the Obama administration,'' Representative Darrell Issa of California, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in a statement.
Over the past year, as the election neared, the issuance of new regulations slowed and many of them appeared to be designed to please business, or at least not alienate it.
Bill Kovacs, a senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said he was skeptical of the administration's motives but gratified nonetheless. ''It's probably the political season,'' he said. ''But I think we are hopeful that the administration is beginning to understand that the regulatory process has consequences.''
Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has accused Mr. Obama of causing business uncertainty and stifling economic growth through overzealous regulation. He promised to repeal the Obama-era regulatory laws and hold the cost of new regulations at zero.
The polymathic Mr. Sunstein has written or co-written dozens of books and articles on subjects ranging from climate change to animal rights and is one of the most frequently cited legal thinkers in America. One of his most influential popular works, written with Richard H. Thaler, the behavioral economist, was ''Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness.'' The book's thesis is that gentle, low-cost signals -- like putting fruit at the beginning rather than the end of a cafeteria line, or making participation in retirement savings plans the default position rather than an option -- are more effective than the heavy hand of government regulation.
In returning to Harvard Law School, Mr. Sunstein will direct the new Program on Behavioral Economics and Public Policy.
Mr. Sunstein's wife, Samantha Power, a Pulitzer Prize winner for her writing on genocide, also works at the White House, as a senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights. She said she still planned to return to the post after a maternity leave.
The White House said Boris Bershteyn, the budget office's general counsel, will serve as interim regulatory chief.

HEADLINE: Berkshire's Results Are Mixed In Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Second-quarter profit at Berkshire Hathaway fell 9 percent because of bigger paper losses on derivatives the company sold, but many of its subsidiaries performed well, the company said Friday. 
Berkshire said it had $3.1 billion in net income, or $1.25 per Class B share. That was down from last year's second-quarter net income of $3.4 billion, or $1.38 per Class B share. Last year's quarter was helped by a one-time gain of $1.25 billion.
The results topped the $1.19 a share Wall Street was expecting, according to a FactSet survey.
Berkshire's revenue grew slightly to $38.5 billion from $38.3 billion. Profit improved in Berkshire's insurance units. And business improved at Berkshire's utility, railroad, manufacturing and retail businesses.
Berkshire's chief executive, Warren E. Buffett, has said it is better to look at Berkshire earnings without the derivative losses and investment gains. He says Berkshire's investment and derivative gains or losses can be misleading because the company rarely sells its investments.
Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, reported a 37 percent increase in its operating profit.
Berkshire reported $3.7 billion in operating earnings, or $1.50 per Class B share. That was up from $2.7 billion, or $1.09 per Class B share, last year.
Andy Kilpatrick, the stockbroker-author who wrote ''Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett,'' said the results are impressive because during the second quarter Europe's debt woes increased and the overall economy slowed.
''I thought it was a good decent quarter in a bad world,'' Mr. Kilpatrick said.
Berkshire officials do not typically comment on quarterly earnings reports, and they did not immediately respond to a message Friday afternoon.
Berkshire recorded a $693 million loss on its derivative contracts in this year's second quarter.
That's up from a $120 million loss last year.
The true value of the derivatives won't be clear for at least several years because they don't mature until nearly a decade from now.
But Berkshire is required to estimate their value every time the company reports earnings.
Mr. Buffett has told investors he believes the contracts -- some of which are tied to equity markets and some of which are tied to credit defaults -- will ultimately be profitable because the premiums are being invested.
Berkshire owns about 80 subsidiaries, including clothing, furniture and jewelry firms.
Its insurance and utility businesses typically account for more than half of the company's net income.
It also has major investments in companies like Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo & Company.
The quarterly results were issued after the stock market's close Friday.
Berkshire's Class B shares rose 57 cents, or 0.67 percent, to $86.15 in after-hours trading Friday.

PERSON: Paul W. McCracken 

HEADLINE: Paul W. McCracken, Adviser to Presidents, Dies at 96

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Paul W. McCracken, a moderate Republican who served as an economic adviser to both Republican and Democratic presidents and who led President Richard M. Nixon's largely unsuccessful effort to tame the rising inflation of the late 1960s and early 1970s, died on Friday in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 96.
His death was announced by the University of Michigan, where he had taught for most of his academic career. A wide-ranging thinker, Mr. McCracken was part of a postwar generation of economists who believed that government should play an active role in moderating business cycles, balancing inflation and unemployment, and helping the disadvantaged. 
His nearly three years at the White House coincided with a turbulent era marked by rising deficits, rampant inflation, the imposition of wage and price controls, and the breakdown of the system of fixed exchange rates that had governed the world's currencies since World War II.
As a result, by the early 1980s, Mr. McCracken, like other economists, questioned the Keynesian assumptions that had been dominant since the war. He concluded that high inflation had resulted from ''a cumulative paralysis in our will'' and called for greater fiscal discipline to limit the growth of government spending -- a topic that continues to vex Washington.
''Government was never during the 1970s able to bring itself to meet the first fundamental requirement of a successful price-stabilization policy -- namely, that its policies, quite simply, would not accommodate inflation,'' Mr. McCracken wrote in 1980.
In fact, at that moment the Federal Reserve, under a new chairman, Paul A. Volcker, had begun to raise interest rates sharply, producing back-to-back recessions, in 1980 and 1982, that at last broke the back of inflation, but at the cost of painfully high unemployment.
Paul Winston McCracken was born on Dec. 29, 1915, in Richland, Iowa. His father, a farmer, and his uncle, an economics teacher, encouraged him to study economics at William Penn College (now University) in Oskaloosa, Iowa. He graduated in 1937 and then taught for three years at Berea College in Kentucky, where he met Emily Ruth Siler, a student teacher.
They married in 1942, the same year Mr. McCracken received a master's from Harvard in economics and went to work at the Commerce Department in Washington. From 1943 to 1948 he was a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, while completing a Ph.D., also at Harvard. Then he joined the faculty at what is now the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.
Mr. McCracken was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1956 to 1959 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He advocated unsuccessfully for a tax cut to stem a major recession in 1957-58, and later said that the administration's hands-off approach to the economy had helped bring on another recession, in 1960-61, and cost Nixon, Eisenhower's vice president, the 1960 presidential election.
While a professor, Mr. McCracken served two Democratic presidents: John F. Kennedy, as a member of a task force on the domestic economy, and Lyndon B. Johnson, as part of a commission on budgetary accounting.
After winning the 1968 election, Nixon summoned Mr. McCracken to a meeting in New York. Asked to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. McCracken said he should call his wife, but Nixon replied: ''I have a press conference in a few minutes, and I don't really have much to tell them. Why don't we just announce it there.''
The president described Mr. McCracken as ''a centrist, a man who is pragmatic in his economics.''
Working for Nixon, Mr. McCracken was confronted with an inflation rate that had been rising since 1965, a byproduct of the deficits that the federal government had amassed during the Vietnam War.
In a speech in August 1969, he said inflation had ''caused severe social and economic damage'' and ''had a socially disintegrating effect through its tendency to escalate group tensions.''
He also called for expanding unemployment insurance, reorganizing work force training, exempting the poor from federal income taxes and improving mass transit -- positions that reflected the dominant liberal consensus of the times.
Mr. McCracken represented a middle ground between Johnson's advisers, who had advocated ''fine-tuning'' tax policies to regulate the economy, and the conservative, laissez-faire approach of the Chicago school, led by Milton Friedman. Mr. McCracken became the architect of a policy of gradualism, which sought to slow inflation by reducing growth slightly, without causing a recession.
He hoped to slow price increases through a combination of a budget surplus, brought about when a Johnson-era tax surcharge was extended, and tighter monetary policy by the Fed, which would rein in speculation by the stock market and wage demands by unions. He warned the government not to ''lock the brakes so severely that the economy would be thrown into the ditch.''
But prices continued to rise, despite a recession in 1969-70, and by mid-1970 Nixon had directed the council to issue ''inflation alerts,'' singling out what Mr. McCracken later called ''egregious cases'' of inflation, including a large jump in New York City taxicab fares.
After a momentous weekend in the presidential retreat at Camp David, Nixon decided to impose wage and price controls for the first time since the Korean War. He also unilaterally ended the Bretton Woods system under which the United States had agreed to sell gold to foreign governments for dollars at fixed exchange rates.
The controls were popular and probably a factor in Nixon's overwhelming re-election victory in 1972, Mr. McCracken wrote.
But the controls proved unsustainable, as Mr. McCracken had warned in 1969, when he said they were ''far less effective than many are now inclined to assume.'' They were abandoned by 1974. ''Stagflation,'' a crippling combination of sluggish growth and high inflation, would continue to beleaguer the American economy until the early 1980s.
Mr. McCracken later maintained that gradualism had been working, ''but its slow and erratic pace and the political requirements were not compatible.'' In fact, the price controls probably ''exacerbated and extended'' the inflation of the 1970s, he wrote in a 1996 essay in Presidential Studies Quarterly.
Mr. McCracken returned to Michigan at the end of 1971. He was the Edmund Ezra Day distinguished university professor of business administration until his retirement in 1986.
He is survived by two daughters, Linda Langer and Paula McCracken. His wife died in 2005.

HEADLINE: Hiring Picks Up, But Data Gives No Clear Signal

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
America added more jobs than expected last month, offering a pleasant surprise after many months of disappointing economic news. Even so, hiring was not strong enough to shrink the army of the unemployed in the slightest.
Employers added 163,000 jobs in July, the Labor Department reported on Friday. That was more than twice the job growth in the previous month, and substantially more than Wall Street analysts had forecast. The underlying details of the report, however, ranged from unimpressive to outright discouraging and provided plenty of fodder for Republican attacks on President Obama's economic legacy.
The Obama administration, for its part, argued that Republican obstructionism to its economic policies was holding back the recovery. 
July's jobless rate ticked up slightly to 8.3 percent, about the same as it has been all year. A broader measure of unemployment -- including part-time workers who want full-time jobs, and people who have given up looking for work -- rose to 15 percent.
United States markets closed substantially higher on the news. But the mixed report gave investors, workers, presidential campaigns and Federal Reserve officials anything but a clear signal on the strength of the economy. Job growth seems to be heading sideways.
''It's a lot better than we'd been seeing in the last few months, but it's still short of the kind of job growth we were seeing at the beginning of this year,'' said Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics. As for the pace of hiring through the rest of the year, he said, ''I think this is about as good as it's going to get.''
Given the lackluster gains in Friday's report, many economists remain convinced that the Federal Reserve will step in with additional monetary stimulus as soon as its next meeting in September.
In a statement this week, Fed officials acknowledged that the recovery was slowing and said they stood armed and ready on the sidelines. The most likely actions include making another round of asset purchases and extending its public predictions on interest rate policy.
''Today's report doesn't take the pressure off of them to do something to move the economy up from 2 percent growth,'' said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. ''By the same token, it also takes the gun away from their head that they have to do something very quickly.''
By their next meeting, Fed policy makers will have another month of job data, which could provide further guidance.
Even if the Fed does act, more monetary stimulus may not be all that effective, given that the central bank has pumped so much money into the economy already.
''There isn't any fantastically strong monetary policy tool left out there,'' Mr. Ashworth said. ''They've already fired the heavy artillery.''
In their own ways, both the Obama administration and its Republican opposition claimed that the jobs report was evidence that fiscal policy needed to change, too.
''This is an extraordinary record of failure,'' Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said at a campaign appearance in North Las Vegas, Nev. ''The president's policies have not worked because he thinks government makes America work. He's wrong.''
At an event in Washington, Mr. Obama said there was ''more work to do'' on behalf of the nation's 12.7 million idle workers. His administration has argued, though, that the president has not actually had a chance to fully execute his economic policy agenda because of Congressional gridlock.
''If you look at today's jobs report, where we saw declines were construction and government education jobs,'' said Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. ''The main components of the Jobs Act would target exactly those two areas, by investing more in infrastructure and helping local governments keep teachers and first responders on the payrolls. I think it's the kind of medicine that's well targeted to the continuing areas of weakness in the job market.''
Congress is now in recess, and is not expected to undertake any significant actions before November's election.
Economists do not expect job growth to pick up much any time soon. Concerned about the European debt crisis and the draconian American fiscal tightening scheduled for the end of the year, many companies have postponed hiring until they have more clarity about policy conditions and global financial markets.
''Truly, what I'm worried about is that corporate profits have not been as good in the last six months as they had been before,'' said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse. ''Whatever cash on hand I have, I have because I've been scared, and I'm going to keep it until I'm not scared anymore.''
Government layoffs, which have occurred nearly every month for the last two years, have been partly offsetting job growth in the private sector. In July, total government employment -- that is, at the federal, state and local levels -- fell by 9,000 jobs.
Forecasts for gross domestic product growth in the third quarter of this year have fallen in recent days after other disappointing economic news from manufacturing and consumer spending. This bodes poorly for employment growth, which is already playing catch-up in what has been called a jobless recovery.
The economy now produces more goods and services than it did before the downturn officially began in December 2007. But it does so with almost five million fewer jobs.
''Nearly the entire reduction in unemployment since October 2009 has been accomplished through a significant drop in the percentage of adults participating in the labor force,'' said Peter Morici, a professor in the business school at the University of Maryland.

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Lawmakers from both parties will stop by the Sunday shows to discuss a long list of unresolved issues and what the economic numbers mean for the presidential campaign. 

 BODY:
The latest unemployment report offered a mixed bag on the economy with stronger than expected job growth combined with a small uptick in the jobless rate. Lawmakers from both parties will stop by the Sunday shows at the beginning of a five-week Congressional vacation to discuss the long list of unresolved issues and what the economic numbers mean for the presidential campaign.
Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, and her counterpart on the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, will be on ABC's "This Week" to debate how the modest economic growth will affect President Obama and whether Mitt Romney can convince voters that his fiscal agenda will better serve the country.
To look at how the jobs report will play in the all-important battleground states, CBS's "Face the Nation" will host Gov. Bob McDonnell, Republican of Virginia, former Gov. Ted Strickland, Democrat of Ohio, former Gov. Ed Rendell, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, for their insight on voter reactions to the unemployment figures.
Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, will sit down with CNN's "State of the Union" to revisit his party's anti-tax pledge and discuss his views on how a bipartisan effort can help solve the federal debt crisis. Later, Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to the Obama campaign, will delve into the latest unconfirmed assertions made by Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, about Mitt Romney's alleged failure to pay taxes for 10 years.
The Obama campaign has also deployed David Axelrod, chief strategist to Mr. Obama, to give a status report on the president's ground operation just months away from Election Day on "Fox News Sunday." Ted Cruz, a Tea Party candidate who snagged the Republican Senate nomination in Texas from the state's lieutenant governor, is considered a rising star in the party and will talk about the latest upset and his plans for campaign season.
C-Span's "Newsmakers" will feature an interview with another Texan, Senator John Cornyn, a Republican, to discuss fiery races within his party and what the party's strategy will be to win a majority this fall in the Senate.
President Obama's deferred action program for undocumented young people will soon take effect. Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, and Myrna Orozco, field director of United We Dream, will discuss efforts to ensure that all applicants to the program are familiar with the approval process on Univision's "Al Punto."
Patrick Gaspard, the Democratic National Committee's executive director, will be a guest on Bloomberg TV's "Political Capital."
NBC's "Meet the Press" has been pre-empted by Olympic coverage.

 BODY:
How some crimes of the elite are not prosecuted, and why.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Read the newspaper and you will see many instances of ordinary citizens going to jail when they break the law, while the elites face a mere slap on the wrist.
One shouldn't be fooled by the perp walks of rogue traders who hid billions in losses, perpetrators of Ponzi schemes or executives who committed insider trading for their own accounts. They are prosecuted because getting rid of the bad apples is in the interests of the firms involved and the securities industry in general.
But what has never been routinely prosecuted are the crimes in which corporations benefit because, after all, Big Business runs government instead of the other way around. For example, efforts to prosecute fraud in the 2008 economic debacle have focused on homeowners who made fraudulent loan applications, not the financial institutions that encouraged these loans.
These are among the others typically not prosecuted for their crimes: 
Stockbrokers who engage in unauthorized trading.
Manufacturers that sell harmful products and then lie about their safety.
Factory owners who ignore safety rules and thereby injure their workers.
Except in the most egregious cases or where the larger interests of the industry are involved, executives and professionals are usually charged only civilly, which means they pay a fine or lose some privilege (often just temporarily). For this purpose, an alphabet soup of regulatory agencies, whose real purpose is to protect the industries, exists.
Those in the professions -- law, medicine, accounting and so on -- have it even easier. Their transgressions are usually turned over to their own professional associations.
In other words, nowadays only the activities of chumps fall under the jurisdiction of the police. Everyone else has a ''get out of jail free'' card.

Readers React
Here's my guess: the vast majority of white-collar prosecutors and defense attorneys agree with Mr. Zell that there is a double standard of justice in this country: one for you and me, and another for the rich and powerful. So why don't more of them speak out, as Mr. Zell has?
Because they don't want to burn their bridges to the establishment.
The typical trajectory of the top law school graduates interested in a career in white-collar law is this: work as a federal prosecutor for a couple of years, then become a partner in a white-collar defense law firm and defend corporate criminals -- at 5 to 10 times the pay.
The young prosecutor understands that serious criminal prosecution of major corporations and their executives will likely jeopardize his or her career at the big white-collar defense law firms.
That's one reason that instead of securing guilty pleas against major corporations, for example, they settle for deferred and nonprosecution agreements.
Mr. Zell spoke the truth. No way he's going to be working for one of the corporate defense firms any time soon.
RUSSELL MOKHIBER Washington, Aug. 1, 2012
The writer is the editor of the Corporate Crime Reporter.
The long history of under-punishing white-collar (suite) crime and over-punishing conventional (street) crime does not have an easy solution. As Mr. Zell correctly suggests, the dominance of government policy and the co-opting of the regulatory agencies by high finance and big business render piecemeal legislative initiatives and token criminal prosecutions more symbolic than truly effective.
Only with a broad transformation of public consciousness to fully recognize the immense harm of high-level white-collar crime can we hope for the emergence of the political will necessary to transform the basic architecture of our political economy.
Only with a finance and corporate sector organized to focus laserlike on the interests of citizens, consumers and workers, as opposed to the obscene enrichment of the 1 percent, will we see truly effective prosecution and punishment of high-level white-collar crime.
DAVID O. FRIEDRICHS Clarks Green, Pa., Aug. 2, 2012
The writer isa professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Scranton and the author of ''Trusted Criminals: White Collar Crime in Contemporary Society.''
Welcome to the 99 percent! It is a long tradition here that those of us who are not on top have no power. That is why you get the parking ticket for parking in a restricted zone ...where ''they'' can park.
What is amazing is that the electorate allows this state of affairs, some cheering on the very legal constructs that shut down the rights of their fellow citizens.
Congress is made up of many who claim that the ''job creators'' will build a worker utopia only if they are not harassed by regulations and taxation. And we vote for them!
ROBERT HIRST Massapequa, N.Y., Aug. 1, 2012
Of all the urgent issues pressing America today, not one is more infuriating to me and everyone I know than our government's abject refusal to prosecute the powerful bankers and other financiers for the catastrophe their greed has inflicted on the lives of millions of innocent citizens.
Mostly products of our ''elite'' institutions, rather than being punished for their crimes, they walk away with millions of undeserved dollars and then add insult to injury by stashing large chunks in the Cayman Islands, Switzerland and other tax dodges.
Bill Clinton, Robert E. Rubin, Dick Armey and the other influentials who undid the Glass-Steagall Act should work to undo at least some of the damage they caused by applying their clout to restore the law's protective separation between banking and playing the market.
Meanwhile, as the 1 percent sail blithely along, we see Congressional Republicans pressing to make drastic cuts in school lunches for our poorest children. What has happened to our great country's sense of decency and fairness? Have we no shame?
ARLIE SCHARDT Stonington, Me., Aug. 2, 2012
The writer was Al Gore's national press secretary when he ran for president in 1988.
Too often, citizens mistake government as the main enemy. We see corporations built and run by those without governing powers, so we believe that they're on our side, our swords and shields meant to fight off big government.
The truth is that big business is mostly incapable of making decisions based on good ethics. The fueling drive of business is profit, and we should never forget that.
Unfortunately, the corporations run the government, and our system does little to ensure that they make good decisions or are held accountable. They have the power to evade prosecution, as Mr. Zell points out. They also heavily steer government to benefit profit through lobbying and advertisements.
The founding fathers had no idea that big business was just as dangerous to democracy as an all-powerful government. If we don't limit the influence of big business in government now, it's likely that corporations will substitute oligarchy for democracy, if it hasn't happened already.
MICHAEL PAUL CAROLIN Tucson, Aug. 1, 2012
Mr. Zell makes the argument that members of corporations, as well as those in various professions, are given a pass when it comes to being prosecuted for crimes. There is another facet to the same argument.
If more money can buy the time and energy of better defense lawyers, and if better defense lawyers make it more likely that the defendant will be either acquitted or given a lesser sentence, then money, rather than the evidence, dictates the outcome.
Given this, it only makes sense that Lady Justice not be depicted with a blindfold (which, after all, represents objectivity).
WILLIAM VAUGHAN Jr. Chebeague Island, Me., Aug. 1, 2012
The Writer Responds
As Mr. Mokhiber writes, lawyers know all too well the double standard that exists in the law. But precisely because their vantage point allows them to know the inner workings of the law, lawyers are sworn to secrecy. In this way, the public is kept in the dark.
Every now and then, a speck of light shines in. For example, lawyers have been disbarred for stating that a judicial decision was result-oriented rather than based on the law. According to a New York Times/CBS News Poll taken last month, the American public has figured out on its own that this is why the Supreme Court upheld President Obama's health law.
So in answer to Mr. Hirst, the reason the 99 percent do not rise up against the law is that most of what goes on is hidden. From a former Treasury Department official's recent Op-Ed article (''Mitt Romney's Financial Mysteries,'' July 31), even I was shocked to learn that the government, by failing adequately to audit gift tax returns, has allowed the very wealthy to transfer unlimited amounts of money to their children without paying the required taxes. Who knew?
As Mr. Carolin said, the public doesn't even know who the enemy is. The people see the government showering the country's resources upon favored individuals to aid private enterprises and build up private fortunes, and so they ''mistake government as the main enemy.'' But as he and I pointed out, Big Business runs the government.
To find the solution Mr. Friedrichs and Mr. Schardt seek, we must force the government to treat everyone equally.
Instead of giving the government discretionary power to do whatever it wants, it should be forced to prosecute all crimes for which probable cause exists, to establish standardized plea-bargaining rules, to bid all government contracts, to subsidize no private company or all of them, and to replace the often mutually exclusive legal precedents in the common law with unambiguous statutory law.
Some may say that taking away the government's discretionary power is like taking away a sailor's curse words. To which I would respond: Silence is golden.

HEADLINE: Working While Sick

 BODY:
More than 40 million American workers get no paid sick leave. They have to work when ill or take unpaid sick days, which can lead to financial hardship, or, worse, dismissal. The best way to address this workplace and public health problem is with a national law requiring businesses to provide paid sick leave -- a normal benefit for workers in at least 145 countries. 
But since there is little hope for such progress anytime soon in Washington, New York City Council members are taking up the cause. At least 36 of 50 council members support a proposed city law that would require sick leave for more than 1.2 million workers. Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker, has refused to bring a bill to the floor, however.
She argues that the timing is bad given the weak economy and that the benefit could increase compensation costs for businesses by an average of 1.5 percent, which in her view would hurt smaller companies to the point of driving them out of business or out of the city. Some business leaders say that companies will cut jobs if even a few days of sick leave are required.
Little evidence to support such fears has been seen in San Francisco, the District of Columbia and the state of Connecticut, which require many businesses to provide the benefit. There are also economic benefits -- lower turnover, higher productivity and morale, and reduced job loss for workers. But Ms. Quinn, who says she supports paid sick days in principle, does not want to consider a citywide sick-leave law until the economy is stronger.
The current council proposal would require firms with 5 to 19 employees to provide workers five paid sick days a year, which could also be used to care for sick family members. Businesses with 20 or more employees would have to provide nine days a year of any type of paid leave. The proposal would not cover independent contractors, interns or most union workers. There would be a one-year grace period for new businesses with fewer than 20 employees.
Ms. Quinn and Councilwoman Gale Brewer, who is the lead sponsor of the bill, should be able to find a workable compromise. The requirement could be phased in slowly, especially for new companies and the smallest businesses. If done wisely, New York City's version could be the sensible model for federal legislation.
Ms. Brewer, Ms. Quinn and other New York City political leaders should also put more pressure on Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Legislature to pass a state measure on paid sick leave.
Connecticut's law, enacted last year, requires sick leave for most businesses with 50 or more employees. That still leaves far too many employees without paid sick days, but it is a start. Gov. Dannel Malloy said recently that the law had not led to more small business failures and that the state had gained jobs since it took effect.
This benefit is also good for public health. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that workers who could take sick leave instead of working while unwell were less likely to be hurt on the job.
American workers should have paid sick leave, and New York City could set a standard for the rest of the nation. Workers in the city deserve a sensible and humane sick-leave benefit now.

HEADLINE: 2015 Is Gonna Be The Year

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is a co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Like a lot of New Yorkers, I've never bought a new car. I had never even talked to a new-car salesman until I accompanied my dad to buy a Toyota the other day. While I was walking around the dealership, though, I couldn't believe just how cheap it has become to lease a new Camry. For less than $200 a month, or about half the price of a parking spot at many Manhattan garages, you can drive the basic model off the lot.
I assumed that this was a sign of an industry in desperation. Then Anthony Pratt, who runs forecasting for the auto-data firm Polk, told me that it was the exact opposite. New-car sales, which collapsed to less than 11 million in 2009, are expected to surpass 14 million this year. And forecasters believe that they will increase by around a million annually for the next couple of years. In 2015, we could eclipse 16 million vehicles sold, which is near the precrisis peak. 
The industry's buoyancy comes largely from pent-up demand. Many Americans are driving really, really old cars. The average passenger vehicle is now 11 years old -- making this the oldest fleet ever -- and the percentage being junked has been at near record lows. One manufacturer recently told me that he was selling parts that few cars previously lived long enough to need.
The cheap lease prices are built into this calculation. (Though the industry is also benefiting from recent restructuring and low interest rates.) Auto companies price their leases based partly on an estimation of a car's residual value, or how much they think they can resell it for when the lease expires three years later. The auto industry, Pratt explained, is anticipating that in the next few years Americans, like my dad, will finally ditch their ancient cars and flood dealerships. Some may buy or lease new cars. Many others will buy preowned ones. But in order to have enough of those gently used vehicles ready by 2015, the auto companies need to push new ones into the market now. If Toyota is leasing a Camry for $200 a month, it shows its confidence that it can make a significant profit on the back end.
All these potential customers make the U.S. auto industry believe that 2015 is going to be the year that things finally get back to normal. And despite a steady stream of numbingly grim economic news, it is already doubling down on its future. ''Volkswagen just opened a new plant in Chattanooga -- they're already talking about expanding,'' Pratt told me, noting that the company plans to more than double its North American sales, to 800,000, in the next few years. ''Honda announced they're expanding production in Greensburg, Ind. Kia recently expanded in Georgia and Hyundai in Alabama.''
This optimism is also embodied in the number of new models about to hit the production line. A few years ago, the industry introduced only around 50 new models. This year, it is planning 94; next year, there will be another 101. Companies have stopped holding back on technological advances too, like the improved integration of the Internet into cars, the broad adoption of new safety features like rearview cameras and all sorts of energy-efficient advances.
So is the car industry's optimism more reliable than the numbingly grim economic news? In normal times, forecasters would generally ignore auto-leasing terms and instead pay a lot more attention to, say, Treasury bond interest rates, recent retail sales or the employment rate. Unfortunately, right now these normally helpful indicators are entirely overwhelmed by extreme short-term worries. Europe is near financial disaster, China's economy could face a deep recession and any conflict between Israel and Iran could send oil prices to record highs. These possibilities -- not to mention plenty of others -- have effectively overwhelmed once reliable indicators over the near term, and it has become nearly impossible to get a decent read on what the economy might look like in a year or so. Every forecaster I spoke with said they felt more uncertain than ever.
The auto industry has historically been a useful proxy for the overall economy. Everyone everywhere (besides New York City) needs a car, and manufacturing plants, suppliers and dealerships extend their reach to nearly every corner of the country. But the industry also does not have the luxury of waiting out the current malaise in order to form an opinion about the future. In order to determine factory capacities and lease prices, it must have an opinion about 2015 right now, no matter what. And if that determination is largely based on a belief that a lot of people are about to need new (or slightly used) cars, so be it. In fact, Paul Edelstein, an economist at the research firm IHS Global Insight, told me that the industry's rosy forecasts basically presuppose that, by 2015, our short-term worries about U.S. unemployment rates, the euro, China and Iran will be resolved. Statistically speaking, our luck can't always be as bad as it has been.
This positive view can occasionally be self-fulfilling. If the auto industry believes 2015 will be better, it will invest in bigger plants, hire more employees, place bigger orders with its suppliers and do countless other things that can push a recovery along. Other industries, like retail or housing, might react to these newly hired autoworkers and invest accordingly. Edelstein says that many companies in the durable-goods sector -- anything made to last more than three years, from refrigerators to aircraft carriers -- are also preparing for a better 2015. Computer and communications equipment sales are predicted to do well, too. That's actually how economic recoveries happen -- the core debate in economics is essentially over how to trigger confidence and encourage people and businesses to take risks and spend money. ''In 2015 the picture brightens considerably,'' Edelstein says. ''We've got to get there first. And that's really the problem.''
Yet the auto industry accounts for less than 3 percent of the overall U.S. economy. That's too small to create a recovery on its own. Pratt admits that this sunny forecast is hardly certain. He also knows that nearly all of the economic forecasts of the past few years have been far too optimistic. If Pratt's forecast is wrong, it's much more likely to be wrong on the downside. As he explained, it's very easy to imagine a number of events that would disrupt the economy -- from a prolonged European crisis to a Chinese downturn -- but very hard to think of something that could prompt a surprising uptick. Then again, ''at some point,'' he says, ''you have to put a line in the sand and say, 'This is what we believe.' ''
To me, the shaky optimism about 2015 is probably just the best indicator of how lousy our economy has been in 2012. There is one exception, though. Once a real recovery is under way, it's likely to mean more jobs for a lot of currently unemployed people. Motor vehicles and parts manufacturers employed more than 11 million people in 2005. Today they employ just over 7.5 million, and there is no way they can accommodate much growing demand without some serious hiring. Meanwhile, there are now millions of Americans who have emerged from the recession, paid down debts and have equity in their houses. Many of them probably also need a new car. The auto industry's biggest challenge may be to persuade them to take the same risks that it has.

HEADLINE: Is It Hot Enough for Ya?

BYLINE: By ERIC KLINENBERG. 
A professor of sociology at New York University and the author of ''Going Solo'' and ''Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.''

 BODY:
CLIMATE change is hardly a seasonal issue, but summer is the only time of year when Americans and the news media regularly fix their attention on the everyday heat emergency that's already altering life on our planet. Indeed, this summer's record-shattering weather across the United States has created a heightened level of interest in and concern about the consequences of climate change.
For the moment, we have an opportunity to make fundamental changes to the way our country deals with the environment, changes that would lock in public acceptance of climate change. But we have to act quickly -- not only because the crisis is urgent, but because one good blizzard could change a lot of minds. 
For now, though, Americans, long cynical about global warming, are confronting the facts. According to a survey conducted in July by the University of Texas, 70 percent of Americans believe the climate is changing, compared to 65 percent in March, and only 15 percent say it isn't. Party affiliation continues to divide public opinion, but today most Republicans, 53 percent, believe in climate change, as do 72 percent of independents and 87 percent of Democrats.
Perhaps that's because this year's extreme weather has afflicted residents of red and blue states equally. The United States Drought Monitor, based at the University of Nebraska, reports that moderate to severe drought conditions this summer are affecting 64 percent of the lower 48 states, leading to domestic food inflation and record high prices for grain.
The Midwest is becoming a Dust Bowl, the Southwest and Rocky Mountains a tinder box. Lakes and rivers across the South are drying up. And a series of brutal heat waves, severe storms and prolonged power failures has punished residents of the Northeast, generating widespread concern that the region's infrastructure is woefully unprepared for the strange weather that's become our new norm.
But the most visible human drama of climate change is happening in cities. Cities are not merely the population centers where dense concentrations of people are trapped and exposed during dangerous weather events. They are also ''heat islands,'' whose asphalt, brick, concrete and steel attract the heat while pollution from automobiles, factories and air-conditioners traps it. City dwellers experience elevated heat at all hours, but the difference matters most at night, when the failure of high temperatures to fall deprives them of natural relief. For the most vulnerable people, these ''high lows'' can be the difference between life and death.
Americans began to take urban heat seriously after 1995, when a record-breaking heat wave -- three days of triple-digit heat -- baked Chicago. Ordinarily, heat waves fail to produce the kind of spectacular imagery we see in other disasters, like earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. Heat doesn't generate much property damage, nor does it reveal its force to the camera or naked eye. Heat waves are invisible killers of old, poor and other mostly invisible people. Until the summer of 1995, medical examiners and media outlets often neglected to report heat-related deaths altogether.
But the great Chicago heat wave changed things. It caused so much suffering that at one point nearly half the city's emergency rooms closed their doors to new patients. Hospitals were not the only institutions stretched beyond capacity by the heat. Streets buckled. Trains derailed. The power grid failed. Water pressure diminished. Ambulances were delayed.
There were ''water wars'' in poor neighborhoods, where city workers cracked down on residents who opened fire hydrants for relief. There were surreal scenes at City Hall, where members of the mayor's staff declined to declare a heat emergency, forgot to implement their extreme heat plan and refused to bring in additional ambulances and paramedics.
And there was Mayor Richard M. Daley, telling reporters: ''It's hot. It's very hot. But let's not blow it out of proportion,'' while the morgue ran out of bays and the medical examiner had to call in a fleet of refrigerated trucks to handle the load. When the temperatures finally broke, 739 Chicagoans had died as a result of the heat wave.
Chicago learned from the disaster, and today it is a national leader in planning for the next acute heat emergency. The city compiles a list of old, isolated and vulnerable residents, and public workers contact them when dangerous weather arrives. City officials and community organizations promote awareness and encourage residents to check in on one another. The local news media treat heat waves as true public health hazards. Everyone knows how perilous the new climate can be.
Unfortunately, Chicago keeps getting reminders. In the early July heat wave, despite its improved emergency response system, Chicago reported more heat deaths than any other city or state. And this week the Union of Concerned Scientists released ''Heat in the Heartland,'' a study that reports an increased incidence of dangerous hot weather throughout the Midwest in the past 60 years, including elevated evening temperatures and more heat waves lasting three days or longer. Along with Chicago, the report singles out St. Louis, Detroit, Minneapolis and Cincinnati as being at risk, but also cites public health research predicting more heat waves in towns and cities throughout the Midwest and Northeast.
There are likely to be more such reports this summer, like a recent Environment America Research and Policy Center study finding more extreme downpours as a result of global warming. If a particularly strong hurricane hits, climatologists will once again explain that rising sea levels increase the likelihood of more, and more severe, storms, and perhaps even more Americans will begin believing in climate change. Then again, in our event-driven culture, a cold winter may well reverse the trend.
Americans' growing concerns about global warming will mean nothing if our national leaders are unwilling to seize the moment and do something about it. No city wants to be the next Chicago, and no urban government should go without the kind of acute-heat emergency plan that Chicago has today. But the question that may determine the life and death of future generations is whether we will face up to the larger heat emergency before the political climate changes once again.

TOO HIGH TO FAIL
Cannabis and the New Green Economic Revolution
By Doug Fine
Illustrated. 319 pp. Gotham Books. $28.
''Too High to Fail'' is a good rebuttal to those who say stoners never accomplish anything -- Doug Fine did.
He has written a well-researched book that uses the clever tactic of making the moral case for ending marijuana prohibition by burying it inside the economic case. We've become a ruthless society, and almost everything (I'm looking at you, Environment and Health Care) has to be sold as ''first, it's good for business.'' To his credit, Fine doesn't do what so many of us do and scream, ''Can't we just stop jailing potheads because that would be the right thing?'' Also to his credit, he never admits he's one of them. 
The ''war on drugs'' is America's longest war. It has cost taxpayers $1 trillion in the last 40 years, Fine notes, and it has turned our nation into ''the most highly incarcerated society in history.'' In 2011, a global commission on drug policy (whose members included Paul Volcker, George P. Shultz and former presidents of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico) declared that ''the global war on drugs has failed.'' Sixty-/seven percent of Americans agree. Antonin Scalia and Pat Robertson are now to the left of President Obama on pot.
In a way, the author of a polemic on marijuana policy suffers from the odd case of having too many facts on his side. To a person coming to this subject pot-/agnostic, it might seem as if the issue is being loaded. No, it is loaded. As Fine points out, the real addicts of the drug war are the law enforcement agencies that live off this senseless game of cops and robbers.
''Too High to Fail'' takes the form of a fly-on-the-wall account of Northern California's burgeoning legal cannabis industry. Fine, an investigative journalist, takes us to Mendocino County, where he follows one plant from seed to medical marijuana patient in the first county in the nation to decriminalize and regulate cannabis farming.
Fine fits in well in Mendocino. Bearded and driving his vegetable-oil-fueled truck, he looks and plays the part. But be warned: if you are indifferent to drug culture, you may roll your eyes at some of the stoner talk. When Fine says, describing a Mendocino grow house, ''I felt like I was inside a Peter Tosh album cover photo,'' even I wanted to tell him he was harshing my mellow.
Mendocino County is depicted here as a kind of democratic utopia where local law enforcement and cannabis farmers are on the same side. In 2008, the county passed a land-use ordinance called Chapter 9.31, which authorized growers to cultivate up to 99 cannabis plants (this has since been reduced to 25). Rather than turning the county into a police state, legalization made it safer. Revenues in the municipality increased, and cannabis farmers were treated as law-abiding citizens.
Fine calls Mendocino the state's ''progressive lab,'' because it was essentially engaging in an act of civil disobedience. It may have been in accordance with California law, but ever since states (17 now, plus the District of Columbia) started legalizing medical marijuana, the federal government under a Democratic (Clinton), then a Republican (Bush) and now a Democratic administration has consistently resisted going along. Consequently, Fine observes, Mendocino has a kind of fifth season: helicopter season. ''Helicopter noise is Mendocino County's summer soundtrack,'' he writes of the federal choppers circling overhead. ''Something you just have to deal with in warm weather, like the summer before 10th grade when it was 'Born in the U.S.A.' ''
The most eye-opening and persuasive parts of the book explore the revenue and benefits to be had from cannabis without a single joint's being lighted. Throughout human history, cultures from Mongolia to Peru have used the non-psychoactive cannabis plant for food, shelter, clothing and medicine. Early drafts of the Declaration of Independence were written on hemp paper, and the covered pioneer wagons that took America westward were made of cannabis fiber. In 1942, cannabis prohibition was suspended because of a shortage in industrial supply during the war, and the government actually encouraged farmers to grow it, using a propaganda film, ''Hemp for Victory.''
The place industrial cannabis is not found yet, Fine points out, is in the above/ground American economy, thanks to its listing as a Schedule I narcotic. The Drug Enforcement Administration's official stance is that it has no medical value at all: ''Smoked marijuana has not withstood the rigors of science -- it is not medicine, and it is not safe.'' O.K., Fine seems to say, but tell that to the doctors with evidence of its ability to shrink tumors and ease the effects of chemotherapy; or to the seniors of Orange County who depend on medical marijuana to treat their arthritis, and the doctor who uses it to treat his glaucoma; or to the 30-year-old Iraq war veteran with the shrapnel injuries who thanks God every day for this drug. It is prescription drugs that are now the leading cause of fatal drug overdoses -- more than 26,000 each year. Also each year, over 23,000 Americans die of alcohol-related causes. None have died from cannabis alone.
As I said, the issue is loaded. And yet the side that has all the load never seems to win in America. The ending of ''Too High to Fail'' -- spoiler alert -- is a real bummer. Just as Fine was about to send the manuscript to his publisher in November 2011, the feds cracked down in Mendocino. The 9.31 program was essentially abandoned, and the local, participatory democracy Fine immersed himself in for a year was pushed back underground.
He should have seen it coming. Halfway through his adventure, Fine was pulled over by a state trooper when he left the friendly confines of Mendocino and crossed into Sonoma County -- where it's cool to get high on wine, but not on pot. Fine was doubtful that anyone in California actually used the old war-on-drugs tactics until this incident, but it was a reminder that some people are still in battle mode.
Relating how he was taken into custody, Fine describes something he calls ''Panzer's Paradox'' -- basically, the fact that ''when it comes to distribution, there is no uniformity in cannabis legal interpretation now,'' as William Panzer, a lawyer specializing in cannabis defense, says. (Panzer was an author of Proposition 215, the medical-marijuana act passed in California in 1996.) Fine boils down the difference between a cannabis-friendly county and an unfriendly one to ''the career ambitions or personal cannabis views of the local D.A. and sheriff.''
He also paraphrases ''The Art of War'': ''If a war is ill conceived at its core, it can't be won.''

HEADLINE: Case Closed? That Squad Looks Familiar

BYLINE: By MARGY ROCHLIN

 BODY:
Los Angeles
IN December of 2010, when Kyra Sedgwick, the Emmy Award-winning star of ''The Closer'' on TNT, told the show's producers and network executives that the seventh season of that reliable ratings generator would be her last, little time was spent debating what to do next. ''I think everybody assumed that at a certain point that Kyra might decide she wanted to move on,'' said Michael Wright, the president and head of programming for TNT, TBS and Turner Classic Movies. ''So we'd been talking about that possibility for, frankly, a couple of years before it actually happened.''
By the next morning James Duff, who created ''The Closer,'' was presented with TNT's solution. The name ''The Closer'' would be jettisoned, but the fictional world of the series would remain as ''Major Crimes,'' after the elite division of Los Angeles Police Department detectives once led by Ms. Sedgwick's transgressive crime solver, Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson. ''I said, 'O.K.,' '' Mr. Duff acknowledged in a phone interview, ''but I didn't have a clue as to how I was going to do it.'' 
Mr. Duff found his answer in Los Angeles, its broke economy and a legal system eager to avoid costly trials by offering plea bargains. The tension of ''The Closer'' -- the only original scripted series to rank No. 1 among basic cable shows for five consecutive years -- is how Brenda will wring a confession from even the most reluctant suspect. The high point of a ''Major Crimes'' episode will have police and prosecutors working together to put a criminal behind bars by way of a deal. In this way Mr. Duff figured out how best to use almost all of the supporting cast from ''The Closer'' -- besides Ms. Sedgwick, the cast members J. K. Simmons and Corey Reynolds are also not continuing their roles -- and to showcase them in an ensemble drama.
When ''The Closer'' fans tune in to ''Major Crimes'' on Aug. 13, familiar faces typically relegated to reactive status when Brenda was in the room will be taking charge and getting close-ups. In fact the only thing that might confuse viewers is TNT's label of ''Major Crimes'' as a spinoff. In the land of narrative television a successor to an original show typically involves a move, like to Seattle (''Frasier'') from the bar stools of Boston (''Cheers'').
''It's not really what we consider a spinoff historically,'' said G. W. Bailey, who over the years has turned his fuming and unfiltered Lieutenant Provenza into a fan favorite. ''It's a new kind of hybrid. I'm at the same desk. I park in the same spot. I haven't moved an inch.''
Call the show what you will, TNT's job is to let viewers know that ''Major Crimes'' will offer everything its predecessor did in terms of a murder mystery solved and a workplace group examined, just without the workaholic Brenda leading the charge. To help ease the transition, TNT is unveiling ''Major Crimes'' at 10 p.m., right after the series finale of ''The Closer.'' This strategy provides instant gratification for the curious. A ''Closer'' fan hoping to reflect on Brenda's dramatic exit will barely have time to tweet ''@Kyrasedgwick thx 4 FUN TIMES'' before heading straight into the new show.
''We all felt like we should have a week off,'' Mr. Duff said, but Steve Koonin, president of Turner Entertainment Networks, saw things differently. ''He felt like he would never be able to deliver as large an audience to the spinoff as he would on that night. I didn't disagree with him. I just felt like, 'Yes, but you're also probably setting us up for the steepest second-week drop-off in television.' But I could be wrong.''
When asked about his decision, Mr. Koonin said: ''In television it's the lead-in that matters. I felt we should take advantage of the audience, give people a chance to sample the show, and they can decide whether they like it or not.'' Then he added, ''The world is about trade-offs, and if we get a few bumps and bruises and a headline that says, ' ''Major Crimes'' goes down the second week,' I think I can survive that.''
One thing is certain: Those working on ''Major Crimes'' were spared the predictably uncomfortable early days of a new series when cast, crew and production staff eye one another warily, waiting to see who is a friend and who is a diva. Instead, it's a ''Closer'' reunion. On a recent July morning in the Hollywood soundstage where ''Major Crimes'' is filmed, it felt like business as usual on the set of a long-running procedural. There were tough-talking detectives in suits, a table-tossing pimp and lots of female crew members dressed in oversize gold hoop earrings and saucy laced corsets.
As a script supervisor with a bangle-bedecked pink head scarf walked by, Andrew Sacks, a producer on both series, explained that ''Major Crimes'' has carried on the ''Closer'' tradition of Friday night theme parties. ''It's Pirate Day,'' he explained.
To understand the happy buzz on the set is to factor in the thought that coursed through this company's collective mind when Ms. Sedgwick revealed she was leaving: time to look for other employment.
''We were all very sad,'' said Tony Denison, who plays Lt. Andy Flynn and who, with the rest of the ''Closer'' cast, has been nominated five times for best ensemble performance in the Screen Actors Guild awards. ''Then James called me up and said, ' ''The Closer'' might be over, but I have more stories to tell,' and I thought, 'Great!' ''
He continued: ''We had a very powerful cast. We're like this group of ballplayers who wound up on a championship team, and now we get this opportunity to be on the field every week.''
The closest thing to a lead actor on the new show is Mary McDonnell, a two-time Oscar nominee adored by science-fiction buffs and millennial feminists for her portrayal of the noble President Laura Roslin on the series ''Battlestar Galactica.'' Of the cast Ms. McDonnell has the trickiest role: While others return as fan-approved mainstays, her Capt. Sharon Raydor -- a tough, stiff-smiling investigator from Internal Affairs who often locked horns with Brenda -- was considered an antagonist. Early in the first episode of ''Major Crimes,'' called ''Reloaded,'' Captain Raydor is given the departed Brenda's office, but she gets nothing but grief from her squad. Promoted into a job for which she is fully qualified, she's a woman in the lonely position of being openly disliked by those who answer to her. And Mr. Duff said viewers aren't necessarily supposed to like her, either.
''She's going to be someone about whom you are conflicted,'' Mr. Duff said. ''She's like a hall monitor. Hall monitors can be annoying. She loves the rules. We used to have a person who found the rules time consuming and difficult. Now we're going to see: 'Do the rules work? Does the justice system work as designed?' And that's a really interesting question.''

HEADLINE: Why D.C. Is Doing So Well

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Washington
A SPORTS team obviously cannot create a civic renaissance. But when a city and a team happen to go on a good run at the same time, it can be particularly sweet, and it's happened more often than you might think.
The Dallas Cowboys won two Super Bowls in the 1970s just as an oil boom was remaking Texas. The San Francisco 49ers displaced the Cowboys in the 1980s when the personal-computer revolution was enriching no small number of Bay Area residents. The Yankees' re-emergence in the late 1990s will always be a chapter in New York's larger comeback story. 
Now Washington may be getting its turn.
The city was a baseball laughingstock for most of the last century. ''First in war, first in peace, and last in the American League,'' as the vaudeville joke put it. For the final few decades of the 20th century, Washington did not even have a team, making it easily the biggest metro area without one. The absence became yet another sign of the capital's cultural otherness.
Today, seven years after the Montreal Expos moved to Washington and became the Nationals, they have surprised the prognosticators with, as of Friday, the second-best record in baseball, behind only the Cincinnati Reds. The Nats, as we call them here, are on pace to give Washington its first postseason baseball since 1933. The young pitching staff dominates opposing hitters, and a dynamic 19-year-old outfielder -- Bryce Harper, nicknamed Bam Bam, for an early temper tantrum that involved a bat, a wall and ultimately some stitches -- evokes a young Mickey Mantle, both statistically and stylistically.
For the city itself, the good times are a bit more complicated, given Washington's place in the national psyche. But they're no less striking. Washington may have the healthiest economy of any major metropolitan area in the country.
The unemployment rate was 5.7 percent in June, compared with 9.3 percent in Chicago, 9.6 percent in New York and 10.3 percent in Los Angeles. The average house price in the region is more than 10 percent above the 2009 nadir, while nationwide prices remain near a decade-long low.
And you can actually see the prosperity. Although much of the city itself remains poor, several neighborhoods are noticeably brighter, and the city's population has been rising for more than a decade. Downtown Washington is full of cranes building City Center DC -- a mix of apartments, stores, offices and a park scheduled to open next summer. In McLean, Va., and Potomac, Md., mansions continue to rise from the ground.
According to a Gallup poll, Washington is the country's most economically confident region. The Nats' marketing department has come up with a slogan that happens to fit the mood: Natitude.
Some of the local prosperity, of course, is not worth celebrating. It stems from what economists call rent-seeking -- tapping into the economic value created by someone else, rather than creating new value.
In Washington's case, the rent-seeking takes the form of capturing even a small portion of the financial gusher flowing to and from the federal government. The lobbyists, consultants and defense contractors building some of those mansions in McLean and Potomac are doing so, in effect, with government dollars from military or Medicare or other budgets. As most of the country continues to struggle through an agonizingly slow recovery, Washington uncomfortably calls to mind the rapacious Capitol in Suzanne Collins's ''Hunger Games'' series.
Still, Washington's good times are not all -- or even mostly -- about rent-seeking. The region has two legitimate economic lessons to offer the rest of the country.
The narrower of the two is a reminder that, for all its unpopularity, a Keynesian response to an economic crisis really can make a difference. The Washington area's households and businesses have cut back in recent years, too, but their frugality has been offset by steady government spending. If anything, government has helped fill the void, with the District of Columbia's having received more stimulus dollars per capita than any state, according to an analysis by ProPublica.
In the worldwide experiment on fiscal policy that's been run during the past few years, Washington has joined China firmly in the stimulus camp. Much of the rest of the United States, where almost two million state and local government jobs have disappeared, looks more like austerity-hobbled Europe.
Washington's second lesson is arguably even more important. If you wanted to imagine what the economy might look like if the country were much better educated, you can look at Washington.
Thanks to strong public-school and higher-education systems in Maryland and Virginia, the area's teenagers are much more likely to enter and graduate from college than teenagers elsewhere. Even the city's troubled school system has improved somewhat. The region also tends to attract skilled immigrants from around the world (which has the delicious side benefit of a thriving suburban restaurant scene).
About 47 percent of the region's adults have a bachelor's degree, more than any other major metropolitan area in the country, according to the Census Bureau. In an economy ever more organized around knowledge, Washington's employers -- from biotechnology and Internet companies to retail and health care -- have an easier time finding workers who fit their needs. Especially in bad times, employers can have more confidence they are hiring someone they will want to keep.
How do we know that education matters more than stimulus or rent-seeking? Other highly educated regions, like Boston and Minneapolis, join Washington near the bottom of the unemployment ranking and the top of the household-income ranking. ''The more a person learns, the more a person earns,'' Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland told me last week.
There are obviously exceptions to that rule, just as there are exceptions to the good times in Washington. The federal spending cuts in military and domestic programs scheduled to start on Jan. 1, 2013, would have an outsize effect on the Washington economy if they take effect. The current mayor of Washington is enmeshed in a series of scandals reminiscent of the bad old 1980s. The Nationals' lineup is saddled with too many weak hitters who don't know how to draw a walk.
But Washington's strengths are a good bet to outlast its weaknesses. High-skill economies can overcome temporary downturns. And young superstars eventually tend to find the supporting cast they deserve.
Until then, most Washington fans will just be happy to have a baseball team playing meaningful August games -- especially in a broiling August of a desultory presidential campaign.

HEADLINE: A Confederacy of Bachelors

BYLINE: By HILARY HOWARD

 BODY:
WHAT if you had never settled down? Never taken that job for the health insurance, or decided to start a family? For New Yorkers of a certain age, those are the middle-of-the night questions, the nagging thoughts that occur as they squeeze themselves onto the packed No. 1 train for another day at the office, ignoring that unfinished screenplay or latent desire to chuck everything and live in an ashram.
New Yorkers in midlife crisis, meet the brotherhood of Fortress Astoria: Danaher Dempsey, Luke Crane, Rick Brown and Shyaporn Theerakulstit, best friends and artists.
They have no children, no linear career histories, no readily disposable savings. The four men, all heterosexual, approaching 40 and never married, have lived together for 18 years, give or take a revolving guest roommate, cohabitating in spaces like an East Village walk-up, a Chelsea loft and, now, a converted office space in Queens. 
Their latest home, which they have nicknamed Fortress Astoria, takes up the second and third floors of a slate gray concrete block building with floor-to-ceiling windows on 31st Street. The setup is ideal for four bachelors. Bedrooms do not share common walls, and there are communal spaces both upstairs (huge television, sofa) and down (kitchen). There is a lovely garden out back tended by Mr. Theerakulstit.
The apartment presents itself as a mix of man-child fantasy and discerning urban sophistication -- Peter Pan meets the man cave. Action hero figurines, many still in their boxes, are displayed over the doorways, while film snob DVDs (by directors like Akira Kurosawa or Preston Sturges) line the shelves. There are expensive Mac computers in the bedrooms, and the kitchen holds an impressive array of spices (turmeric, pink peppercorns, cardamom), not one but two mortars and pestles, designer Japanese knives and a seltzer-making machine.
But dinner on a recent night was takeout pizza and garlic knots, served on paper plates. And in one of the downstairs bathrooms, a chopstick serves as a toilet paper holder.
Sociologically, the men represent the apotheosis of two trends in American life. While Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg may be promoting the idea of tiny apartments for singles, the most recent census figures suggest that many people do not want to live alone; they prefer or need the company: The number of roommates in nonfamily households in New York City increased by more than 40 percent between 2000 and 2010. At the same time, Americans, especially men, have been pushing back the age at which they first marry -- for men, it climbed to 28.2 years in 2010, up from 26.8 a decade earlier.
Indeed, though the men might resist putting so much weight upon their living arrangement, they are part of an ongoing redefinition of family life in the 21st century, in which traditional structures are replaced by fluid networks and bonds not dependent on blood ties.
''Now there are so many variations on how to live,'' said Bella DePaulo, a social scientist and author of the book ''Singled Out.'' Many adults in middle age and beyond, she said, are choosing the ''friendship model'' for their living needs, opting for roommate arrangements similar to what they had in college or in their 20s, ''except now they're so much more thoughtful about it.''
Judith Stacey, a sociologist at New York University and author of the book ''Unhitched,'' added that traditional couples and families carried conflicting ''demands and tensions of desire and domesticity,'' while living among friends meant that ''the vagaries of sexual attraction don't disrupt your security and stability.'' This kind of communal living is especially good for creative types, she said. ''It's an easy way to get support and it's less of a threat to your artistic life.''
Which sounds about right to these men. ''We've somehow drifted into this place where we are really close, and care about each other deeply, and yet we give each other lots of space and stay out of each other's daily business,'' said Mr. Brown, a senior editor at VH1, the cable network. ''We've got all the benefits of a family with very little of the craziness that normally comes along with them,'' he added.
IT is a sweltering Thursday night in June, and the four men have gathered to talk about their living arrangement. As they chat and eat dinner, Mr. Theerakulstit works on a costume for a friend's impromptu video project, to be shot later that night. The project, quite possibly inspired by Mr. Theerakulstit's own elaborate and self-directed videos that he posts on his YouTube channel, is a spoof of the ''G.I. Joe'' comic. He sits on the floor with his jet-black hair in a long braid slithering down his back and a glue gun in hand. ''Does this look ridiculous?'' he asks at one point, holding a mask he had fashioned from a plastic liter bottle over his eyes.
''No, it looks really good,'' Mr. Dempsey says. The other two nod in approval.
Imagination and creativity have always been important to the men, who met at N.Y.U. in 1991, three of them through a role-playing group organized by Mr. Crane. While still in college, they lived in neighboring dorm rooms. For a brief stint in 1994, a two-bedroom, fourth-floor walk-up on East Fifth Street was home to Mr. Crane, Mr. Brown and Mr. Dempsey.
Then, in 1996, the group discovered a 2,000-square-foot loft in Chelsea -- dark and industrial with an elevator that opened directly into their common area -- with a monthly rent of $2,800. At first, Mr. Theerakulstit stayed on the couch as an ''honorary'' roommate, while other renters cycled through.
But Mr. Theerakulstit made things official in 2005. On his first day as a rent-payer, he flopped on the communal couch and announced, ''I am never leaving here,'' Mr. Crane recalled. The quartet was complete.
''I have so many warm memories of one us just standing in the other one's doorway, and just talking,'' Mr. Brown said. They regularly gathered for role-playing games, ''Monday Night Football'' or cooking Sri Lankan meals, Mr. Dempsey's specialty.
Splitting the rent four ways gave the roommates the economic freedom they needed to pursue their dreams. For Mr. Brown that meant making films; for Mr. Dempsey and Mr. Theerakulstit it was acting. Mr. Crane channeled his interest in fantasy into creating The Burning Wheel, a role-playing game he first published in 2002.
None have come close to making it big, although Mr. Crane is somewhat famous in the niche world of role-playing. But compromise has come hard.
For years, Mr. Brown dodged permanent video editing assignments for short-term gigs so he could write a screenplay and make a short film. But then, he said, he ''crashed and burned'' after investing 18 grueling months -- and his savings -- in the film, which received ''disappointing'' responses at various screenings. ''I've kind of let go of the obsession and anxiety of expressing myself,'' he said, ''and just given myself permission to work and live.''
Mr. Dempsey at one point took a job as a data analyst at Pfizer that gave him health insurance and a paid vacation for the first time in his life. But he felt stifled by full-time office culture, preferring to work part time for a Web design company and pursue a career in the fitness industry while phasing out his acting career. ''To my friends who were married and had kids, what I did was incomprehensible,'' he said. ''I knew that if I'd stayed, I'd probably be making tons of money, but I would have been unhappy.''
Soon he was completely eschewing Off-Off Broadway to become a personal trainer, and this fall he is to begin pursuing a degree in physical therapy. He said he felt insecure about his choices sometimes, but the benefits of his alternative, Fortress Astoria-based lifestyle have outweighed the losses.
''The freedom this has allowed me to have -- to figure out my own quirks and foibles -- has been much more important than investing in things that might have tied me down to something that would have kept me from figuring those other things out,'' he said.
''Our definition of adulthood and what we want to get out of life are different from many people's,'' said Mr. Theerakulstit, who narrates audiobooks among other odd jobs to pay the rent. He then quickly struck a ninja pose in his completed costume for the ''G.I. Joe'' character Snake Eyes. ''How do I look?''
''Good, but you need different pants,'' Mr. Dempsey said.
FOUR years ago, the group faced its biggest challenge when the building they were living in was sold and the rent more than doubled.
For other people, that might have been the time to break up. After all, they were all 35, had lived together for more than a decade and their college days were long behind them.
Instead, they committed to hunting for a space big enough to keep them together. ''We had a good thing going and none of us wanted it to end,'' Mr. Dempsey said.
The apartment search, three months long, was harrowing. The men, accustomed to a 2,000-square-foot space, were looking for something comparable, with four separate bedrooms. Mr. Crane, who ultimately discovered Fortress Astoria, said, ''I just remember wanting to kill you all.''
Mr. Dempsey concurred. ''It was a frustrating time. Everyone had complaints about each place we toured.''
''Each guy had to feel like he'd been accommodated,'' Mr. Crane said.
The building's ground floor is home to a barbershop from which the sound of merengue music filters upward, much to the men's chagrin. The floors above were supposed to house offices, but the owner discovered the building was not zoned for commercial use above the first floor. The elevated N train rattles by 100 feet outside the windows, but the place, which rents for $3,350, sprawls over 2,100 square feet, including the garden, with enough bedrooms for all.
The men use a joint checking account to pay their rent, and Mr. Crane pays for the Internet while Mr. Brown is in charge of the electricity. ''Our system is, we wait for Rick to tell us two months after the bill has been sent that it's overdue and then we scramble to pay it,'' said Mr. Theerakulstit, who cultivated the back garden, putting in everything from a giant sunflower to bok choy, brussels sprouts, Thai herbs, and even a fish pond.
To make the pond he originally buried a large plastic clothing container in the ground. ''But a drunken attendee at a party a few years back decided to step into it, and it cracked,'' he said. He built another pond.
There are two half-baths and only one full bath, with a diminutive shower and no tub. Sharing the shower does not seem to be a problem, though, because each roommate is on a different schedule -- these days, it's rare for them all to be home at the same time.
SPLASHED across the men's refrigerator are wedding and birth announcements -- ''the people who are growing up around us,'' as Mr. Theerakulstit puts it.
''None of us has invested in a career, or property, or family. And I think about this, obviously,'' Mr. Crane said, adding that, in the past, he had had two serious girlfriends who wanted him to move in with them. Both times he chose to stay put.
But he is all right with that choice. Many of his friends, Mr. Crane said, got married in their 20s and early 30s, and now many of them are unhappy and divorcing. He said he was confident that he and his roommates had avoided ''that first unhappy marriage.''
And they do have girlfriends. For the past eight months Mr. Brown has been dating Monica Ross, 25, a bartender and actress. ''She was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar,'' said Mr. Brown of the night they met. There was immediate ''sarcastic banter,'' said Ms. Ross, adding that she almost decided she could not date him when she discovered his age. But he won her over. ''Rick seemed more accepting and generous than any other guy I'd been with; he was genuine.''
Ms. Ross found Fortress Astoria pretty genuine, too, despite the fact that Mr. Brown's room looked like her ''high school locker.'' At first, she said, she found the communal living a bit overwhelming. But then she read, in Andrew Weil's 2011 best-seller, ''Spontaneous Happiness,'' that people living alone tended to get depressed more often and more easily than people who lived together. ''That spoke to me,'' she said.
Now she has a key to the apartment's front door -- ''I thought, here's this really weird family I can just walk in on now!'' she said, of receiving the key -- and in unofficial household discussions, Mr. Brown has been voted ''most likely to leave Fortress Astoria first.''
However, another woman in Mr. Brown's life is less pleased with his living arrangements: his mother. ''I don't think she's terribly happy about it,'' he said. ''I'm 39 years old and still living with my college buddies, and I think the whole idea makes her uncomfortable; it's simply not what a grown man is supposed to be doing.''
''My mom just wants me to go to grad school,'' Mr. Theerakulstit said. (''All Asian mothers just want their children to go to grad school,'' he added). He also has a regular girlfriend, Stacey Shub, a single mother in her 40s who works in the tech industry. They met after he sent her a link to his YouTube channel on the dating site OkCupid. She was so smitten on their first date, she said, ''he could have told me he lived in a tree and I would have been O.K. with it.''
So when she first visited Fortress Astoria, she really was not taken aback.
''It's almost like they have four really tiny studio apartments,'' she said. But, when showering, ''you realize you're in a home with four men, or man-children,'' she added, using Mr. Theerakulstit's term for the roommates.
HART CRANE, Mr. Crane's younger brother, started visiting the men from his home in North Carolina when he was 9. Now he is 22.
''When I was a kid, I just felt like it was how they lived in New York,'' he said. ''After all these years, I still see it as practical. But I also think what they have together is pretty unique; they're all like brothers, like family.''
But it goes without saying that being a struggling artist or entrepreneur in New York becomes more complicated as one gets older. Bourgeois comforts like savings accounts and paid vacations start to matter.
And freedom grows harder with age. In December, Mr. Dempsey will be the first roommate to turn 40, followed by Mr. Theerakulstit and Mr. Crane in the spring, and Mr. Brown next August. Will they all still be living at Fortress Astoria a year from now? That's hard to say.
And the alternatives are unclear. ''Career and marriage go hand in hand, right?'' asked Mr. Theerakulstit. ''Unless your career is stable, moving into that next phase of life, having a family, doesn't work out so well.''
And so, for the moment, anyway, a brotherhood continues.
''I think the secret to our success is that we don't think too much about the future,'' Mr. Crane said. ''We live together because we live together. That is all.''

HEADLINE: Lucrative Gambling Pits Tribe Against Tribe

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
OROVILLE, Calif. -- A pitted gravel road snakes through the forest to the Enterprise Rancheria of the Maidu Indians' sole piece of tribal land about 15 miles east of here in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Broken trailers and a hot tub rejiggered to irrigate a garden sit in a clearing, the few acres of flat land where a handful of people live in houses in disrepair.
With little accessible space on its 40-acre territory, the 800-member tribe used government grants last year to buy a nearby trailer park that is now home to a dozen families. About half live in old trailers that were used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to house those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.
To pull itself out of poverty, the tribe applied in 2002 to build an off-reservation casino at a spot with more economic potential, near towns and highways about 35 miles south of here. After the federal government gave its approval last year, the final decision now rests with Gov. Jerry Brown, who is expected to decide on the fate of the Enterprise casino and another tribe's off-reservation proposal by an Aug. 31 deadline. 
But plans for the two casinos are drawing fierce opposition and last-minute lobbying in the state capital from an unexpected source: nearby tribes with casinos that they say will be hurt by the newcomers. Leading the fight against Enterprise is the United Auburn Indian Community, whose casino, Thunder Valley, has become one of America's most profitable and has brought the formerly destitute tribe unimaginable riches.
''It's really sad right now in Indian country with the divide between the haves and have-nots,'' said Cindy Smith, the secretary of Enterprise's tribal council. ''It's just a struggle to get on equal footing. And even when you're on equal footing, you're really not, because we're almost two decades behind.''
Since Indian gambling was legalized in the United States in 1988, only five tribes have gotten final clearance to build casinos off their reservations. The intense campaign against Enterprise and the other applicant, the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians, comes as the gambling market has grown crowded, especially here in California.
Opposing tribes accuse the newcomers of encroaching on areas to which they have no historical ties. ''We have other tribes out there doing what we call reservation shopping,'' said Brenda Adams, the treasurer of United Auburn. ''We played by the rules. We had to stay on our historical lands. They call it equal footing, but is it? We'd like to have a casino in downtown San Francisco, but that's not our territory.''
The issue has raised larger issues in Indian communities across the nation about the goals of gambling. A decade ago, tribes were united in their efforts to further Indian gambling, which was supposed to give them the means to become self-sufficient, said Steven Light, co-director of the University of North Dakota's Institute for the Study of Tribal Gaming Law and Policy. But he said that talk of ''fairness and justice'' has given way in an increasingly competitive market.
A short drive from Sacramento -- and about 30 miles from Enterprise's planned site -- Thunder Valley has a 2,700-machine casino, a 300-room hotel, an amphitheater and a golf course. Helicopters fly in high rollers from San Francisco. With 80 percent of its revenues coming directly from gambling, Thunder Valley is so profitable that it has transformed the lives of its owners, the 400-member United Auburn tribe, most of whom received welfare benefits until the casino opened in 2003, said Ms. Adams, 40.
The tribal council has provided housing for members, built group homes for troubled children and connected residential areas to water and sewer systems. All members receive free health care and dental benefits. Children making the honor roll receive hundreds of dollars as incentives. Tribal trips were made to France, Italy and Mexico.
The tribe's 200 adult members each receive a share of the casino's revenues, a cut that the local news media has reported as $30,000 a month per member but that industry experts estimate is more. Douglas G. Elmets, a spokesman for the tribe and a former White House spokesman during the Reagan administration, said only that members did not need to work for financial reasons, but that many did in tribal affairs.
Another tribe opposing the off-reservation casinos, the 20 members of the Jackson Rancheria of Miwuk Indians, depended on welfare and gathered firewood to make ends meet before gambling, said Rich Hoffman, the casino's chief executive. Now, the tribe owns real estate in California and Nevada; Goldman Sachs manages the tribe's portfolio, which is ''in the hundreds of millions'' of dollars, Mr. Hoffman said.
Still, he was worried that the good times would not last. With the state eager to get a greater share of gambling revenues, Mr. Hoffman said he believed that other forms of non-Indian gambling, particularly online operations, could become legal. ''I don't think the tribes 20 years from now will still have an oligopoly on gaming,'' he said.
Another small tribe, the 60-member Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, has used profits from its Cache Creek casino to buy land and diversify into agriculture. The tribe has hired experts to farm 1,300 acres with a dozen crops. Its wine and olive oil, Seka Hills, is sold in San Francisco. Its new multimillion-dollar olive mill, which other olive oil producers in the area have contracted to use, is scheduled to start operating soon.
The tribe, which used to oppose the off-reservation casinos but is now publicly neutral, has felt the need to diversity beyond gambling. ''Too many eggs in one basket is probably not a good thing,'' said Marshall McKay, the tribal chairman.
Nationally, most tribes, including those with less profitable casinos, remain in poverty, experts say. So opposition, especially from some of the most profitable tribes, rankles the North Fork tribe, one of California's biggest tribes with 1,900 members. Of the state's 104 federally recognized tribes, 61 have casinos in what is the nation's biggest market for Indian gambling.
''They don't want to see other Indians prosper, I guess,'' said Alvin McDonald, 34, one of a handful of people living on the tribe's 80-acre tract on the edge of the Sierra National Forest about 200 miles southeast of here.
The tribe is waiting for the governor's decision on its plans to build a casino on a highway about 35 miles away. Its main opponent, the nearby Picayune Rancheria of the Chukchansi Indians, accuses North Fork of being interlopers from the other side of the Sierra Nevada. The two tribes share many links, including intermarriage.
''That's what makes it more hurtful,'' said Elaine Bethel Fink, 65, the chairwoman of North Fork's tribal council.
Here in Oroville, in the decade that he has fought for a casino, Art Angle, 70, Enterprise's vice chairman and a retired logger, has lost friends in the opposing tribes -- men with whom he had spent a chunk of his life ''logging and partying.''
''They don't look at me in the same way,'' he said.
With the final decision only weeks away, Mr. Angle's worries were turning inward. ''I don't have any money yet,'' he said. ''I don't know what's going to happen in 10 years. I may become as bad as them.''

HEADLINE: Get It Right On Gas

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Nicholas D. Kristof and the public editor are off today.

 BODY:
WE are in the midst of a natural gas revolution in America that is a potential game changer for the economy, environment and our national security -- if we do it right.
The enormous stores of natural gas that have been locked away in shale deposits across America that we've now been able to tap into, thanks to breakthroughs in seismic imaging, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or ''fracking,'' are enabling us to replace much dirtier coal with cleaner gas as the largest source of electricity generation in America. And natural gas may soon be powering cars, trucks and ships as well. This is helping to lower our carbon emissions faster than expected and make us more energy secure. And, if prices stay low, it may enable America to bring back manufacturing that migrated overseas. But, as the energy and climate expert Hal Harvey puts it, there is just one big, hugely important question to be asked about this natural gas bounty: ''Will it be a transition to a clean energy future, or does it defer a clean energy future?'' 
That is the question -- because natural gas is still a fossil fuel. The good news: It emits only half as much greenhouse gas as coal when combusted and, therefore, contributes only half as much to global warming. The better news: The recent glut has made it inexpensive to deploy. But there is a hidden, long-term, cost: A sustained gas glut could undermine new investments in wind, solar, nuclear and energy efficiency systems -- which have zero emissions -- and thus keep us addicted to fossil fuels for decades.
That would be reckless. This year's global extremes of droughts and floods are totally consistent with models of disruptive, nonlinear climate change. After record warm temperatures in the first half of this year, it was no surprise to find last week that the Department of Agriculture has now designated more than half of all U.S. counties -- 1,584 in 32 states -- as primary disaster areas where crops and grazing areas have been ravaged by drought.
That is why on May 29 the British newspaper The Guardian quoted Fatih Birol, the chief economist for the International Energy Agency, as saying that ''a golden age for gas is not necessarily a golden age for the climate'' -- if natural gas ends up sinking renewables. Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the I.E.A., urged governments to keep in place subsidies and regulations to encourage investments in wind, solar and other renewables ''for years to come'' so they remain competitive.
Moreover, while natural gas is cleaner than coal, extracting it can be very dirty. We have to do this right. For instance, the carbon advantage can be undermined by leakage of uncombusted natural gas from wellheads and pipelines because methane -- the primary component of natural gas -- is an extremely powerful greenhouse gas, more powerful than carbon dioxide. The big oil companies can easily maintain high drilling standards, but a lot of fracking is done by mom-and-pop drillers that do not. The standards that can make fracking environmentally O.K. are not expensive, but the big drillers want to make sure that the little guys have to apply them, too, so everyone has the same cost basis.
On July 19, Forbes interviewed George Phydias Mitchell, who, in the 1990s, pioneered the use of fracking to break natural gas free from impermeable shale. According to Forbes, Mitchell argued that fracking needs to be regulated by the Department of Energy, not just states: ''Because if they don't do it right, there could be trouble,'' he says. There's no excuse not to get it right. ''There are good techniques to make it safe that should be followed properly,'' he says. But, the smaller, independent drillers, ''are wild.'' ''It's tough to control these independents. If they do something wrong and dangerous, they should punish them.''
Adds Fred Krupp, the president of the Environmental Defense Fund who has been working with the government and companies on drilling standards: ''The economic and national security advantages of natural gas are obvious, but if you tour some of these areas of intensive development the environmental impacts are equally obvious.'' We need nationally accepted standards for controlling methane leakage, for controlling water used in fracking -- where you get it, how you treat the polluted water that comes out from the fracking process and how you protect aquifers -- and for ensuring that communities have the right to say no to drilling. ''The key message,'' said Krupp, ''is you gotta get the rules right. States need real inspector capacity and compliance schemes where companies certify they have done it right and there are severe penalties if they perjure.''
Energy companies who want to keep regulations lax need to understand that a series of mishaps around natural gas will -- justifiably -- trigger an environmental backlash to stop it.
But we also need to get the economics right. We'll need more tax revenue to reach a budget deal in January. Why not a carbon tax that raises enough money to help pay down the deficit and lower both personal income taxes and corporate taxes -- and ensures that renewables remain competitive with natural gas? That would ensure this gas revolution transforms America, not just our electric grid.

HEADLINE: The Sounds of Two Banks' Silence

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
WHEN is no news big news? When central bankers, confronted by a crisis in this post-Lehman world, convene and take no action.
It happened in both the United States and in Europe last week, with markedly different results.
First, Federal Reserve policy makers convened in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday amid considerable speculation that weak economic data would impel them yet again to stimulate the economy. 
The data was, in fact, quite gloomy, Fed officials said in a statement after their meeting. ''Economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first half of this year,'' the statement said.
Nevertheless, the officials decided to merely ''monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments.'' Essentially, the Fed did nothing -- and James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, was delighted.
''Nothing is exactly what they should be doing right now,'' Mr. Paulsen said in an interview. After years of expansionary monetary policy that has failed to reignite rapid economic growth, he said, ''it's time to let the economy take care of itself.''
On Thursday, it was the European Central Bank's turn to do nothing. While financial markets processed the Fed's inaction rather easily, in Europe's case they evidently expected something much more forceful.
After all, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, raised public expectations on July 26, when he promised that he would ''do whatever it takes to preserve the euro,'' raising the ante even higher with these words: ''Believe me, it will be enough.''
Last week, Mr. Draghi's words weren't enough.
Meeting in Frankfurt, the central bank did not lower its benchmark interest rate, which remains at 0.75 percent. More important, it didn't directly intervene in the bond market to buy the debt of distressed members of the euro zone, as some traders apparently anticipated. (The same day, the Bank of England also took no action, but in the shadow of the London Olympics, this did not amount to big news.)
As details of the European Central Bank's immobility sank in, stocks fell across Europe and elsewhere. The euro declined and Spanish and Italian bond yields rose sharply, while demand surged for seemingly safer sovereign debt, like that of the United States.
In a news conference after the bank meeting, Mr. Draghi's fresh assurances did not mollify the markets.
''It's all been bark and no bite,'' said Eric Stein, a portfolio manager at Eaton Vance.
Mr. Draghi said the central bank, along with European governments and euro area rescue funds, would take measures to reduce punishingly high yields caused by ''fears of the reversibility of the euro'' -- that is, concern that the euro zone will break up. ''The euro is irreversible,'' he said.
But Mr. Stein said the process of resolving the euro zone's problems seemed as tortuous as ever. He said Mr. Draghi viewed the short-term credit market ''as the transmission mechanism for the problems of the peripheral countries'' and would make sure the market functioned smoothly.
Mr. Stein added that in the central bank's view, ''countries need to get their own fiscal houses in order'' if they are to make a long-term solution possible. Getting there from here will not be simple, he said.
The obstacles are many. In Germany, the nation's highest court is considering whether the European Stability Mechanism -- Europe's still-dormant main financial rescue fund -- is permitted under Germany's constitution. It isn't expected to rule until Sept. 12.
EUROPE'S economy, meanwhile, is weakening, a matter of great concern both in the euro zone and around the world.
United Parcel Service, which moves packages globally, said its business was being challenged by the slowdown in Europe, which in turn was affecting exports from both Asia and the United States. ''Economies around the world are showing signs of weakening, and our customers are increasingly nervous, said D. Scott Davis, the U.P.S. chief executive, in a conference call with analysts on July 24.
''In Europe,'' Mr. Davis said, ''the debt crisis lingers on as more countries struggle with austerity measures that are pushing them into recession.'' And in the United States, he said, manufacturing and retail sales numbers in June ''were the worst we've seen since 2009.''
He added: ''Given these trends, we think current second-half economic forecasts for the U.S. are too high and that G.D.P. growth will likely be closer to 1 percent.''
In the United States, corporate earnings season is well under way, and analysts estimate that the growth rate for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 for the second quarter was only 0.40 percent, according to S.& P. Capital IQ. If that turns out to be accurate, it would be the lowest growth rate since the second quarter of 2009, the S.& P. unit said.
Unemployment rose to 8.3 percent in July, from 8.2 percent in June, the Labor Department said Friday, while job creation was modest, with 163,000 new jobs in the month, more than expected.
Despite the signs of weakness, Mr. Paulsen is focusing on indications that the United States economy may have ''bottomed.'' He said the biggest remaining problem might be psychological -- that people's ''animal spirits'' have been depressed by the negative comments of American political and economic leaders.
Further Fed action now -- with both short- and long-term government interest rates extraordinarily low -- would signal that the economy is ill, not healthy. The Fed ought to consider raising rates, not lowering them, he said.
''We need a sign of confidence in the strength of the economy,'' he said. ''And we need to let the economy continue to self-medicate, to heal itself, and that process is already well under way.''
Mr. Stein, for his part, says that if there is no big improvement soon -- and he doesn't expect one -- it's likely that Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, will embark on more large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing, later this election year, possibly in September. ''I think Ben Bernanke just needs to see more data,'' Mr. Stein said. ''I think if the data comes in and it continues to be weak, the Fed will have to act.'
If the Fed does nothing then, it will be even bigger news.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Takes on Health Costs

 BODY:
Give Massachusetts credit for setting audacious health care goals. It took the lead in guaranteeing near-universal health insurance coverage for its residents, providing a template for the federal reforms to follow.
Now a bill passed last week by the Legislature -- and enthusiastically endorsed by Gov. Deval Patrick -- aims to tackle the much harder problem of controlling health care costs. Massachusetts will be the first state to try to cap overall health care spending, both private and public, so that it will grow no faster than the state economy.
The state was able to reach near-universal coverage because the vast majority of its population was already covered by some form of insurance. It also could subsidize coverage for the uninsured using a big pool of money that had been used for charity care. 
But when it comes to controlling health care costs, Massachusetts has no advantage, and in fact is starting behind most other states. Its costs are among the highest in the nation, and they have been growing in recent years at 6 percent to 7 percent while the economy has been growing at less than 4 percent. That bleak picture may be changing. The growth rate of health costs has slowed significantly over the past year or two, but nobody knows if this is a temporary or lasting change.
The new legislation sets a very ambitious target: to hold the annual increase in total health care spending to the rate of growth of the state's gross domestic product for the first five years, through 2017, and then even lower for the next five years, to half a percentage point below the economy's growth rate. The savings are projected to be as high as $200 billion over a 15-year period.
Setting goals is a necessary step, but there is skepticism among health care analysts that these targets could be met in such a short time given the lack of a strong enforcement mechanism in the legislation.
That does not mean the bill is completely toothless. It will establish a commission to monitor the growth in spending and require that health care providers or insurers explain themselves if their costs rise above the target growth rate. If there is no valid reason, the commission can demand that an organization submit a plan to bring its spending back in line. As a last resort, the commission can impose a $500,000 fine if it finds that the organization failed to make a good-faith effort. Many analysts expect the state will have to become increasingly aggressive in demanding cost cutting by providers and insurers if savings do not materialize.
The bill also contains other policy changes. It encourages more hospitals and doctors to set up ''accountable care organizations'' that would move away from traditional fee-for-service billing, which encourages needless tests and procedures. How successful those organizations will be at cutting costs is uncertain.
The law requires the state's Medicaid program, state employee health care program and all other state-financed health care programs to adopt alternatives to fee-for-service payments, like paying a flat fee for all the care a patient will need over a year or bundling payments for doctors and hospitals to coordinate a patient's care.
Other useful provisions include a requirement that health care providers report regularly on cost trends and quality measures, which should help patients shop comparatively; a new $60 million fund to invest in programs to reduce obesity, diabetes, asthma and other chronic diseases; $30 million to accelerate conversion to electronic health records; and malpractice reforms that could reduce litigation without imposing caps on damage awards.
Some critics worry that the state will not have the personnel and resources to do an effective job of enforcing these provisions. Others warn that the bill could impose burdensome regulations on health care providers and damage a cornerstone of the state's economy.
Still, hospital and doctors' groups have been supportive, and the bill was approved unanimously in the Senate and overwhelmingly in the Assembly. That may be a sign, some say, that the bill lacks the teeth needed to control the way providers set prices.
But don't count Massachusetts out. It led the way in expanding coverage. What happens there on cost control will offer valuable lessons for the rest of the country.

HEADLINE: Man Suspected of Faking His Death Has Returned to New York, Officials Say

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
Officials investigating the disappearance of a Long Island man who seemed to try to fake his own death last week said on Saturday that he had returned to New York, but that they had not decided whether to charge him with a crime. 
The man, Raymond Roth, 47, disappeared in the waters off Jones Beach on July 28, prompting an extensive police search, involving a helicopter and boats, that turned up nothing. His wife, Evana Roth, said on Friday that she had found e-mails implicating Mr. Roth in the staging of his death and that she feared for her safety.
Detective Thomas Duignan of the New York State Park Police said by telephone on Saturday that officers met with the Nassau County district attorney's office but were not ready to speak with Mr. Roth or his son, Jonathan, who had called to report his father missing and was suspected of being involved in the disappearance. He confirmed that Mr. Roth, an unemployed telecommunications manager from Massapequa, had returned to New York but could not give further details.
Investigators said that Mr. Roth had not been charged with a crime.
''We're not planning to make any arrests today,'' Detective Duignan said.
A lawyer for Ms. Roth, Lenard Leeds, reiterated concerns about his client's safety on Saturday amid reports by neighbors that Mr. Roth had been seen near the couple's home late Thursday.
Ms. Roth would seek an order of protection against her husband, Mr. Leeds said by telephone.
''We think that he's an imminent threat to her,'' he said.
On July 28, Jonathan Roth, 22, reported that his father had disappeared after swimming off Jones Beach. Raymond Roth, who was presumed dead after the search, was stopped for speeding in South Carolina on Aug. 2, but was not detained.
Ms. Roth, a doctor's receptionist, said that she had begun preparing for her husband's funeral when she learned that he was still alive. Since then, she said, Mr. Roth has repeatedly tried to contact her by telephone, though Mr. Leeds said she had refused to speak with him. The whereabouts of Jonathan Roth, who is Ms. Roth's stepson, was unknown.
In a news conference on Friday, Ms. Roth described her husband as a verbally abusive alcoholic. She said she did not know why he tried to fake his death, though she said he was fired on July 20, shortly after he had threatened to shoot two supervisors.
Mr. Roth turned over a licensed gun he owned on July 21, after a police inquiry.
Mr. Leeds said Ms. Roth had given away four other firearms that Mr. Roth had owned. He said Ms. Roth would seek a divorce and attempt to regain full ownership of the family's home. She said that Mr. Roth had coerced her into transferring the home into both their names in April.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Assemblyman Accused of Writing Bad Checks Blames Economy

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
TRENTON -- A New Jersey assemblyman who was arrested on Friday and accused of writing nearly $400,000 in bad checks from his military-contracting business accounts blamed the poor economy for his financial and legal problems. 
The assemblyman, Robert Schroeder, a Republican from Washington Township in Bergen County, told The Record of Bergen County that his business, All Points International Distributors, had been ''in decline during the Obama administration.''
The federal Government Accountability Office said it had passed over All Points for a contract to provide tents for an Army unit in Afghanistan last year, even though Mr. Schroeder's business submitted a lower bid than competitors, because it had found the company's past performance to be unacceptable.
Mr. Schroeder, 52, the founder and president of All Points, said that checks he had written to two suppliers bounced. He said he had written them assuming that several thousand dollars the Army owed him for a contract had been wired to the account.
Mr. Schroeder said that the checks totaled about $100,000 and that he had paid the debts.
''I made a mistake; I apologize,'' Mr. Schroeder said. ''I'm responsible for my actions.''
If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $150,000 fine.

HEADLINE: A Spanish Hat Factory Thrives on Orders From a Finicky Brooklyn

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

 BODY:
SEVILLE, Spain -- Since its founding 127 years ago, the Fernandez y Roche factory on the edge of this Andalusian capital has weathered every crisis known to hatters.
It surmounted the 1930s ''hatless'' trend that eschewed fedoras. It survived the sliding popularity of the birettas and saturnos worn by Roman Catholic priests. And, now, it is weathering a decline in Spanish sales of the most elemental symbol of Andalusia, the stiff-brimmed cordobes hat favored by horseback riders and the occasional bullfighter.
But despite the Spanish economic crisis, the hat company is thriving, thanks to an unlikely revenue base: the sales of thousands of black hats each year to Satmar Hasidic Jews in Jerusalem and Brooklyn.
''They are saving us in the crisis,'' said Miguel Garcia Gutierrez, 35, the managing director of the Roche factory, officially known as Industrias Sombrereras Espanolas, which operates in an industrial park in Salteras, about nine miles outside Seville. ''We have an important market in Spain for traditional hats, but with the crisis those sales have fallen for the last three years, between 20 and 30 percent. But our exports are rising for hats for Orthodox Jews.'' 
The business is flourishing even though Andalusia's unique artisans are suffering as demand falls in weak domestic markets. That includes everyone, from third generation artists who make ''borlas'' -- the silken tassels that swing from elaborate religious floats -- to families that embroider robes for statues of the Virgin Mary paraded through Seville during the city's all-important Easter week activities.
The Satmars, one of the largest Hasidic sects with more than 150,000 members, left Hungary and Romania after World War II and settled in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, their main stronghold. There are also communities in Jerusalem and London.
The Spanish factory began supplying hats to the group's enclaves in Brooklyn in 1980, after an American hat maker shut down and a Brooklyn store, Kova Quality Hatters, started looking for new manufacturers.
Today, the factory still produces traditional monteras for bullfighters, a stable niche market, and plumed, dress military hats made from a collection of more than 2,000 wooden molds. But its growth industry is the basic black felt hat, selling more than 12,500 of them a year -- largely purchased by the growing Satmar sect. More than 70 percent of all their hats are exported to the United States, England, Japan, Belgium and Israel.
The hats for the Orthodox Jewish market are not listed in any catalog or Web site. The three popular models make distinctive fashion statements summed up by their names: Bent Up, Snap Brim and the Clergy, which lacks a crease in the crown and is bound around the brim.
''It may seem like they are all very similar black hats, but actually this group has its own fashions,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''Styles are constantly evolving with a crown that is higher or lower or a brim that is wider or narrower.''
Those barely perceptible differences in plain black hats are important markers, according to Ester Muchawsky-Schnapper, the curator of a popular exhibit that is drawing 800 people a day at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem on the lives and customs of Hasidic Jews, including the Satmar sect and their hats.
Some groups wear hats with satin ribbons around the crown that fold into a bow on the right side while others wear it on the left, said Ms. Muchawsky-Schnapper, adding that these differences reflect the choices of the groups' leaders and members. Brims are a decisive feature.
''You can differentiate the different groups by their hats,'' she said, noting that another Hasidic sect, the Lubavitchers, draws meaning from a triangle-shaped crease at the crown, which signifies ''wisdom, knowledge and understanding.'' The Satmars in Jerusalem wear a very flat hat of rabbit hair, which is more velvety than the Satmar hats in New York, she said.
In the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, Albert Ehrman is the second generation in his family to run the half-century-old Kova Quality Hatters from a brick storefront. He travels each year to southern Spain with his wife, Miriam, to personally inspect the Clergy hats, the most popular with his Satmar clients.
This summer, he spent hours with a small metal ruler, measuring hat brims for uniformity and demanding a ''good, sharp edge'' for the Clergy, which lately have been narrowing and selling for up to $175 in the United States.
The factory is equipped with rare wooden, antique combing machines that date to the turn of the last century and are used to produce felt made from rabbit, hare and beaver furs. Most of its 40 employees learned their skills at the factory because there are no classes for milliners.
In the summer, when the air is dry, the felt is shaped into crowns and stiffened with a golden resin from India, before being steam-molded into shape. Seamstresses add hatbands, ribbons and labels, some on a vintage Willcox and Gibbs sewing machine.
''We try to take the bugs out of the system,'' Mr. Ehrman said, his voice carrying above the factory clatter. ''Our customers are much more particular than the people in the factory. The shape should be just right. When they wear the hat, they want it to have a crisp look, not just a soft look like you wear wherever it lands.''
A visit to his store is a rite of passage for generations of families who bring children in when they turn 13 to choose Spanish-made Snap Brims and Clergys, often simply called a ''Roche,'' shorthand for the company, Fernandez y Roche, though by coincidence it also means ''head'' in Hebrew.
''It's fascinating to me,'' said Simon Yisrael Feuerman, 49, a New Jersey psychotherapist who wears his Snap Brim on Saturdays and is one of three generations of loyal ''Roche'' customers who shop at Kova.
''The male identity is so profound in the community. A visit to Kova is really the one time that they act with vanity. They keep looking at the hat,'' he said. ''The differences are crucial once they put on the Roche. Is this brim too big? Does this make me too fat? There is nothing more important than the hat. Nothing. Not even nuclear war.''
What does he think about the ivory lining in his Snap Brim marked with the name of a distant Seville company and the words ''Made in Spain''?
''It's so remote,'' he mused. ''Nobody thinks about this. People would look at you like you were insane. In people's minds, it could be straight from Moses.''

HEADLINE: The World Behind The Tinted Window

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
THE social theorist Marshall McLuhan famously described media as ''extensions of man.'' The filmmaker David Cronenberg, a fellow Canadian, has made several movies that count as mind-bending elaborations of that insight.
In ''Videodrome'' (1983) a video signal embedded in a pornographic cable broadcast causes hallucinations and bodily transformations in its viewers. The game players of ''eXistenZ'' (1999) download alternate realities by plugging squishy protoplasmic pods directly into their spines. Mr. Cronenberg's latest film, ''Cosmopolis,'' takes place in a spectral world of global capital, digital information and virtual everything. Its currency-trading billionaire hero, cocooned in a white stretch limousine that serves as a second skin, deals and speaks in abstractions and is himself something of a hologram, an inscrutable young master of a conceptual universe. 
''Cosmopolis,'' due Aug. 17 from eOne, follows the suave Eric Packer (played by the ''Twilight'' heartthrob Robert Pattinson) on what proves to be a day of reckoning. Inching through Manhattan traffic for a haircut on the other side of town, he receives a succession of experts and analysts in his leather-upholstered sanctum, which doubles as a boardroom, a bedroom and even a doctor's office. External distractions -- a presidential motorcade, anti-capitalist demonstrations -- appear through tinted windows and on touch screens. Everything happens and is experienced at a dreamlike remove. Eric's bet against the Chinese yuan has turned disastrous, but he responds with eerie detachment, numbly contemplating the prospect of his economic and actual extinction.
Based on a 2003 novel by Don DeLillo, ''Cosmopolis'' merges the distinctive sensibilities of a filmmaker and a novelist who have both been called prophetic, a shorthand way of saying that both have their antennas up for the larger forces -- language, technology, the collections of images and systems of knowledge -- that shape our world and our sense of reality. Films and footage, like the Zapruder home movie in ''Libra,'' often play crucial roles in Mr. DeLillo's books, but while several of his novels have been optioned for adaptation -- ''White Noise'' and ''Libra'' were in the works for years -- until now all had stalled in development.
''Cosmopolis'' is hardly obvious screen material on the page. But Mr. Cronenberg has located cinematic life in other novels that many would deem unfilmable, whether for being too bizarre (William S. Burroughs's ''Naked Lunch''), too graphic (J. G. Ballard's ''Crash'') or too interior (Patrick McGrath's ''Spider'').
In an interview at the Cannes Film Festival, where ''Cosmopolis'' had its premiere in May, Mr. Cronenberg spoke about his approach to adaptation. ''You have to betray the book in order to be faithful to the book,'' he said. ''You have to recognize that literature is not cinema.''
But ''Cosmopolis,'' which some critics in Cannes faulted for being too static, is an almost perversely faithful rendition of the book. On the phone from Toronto recently, Mr. Cronenberg said that claustrophobia was very much the point. ''I love the ascetic idea of so much happening within a limo,'' he said. ''I don't find that it forces you into monotony. Quite the opposite, it forces you to be innovative.''
He looked at films that were restricted to cramped locations -- the submarine-set ''Das Boot,'' and ''Lebanon,'' which unfolds inside an Israeli tank -- and he even moved one scene, an encounter between Eric and his art dealer, from an apartment into the car.
Mr. DeLillo, for one, might argue that there is something inherently cinematic about this contained structure. His one produced screenplay to date -- for the 2005 indie ''Game 6'' -- is also about a character stuck in traffic, trying to get from point A to B. ''A man on a horse crossing the screen from right to left, or left to right -- there's something about that that strikes me as the essence of American cinema,'' Mr. DeLillo said in a recent phone interview from his home in New York. ''In this case we have a man in a limousine who's crossing the screen in a rather different way of course. But it's that idea of a journey that will be resolved in the simplest and maybe the most violent possible way.''
The limo built for the film was a ''Lego-like modular structure,'' Mr. Cronenberg said. ''It had to come apart for lighting, for sound, for camera.'' In keeping with Eric's stipulations that his car be ''prousted'' -- lined with cork, a la Proust's room, to shut out the din of the outside world -- Mr. Cronenberg instructed his sound designers to keep the limo scenes free of ambient noise. Not even the hum of the engine is audible.
This airless bubble is an oddly apt vessel for Mr. DeLillo's heightened language, which Mr. Cronenberg transcribed almost verbatim. (He wrote the script in a mere six days.) ''It's very stylized,'' Mr. Cronenberg said of Mr. DeLillo's dialogue, ''but it also taps into some inner rhythms of the American psyche.''
Some reviewers were put off by the novel's clipped cadences -- Walter Kirn in The New York Times Book Review described the dialogue in the book as ''an unholy collaboration between Harold Pinter and Robby the Robot'' -- but Mr. Cronenberg embraced the artifice. ''I can hear naturalistic dialogue any day on the street,'' he said. ''What I wanted was not just to hear this dialogue spoken but to see actors embody it. They bring it to life in a physical, corporeal way.''
Amid a revolving door of mostly female visitors played by the likes of Juliette Binoche and Samantha Morton, the impassive constant is Mr. Pattinson. ''I don't think Rob's face has ever been examined in such excruciating detail, from so many angles,'' Mr. Cronenberg said. ''That was part of the casting. You want a face that can take that.''
Mr. Pattinson acknowledged that the part was challenging. ''The dialogue seemed to flow really easily,'' he said. (He was speaking shortly after his appearance at Comic-Con International last month, before the recent tabloid furor over the dalliances of his girlfriend and ''Twilight'' co-star Kristen Stewart.) ''But when you approach the character in a conventional way and try to figure out who he is, that becomes terrifying.'' He added: ''I kept trying to hold on to that element of not really understanding him. I think David liked the takes when I had literally no idea what I was doing.''
Even now the movie remains elusive for Mr. Pattinson, who said he had seen it four times: twice he was baffled (''It was impossible to crack'') and twice he connected with the dry absurdist comedy. ''David just presents it as deadpan, and people don't know whether to laugh or not,'' he said.
Often considered a progenitor of body horror, Mr. Cronenberg has an underappreciated sense of humor. ''Cosmopolis,'' much like ''Crash'' and ''Naked Lunch,'' highlights the mordant comedy of the source material. ''People keep saying to me, 'Do you ever think of doing a comedy?' And I say, 'Well, I've made tons of them,' '' Mr. Cronenberg said. ''You have much more freedom to be subtle and dark in a comedy that's not being presented as a comedy.''
In some ways ''Cosmopolis'' continues many themes from his previous movie, the Freud and Jung drama of ideas ''A Dangerous Method.'' Eric's journey could be thought of in Freudian terms: a death drive. Both these dialogue-heavy films also share a view of language as an instrument of power. ''In 'A Dangerous Method' language is being reshaped and terms being invented for phenomena that had not yet been recognized,'' Mr. Cronenberg said. ''There's some of that also in 'Cosmopolis,' where the terminology is a question of power.''
If ''Cosmopolis'' was greeted in some quarters as a post-Sept. 11 novel, it now appears to have anticipated the recent financial crisis. ''The world seems to have caught up with that book,'' Mr. Cronenberg said, adding that the Occupy Wall Street movement was heating up as they were shooting the protest scenes. But he cautioned against making too much of the connections: ''It's certainly not mine or Don's aspiration to be a prophet.''
Mr. Cronenberg's apocalyptic film is perhaps best appreciated not for its topical links to the real world but for giving form to the nightmares of our age. ''I wanted to play 'Cosmopolis' as absolutely real as you could,'' Mr. Cronenberg said. ''It's a realism that's disturbing because it's so close to reality, and yet you know it's not. I suppose at that point you're talking about dream reality.'' He added: ''I've always thought that movies work in terms of dream logic. Even movies that present themselves as 100 percent real, it's still a dream.''

HEADLINE: Craving Energy and Glory, Pakistan Revels in Boast of Water-Run Car

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH; Salman Masood contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- In a nation thirsting for energy, he loomed like a messiah: a small-town engineer who claimed he could run a car on water.
The assertion -- based on the premise that he had discovered a way to easily split the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in water molecules with almost no energy -- would, if proven, represent a stunning breakthrough for physics and a near-magical solution to Pakistan's desperate power crisis.
''By the grace of Allah, I have managed to make a formula that converts less voltage into more energy,'' the professed inventor, Agha Waqar Ahmad, said in a telephone interview. ''This invention will solve our country's energy crisis and provide jobs to hundreds of thousands of people.'' 
Established scientists have debunked his spectacular claims, first made one month ago, saying they violate ironclad laws of physics. But across Pakistan, where crippling electricity cuts have left millions drenched in the sweat of a powerless summer, and where there is hunger for tales of homegrown glory, the shimmering mirage of a ''water car'' received a broad and serious embrace.
Federal ministers lauded Mr. Ahmad and his vehicle, sometimes at cabinet meetings. The stand-in minister for religious affairs, Khursheed Shah, appeared on television with him and took a ride in his small Suzuki rental, which was hooked up to a contraption that Mr. Ahmad described as a ''water kit.'' Respected talk show hosts suggested he should get state financing and protection.
The country's most famous scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan -- revered inside Pakistan as the father of the country's nuclear weapons program and reviled elsewhere as a notorious figure in the international nuclear black market -- gave it his imprimatur, too. ''I have investigated the matter, and there is no fraud involved,'' he told Hamid Mir, a popular television journalist, during a recent broadcast that sealed Mr. Ahmad's celebrity.
The quest to harness chemical energy from water is a holy grail of science, offering the tantalizing promise of a world free from dependence on oil. Groups in other countries, including Japan, the United States and Sri Lanka, have previously made similar claims. They have been largely ignored.
Not so with Mr. Ahmad, even if he is an unlikely scientific prodigy. Forty years old and a father of five, he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1990 from a small technical college in Khairpur, in southern Sindh Province, he said in the interview. For most of his career he worked in a local police department. He is currently unemployed.
But he sprang up at a moment when Pakistan was intensely aware of its power shortcomings. Violent riots erupted across Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Provinces recently as temperatures in some places hovered around 110 degrees amid electricity shortages that stretched up to 20 hours per day. Chronic shortages of natural gas, which powers many cars and homes, result in lines snaking from gas stations. Energy politics are expected to play a prominent role in elections set to take place within the next 10 months.
In another measure of the issue, the United States government has donated heavily to electricity generation projects, hoping to win support from Pakistan's largely hostile public; last week, Congress authorized $280 million for various hydroelectric projects.
News media commentators said the coverage of Mr. Ahmad's claims was the Pakistani version of Britain's ''silly season,'' when journalists and politicians embrace the unlikely during the annual lull in politics. But for established scientists, it was a symptom of a wider, more worrisome, ignorance of science.
It shows ''how far Pakistan has fallen into the pit of ignorance and self-delusion,'' wrote Pervez Hoodbhoy, an outspoken physics professor, in The Express Tribune, a national English-language daily. He added: ''Our leaders are lost in the dark, fumbling desperately for a miracle; our media is chasing spectacle, not truth; and our great scientists care more about being important than about evidence.''
The ''water car'' is not the first unlikely episode in Pakistani science. In 2010 Atta ur-Rahman, head of the state higher education body, aired views that the United States government was financing a covert science project in Alaska that sought to manipulate the world's weather and that could set off earthquakes, floods and tsunamis.
Dr. Rahman's article incited a furious public debate with other scientists, notably Dr. Hoodbhoy, who has also sought to highlight a worrisome decline in academic standards in Pakistan.
Stories of widespread plagiarism, fake qualifications and doctorates granted under dubious circumstances have circulated in academic circles for several years. ''We have had a flood of academic garbage,'' Dr. Hoodbhoy said. The trend was inadvertently accelerated under the military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, who required all members of Parliament to hold a college degree -- prompting some to acquire fake ones.
Pakistan is not lacking in academic talent. With 68 percent of the population under 30, according to the United Nations, education is a preoccupation among parents across the social spectrum. This year 200 Pakistani undergraduates will start at 50 different American colleges under the government-financed Fulbright educational exchange program.
Yet even the country's academic achievements are mired in the old problems of politics, prejudice and religion.
The work of a Pakistani particle physicist, Abdus Salam, won him a Nobel Prize along with two others scientists in 1979, and it has been credited with paving the way for the discovery of what appears to be the Higgs boson particle, which was announced July 4.
But Dr. Salam, who died in 1996, is largely ignored in his homeland because he was a member of the Ahmadi sect, whose members suffer state-sponsored discrimination and, in recent years, attacks by violent extremists.
For his part, Mr. Ahmad brushed off his critics, claiming to have run the Suzuki for 250 miles on 10 liters of water.
''I am not concerned with theory. I have given a practical demonstration that a vehicle can run on water,'' he said. ''What more proof do these critics need?''
In a word, more. ''Water car'' jokes have circulated widely on Twitter, while an Internet comedy group, The Naked Tyrant, rolled out a spoof video featuring a religious man who claimed to make his car run on ''pious deeds.''
And, as a reader of one newspaper noted in a letter to the editor: ''What is odd is that the only specimen so far on display is the one fitted in his own car.''

A COZY living room with a shag rug, an Eames bent-wire chair, a boomerang-shaped coffee table and a picture window that cleverly doubles as a film screen greets the visitor to ''Long Island, America's 1950s Frontier,'' an exhibition at the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages in Stony Brook. Pop songs of the '50s like ''Blue Suede Shoes'' and ''Mr. Sandman'' drift in from another display area, where a gaudy Wurlitzer jukebox sits amid teenagers' memorabilia. On the picture-window screen, glimpses of Levittown from a 1952 newsreel flicker by.
The exhibition reflects a time when ''Long Island was changing by the week,'' said Joshua Ruff, the exhibition's curator. In the early 1950s, Nassau was the fastest-growing county in the nation, he said, ''and when Nassau started filling up, people moved to Suffolk.'' 
The show has attracted hundreds of visitors a day since it opened on July 20, he said, with many staying an exceptionally long time. In addition to about 200 artifacts -- among them an ''Ike'' dress, an old-fashioned gasoline pump, and a hat that belonged to the master planner Robert Moses -- it includes four video screens that play taped interviews with residents reminiscing.
Not everything is about good times. Just as Long Island embodied post-World War II optimism and expansion, Mr. Ruff said, it manifested pervasive problems, including traffic congestion, loss of green space and racism. One video includes an interview with Eugene and Bernice Burnett of Wyandanch, who describe being turned away when they sought to buy a house in Levittown around 1950 because, they were told, the owners were not ready ''to sell to Negroes.''
''That was a dream-shattering experience,'' Mr. Burnett says. ''It was a long ride back to Harlem.''
Mr. Burnett, 83, a retired Suffolk police sergeant and businessman, said in a recent interview that he and his wife moved in 1950 to a development in Amityville that advertised itself as welcoming returning veterans regardless of race. (He had served in the Army.) However, Mr. Burnett said, he and his family ''came face to face with discrimination'' in the school system there, and in 1960 they moved to Wyandanch.
The first African-American homeowner moved to Levittown in 1955, Mr. Ruff said, despite resistance from neighbors even then.
Some scenes in the exhibition are ambiguous. A large photograph shows Robert Moses on a piece of house-moving equipment in North Valley Stream in 1953, about to move the first of 104 homes for a widening of the Southern State Parkway, an attempt to alleviate traffic jams before the Long Island Expressway was built. Mr. Moses looks confident. ''It was a publicity shot,'' Mr. Ruff said. He pointed out, however, that Henry Hall, the home's owner, who is also perched on the equipment, ''looks pretty anxious.''
Both the cold war and the Korean War became economic boons to Long Island because of its large aerospace industry, Mr. Ruff said. A photograph shows a missile installation in Westhampton that from 1959 to 1964 held 56 nuclear-tipped surface-to-air missiles. ''It was meant to protect us from Soviet bombers,'' Mr. Ruff said.
The overall tone, though, is upbeat. Next to the video about moving to Long Island is a 1955 RCA television set donated by Charles Sachs, who now lives on Staten Island; his parents bought it for their East Meadow home. In a nearby photograph, Mr. Sachs is seen celebrating his fifth birthday at a cheerful party with friends. Re-creations of a period kitchen, flanked by photos of women shopping in brimming supermarkets and of a boy's bedroom, crammed with toys like a Tonka Toys tow truck, evoke an era of abundance.
Childhood on Long Island was ''a giant block party,'' a wall placard notes. Doris Kearns Goodwin, who grew up in Rockville Centre, remembers houses ''clustered so close to one another that they functioned almost as a single home,'' the panel says, adding that by 1960, half the population of Long Island was under 20.
The teenage years look like fun, as illustrated by a 1949 Harley-Davidson motorcycle, a huge neon ''Diner'' sign, a leather jacket similar to one worn by Marlon Brando in the 1953 movie ''The Wild One'' (shown in a photo), a poodle skirt and that flashy jukebox. Mr. Ruff said he followed the playlist displayed on the jukebox when he assembled the exhibition's soundtrack, but the two dozen songs are not playing on vinyl. They come from a speaker mounted nearby -- and were bought from iTunes.
A section on fashion and society boasts a row of dresses on mannequins accompanied by enlarged photographs of their original wearers (and some fancy ladies' hats in a glass case). The most notorious segment of this section belongs to Ann Woodward, represented by three cocktail dresses and three 1955 photos. In one, she dances with her husband, William Woodward Jr. Another shows her holding a photograph of a tiger she had killed on a hunting expedition. In the third, the Nassau County police examine the 12-gauge shotgun she used to kill Mr. Woodward at their Oyster Bay Cove estate. (She said she had mistaken him for a prowler, and a grand jury found no evidence of a crime, but she was plagued by rumors of murder until her suicide in 1975.)
Among political fashions, the highlight is the ''Ike'' dress -- President Dwight D. Eisenhower's nickname is repeated in red all over the white dress -- with a matching parasol and a photo of a group of women wearing the dress, circa 1956.
Museum visitors may scribble their own recollections of the 1950s in one corner, on cards that others may read. Another interactive display encourages visitors to match a dozen high school yearbook photos with the mature faces of the same people. Among the better known: the musician Lou Reed of Freeport and the director Francis Ford Coppola of Great Neck.

HEADLINE: Mapping Future Growth

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

 BODY:
AFTER years of confusion, disputes and rule changes, New Jersey's 21 counties surprised many last month by meeting a deadline to produce updated sewer service maps -- not only locating infrastructure already in place but also detailing where new infrastructure should go. The maps are expected to guide statewide development well into the future.
''It's important to update these sewer service plans to know where to build,'' said Chris Sturm, the senior director of state policy for New Jersey Future, a planning group that focuses on smart growth. ''This step spells out where it makes sense to grow, where we have infrastructure, and where it doesn't make sense to grow, in environmentally sensitive areas.'' 
Of course, achieving this milestone hasn't completely put arguments to rest. While planners, builders and the state's Department of Environmental Protection hailed the new sewer maps as a first step toward directing smart growth in New Jersey, environmentalists described them as a further example of the Christie administration's favoring developers over the environment.
In a news release announcing the counties' compliance with a July 15 deadline to submit their updated maps, the Department of Environmental Protection praised the maps for ''protecting nearly 210,000 acres of environmentally sensitive lands and better safeguarding the state's water quality.'' But for environmentalists, this number is more than 90,000 acres shy of the 300,000 acres once deemed environmentally sensitive and expected to be shielded from sewer service development.
David Pringle, campaign director for the New Jersey Environmental Federation, said a more accurate headline for the maps would be ''Gov. Chris Christie reinstates 100,000 acres into development area.'' He added: ''This is an area we haven't lost yet. It's where we have endangered species' habitats, wetlands and the source of much of our drinking water supply. Once you develop, you can't go back.''
Efforts to address water quality management in New Jersey date back to 1996, when the federal Environmental Protection Agency ordered the state to update its sewer service network with an eye toward protecting endangered species and water supply. The state did eventually adopt new water quality management rules and ordered the counties to develop maps that would comply with those rules, but not until 2008. Court challenges by developers were among the factors that dragged the process out over a decade.
It was during that decade that 300,000 acres of environmentally sensitive land within areas designated as appropriate for sewer service were declared off limits (down from a previous 375,000 acres, after the Corzine administration removed parcels of 25 acres or less).
The current 209,000 acres deemed sensitive reflect more up-to-date data, according to Lawrence Hajna, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection. ''The 300,000 acres was just a starting point -- a ballpark number to begin the actual mapping process,'' he said. ''That then had to be ground-truthed for what's actually happening, what's been developed and what's not.'' He noted that since previous sewer maps had been published -- the oldest of them dating to the mid-1980s -- close to 18,000 acres had been added back into the sewer service areas statewide.
The counties' new sewer maps, which are expected to receive final approval by the end of the year, represent the first in a three-step process to address water management issues. In legislation passed in December, counties were given two additional years to complete the two remaining steps: an analysis of how sewer plants already in place could accommodate the waste generated if everything deemed buildable under current zoning went ahead; and a plan for policing sections outside sewer areas, which use septic systems.
Environmentalists questioned the wisdom of having allowed Step 1 before Step 2, arguing that it was unrealistic to map places where new infrastructure should go, without first knowing the full capacity of the sewage systems already in place. Of particular concern to them is that, with the maps in hand, developers eager to take projects to fruition can use them to apply to counties, and ultimately the state, for amendments -- thereby opening the door to encroachment on sensitive land.
''The new legislation said they couldn't make amendments until the sewer plans were submitted,'' said Jeff Tittel, the director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. ''So now that they're submitted, it allows them to come in and add other areas not in the sewer service areas.'' He noted, ''Where sewers go is what drives overdevelopment.''
Timothy J. Touhey, the chief executive of the New Jersey Builders Association, countered that with the current economic uncertainties affecting the industry, builders were disinclined to spend investment dollars in areas that might be deemed environmentally sensitive. Mr. Touhey saw the new sewer maps as providing some clarity going forward.
''Anytime you bring predictability and efficiency to a process,'' he said, ''it's going to save money for builders. They're not changing the rules along the way.''
But Elliott Ruga, the New Jersey Highlands Coalition's senior policy analyst, expressed concerns that the new mapping would allow for development in areas that had previously been restricted, not only in the Highlands, but also the Pine Barrens and the Barnegat Bay Watershed area. He described the rules governing state water management as ''part of the governor's deregulation of the environment to favor developers.''
He said he and other environmentalists planned to attend the upcoming public hearings being held in each county to review the new sewer maps. In addition, the Department of Environmental Protection has invited him to take part in a meeting with environmentalists in September to discuss the state's overall water management plan, though he doesn't have much confidence that his voice will be heard.
''They will take under advisement what we have to say, and then do exactly what they want to do,'' Mr. Ruga said. ''But they'll be able to say, 'We've consulted with our environmental stakeholders.' ''

THE PRICE OF INEQUALITY
By Joseph E. Stiglitz
414 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $27.95.
Joseph E. Stiglitz's new book, ''The Price of Inequality,'' is the single most comprehensive counter/argument to both Democratic neoliberalism and Republican laissez-faire theories. While credible economists running the gamut from center right to center left describe our bleak present as the result of seemingly unstoppable developments -- globalization and automation, a self-/replicating establishment built on ''meritocratic'' competition, the debt-driven collapse of 2008 -- Stiglitz stands apart in his defiant rejection of such notions of inevitability. He seeks to shift the terms of the debate.
It is not uncontrollable technological and social change that has produced a two-tier society, Stiglitz argues, but the exercise of political power by moneyed interests over legislative and regulatory processes. ''While there may be underlying economic forces at play,'' he writes, ''politics have shaped the market, and shaped it in ways that advantage the top at the expense of the rest.'' But politics, he insists, is subject to change. 
Stiglitz is a Nobel laureate and a professor of economics at Columbia (where I too teach, but we are not personally acquainted). He holds a commanding position in an intellectual insurgency challenging the dominant economic orthodoxy. Among his allies are Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson (the authors of ''Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer -- and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class''); Lawrence Lessig (''Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress -- and a Plan to Stop It''); Timothy Noah (''The Great Divergence: America's Growing Inequality Crisis and What We Can Do About It'') and Paul Krugman (''End This Depression Now!''). The collective argument of these dissidents is not only that inequality violates moral values, but that it also interacts with a money-driven political system to grant excessive power to the most affluent. In short, those with power use it to insulate themselves from competitive forces by winning favorable tax treatment, government-/protected market share and other forms of what economists call ''rent seeking.''
Conservative advocates of pure free markets, in this view, fail to acknowledge how concentrated economic power converts into political power. The right, for example, has hailed the evisceration of the estate tax and the lifting of restrictions on campaign contributions, despite evidence that such policies work to restrict competition -- by further concentrating wealth in the case of the estate tax, and by further empowering corporate America to control political decisions in the case of campaign finance.
Stiglitz and his allies argue that a free and competitive market is highly beneficial to society at large, but that it needs government regulation and oversight to remain functional. Without constraint, dominant interests use their leverage to make gains at the expense of the majority. Concentration of power in private hands, Stiglitz believes, can be just as damaging to the functioning of markets as excessive regulation and political control.
The importance of Stiglitz's contribution (and that of other dissidents) to the public debate cannot be overestimated. The news media and the Congress are ill-/equipped to address the role of economic power in shaping policy. Both institutions are, in fact, unaware of the extent to which they themselves are subject to the influence of money.
Stiglitz describes the economic capture of regulatory authorities by the interests under their jurisdiction -- and the more subtle intellectual capture of policy makers of all kinds. The calculated and purposeful shaping of public discussion allowed conservative analyses to dominate debate in the years before the collapse of 2008, and in the years since they have been dominant as well.
It is not just democratic politics that is threatened by huge disparities in wealth and income. Much of Stiglitz's book is devoted to demonstrating that excessive inequality amounts to sand in the gears of capitalism, creating volatility, fueling crises, undermining productivity and retarding growth. Just as discrimination results in the failure of a nation to make the best use of all its citizens, inequality, when it leads to inadequate schooling, housing and neighborhood conditions for large numbers of people, acts in a similarly destructive fashion.
Stiglitz succinctly summarized his own argument in a recent online column: ''Inequality leads to lower growth and less efficiency. Lack of opportunity means that its most valuable asset -- its people -- is not being fully used. Many at the bottom, or even in the middle, are not living up to their potential, because the rich, needing few public services and worried that a strong government might redistribute income, use their political influence to cut taxes and curtail government spending. This leads to underinvestment in infrastructure, education and technology, impeding the engines of growth. . . . Most importantly, America's inequality is undermining its values and identity. With inequality reaching such extremes, it is not surprising that its effects are manifest in every public decision, from the conduct of monetary policy to budgetary allocations. America has become a country not 'with justice for all,' but rather with favoritism for the rich and justice for those who can afford it -- so evident in the foreclosure crisis, in which the big banks believed that they were too big not only to fail, but also to be held accountable.''
Stiglitz wrote ''The Price of Inequality'' at the height of the uprisings in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt, and the Occupy Wall Street movement here in the United States. These revolts against established power helped make him optimistic about the prospect of change in the future. But he seems more sanguine at the beginning of his book -- ''There are moments in history when people all over the world seem to rise up, to say that something is wrong'' -- than at the end, which concludes on a note of warning: ''Time, however, may be running out. Four years ago there was a moment'' -- the 2008 election -- ''where most Americans had the audacity to hope. Trends more than a quarter of a century in the making might have been reversed. Instead, they have worsened. Today that hope is flickering.''
Circumstances in the summer of 2012 justify Stiglitz's more apprehensive conclusion. Prospects for programs boosting public investment are virtually nil. Republicans stand a good chance of taking control of both branches of Congress after the next election. Their presumptive presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, may capture the White House. If so, his tax and regulatory proposals will most likely embody all that Stiglitz finds repugnant. Even if Romney loses, the American political system does not appear ready to respond to Stiglitz's call to arms.
Stiglitz may prove most prescient when he warns of a society governed by ''rules of the game that weaken the bargaining strength of workers vis-a-vis capital.'' At present, he says,''the dearth of jobs and the asymmetries in globalization have created competition for jobs in which workers have lost and the owners of capital have won.'' We are becoming a country ''in which the rich live in gated communities, send their children to expensive schools and have access to first-rate medical care. Meanwhile, the rest live in a world marked by insecurity, at best mediocre education and in effect rationed health care.'' Except for a brief period in 2008-9, when the stock market decline hit the wealthy the hardest, the trends would seem to be moving toward Stiglitz's pessimistic vision of the future, with little prospect of change no matter who wins office on Nov. 6.

HEADLINE: Plan to Build a Private Highway Bisecting Maine Draws Mixed Reviews

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, Me. -- Central Maine is so vast and so empty, with so few roads, that it has given rise to a classic bit of New England humor. An old Yankee is asked for directions, whereupon he replies, ''You can't get there from here.''
The problem in Maine is that most of its major roads run north-south. Very few run east-west, which makes traversing the state one long, slow slog.
Peter Vigue, the chairman and chief executive of the Cianbro Corporation, a large engineering and construction company based in Maine, is hoping to change that. He has proposed a $2 billion private toll road running 220 miles across the state. 
He says it could make Maine a vital link in the global economy, speeding commerce across the Northeastern United States to markets in the Midwest, as well as help revitalize the lagging local economy.
The expansions of the Panama and Suez Canals make this highway even more urgent, he said in an interview last week. Bigger ships from around the world, carrying more cargo containers, will be looking for bigger, less congested ports on the East Coast, he said, and Maine already has one in Eastport.
The idea of an east-west highway has been kicking around for decades. But Mr. Vigue's proposal stands a good chance of becoming reality. As such, it has struck a raw nerve within the Maine psyche and has prompted a fierce debate over the state's brand, character and future.
Opponents say a major thoroughfare slicing through the state would destroy the very qualities of peacefulness, natural beauty and remoteness that make this region desirable in the first place.
''It would just completely change 'the way life should be,' '' said Chris Buchanan, referring to the state's unofficial slogan. Ms. Buchanan is the statewide coordinator for Stop the Corridor, a coalition opposing the highway.
''Maine is a rural state,'' she said, ''and this is a businessman who is trying to make it the Northeast trade gateway.''
That is exactly what others hope Mr. Vigue (pronounced VIG-you) can achieve.
''You can think small and be small, or you can think big and be big,'' said Christopher M. Gardner, executive director of the Eastport Port Authority. Eastport has the greatest natural depth of any port on the East Coast, but it gets less traffic than many others.
''A big ship could come in here now, but we lack the connectivity to the rest of the world to warrant it,'' Mr. Gardner said. ''But,'' he added, ''we're not in the middle of nowhere, we're right in the middle of the supply chain. We just have to seize the opportunity.''
The main reason that Mr. Vigue -- and his opponents -- believe that his proposal could succeed now where others have failed is that it would be financed privately.
''We have no state or federal participation,'' Mr. Vigue said in the interview, ''and we are confident that this is achievable.'' He said he was in discussions with other private partners and was following a recent trend of more private industry involvement in highways around the country.
''You find that cities, states and the federal government do not have adequate funding to support the demand for infrastructure,'' Mr. Vigue said.
But to the consternation of many, he has not specified the exact route from the east, in Calais, to the west, in Coburn Gore. He said he would buy and string together existing roads and rights of way; because the project is private, he cannot use the state's right of eminent domain. For those reasons, he said, the corridor would not disrupt local communities.
But opponents say they have been left in the dark on important details. They fear a 2,000-foot-wide corridor carrying not only long-haul trucks but also oil and gas pipelines and communications cables. (Mr. Vigue said the corridor would be 500 feet wide and says he has had ''no such conversations'' with utilities.)
Bob and Joan Morrison moved their family from Southern Maine to a farm here in Charleston, a rural area about 25 miles northwest of Bangor, in the 1970s because they fell in love with the gently rolling hills. They also saw the area as affordable and thought it would keep its rural character.
Their son Steve now lives in their original farmhouse with his own family, while Bob and Joan live in another house on the property, a dairy farm of about 1,000 acres. They sell their milk to an organic co-op that processes it in New Hampshire, but plan to start shipping it this winter to a new company in Maine. They grow a lot of their own food and prefer supporting the local economy to the global economy that Mr. Vigue envisions.
''This area has been left behind, and that's the way we like it,'' Joan Morrison, 72, said as the family sat around the kitchen table.
The Morrisons spend a lot of time poring over maps and trying to figure out where the corridor will run and how it will affect them.
''Losses due to the proposed corridor will make it harder, not easier, for my business and other farms in the area to find quality fields to rent or buy,'' said Steve Morrison, 47.
Contrary to Mr. Vigue's promises, the Morrisons see little benefit to Maine itself, beyond a few gas stations to serve the trucks that are hauling goods and waste for international conglomerates.
Environmentalists say the road would be a ''nightmare'' for the land, air and animal habitats as well as for recreational activities. The private financing has also raised red flags. A 2009 report by the United States Public Interest Research Group Education Fund found that some other privately financed toll roads had failed, leaving taxpayers responsible.
The next step here is a financial feasibility study, for which the Legislature has approved $300,000, to be reimbursed by the builders if the project goes ahead.
The state is paying for the study because it has an interest in the economics of the project, said Ted Talbot, a spokesman for the Maine Department of Transportation; it is not being done for Mr. Vigue.
''We want to know, if it's a toll road, how does it become profitable for a private company to operate?'' Mr. Talbot said. ''Someone has to plow it, police it, maintain it.''
Mr. Vigue would not say how much he expected to charge at the tollgates. He dismissed reports that the cost for the whole route could run as high as $100 for cars and $200 for trucks. ''It will be financially attractive or people won't use it,'' he said.
Once the feasibility study is done, Mr. Vigue said he expected to take three years for the permitting and design of the project and another three to build it.
Tony Brinkley, a professor who works on economic development projects for the Franco-American Center at the University of Maine, said many in the state were torn over the proposal.
There is scant information about the road, he said, and no one is really in a position to judge whether it would be more harmful or more beneficial to Maine in the long run, or whether it would help Canada at Maine's expense. For everyone worried about wrecking Maine's way of life, he said, others fear that doing nothing would leave the economy stagnant.
''The Maine brand,'' he said, ''should not be poverty.''

TRIBURBIA
By Karl Taro Greenfeld
253 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $25.99.
One view of the novel, the one that E. M. Forster advanced, says it's ''a fiction in prose of a certain extent'' -- meaning more than 50,000 words, in Forster's opinion. By that definition Karl Taro Greenfeld's ''Triburbia'' qualifies as a novel, which is what his publisher calls it, though I'd be inclined to call it linked stories. I suspect that if ''Dubliners'' had been published in recent years it would have been marketed as a novel. If Tom Rachman's ''Imperfectionists'' and Jennifer Egan's ''Visit From the Goon Squad'' are novels, if Flann O'Brien's ''At Swim-Two-Birds'' is a novel, then so, perhaps, is ''Triburbia.'' It lacks the sense of closure and the linear narrative drive of more conventional examples of the form, but it's an artful and casually cohesive work of fiction imbued with anthropological insight. 
Greenfeld's story is set in the bohemian Manhattan neighborhood of TriBeCa (the triangle below Canal Street), which, like SoHo to the north, was a zone of abandoned loft and factory buildings when artists looking for cheap space began colonizing it in the early 1970s. Three decades later, according to Forbes magazine, TriBeCa had become the most expensive ZIP code in Manhattan, displacing the venerable Upper East Side's 10021. Greenfeld deftly charts this transition from the Mudd Club to Whole Foods, from James Rosenquist to Bethenny Frankel.
The book takes place during George W. Bush's second term; the attack on the World Trade Center, just to the south, is receding into memory; the financial crisis is just starting to unfold, although most of these culture producers pride themselves on being ignorant of what's happening on Wall Street. They are for the most part second-generation TriBeCans, not necessarily artists but engaged in the artistic professions, resentful of the bankers and lawyers who are moving in.
''We are a prosperous community,'' says one character, a sound engineer married to an heiress. ''Our lofts and apartments are worth millions. Our wives vestigially beautiful. Our renovations as vast and grand in scale as the construction of ocean liners, yet we regularly assure ourselves that our affluence does not define us. We are better than that. Measure us by the books on our shelves, the paintings on our walls, the songs on our iTunes playlists, our children in their secure little school. We live in smug certainty that our taste is impeccable, our politics correct, our sense of outrage at the current regime totally warranted.''
Most of these characters are young parents, loosely affiliated through P.S. 234, which their children attend, and as much as this is a book about a place it's also about a time of life: most of them are approaching 40 or looking back at it wistfully. Most of the men, who don't need to be in the office at any particular time, gather for breakfast after dropping the kids off at school. The wives are more likely to hold down conventional jobs, as publicists or editors. The children are precocious and spoiled. One parent contemplates their future: ''They could live the latest version of the American dream, . . . some mixture of drinking in bottle-/service nightclubs and pursuing a creative career as a video producer or painter or performance artist.''
Greenfeld is particularly good at depicting the tribal rites and caste systems of the kids. One of the best set pieces in the book is his portrait of Cooper, a ruthless fourth grader and the daughter of the sound engineer, who is a part-time model and a full-time mean girl. Even Rankin, the possibly mobbed-up nightclub owner, is helpless in the face of little Cooper's incessant bullying of his daughter.
The odd man out at this block party, the local Banquo's ghost, is the unnamed puppeteer who as part of the first wave of gentrification in the 1970s paid $280 a month for a ''long and skinny loft, windows on both ends, a toilet in the middle, no kitchen.'' He clings to his identity as an artist long after he's stopped producing the fornicating puppets that gave him a brief moment of underground celebrity, and to the loft that he can afford only because of rent control. ''We were the aboriginals,'' he says, ''who were slowly being driven out by the wealthier, colonizing settlers.''
Among those settlers is the author of a James Frey-like best-selling memoir. ''The scene in which I break the nose of one of my counselors at the rehab center,'' he tells us, ''has become almost as notorious as my boarding a plane with a broken jaw and Transportation Security agents following the trail of blood down the aisle to my seat.'' This retelling of a recent literary scandal is pleasantly cringe-inducing, although the seams between the real-life story and Greenfeld's inventions are a little ragged, as if he'd pasted a nerd's head onto a weight lifter's body. One reason ''A Million Little Pieces'' was so convincing was that Frey seemed like precisely the kind of chest-/thumping reprobate depicted in the book. Greenfeld's fictional memoirist, by contrast, is so insecure he's surprised his wife finds him attractive. But you can't really blame him: she's a gorgeous Ivy League It Girl, a former fashion editor on intimate terms with the designers and celebrities in her magazine. ''She had been and forever would be the cool girl in every place she went: Gstaad, St. Barts, East Hampton.'' We've all known her, loved her and hated her, at least from afar.
The women of ''Triburbia'' are particularly entertaining, much savvier and more cynical than their mates. ''I don't know what guys do anymore,'' the wife of the sound engineer says. ''It seems like when I meet a man in his 20s or 30s, he does something in advertising or marketing, but is more defined by his hobby of riding fixed-gear bicycles or some intense and very particular food enthusiasm.''
Greenfeld is best known as a journalist, the author of five acclaimed books of nonfiction, and at moments in ''Triburbia'' he veers toward trend-piece journalistic shorthand. ''Celebrities began moving in, movie stars, sons of presidents.'' (That sentence needs a colon.) ''Absentee landlords re-emerged to develop their properties, drive up their rents. The Mudd Club, Area, then Wetlands came and went.'' Yet when he's showing rather than telling, his sensitivity to nuances of the zeitgeist and his keen observational skills make his characters (some of whom will seem eerily familiar to longtime residents of downtown Manhattan) instantly recognizable as creatures of their time and place without quite denying them their humanity. Greenfeld has a gift for satire, but it's balanced by a sense of sympathy for his faux bohemians, and by the self-/consciousness of most of his characters, who know that they're types even as they insist on their individuality.
Greenfeld is attuned to the fleeting details of cultural fashion: of speech, dress and mores that are the weft of character. His TriBeCa husbands and wives and their children play out their biological and vocational destinies within a precise historical moment. Smug and insular as they are, intimations of the financial crisis start to reach them, like thunder rumbling across the river from New Jersey; empty storefronts appear, and, horror of horrors, their lofts start losing value. It's a mark of Greenfeld's talent and the complexity he brings to their portraits that we almost feel sorry for them.

HEADLINE: When Tax Rates Touched the Sky

 BODY:
To the Editor:In ''Taxes Needn't Discourage Philanthropy'' (Economic View, July 29), Robert J. Shiller noted that, despite the supposed disincentive of high marginal tax rates, economic growth was exceptionally strong when income tax rates were far higher than today's. 
This is unsurprising. Incentives affect behavior when people have alternatives. As I teach my business ethics students, if a corporation rewards only bottom-line results, employees will do whatever it takes to make the sale, ethical or not. If the company rewards ethical behavior, that is what it will get.
Similarly, if an industry like finance rewards employees more than one like social work, more people will gravitate to finance.
But higher marginal tax rates affect all income; the alternative to working or investing is not another way to earn rewards. It is not working or not investing. So tax rates simply become part of the economic background within which people try to earn as much as they can. The assertion that higher marginal rates will reduce economic incentives is an excuse to lower taxes on the wealthy. Barry Bennett

To the Editor:
The column noted the high tax rates that were in effect before the 1980s.
It should be remembered that, in those years, the law facilitated the use of domestic and foreign tax shelters, and most high-income earners made liberal use of them to reduce their tax burdens. Martin Herman

To the Editor:
Robert J. Shiller is spot on in saying that taxes needn't discourage philanthropy and stand to propel it In a hornet's nest of legislative debate over the reduction of deductions, however, it's become an either/or, more/less discussion.
The need for charitable support, however, only grows. Perhaps it's time for the Congress to debate the creation of new tax incentives to spur giving to certain charitable needs -- as was done in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. William BagleyMadison, Conn., July 31

HEADLINE: 99 Ways to be Naughty in Kazakhstan

BYLINE: By EDITH ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
A few months ago, at the Tablao Villa Rosa, a tourist-friendly restaurant in Madrid, dozens of beautifully dressed women from all over the world were gathered around a stage taking cellphone pictures of a male flamenco dancer in tight pants. The women, whooping and clapping against the sides of their wine glasses, were editors, publishers and executives from the far-flung corners of the Cosmopolitan magazine universe -- missionaries from the more established international Cosmos (Australia, France, Britain) and the newer, upstart Cosmos (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Mongolia, Vietnam and dozens of other countries). They gathered there at the biennial Cosmic Conference to soak up the Cosmo ethos (''Fun, fearless, female!'') and then went home to radiate it outward. One Cosmo staff member would tell me -- in complete seriousness, having chosen her words carefully -- that Cosmic was going to change my life.''Did you see those pants?'' asked Kate White as she sat down with a glass of red wine at the wine-barrel table where I was writing down my impressions of, among other things, the flamenco pants. 
White, 61, is the laser-blue-eyed editor of Cosmo U.S., the mother ship, or Big Cosmo, as it's called by other editors. During White's 14-year tenure, the magazine has increased its U.S. circulation to 3 million readers, from 2.3 million, and introduced 22 international editions for a total of 64, including spinoffs. (By comparison, Marie Claire has 35 international editions, and Glamour has 16). She's dazzling but relaxed, with a full, frequent laugh. She is the Bill Clinton of Cosmic, the charming and influential American, the unofficial boss of bosses, toward whom her international counterparts gravitate. Her book, ''I Shouldn't Be Telling You This: Success Secrets Every Gutsy Girl Should Know,'' is due out in September.
White also wastes no time. Within minutes she was asking me whether and when I want to marry, whether and when I want to have kids, whether I'd want to marry but not have kids and whether I'd consider freezing my eggs. I was surprised by my answers, not knowing I had them until I heard myself telling her, with no hesitation, that I did want to marry and have kids but that I thought I'd be O.K. if neither happened and that work was more important to me at the moment (perhaps to the detriment of those things) and a number of other personal details. Another Cosmo editor swooped in before I could ask her for specific advice, but I would have.
White's likable directness is one of her magazine's defining characteristics. Cosmo has a cheerful, girlfriendy tone (''When Your Period Makes You Cra-a-zy'') and a much racier reputation than its newsstand competitors (''Eeek! You'll Die When You Read What These 'Normal' Guys Wanted Once Their Pants Hit the Floor''). Its covers rarely fail to feature at least one bold, all-caps rendering of the word ''sex.'' The August issue, for instance, offered ''52 Sex Tips'' and ''When Your Vagina Acts Weird After Sex.'' A sampling of 2012 headlines includes ''50 Sex Tips,'' ''50 Kinky Sex Moves,'' ''99 Sex Questions'' and ''His Best Sex Ever.''
The repetition can be a little numbing, but it may help explain how Cosmo, which is the best-selling monthly magazine in the United States, has morphed into such a global juggernaut. (''If all the Cosmo readers from around the world came together,'' read a recent piece in Cosmo South Africa, ''this group would form the 16th-largest country in the world.'') Through those 64 editions, the magazine now spreads wild sex stories to 100 million teens and young women (making it closer to the 12th-largest country, actually) in more than 100 nations -- including quite a few where any discussion of sex is taboo. And plenty of others where reading a glossy magazine still carries cachet. (''Many girls consider a hard copy of Cosmo to be an important accessory,'' says Maya Akisheva, the editor of Cosmo Kazakhstan.) As the brand proudly points out, in 2011 alone, these readers spent $1.4 billion on shoes, $400 million on cars, $2.5 billion on beauty products and $1.5 billion on fragrance and bought 24 million pairs of jeans.
The magazine recently tried to cement its mythology through a two-minute Web video called ''The Cosmo Effect.'' Onscreen text asks viewers if they take for granted that they can have it all (''dream job, independence, dreamy guy, fun fearless attitude, baby'') or, if they prefer, a modified version of ''it all'' (''sexy single life'' and ''a great pair of heels''). Because not so long ago, the video explains, women's choices were limited. Until ''one woman's vision changed the world.''
Helen Gurley Brown, or H.G.B. as she's known in the Cosmo universe, is the patron saint of Cosmopolitan's sex-centric brand of female empowerment. The author of the then-scandalous self-help book ''Sex and the Single Girl'' -- which advised women on how to better enjoy their jobs, relationships and bodies -- Brown re-branded the magazine with her frank, sexy tone in 1965, when most women's magazines were focused on family and home economics. She remained editor until 1997 and is still listed as editor in chief for Cosmopolitan International on all mastheads.
At 90, Brown maintains a delightfully incongruous pink corner office in the gleaming Hearst Tower on 57th Street in Manhattan. And although somewhat retired, she remains something of a spiritual godmother for the dozens of international editors trying to implement her ideas in their own countries. '' 'Sex and the Single Girl' is still the G.P.S. to being W.O.W. -- a well-turned-out woman!'' explained the editor of Cosmo South Africa, Sbu Mpungose. As has been the case with other newer Cosmos, the first issue of Cosmo Azerbaijan, in 2011, included a feature on Brown: ''It was absolutely necessary for girls in our country to know who she is,'' the magazine's editor, Leyla Orujova, explained.
Akisheva, the editor in Kazakhstan, told me that until recently, she received a handwritten note from Brown after the publication of each issue. ''Our readers might not be very familiar with Helen Gurley Brown's books and biography,'' she said, ''but they surely are influenced by her original ideas. Because this is what Cosmo keeps telling them: You are strong, you can control your life, you can earn as much as men do and you can have sex before marriage and not be condemned by society.''
But what about the other stuff that Cosmo is telling them? One morning at Cosmic, a panel discussion included talk of some favorite Cosmo topics: sex toys (said to produce ''the most incredible combinations of orgasms''), how to help men get erections more quickly and anal sex (''backdoor booty'' as the magazine has called it). One panelist, a young Spanish woman, said that she teases her boyfriend with anal sex and then, jokingly, that she has to save something for marriage. The crowd roared. ''Only at Cosmo,'' said the editor of Cosmo Australia, Bronwyn McCahon, between bites of miniature muffins and sliced melon, ''will you be talking about anal sex at 10 a.m.''
Cosmo is an easy magazine to hate. When I asked my female friends -- including many single women in their late 20s, like me -- what they thought of it, most of them were unkind. ''Cosmo is complete trash,'' one explained. ''Mindless,'' another said. ''I would not be caught reading it outside of an airplane,'' said a third. ''It assumes and expects the worst of women,'' said another. I never had a particularly positive opinion of it, either, and my ambivalence was reinforced by headlines like this one, from a recent edition of Cosmo South Korea: ''Oops! My V Zone Is Strange!''
But to hear the Cosmo missionaries tell it, they're promoting feminism with every issue. ''Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world,'' Fira Basuki Baskoro, the editor of Cosmo Indonesia, said over a lunch of salad and paella. ''When Cosmo came to Indonesia, it changed the way the Indonesian woman thinks. Before Cosmo, it was taboo for women to talk about sex openly.''
White told me that during a 2010 trip to New Delhi, the editor of Cosmo India correlated a rise in love marriages over arranged marriages to Cosmo's influence. ''I don't know if this is true statistically,'' White said, but ''Cosmo has been very, very popular there. And I'd like to think that one of the messages we're delivering to women is: You don't have to marry the guy your parents told you to marry. You should marry who you want to marry. You can have a job if you'd like. You can have a career if you want. These choices are open to you today.''
When asked via e-mail if there were statistics to back up this correlation, the editor of Cosmo India, Nandini Bhalla, politely evaded the question but provided more interesting anecdotes. ''When we launched in 1996, we were flooded with letters -- women wanted to know if kissing could cause pregnancy. They were clueless about the basics of having sex, and they had a million questions about what was right and wrong. The Cosmo team actually tackled these questions personally -- writing back to readers with answers or carrying stories that tackled their concerns. Indian parents are usually conservative about sexual matters, and friends were often equally ignorant, so Cosmo was the only one with reliable information.''
''50 Kinky Sex Moves'' notwithstanding, Cosmo does adhere to a set of surprisingly wholesome values. The magazine discourages plastic surgery, for instance, and has run articles opposing breast implants. In its coverage of food and fitness, White notes, ''we don't do any diets, no crash dieting.'' The U.S. edition also has a section called Body Love, in which it tries ''to encourage women to feel good about their bodies,'' no matter their size. A recent issue featured a spread of a curvy woman in a variety of gorgeous bathing suits on some fabulous remote beach. It didn't feel like a token shoot of a larger model; she was beautiful, and the bathing suits were reasonably priced. (While trying to find the picture again on Google, I fell down the Cosmo rabbit hole, scrolling through a gallery of swimwear, then through ''How to Be Sexier -- Instantly'' and then through all 23 slides of ''Sexy Ideas for Long Hair.'' Texturizer now plays a role in my morning routine.)
The magazine also covers aspects of the female body beyond its sex appeal and orgasmic capacity. ''We ran an article that pained me to run,'' White told me, ''but I felt it was important. It basically said the key time to try to get pregnant is between 25 and 35. There has been so much said about still waiting until you're older, and I didn't have my first kid until I was 37, but we're taking a chance -- you need to know it.''
I asked why it pained her. ''I want every girl to feel that she can have her first kid at 50, if she wants,'' White said emphatically. She has encouraged readers to look into freezing their eggs.
Cosmo happens to be fairly traditional about sex itself. Brown believed that it was O.K. to sleep with married men (it was their wives' responsibility to keep them faithful, she argued), but White eliminated that from the formula. (''A total no-no,'' she said.) The magazine also assumes that you're having sex with a boyfriend or a husband (there's not much in the way of same-sex relationships), and not with a one-night stand. ''We certainly talk about sex mostly in terms of relationships,'' White said, ''and most of our readers have told us they're in relationships, and they want the sexual information for their relationship.'' White also sees the hookup culture boomeranging back to more traditional standards. ''One thing I do think that women will evaluate in the coming years,'' she said, ''is casual sex. Is it really what you want to be doing, casual sex, a lot of casual sex? Is it what you feel good about?'' But if it's your thing, that's fine too. ''We don't pass judgment,'' she said.
White acknowledges that some people find Cosmo's obsession with sex trashy, but she's unabashedly proud of how it sets the magazine apart. ''Every Cosmo reader expects to have herself and her pleasures taken care of, equally,'' she said matter-of-factly. ''We reinforce the idea all the time that, yes, we want you to be a fabulous lover, we want to give you those skills, but you better get it back, baby, because that's what you deserve.'' And if that makes for some repetitive stories, so be it. ''There's a frustration that it takes time to learn how to have an orgasm,'' White said, ''and have it consistently. So that's terrain we cover a lot.''
These mores are upheld, to varying degrees of cultural sensitivity, throughout the Cosmo universe. Judging by searches on the Web site, Cosmo U.K. readers are most interested in hair and oral sex (''in that order,'' says its publishing director, Ella Dolphin), but in India, where women traditionally live with their parents until marriage, the Cosmo reader ''might not be comfortable openly discussing her sex life due to fear of being judged,'' Bhalla says. She also notes that because sex toys are banned in India, ''we're careful not to talk about them in the magazine.'' Leyla Orujova, the editor of Cosmo Azerbaijan, told me that her staff ensures that sex is generally discussed within the context of marriage. Cosmo Singapore comes with a yellow ''Unsuitable for the Young'' warning box on the cover and sometimes runs its sexiest content in a sealed section promising ''phenomenal pleasure . . . waiting for you inside.''
Most international Cosmos are run by their countries' natives, but Kerrie Simon-Lawrence, the beautiful, redheaded editor of Middle East Cosmo, is from Sydney. ''Obviously because of the cultural sensitivities within the Middle East'' -- where dating and premarital sex are, in some countries, punishable by law -- ''we can't lift so much from international editions.'' Throughout the Cosmic Conference, she and the magazine's publisher joked repeatedly about needing good lawyers and the possibility of going to jail.
Other editions feature more subtle deviations. Cosmo France has reliably more artsy and experimental covers. The South Korean edition is huge -- physically huge; issues sometimes come as two separate magazines, because they would otherwise break -- and focuses less on sex than marriage (''My Dreamy Wedding'' and ''Dreams Come True!'' are two cover lines from the 400-page April edition). The editor of Cosmo Croatia, Marjana Filipovic-Grcic, told me that stories about women acting bravely on their own have been particularly popular in her country. The same is true for Cosmo Kazakhstan, which ''focuses on career and travel more than the U.S. edition does,'' writes Akisheva, because ''Kazakhstan is a relatively newly independent, developing country, and women are excited about the career opportunities the market economy has to offer.''
Cosmo Germany is more business-oriented. Cosmo Russia (which has the highest circulation of any women's glossy magazine in that country) publishes longer articles. Cosmo Finland has been running multipage, centerfold-type spreads of topless Finnish guys in order to dispel the notion that Finnish guys aren't hot. (Not overly convincing!)
But for all of the magazines' differences, Cosmo is still pushing ''the same standards of beauty'' around the world, Allison Kimmich, executive director of the National Women's Studies Association, said one afternoon after I returned from the conference. ''I don't know that that's a global export that we want to be proud of.'' Kimmich agreed that editorial content ''can sometimes be what you might even call feminist,'' because ''at the most basic level, the articles do promote women's advancement and equality through good advice about career issues and women's health and sexuality.'' But, she said, there is plenty of content that sends ''contrary'' messages. ''The export of Cosmo is like the export of any other global American brand,'' she said. ''Coca-Cola, Hollywood films. It's a part of what's happening to our economy, and like all globalization, there's good with the bad.''
At the office of Peter Yates, the creative director of Hearst Magazines International, a wall is covered in postcard-size versions of international Cosmo covers tacked up in layers of 12 -- a year's worth of cover art, viewable as flipbooks. There's a lot of Megan Fox, Kate Hudson, Eva Mendes, Scarlett Johansson, Olivia Wilde and Jessica Alba, who was once on 20 international covers at the same time. Unlike other women's magazines, which often go for make-up-centric close-ups (Allure), stylish playfulness (Glamour), professional elegance (Marie Claire) or high-fashion photography (Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Vogue), Cosmo keeps it consistently, overtly sexual. The women look young and fertile, and the cover star is generally Beautiful Young Woman With Lots of Cleavage, Standing, Hand on Hip, Almost but Not Quite Smiling -- or the look a woman might give herself in the mirror before going out hoping to get hit on.
The brand saves money by repurposing its covers across various editions, and it shaves costs in other ways, too. For the most part, articles are created by a small team of staff members at Big Cosmo and then ripple outward through the Cosmo network. The magazine has a database for international editors to see what features Cosmo U.S. has planned approximately three months before they run; once the images and layout are uploaded, they can then tweak the content they like to their own country's needs. Writers do not receive royalties when their work is repurposed. Huffy freelancers are virtually nonexistent.
So what appeared as ''Fascinating Breast Facts'' in the July 2011 edition of Cosmo U.S., featuring a close-up of a woman tugging her shirt open, became ''15 Facts You Need to Know About Your Breasts'' in the October 2011 edition of Cosmo Middle East, where it ran with a photo of a model demurely dangling a bra over her shoulder. ''What His Sleep Habits Can Tell You'' ran in Cosmo U.S. in March 2012 and, months later, appeared in China (same photography but with text translated into Chinese) and in Armenia (different photography). And what ran as the fashion spread ''Motorcycle Diaries'' in August 2009 in Cosmo U.S. -- featuring an abandoned gas station, denim, plaids, a hot guy and the open road -- ran two years later in Cosmo Mongolia with the same blend of denim, plaid, gas station and open road, except the whole thing had been reshot with guys who looked Mongolian.
One byline that regularly appears in editions around the world is that of Jessica Knoll, a pretty, friendly and immaculately put-together 28-year-old senior editor. Over drinks at a quiet wine bar near the Big Cosmo office, Knoll explained that it's not only cheaper to produce features from within but also easier for maintaining the Cosmo voice. And anyway, there's less of it to write these days: ''We did a redesign in January and slashed word count,'' she said. ''Part of that is because we live in a Twitter generation. We're not going to be indulgent writers who ramble on for a couple thousand words -- we need to find a way a to say things quickly but also have some personality.''
''I learned a lot from your recent, um, article,'' I said to her, about eight minutes into our meeting. ''About the wishbone-shaped . . . uh . . .''
''Oh, about the internal clitoris?'' she said. ''See, I don't get bashful. It becomes completely normal to talk to your boss and have the word 'penis' appear 15 times in your conversation.''
The article in question -- ''Have Easier, Stronger Orgasms'' -- was on ''surprising new findings'' about the clitoris based on research done in the 1990s (not exactly new) but features an interview with a woman whose sex book came out this year (new). It ran in the May edition of Cosmo U.S. and will likely appear in Cosmos around the world for months to come. ''It's always our goal to make something feel timely and fresh,'' Knoll said. ''Nothing can be evergreen. Even if it's an age-old idea, we have to somehow find a way to put a fresh spin on it.''
For example, in a passage from ''Sex and the Single Girl,'' from 1962, Helen Gurley Brown advises readers on how to catch someone's attention from across a bar: ''Look straight into his eyes, deep and searchingly, then lower your gaze,'' she wrote. ''Go back to your companions or magazine. Now look at him again the same way . . . steadfastly, questioningly. Then drop your eyes. Do it three times and you're a flirt! (P.S., You will have made him very happy.)'' And then from an article in the May 2012 issue of Cosmo titled, ''The Smile That Makes Men Hit on You'': ''A classic study found that you need to make eye contact with a dude and subtly smile at him twice in a row for him to get that you're interested. . . . Look at him, smile and hold your gaze for a couple of seconds. Then look away for a few seconds, look back and do the same thing again.'' A classic study.
Not that Cosmo and its patron saint haven't tried to evolve with the times. In the introduction to the 2003 reissue of ''Sex and the Single Girl,'' about what had changed in the four decades since the book was originally published, Brown wrote: ''Brains have become almost as treasured as beauty . . . almost! . . . If you had to or could choose one or the other, I would almost choose smart!''
This reminded me of a surprising moment from the Cosmic Convention. During a PowerPoint presentation about reader polls, one slide asked the audience to guess which of the following things young women wanted most: a) beauty; b) an amazing career; c) fame; or d) lots of money. There was a slight pause as audience members made their own guesses. Then the answer: Fame. A faint murmur of confusion. Fame? Really? I conducted a copycat poll among my own friends: 15 picked an amazing career, 6 picked money, 3 picked beauty and only 1 picked fame.
The presenter cited the rise of reality TV and made an effort to spin the findings into something positive. It's not that young women necessarily want to be the next Kim Kardashian, the presenter riffed, but that everyone wants to be famous within her social group or on her own Facebook feed.
So add famemongering to the list of less-than-empowering -- or ''contrary,'' as Kimmich would say -- messages that Cosmo sends to its audience worldwide. But what this hand-wringing neglects is that young women are smart and can sift for what they want. Worrying that Cosmo readers will unblinkingly follow orders about kinky sex moves or imbibe some latent sense of Kardashianism seems unfounded and unnecessary and even a little insulting. Maybe the magazine is benefiting from a rise in love marriages in India more than it is facilitating them, but it's definitely not pushing any woman who isn't interested into backdoor booty.
''I know a lot of people have issues about these very sexual cover lines being on display,'' Knoll said. She told me she could remember reading Cosmo from a very young age and never feeling like she had to go out and have sex with someone. Then she paused for a moment. ''When I would read Cosmo, all it made me want to do was grow up, wear a pretty dress, nice heels, move to the city and have an awesome life. And I just don't think that's a bad thing to want, you know?''

HEADLINE: 99 Ways to be Naughty in Kazakhstan

BYLINE: By EDITH ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
A few months ago, at the Tablao Villa Rosa, a tourist-friendly restaurant in Madrid, dozens of beautifully dressed women from all over the world were gathered around a stage taking cellphone pictures of a male flamenco dancer in tight pants. The women, whooping and clapping against the sides of their wine glasses, were editors, publishers and executives from the far-flung corners of the Cosmopolitan magazine universe -- missionaries from the more established international Cosmos (Australia, France, Britain) and the newer, upstart Cosmos (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Mongolia, Vietnam and dozens of other countries). They gathered there at the biennial Cosmic Conference to soak up the Cosmo ethos (''Fun, fearless, female!'') and then went home to radiate it outward. One Cosmo staff member would tell me -- in complete seriousness, having chosen her words carefully -- that Cosmic was going to change my life.''Did you see those pants?'' asked Kate White as she sat down with a glass of red wine at the wine-barrel table where I was writing down my impressions of, among other things, the flamenco pants. 
White, 61, is the laser-blue-eyed editor of Cosmo U.S., the mother ship, or Big Cosmo, as it's called by other editors. During White's 14-year tenure, the magazine has increased its U.S. circulation to 3 million readers, from 2.3 million, and introduced 22 international editions for a total of 64, including spinoffs. (By comparison, Marie Claire has 35 international editions, and Glamour has 16). She's dazzling but relaxed, with a full, frequent laugh. She is the Bill Clinton of Cosmic, the charming and influential American, the unofficial boss of bosses, toward whom her international counterparts gravitate. Her book, ''I Shouldn't Be Telling You This: Success Secrets Every Gutsy Girl Should Know,'' is due out in September.
White also wastes no time. Within minutes she was asking me whether and when I want to marry, whether and when I want to have kids, whether I'd want to marry but not have kids and whether I'd consider freezing my eggs. I was surprised by my answers, not knowing I had them until I heard myself telling her, with no hesitation, that I did want to marry and have kids but that I thought I'd be O.K. if neither happened and that work was more important to me at the moment (perhaps to the detriment of those things) and a number of other personal details. Another Cosmo editor swooped in before I could ask her for specific advice, but I would have.
White's likable directness is one of her magazine's defining characteristics. Cosmo has a cheerful, girlfriendy tone (''When Your Period Makes You Cra-a-zy'') and a much racier reputation than its newsstand competitors (''Eeek! You'll Die When You Read What These 'Normal' Guys Wanted Once Their Pants Hit the Floor''). Its covers rarely fail to feature at least one bold, all-caps rendering of the word ''sex.'' The August issue, for instance, offered ''52 Sex Tips'' and ''When Your Vagina Acts Weird After Sex.'' A sampling of 2012 headlines includes ''50 Sex Tips,'' ''50 Kinky Sex Moves,'' ''99 Sex Questions'' and ''His Best Sex Ever.''
The repetition can be a little numbing, but it may help explain how Cosmo, which is the best-selling monthly magazine in the United States, has morphed into such a global juggernaut. (''If all the Cosmo readers from around the world came together,'' read a recent piece in Cosmo South Africa, ''this group would form the 16th-largest country in the world.'') Through those 64 editions, the magazine now spreads wild sex stories to 100 million teens and young women (making it closer to the 12th-largest country, actually) in more than 100 nations -- including quite a few where any discussion of sex is taboo. And plenty of others where reading a glossy magazine still carries cachet. (''Many girls consider a hard copy of Cosmo to be an important accessory,'' says Maya Akisheva, the editor of Cosmo Kazakhstan.) As the brand proudly points out, in 2011 alone, these readers spent $1.4 billion on shoes, $400 million on cars, $2.5 billion on beauty products and $1.5 billion on fragrance and bought 24 million pairs of jeans.
The magazine recently tried to cement its mythology through a two-minute Web video called ''The Cosmo Effect.'' Onscreen text asks viewers if they take for granted that they can have it all (''dream job, independence, dreamy guy, fun fearless attitude, baby'') or, if they prefer, a modified version of ''it all'' (''sexy single life'' and ''a great pair of heels''). Because not so long ago, the video explains, women's choices were limited. Until ''one woman's vision changed the world.''
Helen Gurley Brown, or H.G.B. as she's known in the Cosmo universe, is the patron saint of Cosmopolitan's sex-centric brand of female empowerment. The author of the then-scandalous self-help book ''Sex and the Single Girl'' -- which advised women on how to better enjoy their jobs, relationships and bodies -- Brown re-branded the magazine with her frank, sexy tone in 1965, when most women's magazines were focused on family and home economics. She remained editor until 1997 and is still listed as editor in chief for Cosmopolitan International on all mastheads.
At 90, Brown maintains a delightfully incongruous pink corner office in the gleaming Hearst Tower on 57th Street in Manhattan. And although somewhat retired, she remains something of a spiritual godmother for the dozens of international editors trying to implement her ideas in their own countries. '' 'Sex and the Single Girl' is still the G.P.S. to being W.O.W. -- a well-turned-out woman!'' explained the editor of Cosmo South Africa, Sbu Mpungose. As has been the case with other newer Cosmos, the first issue of Cosmo Azerbaijan, in 2011, included a feature on Brown: ''It was absolutely necessary for girls in our country to know who she is,'' the magazine's editor, Leyla Orujova, explained.
Akisheva, the editor in Kazakhstan, told me that until recently, she received a handwritten note from Brown after the publication of each issue. ''Our readers might not be very familiar with Helen Gurley Brown's books and biography,'' she said, ''but they surely are influenced by her original ideas. Because this is what Cosmo keeps telling them: You are strong, you can control your life, you can earn as much as men do and you can have sex before marriage and not be condemned by society.''
But what about the other stuff that Cosmo is telling them? One morning at Cosmic, a panel discussion included talk of some favorite Cosmo topics: sex toys (said to produce ''the most incredible combinations of orgasms''), how to help men get erections more quickly and anal sex (''backdoor booty'' as the magazine has called it). One panelist, a young Spanish woman, said that she teases her boyfriend with anal sex and then, jokingly, that she has to save something for marriage. The crowd roared. ''Only at Cosmo,'' said the editor of Cosmo Australia, Bronwyn McCahon, between bites of miniature muffins and sliced melon, ''will you be talking about anal sex at 10 a.m.''
Cosmo is an easy magazine to hate. When I asked my female friends -- including many single women in their late 20s, like me -- what they thought of it, most of them were unkind. ''Cosmo is complete trash,'' one explained. ''Mindless,'' another said. ''I would not be caught reading it outside of an airplane,'' said a third. ''It assumes and expects the worst of women,'' said another. I never had a particularly positive opinion of it, either, and my ambivalence was reinforced by headlines like this one, from a recent edition of Cosmo South Korea: ''Oops! My V Zone Is Strange!''
But to hear the Cosmo missionaries tell it, they're promoting feminism with every issue. ''Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world,'' Fira Basuki Baskoro, the editor of Cosmo Indonesia, said over a lunch of salad and paella. ''When Cosmo came to Indonesia, it changed the way the Indonesian woman thinks. Before Cosmo, it was taboo for women to talk about sex openly.''
White told me that during a 2010 trip to New Delhi, the editor of Cosmo India correlated a rise in love marriages over arranged marriages to Cosmo's influence. ''I don't know if this is true statistically,'' White said, but ''Cosmo has been very, very popular there. And I'd like to think that one of the messages we're delivering to women is: You don't have to marry the guy your parents told you to marry. You should marry who you want to marry. You can have a job if you'd like. You can have a career if you want. These choices are open to you today.''
When asked via e-mail if there were statistics to back up this correlation, the editor of Cosmo India, Nandini Bhalla, politely evaded the question but provided more interesting anecdotes. ''When we launched in 1996, we were flooded with letters -- women wanted to know if kissing could cause pregnancy. They were clueless about the basics of having sex, and they had a million questions about what was right and wrong. The Cosmo team actually tackled these questions personally -- writing back to readers with answers or carrying stories that tackled their concerns. Indian parents are usually conservative about sexual matters, and friends were often equally ignorant, so Cosmo was the only one with reliable information.''
''50 Kinky Sex Moves'' notwithstanding, Cosmo does adhere to a set of surprisingly wholesome values. The magazine discourages plastic surgery, for instance, and has run articles opposing breast implants. In its coverage of food and fitness, White notes, ''we don't do any diets, no crash dieting.'' The U.S. edition also has a section called Body Love, in which it tries ''to encourage women to feel good about their bodies,'' no matter their size. A recent issue featured a spread of a curvy woman in a variety of gorgeous bathing suits on some fabulous remote beach. It didn't feel like a token shoot of a larger model; she was beautiful, and the bathing suits were reasonably priced. (While trying to find the picture again on Google, I fell down the Cosmo rabbit hole, scrolling through a gallery of swimwear, then through ''How to Be Sexier -- Instantly'' and then through all 23 slides of ''Sexy Ideas for Long Hair.'' Texturizer now plays a role in my morning routine.)
The magazine also covers aspects of the female body beyond its sex appeal and orgasmic capacity. ''We ran an article that pained me to run,'' White told me, ''but I felt it was important. It basically said the key time to try to get pregnant is between 25 and 35. There has been so much said about still waiting until you're older, and I didn't have my first kid until I was 37, but we're taking a chance -- you need to know it.''
I asked why it pained her. ''I want every girl to feel that she can have her first kid at 50, if she wants,'' White said emphatically. She has encouraged readers to look into freezing their eggs.
Cosmo happens to be fairly traditional about sex itself. Brown believed that it was O.K. to sleep with married men (it was their wives' responsibility to keep them faithful, she argued), but White eliminated that from the formula. (''A total no-no,'' she said.) The magazine also assumes that you're having sex with a boyfriend or a husband (there's not much in the way of same-sex relationships), and not with a one-night stand. ''We certainly talk about sex mostly in terms of relationships,'' White said, ''and most of our readers have told us they're in relationships, and they want the sexual information for their relationship.'' White also sees the hookup culture boomeranging back to more traditional standards. ''One thing I do think that women will evaluate in the coming years,'' she said, ''is casual sex. Is it really what you want to be doing, casual sex, a lot of casual sex? Is it what you feel good about?'' But if it's your thing, that's fine too. ''We don't pass judgment,'' she said.
White acknowledges that some people find Cosmo's obsession with sex trashy, but she's unabashedly proud of how it sets the magazine apart. ''Every Cosmo reader expects to have herself and her pleasures taken care of, equally,'' she said matter-of-factly. ''We reinforce the idea all the time that, yes, we want you to be a fabulous lover, we want to give you those skills, but you better get it back, baby, because that's what you deserve.'' And if that makes for some repetitive stories, so be it. ''There's a frustration that it takes time to learn how to have an orgasm,'' White said, ''and have it consistently. So that's terrain we cover a lot.''
These mores are upheld, to varying degrees of cultural sensitivity, throughout the Cosmo universe. Judging by searches on the Web site, Cosmo U.K. readers are most interested in hair and oral sex (''in that order,'' says its publishing director, Ella Dolphin), but in India, where women traditionally live with their parents until marriage, the Cosmo reader ''might not be comfortable openly discussing her sex life due to fear of being judged,'' Bhalla says. She also notes that because sex toys are banned in India, ''we're careful not to talk about them in the magazine.'' Leyla Orujova, the editor of Cosmo Azerbaijan, told me that her staff ensures that sex is generally discussed within the context of marriage. Cosmo Singapore comes with a yellow ''Unsuitable for the Young'' warning box on the cover and sometimes runs its sexiest content in a sealed section promising ''phenomenal pleasure . . . waiting for you inside.''
Most international Cosmos are run by their countries' natives, but Kerrie Simon-Lawrence, the beautiful, redheaded editor of Middle East Cosmo, is from Sydney. ''Obviously because of the cultural sensitivities within the Middle East'' -- where dating and premarital sex are, in some countries, punishable by law -- ''we can't lift so much from international editions.'' Throughout the Cosmic Conference, she and the magazine's publisher joked repeatedly about needing good lawyers and the possibility of going to jail.
Other editions feature more subtle deviations. Cosmo France has reliably more artsy and experimental covers. The South Korean edition is huge -- physically huge; issues sometimes come as two separate magazines, because they would otherwise break -- and focuses less on sex than marriage (''My Dreamy Wedding'' and ''Dreams Come True!'' are two cover lines from the 400-page April edition). The editor of Cosmo Croatia, Marjana Filipovic-Grcic, told me that stories about women acting bravely on their own have been particularly popular in her country. The same is true for Cosmo Kazakhstan, which ''focuses on career and travel more than the U.S. edition does,'' writes Akisheva, because ''Kazakhstan is a relatively newly independent, developing country, and women are excited about the career opportunities the market economy has to offer.''
Cosmo Germany is more business-oriented. Cosmo Russia (which has the highest circulation of any women's glossy magazine in that country) publishes longer articles. Cosmo Finland has been running multipage, centerfold-type spreads of topless Finnish guys in order to dispel the notion that Finnish guys aren't hot. (Not overly convincing!)
But for all of the magazines' differences, Cosmo is still pushing ''the same standards of beauty'' around the world, Allison Kimmich, executive director of the National Women's Studies Association, said one afternoon after I returned from the conference. ''I don't know that that's a global export that we want to be proud of.'' Kimmich agreed that editorial content ''can sometimes be what you might even call feminist,'' because ''at the most basic level, the articles do promote women's advancement and equality through good advice about career issues and women's health and sexuality.'' But, she said, there is plenty of content that sends ''contrary'' messages. ''The export of Cosmo is like the export of any other global American brand,'' she said. ''Coca-Cola, Hollywood films. It's a part of what's happening to our economy, and like all globalization, there's good with the bad.''
At the office of Peter Yates, the creative director of Hearst Magazines International, a wall is covered in postcard-size versions of international Cosmo covers tacked up in layers of 12 -- a year's worth of cover art, viewable as flipbooks. There's a lot of Megan Fox, Kate Hudson, Eva Mendes, Scarlett Johansson, Olivia Wilde and Jessica Alba, who was once on 20 international covers at the same time. Unlike other women's magazines, which often go for make-up-centric close-ups (Allure), stylish playfulness (Glamour), professional elegance (Marie Claire) or high-fashion photography (Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Vogue), Cosmo keeps it consistently, overtly sexual. The women look young and fertile, and the cover star is generally Beautiful Young Woman With Lots of Cleavage, Standing, Hand on Hip, Almost but Not Quite Smiling -- or the look a woman might give herself in the mirror before going out hoping to get hit on.
The brand saves money by repurposing its covers across various editions, and it shaves costs in other ways, too. For the most part, articles are created by a small team of staff members at Big Cosmo and then ripple outward through the Cosmo network. The magazine has a database for international editors to see what features Cosmo U.S. has planned approximately three months before they run; once the images and layout are uploaded, they can then tweak the content they like to their own country's needs. Writers do not receive royalties when their work is repurposed. Huffy freelancers are virtually nonexistent.
So what appeared as ''Fascinating Breast Facts'' in the July 2011 edition of Cosmo U.S., featuring a close-up of a woman tugging her shirt open, became ''15 Facts You Need to Know About Your Breasts'' in the October 2011 edition of Cosmo Middle East, where it ran with a photo of a model demurely dangling a bra over her shoulder. ''What His Sleep Habits Can Tell You'' ran in Cosmo U.S. in March 2012 and, months later, appeared in China (same photography but with text translated into Chinese) and in Armenia (different photography). And what ran as the fashion spread ''Motorcycle Diaries'' in August 2009 in Cosmo U.S. -- featuring an abandoned gas station, denim, plaids, a hot guy and the open road -- ran two years later in Cosmo Mongolia with the same blend of denim, plaid, gas station and open road, except the whole thing had been reshot with guys who looked Mongolian.
One byline that regularly appears in editions around the world is that of Jessica Knoll, a pretty, friendly and immaculately put-together 28-year-old senior editor. Over drinks at a quiet wine bar near the Big Cosmo office, Knoll explained that it's not only cheaper to produce features from within but also easier for maintaining the Cosmo voice. And anyway, there's less of it to write these days: ''We did a redesign in January and slashed word count,'' she said. ''Part of that is because we live in a Twitter generation. We're not going to be indulgent writers who ramble on for a couple thousand words -- we need to find a way a to say things quickly but also have some personality.''
''I learned a lot from your recent, um, article,'' I said to her, about eight minutes into our meeting. ''About the wishbone-shaped . . . uh . . .''
''Oh, about the internal clitoris?'' she said. ''See, I don't get bashful. It becomes completely normal to talk to your boss and have the word 'penis' appear 15 times in your conversation.''
The article in question -- ''Have Easier, Stronger Orgasms'' -- was on ''surprising new findings'' about the clitoris based on research done in the 1990s (not exactly new) but features an interview with a woman whose sex book came out this year (new). It ran in the May edition of Cosmo U.S. and will likely appear in Cosmos around the world for months to come. ''It's always our goal to make something feel timely and fresh,'' Knoll said. ''Nothing can be evergreen. Even if it's an age-old idea, we have to somehow find a way to put a fresh spin on it.''
For example, in a passage from ''Sex and the Single Girl,'' from 1962, Helen Gurley Brown advises readers on how to catch someone's attention from across a bar: ''Look straight into his eyes, deep and searchingly, then lower your gaze,'' she wrote. ''Go back to your companions or magazine. Now look at him again the same way . . . steadfastly, questioningly. Then drop your eyes. Do it three times and you're a flirt! (P.S., You will have made him very happy.)'' And then from an article in the May 2012 issue of Cosmo titled, ''The Smile That Makes Men Hit on You'': ''A classic study found that you need to make eye contact with a dude and subtly smile at him twice in a row for him to get that you're interested. . . . Look at him, smile and hold your gaze for a couple of seconds. Then look away for a few seconds, look back and do the same thing again.'' A classic study.
Not that Cosmo and its patron saint haven't tried to evolve with the times. In the introduction to the 2003 reissue of ''Sex and the Single Girl,'' about what had changed in the four decades since the book was originally published, Brown wrote: ''Brains have become almost as treasured as beauty . . . almost! . . . If you had to or could choose one or the other, I would almost choose smart!''
This reminded me of a surprising moment from the Cosmic Convention. During a PowerPoint presentation about reader polls, one slide asked the audience to guess which of the following things young women wanted most: a) beauty; b) an amazing career; c) fame; or d) lots of money. There was a slight pause as audience members made their own guesses. Then the answer: Fame. A faint murmur of confusion. Fame? Really? I conducted a copycat poll among my own friends: 15 picked an amazing career, 6 picked money, 3 picked beauty and only 1 picked fame.
The presenter cited the rise of reality TV and made an effort to spin the findings into something positive. It's not that young women necessarily want to be the next Kim Kardashian, the presenter riffed, but that everyone wants to be famous within her social group or on her own Facebook feed.
So add famemongering to the list of less-than-empowering -- or ''contrary,'' as Kimmich would say -- messages that Cosmo sends to its audience worldwide. But what this hand-wringing neglects is that young women are smart and can sift for what they want. Worrying that Cosmo readers will unblinkingly follow orders about kinky sex moves or imbibe some latent sense of Kardashianism seems unfounded and unnecessary and even a little insulting. Maybe the magazine is benefiting from a rise in love marriages in India more than it is facilitating them, but it's definitely not pushing any woman who isn't interested into backdoor booty.
''I know a lot of people have issues about these very sexual cover lines being on display,'' Knoll said. She told me she could remember reading Cosmo from a very young age and never feeling like she had to go out and have sex with someone. Then she paused for a moment. ''When I would read Cosmo, all it made me want to do was grow up, wear a pretty dress, nice heels, move to the city and have an awesome life. And I just don't think that's a bad thing to want, you know?''

HEADLINE: U.S. Discreetly Plans for Post-Assad Syria

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even with fighting raging in Syria and President Bashar al-Assad digging in, the State Department and Pentagon are quietly sharpening plans to cope with a flood of refugees, help maintain basic health and municipal services, restart a shattered economy and avoid a security vacuum in the wake of Mr. Assad's fall, administration officials say.
Mindful of American mistakes following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, both agencies have created a number of cells to draft plans for what many officials expect to be a chaotic, violent aftermath that could spread instability over Syria's borders, even though no official could predict whether Mr. Assad's demise was weeks or months away.
The State Department is considering positioning additional food and medical supplies in the region and is studying how to dismantle the raft of American and European sanctions against Syria quickly to allow investment to flow in and business to resume, avoiding further deterioration of life for ordinary people. 
It is also pressing the opposition in Syria to avoid harsh retaliation against the army, the police and the municipal agencies of Mr. Assad's government that could cause a security vacuum and a collapse of services. Looting and chaos after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2003 planted the seeds of a lasting insurgency.
''We don't want them to dissolve all the institutions in place,'' an administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss planning that is largely being conducted out of public view.
Even though the White House has all but ruled out military intervention, the Pentagon is drafting contingency plans for operations with NATO or regional allies to manage a large flow of refugees over Syria's borders and safeguard the country's arsenal of chemical weapons.
The administration's efforts have been driven by a bleak prognosis shared by most officials: Mr. Assad's fall would be likely to set off a grave, potentially violent and unpredictable implosion in a country strained by even more tribal, ethnic and sectarian divisions than Iraq, possibly in the midst of a presidential election campaign at home.
''The main question we're looking at is how it all plays out after the Assad regime collapses,'' one American official said. ''Chapter 1 is he's gone. Chapter 2 is the post-Assad transition, and initial efforts at stabilization. Chapter 3 is completely unknown, and therefore more than a little scary.''
The planning is particularly delicate because the Obama administration does not want to create the appearance of American interference in a transitional, post-Assad government, even though the United States would inevitably be entangled in any turmoil that resulted.
Rafif Jouejati, an American of Syrian ancestry who is a spokeswoman for a network of activists in Syria, said those committed to Mr. Assad's removal had no interest in ''a foreign transition plan,'' however well intentioned.
''What we don't want to do is descend into the total chaos that Iraq did,'' said Ms. Jouejati, who is participating in a similar planning effort among Syrian activists coordinated through the United States Institute of Peace, an independent but Congressionally financed organization in Washington. Even so, she added, ''I don't think we want the United States to impose lessons learned here.''
The State Department and Pentagon planning efforts became more systematic last month after hopes for an internationally brokered resolution faltered in the face of Russian and Chinese opposition in the United Nations Security Council. The planning is being closely coordinated with regional allies like Turkey, Jordan and Israel, and it coincides with an expansion of overt and covert American and foreign assistance to Syria's increasingly potent rebel fighters.
While the administration has ruled out arming the rebels directly, the administration has authorized $25 million in direct assistance for medical supplies and communication equipment to help the fighters and civilian opponents of Mr. Assad coordinate their activities and, crucially, disseminate reports about the fighting to the rest of the world.
Other countries, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are providing weapons, assisted by a small number of officers from the Central Intelligence Agency who are vetting the fighters receiving them and working with State Department officials trying to unify the fighters with political leaders inside and outside the country. Last month, the Treasury Department granted a waiver to let a new American organization, the Syrian Support Group, raise money for the rebels despite the sanctions that prohibit most financial transactions in Syria.
On Thursday, President Obama also announced a $12 million increase in humanitarian aid, bringing the total to $76 million, largely distributed through international organizations like the World Food Program.
The State Department effort is being coordinated by Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns, who worked in the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau during the planning for the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, when the department clashed with the Pentagon over what to do after Mr. Hussein's fall. The department has created a number of separate cells devoted to aspects of a post-Assad Syria, including humanitarian issues, economic reconstruction, security, the stockpiles of chemical weapons and a political transition.
The last is led by the American ambassador to Syria, Robert S. Ford, who closed the embassy in Damascus in February amid deteriorating security there and is now based in Washington. Mr. Ford met in Cairo last week with more than 250 Syrians to shape plans for the inchoate opposition groups to form a transitional government. That meeting followed a larger gathering of Mr. Assad's opponents last month, organized by the Arab League.
The Pentagon, along with Central Command, has established a similar group of planning cells, known as ''crisis action teams,'' focused on contingencies that could involve the American military. Senior officials declined to give the number and emphasized that such cells are created whenever potential crises emerge.
The range of plans being drafted, however, underscored the gravity of the risks. Atop the list is protecting Syria's chemical weapons, which its leaders acknowledged possessing when vowing last month to use them only in the event of a foreign invasion. ''That would be a purely military-type mission, and so we have to think about contingency planning for safeguarding these stockpiles,'' one official said.
The Pentagon has also offered Jordan and Turkey assistance in defending their borders and managing the influx of refugees, as well as ensuring the delivery of humanitarian supplies. Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta discussed these issues with King Abdullah II of Jordan in Amman on Thursday, said the Pentagon's press secretary, George Little, who declined to discuss specific contingency planning.
Some experts and some lawmakers on Capitol Hill have criticized the administration for not devoting more effort and money to assist Mr. Assad's opponents, including the rebel fighters and emerging political leaders inside and outside the country.
''This is certainly a useful exercise,'' James Dobbins, the director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center of the RAND Corporation, told the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations on Wednesday, referring to the State Department's planning. ''Yet planning divorced from resources and power, as these efforts necessarily are, will have only limited impact on actual events.''

HEADLINE: Making a Pitch to the Tea Party in Indiana

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
EVANSVILLE, Ind. -- When Mitt Romney campaigned last week at one stop in Colorado, a key swing state whose governor and senators are Democrats, he sought to sell himself with a simple message: He is a deal maker, someone who can work with Democrats and reach across the aisle, as he did when he was the governor of Massachusetts.
''We've got to have someone that goes to Washington that buries the hatchet and says, 'You know what? There are good Democrats, there are good Republicans that care about America,' '' Mr. Romney said at a rally in a Denver suburb. ''Let's work together to get the American people working.'' 
But on Saturday, Mr. Romney flew on a Gulfstream IV to the southwest reaches of Indiana to campaign for someone with a distinctly different view of bipartisanship: Richard Mourdock, a Tea Party favorite and the state's Republican Senate nominee, who this spring defeated the incumbent, Richard G. Lugar, one of the most influential Republicans of the past generation.
In that primary, Mr. Mourdock, a two-term state treasurer, attacked Senator Lugar for working with Democrats. Bipartisanship is not the way forward, he said: ''The most powerful people in both parties are so opposed to one another that one side simply has to win out over the other.''
These starkly differing views highlight a central challenge for Mr. Romney: He must woo the rising numbers of Tea Party adherents in his party, many of whom were skeptical of his political record and favored more conservative candidates in the primaries like Rick Santorum. Even though Indiana is not an especially conservative state -- President Obama defeated John McCain here four years ago -- a poll showed Mr. Santorum running neck and neck with Mr. Romney as late as the end of March, when the nomination had been all but decided, and two weeks before Mr. Santorum dropped out.
During a brief stop on Saturday afternoon here at Stepto's Bar-B-Q Shack -- known for its pulled pork -- Mr. Romney did not say anything about the need to work with Democrats. And he avoided mention of issues he and Mr. Mourdock might disagree on.
But he did underscore his commitment to some Tea Party principles. As he outlined his five-point plan for renewing the economy, his biggest applause line came when he described his proposal to slash government programs.
''You can't keep spending massively more than you take in, and a treasurer knows that, a governor knows that,'' Mr. Romney said, referring to Mr. Mourdock and himself.
And for a moment he almost seemed to apologize for being from Massachusetts, perhaps the most liberal state in the union.
''Well, I was raised in Michigan, but I'm really a Massachusetts guy now,'' Mr. Romney said. ''But you know what? I'm an American that loves this country.''
If his record in office is any indication, Mr. Romney is also a pragmatist, one who earlier supported abortion rights and successfully enacted a health care plan in Massachusetts similar to what he now derides as ''Obamacare'' and pledges to repeal.
Just as he cannot offend too many social conservatives and Tea Party members who see bipartisanship as spinelessness, Mr. Romney must also win over moderates and independents who might look favorably on the sort of political approach he adopted before he ran for president.
Mr. Mourdock seemed to implicitly acknowledge this conflict, and that he and Mr. Romney do not have the same viewpoint on perhaps many issues. Emphasizing the need for party unity to defeat President Obama, Mr. Mourdock introduced Mr. Romney by telling the crowd of nearly 100 people that four years ago Mr. Romney was ''one of the very first'' presidential primary candidates to back Mr. McCain, even traveling here to Evansville to rally support for him.
''He is back, and he is here in part because he is the ultimate team player, and politics is all about being a team,'' Mr. Mourdock said. ''This is not a solo sport.''

HEADLINE: A Chef, a Brand And Then Some

BYLINE: By ADRIENNE CARTER

 BODY:
MARCUS SAMUELSSON, dapper in a Ralph Lauren tuxedo and patterned scarf, is working the celebrity-couture crowd at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
It is a Monday evening, just around 7, and Mr. Samuelsson -- hotshot chef, food impresario and kinetic force behind Red Rooster Harlem, one of Manhattan's restaurants of the moment -- is displaying his usual verve.
On the red carpet, he snaps a picture of his glamorous wife, the model and philanthropist Maya Haile, with Beyonce. In the European sculpture gallery, he is chatting with Kanye West and several of the New York Knicks. At the Temple of Dendur, he is dining with Andre Balazs, the hotel owner, and Chelsea Handler.
The next morning at 10, Mr. Samuelsson, in a fresh shirt and tux trousers, is sitting in a sound studio some 60 blocks downtown, painstakingly recording the audio version of his new memoir, ''Yes, Chef.'' Six hours later, in a vintage, red velvet tuxedo jacket, he is overseeing an intimate dinner for 350 at Gotham Hall on behalf of Queen Silvia and Princess Madeleine of Sweden. 
And the morning after that, Mr. Samuelsson is back uptown to work the lunch rush at Red Rooster, that culinary mosaic of Southern, Swedish and Ethiopian comforts on Lenox Avenue in Harlem.
Such is the wild and frenetic life of the modern celebrity chef, that strange amalgam of food savvy, marketing acumen and business skill all wrapped, in Mr. Samuelsson's case, into a media-ready package. At 41, he has exploded not only onto New York's food scene but also onto its cutthroat food business scene.
Yes, there is Red Rooster and five other restaurants. But there is more -- much more. A forthcoming cookware collection for Macy's. A new line of teas. Deals with American Airlines and MasterCard. Appearances on ''Top Chef Masters,''''Chopped All-Stars'' and ''The Next Iron Chef.'' Two Web sites, FoodRepublic.com and marcussamuelsson.com, not to mention four cookbooks and the memoir. His growing, multimillion-dollar enterprise stretches from New York to Chicago to California to Stockholm, and employs more than 700 people.
It is a time-tested recipe. Mr. Samuelsson is the figurative heir of Julia Child and Wolfgang Puck, but he is hardly the only one. Mario Batali, Todd English, Tom Colicchio, Alain Ducasse, Bobby Flay, Lidia Bastianich, David Burke -- the list of marquee names in celebrity chefdom is long. Many of these chefs have built sprawling empires of restaurants -- Mr. Batali has 25 -- and have captured the popular imagination with TV shows, iPhone apps and assorted products.
The question for Mr. Samuelsson and other rising stars is how far and how fast they can push a personal brand. The more business ventures they start, the less they can personally control the quality. It is a quandary that any successful entrepreneur faces as a business grows.
''We constantly have to edit, curate, sift through our brand,'' Mr. Samuelsson says. ''Where is the stretch? Where is the perfect fit? Where does it make sense? You have to be a Baryshnikov.''
It is a challenge, but the financial rewards can be big. Successful restaurants in major cities can bring in $10 million a year, more for hot spots like Red Rooster. But chefs can easily double their income with endorsements, books, consulting jobs and just about anything emblazoned with their names.
Mr. Puck, who got the initial idea for a line of frozen foods from Johnny Carson, a regular at his Spago restaurant in the 1980s, today oversees a $400 million-a-year company. Some $30 million of that comes from consumer products like soups and sauces. His line of appliances and cookware generates $50 million. ''Cooking is an evolution,'' he says. ''If you don't change, you fall behind.''
Food snobs bristle, but even the most elite chefs -- ones formally trained in French cuisine, for example, or those with Michelin stars -- often branch out beyond the kitchen. Eric Ripert is the celebrated chef at Le Bernardin, which has been awarded a four-star rating by The New York Times since it opened in 1986. He also has a show on YouTube. Ferran Adria, who won three Michelin stars for his avant-garde cuisine at elBulli, on the Costa Brava in Spain, is consulting on food trends with PepsiCo, the maker of soda and Fritos. He helped develop a line of Lays potato chips in flavors like chicken.
Any chefs worth their toques want to serve great food. But the business reality is that few chefs succeed simply by making the best fois gras terrine or black cod with miso.
''If you want to grow, you need to exploit who you are as a chef,'' says Susan Ungaro, the president of the James Beard Foundation.
AT Red Rooster, Mr. Samuelsson never seems to stand still. On a recent evening, he is at the front of the house, reminding a hostess to ''activate,'' or engage with customers. Then he is meeting and greeting in the dining room. A group of 20-something women asks to be photographed with him. Then he is back in the kitchen, picking bones from red snapper, telling servers to have dish towels ready and moving a trash can out of the way.
His remarkable New York success story, however, started a world away, in Ethiopia. Mr. Samuelsson was born in a village there, and after his mother died during a tuberculosis epidemic, he and his sister were adopted by a white family in Goteborg, Sweden. Eventually, he worked his way up through restaurant kitchens and landed in New York.
As the chef of the Scandinavian restaurant Aquavit in Manhattan, he earned a three-star rating from The Times in 1995, at the age of 23. Four years later, the James Beard Foundation crowned him as the industry's rising star, and in 2003, as the best chef in New York City.
Then the bottom fell out of the economy in 2008. Merkato 55, a pan-African restaurant he opened in the meatpacking district of Manhattan, never really jelled. ''I wanted to do it so bad, but I didn't do my homework,'' he says.
Aquavit was suffering, too, both in New York and at its outpost in Tokyo. Mr. Samuelsson's relationship with his longtime business partner and mentor, Hakan Swahn, began to fray. For Mr. Samuelsson, it was time to move on.
But the breakup was not easy -- or cheap. Mr. Samuelsson had to buy back the rights to use his own name, at least on the Internet. Draining his bank account, he bought back the domain name, marcussamuelsson.com, from Mr. Swahn.
After the breakup, Mr. Samuelsson did a lot of soul-searching during what he calls ''long, dark days of summer.'' What did he do wrong? Why didn't it work?
''If I used drugs, that would have been the time,'' he says. Looking back, he says he has no regrets. ''How you break up, it's messy and it's hurtful,'' he says. ''But we're big boys. We move on.''
For his part, Mr. Swahn says of Mr. Samuelsson, ''Aquavit certainly became a more renowned restaurant during his tenure and owes him a huge piece of its success.''
Without a restaurant of his own, Mr. Samuelsson focused on building his personal brand. In 2009, he starred in the second season of ''Top Chef Masters'' -- and won. Shortly after the taping, he cooked President Obama's first state dinner, in honor of Manmohan Singh, the prime minister of India, creating a menu of roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, green curry prawns, smoked collard greens and coconut aged basmati rice. He also scored a six-figure deal with Target in 2010 to design limited-edition dish towels and to appear at the opening of its Harlem store.
Such efforts proved crucial as he built his own business, the Marcus Samuelsson Group. The ancillary ventures helped provide cash flow and, more important, kept his own brand in the public eye.
He spent two years building a strategy with his co-founder, Andrew Chapman, a New Yorker with Swedish roots. As they envisioned it, the company would take a multipronged approach to food, with a business that included restaurants, media, products and community work. The cornerstone, Red Rooster, opened in December 2010.
AT Macy's flagship store in Manhattan, the Marcus Samuelsson show is in full swing. It is early July, and he is doing a cooking demonstration as part of the book tour for his memoir. Wearing a wireless headset, he moves through the kitchen, playing the role of television host as his sous chef cooks a meal for the audience.
''I knew that guy looked familiar,'' says one shopper, who stops to watch the demo. ''I saw him on CBS This Morning.''
Yet, for all of this, Mr. Samuelsson still faces the usual challenges of a small-business owner.
When he opened Red Rooster, his team didn't expect 600 daily covers -- customers, in restaurant-speak -- and had to buy more refrigerated coolers to accommodate the necessary extra food. During a heat wave this summer, two air-conditioners broke down. The restaurant made do for a couple of days, serving free lemonade and iced tea. Before the sister restaurant, Ginny's Supper Club, opened in the basement of Red Rooster early this year, Mr. Chapman, who is also the chief executive, had to run to the local Kinko's to copy fliers for the launch party.
As it has grown, the Marcus Samuelsson Group has had to become more disciplined.
Mr. Samuelsson and Mr. Chapman have built out their executive staff. They hired Nils Noren, who had worked with Mr. Samuelsson at Aquavit, to help oversee the food-related aspects of the operation. He was a point person for a six-figure multiyear consulting deal with Restaurant Associates to develop a menu for corporate cafeterias, including those at Goldman Sachs, Conde Nast and Morgan Stanley. Christina Wang, a trained baker and former consultant at Booz & Company, brings her business acumen, with contracts, negotiations and the occasional Excel spreadsheet. They have also bolstered their stable of lawyers and accountants to add expertise in sponsorship deals, editorial content and other areas where the company is expanding.
The team now has weekly meetings, in part to make sure that members can keep tabs on Mr. Samuelsson and all of his ideas. He can find inspiration everywhere. On a recent trek to Roberta's, an upscale pizza place in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, he saw a child selling lemonade and iced tea on the street corner, and decided he needed a similar stand at Red Rooster. He polled his Twitter followers to decide between vintage or modern dishes at the restaurant. (Vintage won.)
Mr. Samuelsson is trying to balance the culinary and the commercial. After investing $3 million in Red Rooster, he and his business partner are plowing the profits back into the business. They used some of the money to finance Ginny's.
He is also looking at new projects, albeit selectively and with a less-is-more strategy. This fall, he is opening a casual restaurant in Alice Tully Hall with Restaurant Associates, called American Table Cafe and Bar by Marcus Samuelsson. The idea is to marry the cultural hub that is Lincoln Center with the broader urban area, and infuse it with a sense of fun.
But he remains obsessed with details. For American Table, he helped choose the seat cushions and refine the logo. He rejected one style of the Macy's cookware, reasoning it was too heavy for someone like his grandmother.
MR. SAMUELSSON says he wants to bring a sense of ''democracy'' to dining and to ensure high-quality food in multiple price categories. That is one reason he initially opted to develop a line of food for American Airlines -- not for first-class passengers, but for those stuck in coach. He also plans to open the Nook at Red Rooster, a walk-up window where passers-by can buy coffee, pastries or hot dogs with shrimp salad for a few dollars.
He often seeks interaction with the broader community, whether at his restaurants, through the Internet, or on his daily subway ride. In Harlem, he has held free cooking classes for children and has helped expand the farmer's market in the area. More than 70 percent of Red Rooster employees are local residents, many of whom had little experience with fine dining. The restaurant hired additional managers to get the employees up to speed.
''When you look at strategy, it's not set up to be a pure moneymaking machine,'' says Derek Evans, the media adviser for the Marcus Samuelsson Group. ''It's a passion machine.''

BYLINE: By THE EDITORS

 BODY:
In a 2009 episode of his HBO show, ''Real Time,'' Bill Maher and his panel of guests -- Mos Def, Salman Rushdie and Christopher Hitchens (Scotch in hand) -- pilloried President Obama for his dismissive answer to an ''online town hall'' question about whether it would make economic sense for America to legalize, regulate and tax marijuana. ''I don't know what this says about the online audience,'' Obama said. ''But the answer is no, I don't think that is a good strategy.'' Yet Maher writes in his review of Doug Fine's new book, ''Too High to Fail: Cannabis and the New Green Economic Revolution,'' that there are fiscal and moral arguments to be made over how the United States polices pot. 
In a recent e-mail, he said of Obama: ''If I could tell him just one thing, it would be to remind him that each of the last three presidents could have gone to jail in their youth for doing drugs that other Americans are still being punished for. Just getting caught smoking pot once can follow you around for the rest of your life, blocking career and even housing opportunities. Three presidents in a row now have acknowledged partying in their youth. Our drug policy is a glaring hypocrisy.''
What are the chances federal policy on cannabis will change in our lifetimes? ''Depends on how old you are,'' Maher said. ''If you're 2 years old, maybe. What worries me is that in America, we can almost never kill off anything bad once it starts. Whether it's mohair subsidies or the 50,000 troops still in Germany, once something has a constituency, it finds a way to live on. The drug war, just like the war on terror, created jobs and budgets, and the beneficiaries don't want to give them up, even though they know they're fighting an immoral and unwinnable war.''

HEADLINE: An American Model for Tech Jobs?

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC, HIROKO TABUCHI and CHARLES DUHIGG; Bill Vlasic reported from Smyrna, Tenn., Hiroko Tabuchi from Tokyo and Charles Duhigg from New York. Lis Horta Moriconi contributed from Rio de Janeiro.

 BODY:
SMYRNA, Tenn. -- The dairy farms that once draped the countryside here were paved over so the Japanese carmaker Nissan could build its first American assembly plant. Eighty miles to the south, another green pasture was replaced by a Nissan engine factory, and across Tennessee about 100 Nissan suppliers dot the landscape, making steel in Murfreesboro, air conditioning units in Lewisburg, transmission parts in Portland.
Three decades ago, none of this existed. The conventional wisdom at the time was simple: Japanese automakers would not build many cars anywhere but Japan, where supply chains were in place, costs were tightly controlled and the reputation for quality was unparalleled.
''They were very unfamiliar doing anything outside Japan,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican who was governor of Tennessee when Nissan opened its factory here in 1983. ''They were tentative and awkward even discussing it.'' 
Today, echoes of that conventional wisdom can be heard within the American technology industry. For years, high-tech executives have argued that the United States cannot compete in making the most popular electronic devices. Companies like Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, which rely on huge Asian factories, assert that many types of manufacturing would be too costly and inefficient in America. Only overseas, they have said, can they find an abundance of educated midlevel engineers, low-wage workers and at-the-ready suppliers.
But the migration of Japanese auto manufacturing to the United States over the last 30 years offers a case study in how the unlikeliest of transformations can unfold. Despite the decline of American car companies, the United States today remains one of the top auto manufacturers and employers in the world. Japanese and other foreign companies account for more than 40 percent of cars built in the United States, employing about 95,000 people directly and hundreds of thousands more among parts suppliers.
The United States gained these jobs through a combination of public and Congressional pressure on Japan, ''voluntary'' quotas on car exports from Japan and incentives like tax breaks that encouraged Japanese automakers to build factories in America. Pressuring technology companies to move manufacturing here would pose different challenges. For one thing, Apple and many other technology giants are American, not foreign, and so are viewed differently by politicians and the public. But it is possible and the benefits might be worth it, some economists say.
''The U.S. has a long history of demanding that companies build here if they want to sell here, because it jump-starts industries,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a senior trade official in the Reagan administration who helped negotiate with Japan in the 1980s. The government could also encourage domestic production of technologies, including display manufacturing and advanced semiconductor fabrication, that would nurture new industries. ''Instead, we let those jobs go to Asia, and then the supply chains follow, and then R&D follows, and soon it makes sense to build everything overseas,'' he said. ''If Apple or Congress wanted to make the valuable parts of the iPhone in America, it wouldn't be hard.''
One country has recently succeeded at forcing technology jobs to relocate. Last year, Brazilian politicians used subsidies and the threat of continued high tariffs on imports to persuade Foxconn -- which makes smartphones and computers in Asia for dozens of technology companies -- to start producing iPhones, iPads and other devices in a factory north of Sao Paulo. Today, the new plant has 1,000 workers, and could employ many more. Apple and Foxconn declined to comment about the specifics of their Brazilian manufacturing.
However, a developing country like Brazil can adopt trade policies that would be difficult for the United States to do. Taking a hard line to reduce imports of technology goods and encourage domestic manufacturing could violate international trade agreements and set off a trade confrontation. ''We're a long way from even talking about limits on imported iPhones or iPads,'' said a former high-ranking Obama administration official who did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak.
Protectionism is bad policy in today's globalized world, many economists argue. Countries benefit most when they concentrate on what they do best, and trade barriers harm consumers by driving up prices and undermine a nation's competitiveness by shielding industries from market forces that spur innovation. The United States needs to create new jobs, economists say, but it should not chase low-paid electronics assembly work that at some point may be replaced by robots. Instead, it should focus on higher-paying jobs.
''Closing our border is a 20th-century thought, and it will only weaken the economy over the long term,'' said Andrew N. Liveris, president of Dow Chemical and co-chairman of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, a group of executives and academics convened by the White House who have studied ways to encourage domestic manufacturing.
The debate is not just economic, however. Increasingly, it is political. With high unemployment, the question of how to create jobs has taken a role in the presidential race between President Obama and Mitt Romney, and both have traded barbs on outsourcing by American companies.
Although the car and technology industries are different, and the eras are separated by 30 years, the resurgence of American auto manufacturing in the 1980s is an example of how one industry created tens of thousands of good jobs. Since its first pickup truck rolled off the line here on June 16, 1983, Nissan has produced more than seven million vehicles in the United States. It now employs 15,000 people in this country. It makes more than a half-million cars, trucks and S.U.V.'s a year, with the plant in Smyrna building six models, including the soon-to-be-produced, all-electric Nissan Leaf.
Other foreign carmakers settled in America -- Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and, most recently, Volkswagen -- after a failed attempt decades ago. And some of those factories have become among the best in the world. The Nissan engine plant in Decherd, Tenn., for instance, exports engines to Japan. ''We have 14 companies now that produce light vehicles here, and that is enormous,'' said Thomas Klier, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago. ''There is no major market in the world that compares to it.''
Tennessee?
''Where is Tennessee?''
It was a blunt question, posed by Takashi Ishihara, president of Nissan, to Mr. Alexander, then the state's governor.
Mr. Alexander, who had journeyed to Tokyo in 1979 to pitch Nissan on building a plant in his state, was ready with his answer: ''I said, 'It's right in the middle.' '' To help out, he displayed a satellite photograph of the United States at night, showing the bright lights shining on the East and West Coasts and the relative darkness of Tennessee.
''We were the third-poorest state in the nation back then,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''President Carter had told all the U.S. governors to go to Japan and persuade the Japanese to make in the U.S. what they sell in the U.S.''
Mr. Alexander recalled that the Nissan executives were ''incredibly anxious'' about testing their homegrown production systems abroad. Could the Japanese car companies achieve the same quality using American workers?
Despite the concerns, pressures were growing for Nissan to break out of its manufacturing cocoon in Japan, including currency fluctuations that made exporting more expensive. The final push came from American anger as imports grabbed one-fourth of the United States market.
''Japanese automakers had achieved rapid growth by exporting to America,'' said Hidetoshi Imazu, a senior manufacturing executive at Nissan in Tokyo who led the development of the plant here in its early years. ''But it was clear that model would no longer work.''
In the fall of 1980, Congress held hearings to limit Japanese imports. With tensions running high, Nissan announced plans for the $300 million assembly plant in Smyrna. That gave the company a head start in circumventing looming restrictions. In May 1981, Japan agreed to limit exports to America to 1.68 million cars annually, a 7 percent reduction from a year earlier. In addition, the United States imposed a 25 percent tax on imported pickup trucks.
''The pressure put on the Japanese was absolutely critical for them to agree to export restraints,'' said Stephen D. Cohen, a professor emeritus of international studies at American University.
Rural Tennessee may not have seemed a likely place to build a giant automotive factory, but its location was actually a selling point. It was far from Detroit and the United Auto Workers -- and the Japanese wanted to work without what they saw as union interference.
Nissan's choice of Tennessee was not popular with everyone. On a 20-degree February morning in 1981, trade unionists jeered Mr. Alexander and Nissan executives as they turned the first shovelfuls of dirt for the factory, protesting nonunion construction crews. An airplane circled overhead, urging a boycott of Japanese vehicles.
Standing nearby was Marvin Runyon, a 37-year veteran of Ford who had been recruited as Nissan's first American plant manager. In a later interview with The New York Times, Mr. Runyon was asked what his old colleagues in Detroit thought of his new job. ''They wish me luck,'' he said. ''But not too much.''
Success did not come overnight. Many Japanese were skeptical of their new colleagues. Americans, they had heard, were soft, lazy and incapable of mastering the precision manufacturing that had made Nissan great.
To train its new American engineers, Nissan flew workers to its Zama factory in eastern Japan. There the Nissan officials, assisted by English-speaking Japanese workers called ''communication helpers,'' imparted the intricacies of the company's production techniques to the Americans.
Beginnings at Nissan
Early on, Nissan guarded against quality concerns by not relying on parts from American suppliers. Most components were either shipped from Japan or produced by Japanese companies that set up operations nearby. ''We felt sourcing parts in the U.S. wouldn't allow us to make cars in our own way,'' said Mr. Imazu, the Nissan manufacturing executive.
By 1985, Nissan was confident enough about the quality that it added passenger cars to Smyrna's assembly lines. Gradually, American parts makers were allowed to bid on supply contracts. Even that came amid arm-twisting by Congress, which passed a law in 1992 requiring auto makers to inform consumers of the percentage of parts in United States-made cars that came from North America, Asia or elsewhere.
Calsonic Kansei of Tokyo opened its first plant in Tennessee in the mid-1980s, and now employs about 2,600 Americans making instrument panels, exhaust systems, and heating and cooling modules for Nissan. ''The Japanese suppliers were encouraged to localize production,'' said Matt Mulliniks, vice president for sales and marketing at Calsonic Kansei in Tennessee.
Nissan's early doubts are reflected in recent debates over whether American workers can compete with overseas laborers. Within the technology industry, workers in Asia are viewed as hungrier and more willing to tolerate harsh work schedules to achieve productivity. The numbingly repetitive jobs of assembling cellphones and tablet computers, executives say, would be scorned here; they worry that many Americans would not make the sacrifices that success demands, and want too much vacation time and predictable work schedules.
In the auto industry, the belief that American workers could not match Japanese workers has long since faded. ''A big part of the reluctance of Japanese automakers to come to the U.S. was the belief that their manufacturing systems could only work with loyal Japanese employees,'' said Dr. Cohen, the American University professor. ''Everybody was surprised how quickly the systems were adopted here.''
This year, Nissan held an internal competition to decide where to produce a new Infiniti-brand luxury sport utility vehicle. The plant in Smyrna was vying against one in Japan.
The surprising winner: Smyrna.
''All my life I've heard about how great luxury brands like Lexus and BMW are,'' said Richard Soloman, a 20-year veteran at the Smyrna plant. ''Now we will be building a vehicle of that standard right here in Tennessee.''
The Japanese presence has rippled through the South. But no place has benefited to the extent of Tennessee, which counts more than 60,000 jobs related to automobile and parts production. The state's jobless rate, which exceeded the national average by a significant margin in 1983 when Nissan opened its plant, is now lower -- 8.1 percent in June versus 8.2 percent nationwide.
Brazil's Breakthrough
Earlier this year, when Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, took the stage at a technology conference, he was asked if his company -- which once made computers in America, but now locates most assembly in China and other countries -- would ever build another product in the United States.
''I hope so,'' Mr. Cook replied. ''One day.''
That day came recently for Brazil.
In Jundiai, an hour's drive from Sao Paulo, a strip of asphalt has recently been rechristened Avenida Steve Jobs, or Steve Jobs Avenue. Alongside is a factory where workers make iPhones and iPads. Brazil got these jobs through tactics the United States once used to persuade Nissan and other foreign carmakers to build plants in America: it cajoled Apple and Foxconn with a combination of financial incentives and import penalties.
Like the United States, Brazil is a big market -- the third largest for computers after China and the United States. It has long imposed tariffs on imported technology products to encourage domestic manufacturing. Those fees mean that smartphones and laptops often cost consumers more in Brazil, and that domestic manufacturers can be at a disadvantage if their products require imported parts.
In April 2011, Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, traveled to Asia with a pitch, much as Mr. Alexander did in 1979. The federal government would give Foxconn tax breaks, subsidized loans and special access through customs and lower tariffs for imported parts if it started assembling Apple products in Brazil, where Foxconn was already producing electronics for Dell, Sony and Hewlett-Packard.
Foxconn agreed. Within months, new Brazilian engineers were flying to China for training. By year's end, Foxconn was making iPhones in Jundiai, and it began making iPads there in early 2012, according to Evandro Oliveira Santos, director of the Jundiai Metalworkers Union, whose members work at the plant. Stores now carry Apple products with the inscription ''Fabricado no Brasil'' -- ''Made in Brazil.''
Apple products remain expensive; the latest iPad, for instance, costs about $760 in Brazil, compared with $499 in the United States. But because those devices are made in Brazil and lower tariffs are charged on parts used to assemble them, Foxconn and Apple are pocketing larger shares of the profits, analysts say, offsetting the increased costs of building outside China.
Foxconn declined to discuss specific customers, but said that the Brazilian government's incentive programs had influenced its decisions and that the company expected to generate more Brazilian jobs and aid the government's goal of furthering the country's technology industries.
Indeed, Brazil hopes that compelling Foxconn to assemble iPhones and iPads domestically will help set off a technology explosion. Ms. Rousseff has said that Foxconn could invest $12 billion more in Brazil. And as an electronics supply chain develops within the country, as it has in China, the expectation is that other manufacturers will build factories.
The government also hopes to use consumer electronics as a springboard for more advanced manufacturing. Targeting high-tech parts like computer displays and semiconductors could help Brazil reduce its trade deficit in these products and develop a robust homegrown industry, said Virgilio Almeida, information technology secretary at the Ministry of Science and Technology. ''They are deemed high priority in the Brazilian industrial policy and are part of the Greater Brazil Plan,'' he said. ''Brazil has developed specific policies that grant incentives to foment research, development and industrial production.''
America's Gap
Throughout his term, Mr. Obama has regularly gathered advisers to discuss manufacturing, according to former high-ranking White House officials. As one meeting was breaking up, Mr. Obama casually tapped an aide's iPhone to raise a point. Since the device is designed domestically, he said, it should be possible to make it in this country as well.
But it became clear at the meetings that there were differences of opinion over how best to bring manufacturing home, according to people familiar with the discussions who did not want to be named because the sessions were private. Everyone shared the same goal: establishing a level playing field and creating as many jobs in America as possible. But the debate centered, in part, on choosing among different tactics the American government has used in the past: penalties like tariffs against foreign countries that do not play by the rules or incentives like tax breaks to encourage more domestic manufacturing. On one side were officials like Ron Bloom, until earlier this year the president's senior counselor for manufacturing policy, who favored more aggressive stances to counter policies used by Asian countries. He argued that the United States should fight China's efforts to keep its currency weak. If China's currency were stronger, American companies might find it costlier to make their goods in China and could have greater incentive to manufacture more in this country.
Aligned on the other side at times were two powerful voices: Lawrence H. Summers, the top economic adviser to Mr. Obama until 2010, and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Along with many economists, Mr. Summers argued that an overly aggressive trade stance could hurt manufacturing -- by, for instance, pushing up the price of imported steel used by carmakers -- and over time, drive companies away.
Mr. Geithner thought diplomacy was more effective than confrontational tactics like labeling China a currency manipulator. ''He told us, 'It's going to be a trade war if we go there,' '' according to a person who attended the meetings. But this person countered that China would respond only to pressure. ''What doesn't work is the quiet stuff,'' he said.
Mr. Summers, in a recent interview, declined to discuss his role at the White House. But speaking more broadly, he said that protectionist measures might incite new domestic manufacturing in the short run, but that it would come at a high price. ''People will pay more for the product because it's produced in a place that can't make it at the lowest cost,'' he said. ''It burdens exporters because they pay more for their inputs. And it removes the spur of competition.''
A spokeswoman for Mr. Geithner said, ''A multidimensional approach to tough yet smart engagement with China is the most effective way to level the playing field.'' This strategy has had some success in persuading China to increase the value of its currency, she noted.
One of the president's economic advisers also said that, despite some differences, Mr. Obama's team, including Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers, united to preserve manufacturing jobs in a critical area by bailing out the auto industry in the wake of the financial crisis.
But the divisions within the White House have often frustrated those who wanted a sharper focus on manufacturing. ''The critics would say we didn't really fight for manufacturing policy,'' said another former high-ranking official who took part in many of those meetings and who did not want to be named because the discussions were confidential. ''They have a strong point.''
Now, with unemployment high and a growing debate over outsourcing of jobs, manufacturing is on the political agenda. In March, Gene B. Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic Council, outlined initiatives -- including tax breaks for building factories here, infrastructure investments and going after ''unfair trade practices'' -- to reinvigorate manufacturing. In May, the Commerce Department announced tariffs on Chinese solar panels for selling below fair-market value. The White House has challenged China's trade practices on tires and rare-earth metals, and has established an ''interagency trade enforcement center'' to combat unfair trade.
Washington, however, has generally shied from addressing the protectionist measures of countries like China with countermeasures, as politicians once did against Japan.
After the Senate passed legislation last year imposing tariffs on nations whose currency is undervalued -- a salvo aimed at China -- the bill went nowhere in the House of Representatives, and the White House indicated it did not like the proposal.
However, champions of ''in-sourcing'' legislation -- which takes away benefits from companies moving jobs abroad and provides incentives for those bringing jobs back -- said the tenor of the debate was changing. ''The public by and large has been betrayed by large American corporations that outsource. I think Congress is catching on to that,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio.
Still, he does not advocate tariffs or quotas. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, also favors tax breaks, rather than penalties. ''I love my iPad,'' she said. ''And I want it made in America.''
One reason for the difference today: Unlike in the 1980s, when Japanese auto imports upset many voters, there has been little public outcry over imported cellphones and computers.
Back then, American workers were losing jobs as imports from Japanese companies cut into sales of the Big Three automakers.
But consumer electronics are different. Though some jobs have moved to Asia, many were never here to begin with. And the biggest technology importers -- like Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Microsoft -- are American companies.
Today, many consumers do not know or care where their smartphones are made. ''Where it was built, what it means for politics, how it affects the economy,'' said Raymond Stata, a founder of Analog Devices, one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers, ''that's not something people think about when they buy.''

HEADLINE: Copying Obama's '08 Strategy, Romney Takes to the Ground in Colorado

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
LAKEWOOD, Colo. -- In an office park with clipped lawns and burbling fountains, volunteers at Mitt Romney's new Colorado headquarters were busy working the phones. Do you approve of President Obama, they asked voters. Are you voting Democratic or Republican? Every time they tallied a new Romney supporter, they dinged a bell.
The campaign cannot ding fast enough. With Colorado as narrowly divided and fiercely contested as any battleground state in the country, its fate this November may well depend on whether Mr. Romney's campaign can build a ground-level presence like the one that helped carry Mr. Obama four years ago. 
They are starting from behind. Mr. Obama already has 32 field offices scattered across Colorado, from the dense Denver suburbs to smaller cities on the edges of the mountains and plains. Mr. Romney's campaign has just 10, many of them paired with local Republican Party offices. The campaign's state headquarters has been formally open since only mid-June.
But as Republicans outpace Democrats in fund-raising, they say have doubled their national footprint over the past month. The Romney campaign is looking to chip away at Mr. Obama's vaunted organizational advantage on the ground, as Republican-financed political groups blast the airwaves.
''They are the reigning champs,'' said Rich Beeson, Mr. Romney's political director. ''They learned from us in 2004. We learned from them in 2008.''
With more volunteers and more campaign offices, each campaign can send out armies of door-knockers to identify supporters and goad them to volunteer and vote. They have beachheads to attract new volunteers and spots where supporters can spend evenings building databases, calling other voters and eating one another's homemade cookies.
Republicans say they have 250 ''victory offices'' nationwide, with four more in the pipeline for Colorado, including one in the liberal college town of Boulder. Mr. Romney's advisers say they have no plans to try to match Mr. Obama office for office and staff member for staff member, but they say that will not prevent them from covering places like Colorado with volunteers to make phone calls and ring doorbells.
''Colorado could very well be the state that decides the presidency,'' said James Garcia, Mr. Romney's state director here. ''We have activity across the state. We're leaving no stone unturned.''
The Obama campaign has hundreds of field offices across the country but would not provide a precise number.
The ground game could tip the balance in tossup states like Colorado, analysts say. Local television stations in Denver and in southern and western Colorado are already soaked with political advertisements, most of them currently from Mr. Romney's side. His campaign and Republican-affiliated groups spent $1.4 million in Colorado from July 3 to July 16, edging out the $1.1 million spent by Democrats.
Opinion polls, which have given Mr. Obama a narrow lead, are tightening here in Colorado.
''A serious investment in ground game by either side could be pivotal,'' said Seth Masket, an associate professor of political science at the University of Denver. ''Where it's a really close swing state, a point or two can make all the difference in the world.''
In studying how Coloradans voted in 2008 compared with 2004, Mr. Masket found that Democratic turnout rose by an average of 6.3 percent in counties with Obama campaign offices. Average turnout rose by only 4.5 percent in counties without Obama offices.
The Obama and Romney offices in Lakewood sit four miles apart along Colfax Avenue, a busy, somewhat gritty commercial stretch of strip malls, fast food restaurants and liquor stores that Playboy magazine once called the ''longest, wickedest street in America.''
A short drive east from the Romney campaign's parklike headquarters is the Obama campaign's local field office. It sits in a strip mall, near a dog-training school and a bong shop called Heads of State, and buzzes with activity as seasoned volunteers chat with new arrivals. Others call previous Obama supporters, hoping to reignite some of the enthusiasm that helped Democrats carry this county in 2008.
The volunteers make thousands of phone calls across Colorado every week, describing why they support Mr. Obama and talking to voters (at least the ones who do not immediately hang up) about middle-class tax cuts, student loans and health care. They knock on doors. They register voters at Colorado Rockies baseball games. They try to overcome the malaise and anger congealed by 8.3 percent unemployment nationwide and years of sluggish economic growth.
''Even if they're disappointed, they still believe he's the best hope we have,'' said Jill Wildenberg, a volunteer neighborhood leader for the Obama campaign in downtown Denver.
Team Romney said it was running its Lakewood headquarters 12 hours a day six days a week, with shorter shifts on Sundays. Mr. Garcia, the Colorado director, and Ciara Matthews, the campaign's Colorado spokeswoman, said the campaign had been outpacing expectations on numbers of new volunteers, voter registration and the numbers of shifts people were working.
They see a sign of renewed enthusiasm in Republican voter registration, which stands at 1.12 million, compared with 1.09 million registered Democrats. And they say that volunteers like Mary Janssen, whose family owns a struggling portrait photography studio, may help tip the scales in Colorado.
''We are all hurting, everyone I know,'' Ms. Janssen said, offering a long list of grievances against Mr. Obama, including high joblessness, abortion policies and health care. She said she had been making phone calls since the beginning of summer and had brought friends from her Lakewood neighborhood to volunteer. Her passion to drum Mr. Obama out of office ran as hot as the baking late-afternoon sun outside the air-conditioned office.
''I just jumped in here and said, 'Hey, you got me,' '' Ms. Janssen said. ''I'm going to fight.''

HEADLINE: Record Spending By Obama's Camp Shrinks Coffers

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and JO CRAVEN McGINTY; Kitty Bennett and Derek Willis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama has spent more campaign cash more quickly than any incumbent in recent history, betting that heavy early investments in personnel, field offices and a high-tech campaign infrastructure will propel him to victory in November.
Since the beginning of last year, Mr. Obama and the Democrats have burned through millions of dollars to find and register voters. They have spent almost $50 million subsidizing Democratic state parties to hire workers, pay for cellphones and update voter lists. They have spent tens of millions of dollars on polling, online advertising and software development to turn Mr. Obama's fallow volunteers corps into a grass-roots army.
The price tag: about $400 million from the beginning of last year to June 30 this year, according to a New York Times analysis of Federal Election Commission records, including $86 million on advertising.
But now Mr. Obama's big-dollar bet is being tested. With less than a month to go before the national party conventions begin, the president's once commanding cash advantage has evaporated, leaving Mitt Romney and the Republican National Committee with about $25 million more cash on hand than the Democrats as of the beginning of July. 
Despite Mr. Obama's multimillion-dollar advertising barrage against Mr. Romney, he is now being outspent on the airwaves with Mr. Romney benefiting from a deluge of spending by conservative ''super PACs'' and outside groups. While Mr. Romney has depleted much of his funds from the nominating contest, he is four weeks away from being able to tap into tens of millions of dollars in general election money. And many polls show the race to be very close.
Mr. Obama's cash needs -- he spent $70.8 million in June alone, more than half on advertising and far more than he raised -- have brought new urgency to his campaign's fund-raising efforts. His advisers have had to schedule more fund-raising trips than originally planned to big-money states like New York, according to donors involved in the effort. The super PAC supporting his campaign, Priorities USA Action, is enlisting former President Bill Clinton as a rainmaker, hoping to counter its conservative counterparts.
While Mr. Obama will also have access to general election money in September, he is unlikely to have the same spending advantage over Mr. Romney as he had during the primary season, when Mr. Romney spent much of his money battling Republican rivals.
And with August a traditionally slow month for fund-raising, Mr. Obama has bombarded his supporters in recent weeks with increasingly urgent pleas for money, mindful that he will need to drastically raise his cash intake in the coming months merely to equal his record-breaking haul from 2008.
''My upcoming birthday next week could be the last one I celebrate as president of the United States, but that's not up to me -- it's up to you,'' Mr. Obama wrote last week as the campaign's latest fund-raising deadline and his Aug. 4 birthday approached. ''This July deadline is our most urgent yet, coming after two consecutive months of being significantly outraised by Romney and the Republicans.''
Mr. Obama's heavy expenditures -- and his campaign's pressure on bundlers to find and groom new donors -- have stirred worries among other Democrats, who have long taken Mr. Obama's financial supremacy for granted.
''There is a lot of worry that Romney's folks are raising so much more,'' said one of Mr. Obama's top fund-raisers, who did not want to be identified as discussing internal campaign business. ''I just don't think there's a lot of high-dollar money left on the table.''
In fact, Republicans insist that Mr. Obama will rue his spending.
''Heading into the final laps of the campaign, the Democrats will regret squandering so much of their haul early in the cycle on massive monthly overhead,'' said Sean M. Spicer, a spokesman for the R.N.C.
But in interviews, party and campaign officials defended the approach of spending money to build out the campaign, saying they believed that the wisdom of Mr. Obama's strategy would be demonstrated at the voting booth in November.
''The earlier the better,'' said Adam Fetcher, an Obama campaign spokesman. ''Starting a conversation with a persuadable voter months before Election Day allows us to be more effective in responding to that voter's priorities than if they first hear from us a few weeks out. Building and maintaining our grass-roots foundation takes time and resources, but we believe those early investments will make a difference.''
But grass-roots movements do not come cheap.
Through June 30, Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee had spent $46 million on direct mail and postage, according to F.E.C. records. Legal fees added up to $3 million, while $25,000 went to flower arrangements. Phones and telemarketing have eaten up at least $24 million, and Internet advertising $36 million, part of a sophisticated effort to try out different fund-raising appeals, test attacks on Mr. Romney and reach small donors. The campaign reached two million total donors in May, a campaign official said, a tally it did not reach until August during the 2008 election cycle.
Mindful that the recession has displaced many people who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, especially those with low incomes, the campaign has also invested heavily in voter registration. That has paid dividends in states like Nevada, where Democrats have steadily expanded their registration advantage over Republicans in recent months. In Ohio, the early deployment of money and a field staff last year also allowed the campaign to help Democrats fight a Republican-led effort to restrict early voting in the state.
The campaign has opened field offices far earlier than past campaigns in swing communities around the country, hiring people to train volunteers, find pockets of Democrats and identify voters who might be persuaded to vote for Mr. Obama in November. With staff members in virtually every state, the Obama campaign and the D.N.C. have spent $52 million on payroll and benefits since the beginning of last year, along with $5 million for rent.
In the bellwether city of Chillicothe, Ohio, Mr. Obama's team opened a field office eight months earlier than it did during the 2008 cycle, a party official said on Thursday, allowing the campaign to spend far longer courting those voters still on the fence.
''You can pay for direct mail or TV ads at the last minute, but you can't shortcut long-term volunteer training programs,'' said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the campaign's spending strategy. ''The relationships we've built, the depth of what people know about their communities, our data systems, the training and organization -- good luck doing that in less than 100 days.''

HEADLINE: The Pivot: The Move Of the Moment

BYLINE: By JESSE KORNBLUTH. 
Jesse Kornbluth is the editor of HeadButler.com.

 BODY:
IT'S an election year, and you can't watch a political news show or wade through a piece of punditry without running into the cliche of the moment. ''The pivot'' is that cliche, the Macarena of 2012. 
We used to know the pivot as a physical means of turning but now the pivot is commonly understood to be a rotational movement of a dancer around his own vertical axis, executed so flawlessly it seems frictionless, effortless, without cost or consequence. Think Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.
In a time when ''mistakes were made'' and no one can seem to name who made them or prosecute the known offenders, the rise of ''the pivot'' was inevitable. We have become -- perhaps we always were -- a nation of artful dancers, turning away from old, unworkable situations and stepping into a bright new future on our own terms. As Jenna Wortham wrote in this newspaper about Internet start-ups that veer away from ruin by totally reinventing their missions: ''To pivot is essentially to fail gracefully.''
There is one thing that Americans do not do, and that is fail. The pivot snatches triumph from the jaws of failure: it's success, scored retroactively.
Dwight Howard decides not to leave the Orlando Magic -- give that man a pivot. In an editorial, ''The Proper Pivot Toward Asia,'' The Washington Post urged a shift from military containment of China to a multilayered approach . (Naturally, there is always someone who won't play along. When a blogger recently took a modest drop in the unemployment rate as reason to turn attention to the deficit, Paul Krugman moaned, ''Not Again With the Pivot.'')
In Olympics season, we look for our own to win medals. In that spirit, Mitt Romney takes pivot gold. All winter, he campaigned more like a bred-in-the-bone conservative than a Massachusetts governor who championed a health care system that became the president's model. With the nomination in hand, it was time to ''hit a reset button for the fall campaign'' -- for Romney to pivot toward the middle, there to pitch the moderates and independents who are said to decide elections. But he didn't.
So how does Romney take the pivot prize? He introduced a new move. When confronted with contradictions in his public statements, he goes blank: ''I never said that.'' And his interviewers, lacking a counterpivot, change the subject. Not a calorie burned, not a muscle strained. Astaire couldn't have made a smoother pivot.
You can pivot, too. Don't like the way your business is going? Does your page on Match.com fail to attract? Do you need to make a choice, and you're feeling like inspiration beamed from Martians into your fillings might hold the answer? No worries. Turn, baby. Turn, turn, turn.

To the Editor:
I was surprised by the conclusion Douglas Brinkley and Johnny Depp come to in their essay about Woody Guthrie's novel ''House of Earth'' (''This Land Was His Land,'' July 15). I, too, discern a message, but it's not ''the unerring rightness of adobe living.'' The message of Guthrie's life's work is clear: Fight back against the environmental, economic and social crises that capitalism creates, and for a new global society that guarantees everyone such basic human rights as a beautiful, well-constructed place to live. 
SUSAN DORAZIO Bronx
To the Editor:
Like many readers, I applaud the efforts of Douglas Brinkley and Johnny Depp to bring about the publication of ''House of Earth.'' As the author of a dissertation and several essays on Pearl S. Buck, I am intrigued that the title of Guthrie's novel echoes that given to the trilogy of Buck's novels from the 1930s: ''The Good Earth'' (1931), which won a Pulitzer Prize, was followed by ''Sons'' (1932) and ''A House Divided'' (1935). Buck's publisher issued a combined edition in 1935 as ''House of Earth.''
While Guthrie's novel, as described by Brinkley and Depp, is more anti-capitalist than Buck's were, there appear to be common themes, especially the struggles of ordinary farmers against both the elements and society's elites, and the wisdom of ordinary folk. Just as Guthrie celebrates what today we would call the ''appropriate technology'' of an adobe house in the dry American Southwest, Buck made famous the Chinese farm woman whose thrift and knowledge of the land helped her family persevere against overwhelming odds.
I do not know whether Guthrie's 1940s novel or choice of title were influenced by Buck's best-selling books, but it is clear that both authors spoke to American anxieties and aspirations during and after the Great Depression.

HEADLINE: In London, Taxes Rise. Will Buyers Flee to New York?

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
LONDON may have beaten out New York to host this summer's Olympic Games, but in the global competition for wealthy buyers of million-dollar homes, the Big Apple still has an edge.The two cities have long been ''friendly rivals,'' as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at an event in New York in 2009 with his mop-haired, bicycle-commuting alter ego, Mayor Boris Johnson of London.
And as Mr. Johnson quipped at the time: ''We gave you 'Billy Elliot,' you gave us 'Hairspray.' We gave you mad cow disease, you gave us swine flu. You gave us the subprime disaster, we gave you a plan to spend trillions bailing out the banks.'' Mr. Bloomberg smiled only slightly.
But in 2012, when real estate buyers in each city head to the closing tables, they face considerably different tax burdens. Purchasers of New York property over $3.1 million (about 2 million) pay half as much in transaction taxes as those buying in London, according to a recent study by Knight Frank, an international property consulting firm in London. 
That edge has only widened in recent months. In March, the British government, seeking to crack down on tax avoidance, bolstered the ''stamp duty'' on properties valued over 2 million to 7 percent from 5 percent of the total purchase price. For those daring to use offshore corporations to make such purchases, the tax bill is more severe: 15 percent.
The move by the chancellor of the Exchequer followed a media campaign in Britain urging the government to focus its tax-collection sights on the biggest buyers of central London properties: wealthy foreigners. For years those buyers, who include Russian oligarchs and Middle Eastern sheiks, have legally avoided paying stamp duty by structuring their deals through offshore entities.
The government says it wants to discourage the use of such companies. To further shut the door on the practice it will charge an annual tax of less than 1 percent (the government has yet to define the rate) on properties over 2 million that are already in offshore entities. Foreigners, for the first time, will also be subject to capital gains taxes when they sell their British properties.
The moves have incensed members of the London real estate community, who say the British government is looking to squeeze more revenue from one of the few thriving sectors in Britain's economy. ''First we had banker-bashing, now we've got property-bashing,'' Nick Candy, one of the developers of the posh One Hyde Park, told The London Evening Standard in March.
For the last three years the top end of the London market has ''stuck out like a sore thumb'' compared with the rest of the British housing market, said Liam Bailey, head of residential research at Knight Frank. While prices in central London have shot up by 50 percent since March 2009, overall prices in Britain haven't budged over that period, he said. The Treasury estimates the British government can collect 150 million in extra revenue from the higher taxes through next year, and up to 300 million by 2017.
Other countries in Europe, struggling with recession and mounting deficits, have made similar moves to draw more from the rich. France's new president, Franois Hollande, is planning to tax the incomes of the wealthy at more than 70 percent. The Italian government recently created a new recurring tax of less than 1 percent on overseas real estate assets.
''Whether this latest rise in the U.K. is the end of the tyranny, no one knows,'' Mr. Bailey said.
Will the higher taxes dim the flames of the property market in central London? It may be too early to tell, but total sales over 2 million declined by 3 percent from April to July compared with the same period last year, according to Knight Frank.
Lawyers and accountants say that for the very rich, there is an even more pressing concern: the cost of confidentiality has, in effect, gone up.
Many billionaire buyers are secrecy-obsessed and create complex structures to hide their identities. ''People are suddenly very busy looking at how can they protect their privacy,'' Mr. Bailey said. That's still possible by setting up trusts and using someone else's name on the deed, lawyers say. But there will be additional costs to set them up. Lawyers and accountants in London are scrambling to help clients unwind structures and plan differently for the future. Among those are many Americans who bought London properties through limited liability corporations, said Charles Hutton, a real estate lawyer in London.
Will all this make London less competitive in the battle for wealthy buyers?
A British Treasury spokeswoman noted that Britain has the lowest transaction tax as a proportion of the total cost of purchasing a property of any major country in the European Union. Knight Frank said that London, even with the new higher stamp duty, remains in the lower half of a list of 14 cities in total purchase costs beyond the sales price. From highest to lowest, London, at 7.8 percent, checks in at No. 8, just behind Paris. Monaco, at 15 percent, is the highest. New York, at 3.9 percent, is 12th.
Could the moves drive potential buyers of high-end properties to New York? That may depend on whether the State of New York, which is also revenue-starved, can resist the temptation to follow Britain's lead. Lawmakers clamored for more taxes on foreign purchases in the 1980s and early 1990s when Japanese buyers made attention-grabbing real estate investments in New York (Rockefeller Center) and California (Pebble Beach golf resort).
The federal government enacted a luxury tax in 1990, signed into law by President George H. W. Bush, on sales of yachts, planes, furs, jewelry and luxury cars. It ended up hurting the domestic yachting industry as production shifted to other countries. Congress largely repealed the tax three years later, citing disappointing revenues and the negative impacts on local industries.
Last year Connecticut enacted a 7 percent luxury tax on sales of cars over $50,000; boats over $100,000; and jewelry exceeding $5,000.
Already New York imposes a ''mansion tax'' on purchases of over $1 million. So far the New York legislature hasn't engaged in any serious discussions of bolstering real estate taxes further.
''Given the prominence of real estate in the past decade,'' said Lawrence J. White, an economics professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, ''I am a little surprised we haven't seen more political pressure to tax high-end transactions.''
It seems the xenophobia of the 1980s has given way to greater respect for the golden goose that high-end real estate has become.
''Culturally we are more comfortable with foreign ownership,'' said James M. Carolan, a real estate lawyer in New York, ''and that has buoyed our economy in New York. There is a lot of money looking for a safe harbor, and we look like a safe harbor to the rest of the world.''
The London mayor may have had good reason to boast about his city's winning the bid to host the Summer Olympics. ''Far be it from me to rub in our success in winning the Olympic Games for London,'' Mr. Johnson said on that day in 2009, as Mr. Bloomberg looked on silently.
But now there's another competition under way, beyond the current medal race. And the United States appears to have an edge.

HEADLINE: Myanmar It's Complicated

BYLINE: By JOSHUA HAMMER. 
JOSHUA HAMMER, a freelance foreign correspondent in Berlin, is a frequent contributor to the Travel section.

 BODY:
THE face towel was scented with lemon grass, and the welcome drink was fresh lemonade poured over crushed ice. Sultry breezes filtered through the open-air lobby decorated in colonial style, with wicker chairs, spinning ceiling fans, faux Southeast Asian antiques and pillars of solid teak. Footpaths wound past date palms, jasmine and frangipani; a swimming pool extended toward an artificial lake clotted with hyacinths. Beyond the lake lay one of the wonders of Southeast Asia: an arid plain speckled with 2,000 Buddhist temples.
On a scorching May morning, I had taken a break from touring these structures to drop by the finest hotel in Bagan, the ancient Burmese capital, an hour's flight north of Yangon, Myanmar. Opened in 2005, the Aureum Palace Hotel sprawls across 27 acres and encompasses a sushi bar, spas, fountains, more than 40 guest rooms and 72 villas. The best of these, the $1,090-a-night Island Villa, includes a lap pool, a sun deck with temple views and a personal valet. 
There was only one problem with the Aureum Palace Hotel: its owner. The hotel is the property of U Tay Za, reportedly the richest man in the country -- and a close associate of its former military dictator, Gen. Than Shwe. Owner of Air Bagan and Asia Wings (the country's biggest private airlines), five other luxury hotels and beach resorts in Myanmar, and the Htoo Group, a conglomerate that includes mobile-phone services and timber concessions, Mr. Tay Za has been described by the United States Department of the Treasury as a ''notorious henchman and arms dealer.'' After the 2007 Saffron Revolution, when the junta killed dozens of pro-democracy demonstrators and arrested thousands more, the Bush administration froze his assets and blocked him and his family from traveling to the United States.
In the new Myanmar, though, Mr. Tay Za has apparently changed his ways. Following the lead of Myanmar's reformist government, this former crony of the junta is embracing philanthropy and what his son recently described to Reuters as ''foundation work.'' And even though he remains on the Treasury's blacklist, it seems that Western tourists have begun to feel comfortable staying at his hotels. After struggling to fill its rooms for years, the Aureum Palace had an occupancy rate last winter of 80 percent.
Over the past year, Bagan and other destinations in Myanmar have drawn an increasing number of tourists, following the encouraging actions of President Thein Sein. Since taking office in an election that was stage-managed by the military junta in November 2010, Myanmar's leader has freed hundreds of political prisoners, eased censorship laws and established a cordial working relationship with the Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Meanwhile, President Obama has eased most sanctions; in July, Mr. Thein Sein addressed American business executives gathered in Cambodia, urging them to invest in his country.
For the travel industry, the repercussions have been profound. Companies that once struggled to persuade clients to visit Myanmar have been deluged: Abercrombie & Kent saw a 90 percent increase in the number of Myanmar-bound tourists between the first quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012; Indochina Travel, headquartered in San Francisco, reported that its Myanmar business has grown from 15 percent of bookings to 35 percent over the past 18 months.
''We believe that it will go up to three-quarters of our business,'' said Patrick Morris, a director, who described visiting the country as taking a step back in time. ''Even the most touristy place in Myanmar still feels authentic,'' he said. ''Nobody there knows that they should be selling you a T-shirt.''
With its lush landscapes, Buddhist culture and the mysterious allure of a country that for decades has had limited contact with the outside world, Myanmar has long held a special attraction for adventurous travelers. Tourists began trickling into this former British colony, bordered by China, India, Thailand, Bangladesh and Laos, in the late 1970s when the going was far rougher than it is today. Back then, the government usually issued one-week visas and restricted visitors to a prescribed itinerary. Today tourists typically receive visas that are valid for up to 28 days. Luxury hotels have sprung up, and only a few areas are inaccessible to travelers.
YET the question of whether it is acceptable to visit a country long ruled by a brutal military dictatorship has not gone away. Two years ago the answer was clear; today, it is less so.
Even though Mr. Thein Sein has ostensibly put the country on the path to democracy, Myanmar is hardly free from malign influences. The economy is largely controlled by individuals, like Mr. Tay Za, who amassed their fortunes through alliances with the dictatorship; hundreds of political prisoners remain locked up; and the army is still fighting rebels in northern Kachin State. In June, Buddhists in Arakan State, near the Bangladesh border, and Rohingyas, stateless Muslims who have long been discriminated against by the Burmese government, attacked each other after the rape and murder of a young Buddhist girl.
I've traveled to Myanmar three times in the past 30 years: as a backpacker in 1980, as a journalist in 2010 after the release of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest and last spring, in the wake of political and economic reforms. On my most recent trip, I spent much of my time in Yangon, Bagan and Inle Lake on the edge of restive Shan State. Throughout the trip I was keenly aware of the moral issues involved in traveling in Myanmar, and attempted to avoid patronizing enterprises that are owned by the country's corrupt elite.
But not everybody, I found, had the same pangs of conscience. Pa Pa Win, the desk manager at the Aureum Palace, told me that most clients don't care about Mr. Tay Za's reputation.
''When guests come here they are focusing only for relaxing,'' she said, pointing out that Mr. Tay Za provides employment to local people.
But U Bo Ni, my guide in Bagan, and a supporter of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, advised tourists to think twice before staying there.
''It is true that Tay Za has provided a lot of employment,'' said the former English teacher. ''On the other hand, he collaborated with the military government, so we don't like him. He is a gangster.''
When I arrived in Yangon, I was eager to see how the atmosphere had changed since my last visit. Yangon has grown greatly in recent decades, but in other respects has barely changed: the downtown district beside the Yangon River is still filled with aging tenements, cracked sidewalks where used-book and betel-nut vendors ply their trades and crumbling colonial villas. The prosperous northern corner of the city is dominated by Inya Lake, site of the villa where Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi spent 15 years in house arrest and where she still resides.
I checked into the German-managed Savoy, an intimate faux colonial place. From there it is a 30-minute walk up a steep hill to Shwedagon Pagoda, the city's most venerated landmark. Here Gen. Aung San, the beloved freedom fighter, celebrated Burma's independence from Britain in March 1947, months before his assassination by political rivals. Here, too, his daughter, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, rallied pro-democracy protesters during the blood bath of August 1988 and started her own political career.
Shwedagon is a Buddhist Disneyland, an exuberant confection of golden Buddhas and teakwood shrines laid out across a marble plaza. These are all mere accompaniments to the main attraction: a soaring gold-leaf-covered stupa said to contain several hairs of the Buddha in a sealed chamber.
During my last visit, I had been followed by two inquisitive monks as I walked around the stupa; these men, I later learned, were probably undercover agents employed by the dictatorship to keep an eye on foreigners. This time, I was not followed.
I was intrigued by another site that was off limits during my last visit: the home in which Gen. Aung San had lived between the end of World War II and his assassination two years later. (His widow and three children remained there until 1953.) The Bogyoke Aung San house museum was closed between 1999 and 2007, and then opened only once a year, on July 19, the anniversary of his murder. But the government lifted the restriction in March.
On a drizzly morning, I visited the 1921 structure with its circular verandas and elaborate turrets and got a glimpse of the Burma that existed in the hopeful days after the war. Here was the dining room table where the general's family gathered, upstairs the chamber with three cots where the toddler Aung San Suu Kyi and her two brothers slept. In the library, the general's bookshelves were jammed with volumes ranging from a small-arms training handbook to a history of the Anglo-Afghan wars. A black 1946 Wolseley sedan was parked in the garage.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's position on tourism in Myanmar has softened over the years. In 1995 she appeared to discourage all tourism, telling an interviewer, ''Tourists better stay at home and read some of the many human rights reports.'' Then in 2011 she urged individual tourists -- but not groups -- to come to Myanmar, if they go about their travels ''in the right way, by using facilities that help ordinary people and avoiding facilities that have close links to the government.''
A FEW months ago, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy said that the opposition now welcomes all visitors, as long as they ''promote the welfare of the common people and the conservation of the environment.''
I flew to Bagan on Air Yangon, a company on the United States' list of sanctioned firms in Myanmar. Although I felt some scruples about patronizing the airline, there weren't any satisfying options; the other airlines that fly to Bagan include Air Bagan and Asian Wings (both owned by the Tay Za-sanctioned Htoo Group), Air Mandalay, (partly owned by the Myanmar government) and Air Kanbawza (owned by the Burmese banker U Aung Ko Win, another confidante of the generals). I was reminded that, when dealing with hotels and airlines in Myanmar, it is difficult to find any that do not have some connection to the junta.
Determined not to stay at the Aureum Palace, I checked into the lodge where I'd stayed once before, the Bagan Hotel River View, with lush gardens dominated by the ruins of an ancient pagoda. The place had some ragged edges: the cavernous lobby was dark, the rooms charmless. The place was owned by the Kaung Myanmar Association, a Burmese group with holdings in construction, agriculture, forestry and the hotel business, that, at least, does not appear on the Treasury's list of sanctioned individuals and companies.
I rented a battered bicycle and pedaled through fields studded with temples. The spires of a pyramidal stupa near my hotel would serve as my beacon in case I got lost. In the distance I could see Mr. Tay Za's most controversial creation: a 200-foot-high viewing complex. With three restaurants and a conference center, the tower, which opened in 2005, is reminiscent of a grain silo, and it has been criticized by Unesco for blighting the landscape.
An hour into my tour, a thorn tree branch caught in my spokes and punctured my tire. I'd lost sight of the stupa and had no idea how to get back. I saw a Burmese family encamped beside some ruins and, with their help, reoriented myself. Ninety minutes later I stumbled to a horse cart stand and headed back to my hotel.
The next day I went with Mr. Bo Ni to one of the grandest temples in Bagan: Dhammayazika, a 12th-century bell-shaped pagoda that towers above the plain. Dhammayazika was the favorite of Gen. Than Shwe's chief rival, Gen. Khin Nyunt, who served as chief of military intelligence and prime minister and lavished a fortune renovating the temple with jewels and gold leaf. Gen. Than Shwe deposed him in 2004 and placed him under house arrest and Dhammayazika fell into disrepair. ''Khin Nyunt lost his power, and his pagoda fell apart,'' Mr. Bo Ni told me, as gold flakes fluttered away in the breeze. But now Gen. Than Shwe has stepped down and Gen. Khin Nyunt, freed last January, recently visited Dhammayazika.
''He felt very sorry to see his pagoda in that state,'' I was told by the caretaker, a gaunt man with gums stained black from chewing betel nut, and plans to cover it again in gold.
It's not just rehabilitated generals who are pumping money into Myanmar's attractions. Income from tourism is allowing hotels to undertake renovations and has made significant improvements in the lives of those tapped into the tourist economy.
''It's good that foreigners connect with this country, spread their knowledge, assist the economy and observe what is happening inside Myanmar,'' I had been told earlier in Yangon by U Ba Dhat Aung, a democracy advocate who was recently released from prison and is now a leader of the 88 Generation, an organization of former prisoners.
Mr. Ba Dhat Aung, whom I accompanied to a rally of striking workers at a Chinese-run textile plant outside Yangon, added a few caveats. Some tourist revenue, he pointed out, inevitably ends up in the hands of the government, in the form of taxes and entry fees to tourist zones like Bagan and Inle Lake. Moreover, he said, hard-liners remain a force in Myanmar's government, and many of them seem determined to thwart Mr. Thein Sein's reforms.
''Tourists should proceed cautiously, and think about where they are spending their money,'' Mr. Ba Dhat Aung said.
A Western diplomat who asked to remain unidentified told me that ''most of the owners of hotels, airlines and other parts of the travel industry are cronies'' of the former junta. The sanctioned figures include Mr. Aung Ko Win, the airline owner and associate of Myanmar's former second in command, Gen. Maung Aye; and U Tun Myint Naing, known as Steven Law, the son of a 1970s opium trafficker and the managing director of the Asia World conglomerate, which has a stake in Yangon's Traders Hotel, a favorite of well-heeled travelers.
''If you have a sensitivity about these things you might want to think twice'' about patronizing such places, the diplomat said.
However, U Myint Aung, who spent seven years in the regime's gulag for his role in the 1988 uprising, and who now runs the Former Political Prisoners' Association in Yangon, said he believed that it was time for reconciliation.
''Let the tourists go to Tay Za's Aureum Palace Hotel,'' he told me. ''Three years ago, we would have said, 'Don't go.' But now we say, 'Come, we have no feelings of revenge.' ''
After two days in Bagan, I flew east to Inle Lake and hired a taxi for the hour drive to Nyaungshwe, a ramshackle market town and the jumping-off point for motorized longboats that take visitors to the resorts that line the shore.
Inle's attractions are its floating markets, monasteries, golden-spired Buddhist temples and surrounding hills, populated by exotically attired tribal groups. I bypassed another of Mr. Tay Za's resorts, the Aureum Palace Inle, and spent the night at the Inle Princess Resort, owned by U Ohn Maung, an ethnic Shan and former political prisoner. Tucked on a hyacinth-dappled pond, the hotel consists of 46 chalets, each with teak furnishings and bamboo roofs.
''We are now celebrating the Buddhist Lent period,'' read a note accompanying a pair of earplugs on my nightstand. ''Throughout the night you may hear the voices of monks praying.''
The next morning, in a 30-foot longboat, with a young guide named U Min Min, I crossed the still waters of the lake. Inle was filled with fishing boats, propelled by oarsmen who balanced precariously on one leg, the other entwined around a paddle.
Following a network of canals, the boatman threaded through the narrow sluice gates in bamboo dams. We docked and hiked for a mile to a deserted scene. Here, like a child's version of Bagan, stood more than 200 small pagodas, constructed by the Pa-O people hundreds of years ago. The jungle had all but consumed them. Weeds crawled over ornate lintels. A palm tree sprouted umbrellalike from a pagoda.
''Asia lost in time,'' was the way the photographer and journalist Gary Knight recently described Myanmar to me; the fragile ruins of the pagodas almost literally illustrated his comment.
BACK on the boat, Mr. Min Min and I discussed recent events. Just one week before, the Shan State Army, which has been fighting for autonomy, signed a historic peace deal with the Myanmar government and agreed to help fight drug trafficking across the border into Thailand. It was, Mr. Min Min and I agreed, a sign of progress.
Still, I thought, as I watched the shores slip by, there was reason for caution. From the fawning headlines in local newspapers about various generals, to the handsome villas of the junta cronies near Yangon, to the cautious statements of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, I was continually reminded that the new Myanmar remains a work in progress, and that, as a tourist, the debate over where to spend one's money remains relevant.
As for Mr. Min Min, he was pleased by the influx of visitors and the rise in his income, but was skeptical about recent developments, including the peace treaty.
''I don't think it will last,'' he said, as we made our way across Inle Lake.
CHOOSING CAREFULLY
If you are a conscientious traveler intent on avoiding travel-related companies owned by the Myanmar government or its business associates, a little advance work is required. Before leaving for Myanmar, I contacted a reliable travel agency, SunBird Tours in Yangon (104-106 52nd Street; 95-1 293464, sunbirdtours@gmail.com, tintin@sunbirdtours.com.mm) and asked it to put together an itinerary that would be as free of government influence as possible.
I immediately eliminated hotels like the Strand, a joint venture of the Myanmar government and a Singapore company. In some cases, like that of the Savoy Hotel in Yangon, ownership was not readily apparent. Those required phone calls to the establishment or, in this case, the hotel's marketing agent in Hamburg, Germany. The Savoy is owned by a Burmese woman with ''no connection'' to the government, I was assured. At the United States Department of the Treasury, the Office of Foreign Assets Control publishes a list of sanctioned individuals and companies that provides further clarification.
The German-managed Savoy Hotel (129 Dhammazadi Road, Yangon; 95-10 526289, 526298 and 526305; reservation@savoyhotel-yangon.com) is well situated between Inya Lake (site of the United States Embassy and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's residence) and downtown. It's a charming hotel with 24 rooms and excellent service; the Captain's Bar in the lobby is one of Yangon's favored expatriate watering holes. Prices for a double begin at 91,981 kyat, or $110 at 836 kyat to the dollar.
Just across the Strand Road, right on the river, are my favorite restaurants in Yangon, the Golden Duck and the Junior Duck (95-1 249421, or 09-861-4554), serving excellent Chinese food at reasonable prices. Lunch or dinner for two costs 20,904 to 25,085 kyat.
In Bagan, I stayed at the Bagan Hotel River View (Near Museum, Old Bagan; 95-61 60316, 95-61 060317, 95-61 60032; baganview@kmahotels.com, sales@kmahotels.com). The sprawling complex along the Irrawaddy River has 107 rooms from 58,533 to 91,981 kyat a night.
The best hotel at Inle Lake is the Inle Princess Resort, with 46 chalets on a pond on the eastern bank of the lake (Magyizin Village Inle Lake; 95-81 209055, 95-81 209363, 4 and 5; inleprincess@myanmar.com.mm). A chalet, booked through SunBirds, costs 137,972 kyat a night. There's a fine bar and restaurant serving both Burmese and European food, with alfresco dining on a porch overlooking the lake. Dinner for two, with wine, costs about 66,895 kyat.

HEADLINE: As Harlem Lanes Closes, a Common Neighborhood Refrain

BYLINE: CHRIS PALMER


HIGHLIGHT: Harlem Lanes, which opened in 2006 to great fanfare, was to shut down on Sunday, joining other popular local venues that closed because of economic difficulties. 

 BODY:
As groups of cheering children sought to knock down pins at Harlem Lanes on Friday morning, Joey Hill and Marsha Kindell had a different objective: get rid of mounds of documents.
Inside an office near the back of the bowling alley, at 126th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, Mr. Hill, 45, grabbed folders from a giant plastic tub and tossed them into a garbage bag at his feet.
Ms. Kindell, 31, picked sheets of paper from a pile on a desk, then guided them into a shredding machine. Paper shrapnel was scattered across the floor.
"We've been shredding for the past three days," said Ms. Kindell, adding that most of the papers were old invoices or contained sensitive information, like credit card numbers, that had to be destroyed. She said she had lost count of how many bags of documents had been hauled out of the office.
The task of paper elimination was thrust upon Mr. Hill and Ms. Kindell when Sharon Joseph, the owner of Harlem Lanes, Harlem's only bowling alley, announced that it would close for good on Sunday because of financial difficulties.
The alley's closing is a precipitous fall from the fanfare that accompanied its opening. Former President Bill Clinton attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony in March 2006, because his foundation helped Ms. Joseph develop her business plan for the alley.
Weeks after the opening, the two-story, 25,000-square-foot bowling palace was fully booked with parties for its first three months.
On Friday, Ms. Joseph said that in years past, several high-profile athletes, including Kobe Bryant, Michael Strahan and Jerome Bettis, had visited Harlem Lanes to hold parties or fund-raisers.
"It really was an epicenter of the new Harlem," she said.
The alley has 24 lanes, a sports bar, a kitchen, and a smattering of flat-screen televisions, arcade games and party rooms. It cost about $5 million to open, Ms. Joseph said, adding that she has also spent $1 million on renovations and maintenance.
It was also Harlem's only bowling alley and the neighborhood's first since Lenox Lanes closed in the 1980s.
But when the economy slowed in 2008, Ms. Joseph said, the attractions and the novelty were not enough to sustain the business.
That is a familiar refrain in Harlem. Hue-Man Bookstore, a popular neighborhood fixture, closed last week, its owner citing similar economic difficulties as part of the reason.
And other locally owned businesses, like Society Coffee and Nectar Wine Bar, have shut down within the last year, said Regina Smith, executive director of the Harlem Business Alliance.
"It's been an ongoing issue, and it's just been truly sad," she said.
Continuing to run the business simply cost too much, Ms. Joseph said on Friday, adding that she had reached the point where "enough is enough."
So while bowlers enjoyed the lanes until the end of the weekend, Ms. Joseph was trying to organize the aftermath. Everything was for sale, she said after talking to two local firefighters about selling them some of the couches.
As for anything that she could not get rid of, she said, plans were still being made. The bottom line was that the landlord had decreed that, "I have to have this place empty by Sunday," she said.
The decision to close the bowling alley was not an easy one, Ms. Joseph said. But she described financial issues that piled up, including a reduction in the number of parties and corporate outings at the alley, the loss of money from her investors in February and the increasing difficulty of obtaining credit during the prolonged recession.
As a result, even basic expenses like rent and the electric bill - which increased year after year, she said - were too much for her to continue paying.
At the bowling alley on Friday some of the last patrons of Harlem Lanes lamented the loss of another local establishment.
"It's a bittersweet day," said Desean Grayson, 23, a camp counselor at the Harlem Y.M.C.A., as he handed out slices of pizza to campers.
Mr. Grayson said that the camp had visited the lanes four or five times each summer over the last few years. A visit, which had been scheduled before the closing date was determined, was moved up to Friday so that the campers could bowl once more, he said.
Back in the shredding room, Mr. Hill solemnly packed another trash bag full of folders. He had worked at Harlem Lanes for six years, he said, and was devastated to see it close.
"It's a hurting feeling when you build stuff up and it falls down," he said.

HEADLINE: Dueling Campaigns Ads for a Weekend Off the Trail

BYLINE: GERRY MULLANY


HIGHLIGHT: The presidential campaigns let their advertising do the talking this weekend with the candidates off the trail. 

 BODY:
Both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are off the campaign trail today, but their campaigns are not resting. The two sides released new ads this weekend that struck some fresh themes, with the Romney campaign seizing on the unemployment figures that came out Friday and the Obama campaign making an appeal to female voters.
The ad by the Romney campaign, called "It's Just Not Getting Better," was released Sunday, and notes that "in July, unemployment went up again." That assertion is true, as thejobless rate ticked up to 8.3 percent last monthfrom 8.2 percent in June. But the Labor Department found that 163,000 jobs were created, a figure Democrats touted as evidence of a recovering economy.
The Obama campaign ad highlights Mr. Romney's comment that he would "get rid of" Planned Parenthood. But Mr. Romney's campaign later clarified the remarks, saying he would eliminate its federal subsidies, not get rid of the program, an approach similar to the one he would take with Amtrak.
In a statement, Adrea Saul, speaking for the Romney campaign, criticized the Obama ad as misleading while calling it a distraction from the nation's economic problems:
"One day after the unemployment rate increased and we reached 42 consecutive months with a jobless rate greater than 8 percent, it is not surprising that the Obama campaign would release a false ad in an attempt to distract from the effects of the president's failed policies. Dishonest political attacks will not change the fact that President Obama has not turned around the economy, and his policies have hurt women and families all over the country. We tried it the president's way, and middle-class workers have paid the price. Mitt Romney has a plan for a stronger middle class that will jumpstart the economy and bring back millions of jobs."
President Obama returns to the White House on Sunday from Camp David, where he was celebrating his birthday, while Mitt Romney will be at his country house in Wolfeboro, N.H.

HEADLINE: The Clinton Tax Challenge for Republicans

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Tax increases can reduce the deficit without cutting into economic growth, a fact that Republicans decline to acknowledge even about the Clinton years, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Republicans are adamant that taxes on the ultra-wealthy must not rise to the level they were at during the Clinton administration, as President Obama favors, lest economic devastation result. But they have a problem - the 1990s were the most prosperous era in recent history. This requires Republicans to try to rewrite the economic history of that decade.
In early 1993, Bill Clinton asked Congress to raise the top statutory tax rate to 39.6 percent from 31 percent, along with other tax increases. Republicans and their allies universally predicted that nothing good would come of it. They even said that it would have no impact on the deficit.
Ronald Reagan himself was enlisted to make the case the day after President Clinton unveiled his program. Writing in The New York Times, the former president said, "Taxes have never succeeded in promoting economic growth. More often than not, they have led to economic downturns."
Of course, Reagan himself raised taxes 11 times between 1982 and 1988, increasing taxes by $133 billion a year, or 2.6 percent of the gross domestic product, by his last year in office. Presumably he supported these measures because he thought they would raise growth; otherwise he could have vetoed them.

Speaking before the Heritage Foundation's board on April 16, 1993, former Representative Jack Kemp, Republican of New York, predicted budgetary failure from the Clinton plan. "Will raising taxes reduce the deficit?' he asked. "No, it will weaken our economy and increase the deficit."
Conservative economists were often quite specific about exactly what the negative impact of the president's plan would be. On May 8, The New York Times interviewed several. John Mueller, a Wall Street consultant, said inflation would rise to "at least 5 percent within the next two or three years."
In fact, the inflation rate did not rise at all until 1996 and then went up to 3.3 percent before falling to 1.7 percent in 1997 and 1.6 percent in 1998.
In the same article, the economist John Rutledge also saw higher inflation from the Clinton plan and said it would raise the deficit. "Look for a higher, not lower, deficit if the Clinton package passes Congress," he said.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal budget deficit fell every year of the Clinton administration, from $290 billion in 1992 to $255 billion in 1993, $203 billion in 1994, $164 billion in 1995, $107 billion in 1996, and $22 billion in 1997. In 1998, there was a budget surplus of $69 billion, which rose to $126 billion in 1999 and $236 billion in 2000 before it was dissipated by huge tax cuts during the George W. Bush administration.
Among the most detailed economic analyses of the negative impact of the Clinton plan was one made by the economist Gary Robbins in August 1993. He predicted that G.D.P. would be $244.4 billion lower in 1998 compared with the C.B.O. baseline. He did not provide the baseline figure, so I looked it up. In its January 1993 projection, the budget office put G.D.P. at $7,953 billion in 1998. Subtracting Mr. Robbins's estimate of the economic cost of the Clinton plan yields an estimated G.D.P. of $7,709 billion in 1998.
If one goes to the government Web site where the G.D.P. figures appear and looks up the one for 1998, one finds that it was $8,793 billion. Thus Mr. Robbins was off by more than $1 trillion. G.D.P. was 14 percent higher than he predicted.
Nevertheless, Republicans continue to rely upon Mr. Robbins's estimates of the effects of the economic impact of tax cuts, which always show hugely positive effects from tax cuts. Recently, he was the author of the 9-9-9 tax plan put forward by Herman Cain as he sought the Republican presidential nomination last year.
In my posts on May 22, 2012, and Nov. 22, 2011, I presented other data on the positive economic consequences of President Clinton's high-tax policies compared with the poor economic consequences of President Bush's low-tax policies. Nevertheless, it is conservative dogma that we need more policies like President Bush's and must not, under any circumstances, replicate President Clinton's policies.
However, there are still a few people around old enough to remember the 1990s and 2000s. Even without looking up government statistics, they know that the 1990s were a time when the economy boomed, while the 2000s were a period of economic stagnation.
This has created a problem for Republicans, leading to economic revisionism.
Last year, the Republican anti-tax activist Grover Norquist asserted that the boom of the 1990s resulted from the election of a Republican Congress in 1994, because business people and financial markets somehow knew this would lead to a cut in the capital gains tax. The capital gains tax was in fact cut in 1997. But the boom and the improvement in the budget deficit long predated that event.
In July, Charles Kadlec, a Forbes columnist and author of the book "Dow 100,000" (New York Institute of Finance, 1999), insisted that it is a "myth" that the economy prospered under President Clinton's policies. He offers no actual evidence for this assertion except to say that the economy would have done even better under Reagan-type policies. Like Mr. Norquist, he attributes anything good that happened in the 1990s to the Republican Congress, which did not take office until 1995.
Last week, the investor Edward Conard, author of a recent book glorifying the ultra-wealthy, addressed the Republicans' Clinton problem in a commentary in The Wall Street Journal. He said that the boom of the 1990s was the result of Internet-driven growth and that President Clinton was just lucky that it happened on his watch.
Maybe so, but Mr. Conard left unexplained why the budget went from a large deficit to a large surplus simply because of the Internet or why the big tax cuts on the rich he favors failed to raise growth one iota in the 2000s.
I would not argue that tax increases are per se stimulative. It all depends on circumstances. But it is clear from the experience of the 1990s that they can play a very big role in reducing the budget deficit and are not necessarily a drag on growth. And the obvious experience of the 2000s is that tax cuts increase the deficit and don't necessarily do anything for growth. Those arguing otherwise need to make a much better case than they have so far.

HEADLINE: Low Interest In Prepaid Plans

BYLINE: By BRIAN X. CHEN

 BODY:
Prepaid phone plans, where you pay the full price for a cellphone and then pay lower monthly rates without a contract, seem to offer what most budget-conscious people want. So why haven't they really caught on? 
Contract-free phone plans account for only 23 percent of the wireless customers in the United States phone market, according to the research firm Ovum. The rest are subscribers locked into contracts and paying higher monthly fees.
That's despite the fact that prepaid phone plans are generally a better deal for most people, who can save hundreds of dollars over the course of two years compared to a contract plan.
The iPhone with a two-year contract on AT&T, for example, costs $200 for the handset and then upward of $90 a month for the plan; over two years, including the cost of the phone, customers pay at least $2,360. With a prepaid plan on Virgin Mobile, which is owned by Sprint, the iPhone costs $650 for the handset, and then $30 a month, including unlimited data (the type of data plan that people are happier with, according to J.D. Power). Over two years, that would cost about $1,370.
So why aren't more people going prepaid?
The bait that reels most people into more expensive contracts is the subsidized price of a phone, said Tero Kuittinen, an independent analyst and a vice president of Alekstra, a company that helps customers manage their cellphone bills.
''Right now, consumers don't do the math, and they have a lot of resistance to paying $500 to $600 upfront, and they'd rather pay $100 upfront and then overspend,'' he said. ''That psychology has worked for hundreds of years, and it's still working.''
There are less obvious reasons, too. Another factor is that carriers aren't marketing prepaid plans as heavily because they want more customers on contract plans.
''They deliberately don't market their prepaid plans,'' said Jan Dawson, an Ovum analyst. ''They want you on postpaid plans that deliver higher revenue per user, on contracts that are going to lock you in.''
Sprint, for instance, hasn't begun marketing the iPhone on Virgin Mobile's prepaid plans, even though that offering was introduced in June, (though it says it does plan to eventually).
Mr. Dawson added that smaller carriers that offer prepaid plans, like Leap Wireless or MetroPCS, have tiny marketing budgets compared to the big carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless, so their cheaper phone plans simply aren't as well known.
Finally, until recently, prepaid phone companies haven't offered handsets that are as compelling as the ones you can get with a contract. Only in the last few months did the iPhone and some big Android phones become available through prepaid phone companies.
Prepaid plans don't seem as cool now, but because phones on prepaid plans are generally getting better, and because people are always looking for ways to cut costs in a bad economy, Ovum says it expects American prepaid customers to increase to 29 percent of overall wireless subscribers by the year 2016.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
