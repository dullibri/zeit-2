The Art of Turning a Sow's Ear Into a Silk Purse

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THIS week the Bush administration moved closer to relaxing the rules for air-pollution controls on dirty power plants, and it moved in a California court to promote offshore oil drilling. It took an aggressive step forward for the nuclear power industry, declaring a Nevada mountain scientifically safe for the storage of nuclear waste. And it replaced a research program for auto fuel efficiency that was showing modest success for cars on the road with a more ambitious program that won't affect the car fleet for years, if ever, and in the meantime does nothing to cut gas consumption or promote efficiency.
 These actions followed months of other pro-business regulatory actions that were hardly noticed in the post-Sept. 11 world: allowing more roads and powerline construction on public lands, weakening rules over mining permits, delaying a ban on snowmobiles in national parks, letting developers build on wetlands without replacing them. 
 The question is: Does anyone care? In a time of war and recession, is it politically safe to ignore the environment? The answer appears to be that it is not safe, and that this administration knows it. And for that reason, the president this week also signed an agreement to ensure that water reached the Florida Everglades, an important political matter in an important swing state, and he visited an abandoned industrial plant in suburban Philadelphia, where he announced money to help clean up and develop such sites across the country. 
Pennsylvania is of course another important swing state that he has visited seven times since losing it in 2000.
Last year, when President Bush began making field trips to America's national parks, many in the environmental movement ridiculed what they saw as a cynical attempt by an anti-environmental administration to portray itself as "green" via photo ops.
This was the same administration, after all, that wanted to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling and that, in the person of Vice President Dick Cheney, had dismissed the idea that conservation could help reduce the nation's energy needs, contemptuously dismissing it as a mere "sign of personal virtue."
Nor was it only committed environmentalists who distrusted the Bush administration in these matters. Prior to Sept. 11, polls showed that voters, particularly independents, suburbanites and women, saw the president as beholden to his like-minded friends in the extractive industries of oil, gas, coal, timber and mining.
Mr. Bush and his advisers seemed finally to comprehend the depth of their problem when the public erupted over their pronouncements on arsenic. The administration seemed ready to allow a higher level of the poison in drinking water than the Clinton administration had recommended.
Mr. Bush later called this one of the biggest public relations disasters of his short tenure, and while the administration would continue to take actions that critics considered anti-environmental, it tempered those with moves calculated to placate voters. On Sept. 10, the administration defused the issue by announcing that it would, after all, set the same level of arsenic as that recommended by the Clinton administration.
Even with a war on, the administration seems keenly aware that people still care about the environment. Notably, the administration went ahead last month and ordered General Electric, whose former head, Jack Welch, was a major Bush supporter, to clean up toxic chemicals from the Hudson River. The plan could cost the company half a billion dollars.
So, despite the anti-environmental stirrings by the administration, no one really argues these days that environmentalism is dead. Even much of corporate America recognizes that good environmental practices are good business.
"The reward for good environmental performance is that your earnings go up," said Paul Tebo, a vice president for safety, health and environment for DuPont. Smarter use of raw materials, less waste and cleaner-running equipment that is more energy efficient, he said, "are all benefits to the bottom line, big-time."
Charles M. McLean, president of the Denver Research Group, which advises big corporations on environmental policy, said that since Sept. 11, he has seen no lessening of protests by environmentalists against various projects around the country.
"I'm surprised I haven't seen more deterioration in support for the environment since Sept. 11, but environmentalism has become embedded in the culture," Mr. McLean said. "Of course, if we have five more major attacks and the economy tanks worse than it has now, all bets will be off. But at this point, it's still pretty solid."
Doug Honnold, an environmental lawyer in Bozeman, Mont., agreed. "In the national debate, the environment may not transcend terrorism and war," he said. "But I don't think the fire ever really dims. There was a psychic 'time out' after Sept. 11, but I see us coming out of that now. It's now O.K. to say we can't just rubber stamp what the administration wants. The suburban demographic is particularly concerned about the environment and human health and recognizes that if we pollute the air, my kids are going to get asthma, and it doesn't matter if we are at war."
The peculiar thing is that while the administration is clearly attuned to the political power of the environment, some of its actions continue to suggest a heedless disregard of that knowledge. 
Critics said that the president and vice president seemed wedded to the part of industry that favored fossil fuel extraction partly because of their backgrounds.
"This president and his closest friends come not from 'business' but from a particular element of business," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who is convinced the environment will play an important part in the 2002 Congressional elections. "The oil industry has no incentive to have cleaner drilling or less oil."
OTHERS who think broadly about the environment see the Bush administration as an anachronism when it comes to its relative lack of concern for the environment. Dr. Allen Hammond, a senior scientist at the World Resources Institute, said that the environmental movement was now too big to be thrown permanently off track.
"There's much more of an international consensus than you might believe if you only listen to this administration," Dr. Hammond said. "I'm not surprised that when C.E.O.'s talk to Bush and he wants to give them a break they take it. Times are tough. But they know they need to operate in environmentally sustainable ways because it's good business. Some C.E.O.'s have a better political sense than the White House. They're not about to get labeled as environmentally bad companies because it will hurt them in the stock market, in recruiting talent and with their customers."

HEADLINE: With U.S. Blessing, Russia Gives Fragile Ukraine a Hand 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: KHARKIV, Ukraine 

 BODY:
In the last decade, the United States pumped more than $2 billion into Ukraine, the huge and puzzled nation hinged to Russia's western edge. This was not just to be nice: Ukraine had nuclear weapons, the still real threat of Chernobyl and 50 million people who could steer their fragile new nation toward Europe or drift back into Russia's embrace.
 Now the nuclear arms are gone. The Chernobyl nuclear plant is shut. But Ukraine's relations with Russia seem warmer than ever: at a recent summit meeting in this big industrial city about 25 miles from the Russian border, the flags of both nations waved together on frozen streets as the two presidents -- Leonid D. Kuchma of Ukraine and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia -- once again pledged friendship and tighter business ties. 
 Not so long ago this warming might have caused alarm in Washington, a sign that its influence in Eastern Europe was slipping. But a changing calculus between West and East, marked by far better relations between Russia and America themselves, seems to be depriving Ukraine of some of its geo-appeal. 
American officials sound unconcerned, casting Ukraine and Russia as partners in reform leading toward European standards of business and governance. "We see no contradictions between Ukraine's 'European choice' and stable, normal relations with Russia," said Carlos Pascual, the American ambassador to Ukraine. "Ukraine can -- and should -- pursue both. A stable, confident and reforming Ukraine would be the kind of neighbor that could encourage a reform-minded Russia on its own transition path. The obverse is likewise true." 
Jack F. Matlock Jr., a former ambassador to Moscow and a keen observer of the former Soviet bloc, said that when the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991 Ukraine was seen by many in the State Department as a crucial ally for the Western camp. That sense of urgency, he said, has faded, even as the commonality between Ukraine and Russia -- large Slavic nations with extremely strong economic and business ties -- has become clearer. "As Russia builds stronger institutions, and they are doing that, I think they can be of enormous help to Ukraine, and they can probably do it better than we can," Mr. Matlock said. 
As the Americans seem less purposeful, Ukrainians -- particularly intellectuals and reform-minded politicians -- worry. They fear that their nation is moving backward, or eastward, even as other former Soviet satellites -- and indeed Russia itself -- move more solidly toward the European Union and NATO. 
"Before, Ukraine was like a buffer zone between Russia and the West," said Volodymyr Polokhalo, a writer and a political scientist. "Today, Ukraine is transforming itself into a transit country into Russia. Putin is following a very wise policy that uses the weaknesses in Ukraine to his own strength."
The newspaper Holos Ukrayiny, or The Voice of Ukraine, recently worried, "Having noticed Russia's will to achieve civilized living standards, the West is getting increasingly keen on Russia dragging Ukraine along." 
In the last year, economic growth in Ukraine has skyrocketed -- to some degree on the strength of increasing investments from Russia, which supplies Ukraine with 70 percent of its energy and is Ukraine's largest export market. 
But the general state of the economy is still in shambles, controlled by an elite of powerful businessmen. Many of the dealings with Russia -- whose envoy here is Viktor D. Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister and the former Gazprom chairman -- are murky. The rule of law is wanting.
Politically, Ukraine has suffered. President Kuchma allowed the dismissal of a reformist prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, as his own popularity dipped to single digits over allegations that he was involved in the slaying of a journalist, Georgy Gongadze, in late 2000. 
In October, a general sense of incompetence and loss of control came to a boil when the Ukrainian military accidentally shot down a Russian jetliner over the Black Sea, killing 78 people. Mr. Kuchma denied it, then made matters worse with a string of comments like, "Maybe the missile didn't understand Ukrainian."
Then at year's end, the government announced that it would issue pellet guns to journalists so they could protect themselves if the police could not. In the last 10 years, about a dozen journalists have been killed or have disappeared. 
Ukraine's reputation hit such a low that a group was formed several months ago devoted to sprucing up its image abroad. Oddly, Ukraine Cognita, founded by businessmen with the blessing of Mr. Kuchma himself, seems aimed as much at warning the nation's leaders that they are doing Ukraine serious harm as at alerting foreigners to the country's good qualities.
"The image of the country is of a totalitarian regime, no freedom of the press, no human rights, high corruption," said the group's executive director, Irina Gagarina, not bothering to dispute a single allegation. "It's a pity for a generation of Ukrainians, which is actually ready to make the country better for the future." 
Many eyes are now turned toward the parliamentary elections set for this March; concerns exist as to whether they will be fair or a repeat of Mr. Kuchma's re-election campaign in 1999, widely considered tainted with fraud.
In this national slump, as Western leaders heaped criticism on Mr. Kuchma, particularly over the journalist's death, Mr. Putin remained silent. He went on meeting publicly with a grateful Mr. Kuchma -- who like the Russian leader was successful in the Soviet system -- and made comments about how Ukraine and Russia "should develop their relations with the rest of the world in tandem."
For their part, American officials say they are certainly not abandoning Ukraine. Direct American investment is still higher than that from Russia. Aid remains among the highest to any nation in the world, with the aim of ultimately seeing Ukraine in Europe.
In a speech in Poland last summer that still represents his most detailed public look at Eastern Europe after the cold war, President Bush singled out Ukraine in his sweeping call to erase the dividing line between East and West. 
But his call came wrapped in a question mark, which reflects the frustration of Ukraine's resistance to change. "Some in Kiev speak of their country's European destiny," he said. "If that is their aspiration, we should reward it." 
Although there is a long, lingering sense of unfairness in Ukraine over what most people here perceive as poor treatment by Moscow during the 70 years of the Soviet Union, Russia and Ukraine seem ready to develop their friendship. 
At the summit meeting here, Mr. Putin said Russia and Ukraine should coordinate their efforts to join the World Trade Organization. They also discussed having Ukraine use Russian technology and financing to finish two nuclear reactors to replace Chernobyl, a deal in which Ukraine might walk away from a long-planned financing arrangement with Western nations. 
One thing is certain: most Ukrainians do not share the ambitions of Aleksandr Lukashenko, the Stalinist president of Ukraine's northern neighbor, Belarus, to be formally reattached to Russia.
This sense of nation -- at times shaky between staunch Ukrainian nationalists in the west and those oriented more toward Russia in the east -- seems embodied in a new square under construction in central Kiev celebrating independence from Russia in 1991. Some complain that the design -- especially a heraldic, gilded, statue of a mother Ukraine -- is a bit too Soviet. But ask almost anyone on the square, and the words come out much like those of Roman Gadysh, 24. It is, he said, a symbol "of beauty and independence."

HEADLINE: Bush Seeks Aid for World Bank, Conditionally 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
President Bush will ask Congress to base future increases in aid to poor countries on evidence that the aid is actually bringing progress in such areas as education, trade and the environment, administration officials said.
 The president's budget will recommend that $850 million for aid to the world's poorest nations be contributed to the World Bank in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The current year's appropriation is $797.4 million. 
 It would promise further increases, to $950 million and $1.05 billion, in the next two years, but only if the bank developed indexes that showed that its aid was productive. Otherwise those contributions would remain level at $850 million.
The issue has been a particular concern of Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, who said during a bank meeting in Ottawa last November that the bank should be more "rigorous in measuring the results" of its aid. "Over the last 50 years the world has spent an awful large amount of money in the name of development without a great degree of success," he said. 
Treasury officials acknowledge that developing benchmarks to show what kind of aid works best is not a simple process. They also compliment the bank for its work in identifying nations where aid seems to be producing results and directing its loans increasingly toward them.
But they are already pushing the bank to do more. John B. Taylor, under secretary for international affairs, said today that in discussions with the 28 other donor nations about the anticipated contributions to the International Development Association, which provides some loans on easy terms for the bank, the United States had broached the subject of education performance standards as a condition of increases beyond $850 million.
"We would look at the number of additional students in school, look at the quality, if possible, of that educational project, possibly based on some testing," Mr. Taylor said. How successful the nation was at enrolling girls in school could be another measure, he added, and over the long term, literacy rates could be an additional index of success.
As for other categories not yet raised in the discussions, he said, "You want to get things you can measure." He said public health fit in that category, where the number of vaccinations or the incidence of particular diseases could be calculated.
A senior State Department official said the idea of performance benchmarks was "a major element in the development debate -- the question of, shouldn't there be somewhat more development assistance available?"
"The answer," he said, "is yes, provided one can be assured that it will be effective in projecting sustained growth and development."
On the environment, the official added, one could measure the levels of persistent organic pollutants and whether loans made to reduce them were having an effect. Air quality, too, could be measured, he said.
But in many of these areas, he said, year-to-year measurements were unrealistic because long-term loans are involved. "There does have to be an appropriate time line," he said. "A number of these goals are goals for 2015."
Mr. Taylor said the idea of benchmarks was being well received by other nations. He said "people do recognize that measuring performance is really useful."
One incentive for other nations' support is the potential increase in the United States' contributions. Although the United States is the biggest contributor to the World Bank, which provides about 10 percent of all foreign aid, it gives a much smaller percentage of its resources than do many countries.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Arts-and-Crafts Stores Defy Retailing's Slump

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH KELLEHER 

 BODY:
WHILE much of the rest of the retailing industry faltered, art-and-crafts retailers enjoyed double-digit sales gains last fall, and their shares moved up as well.
 Crafts are not recession-proof, but stores have been busy for the three retailers most widely recommended by analysts -- Michaels Stores, based in Irving, Tex.; A. C. Moore Arts and Crafts of Blackwood, N.J.; and Jo-Ann Stores of Hudson, Ohio. 
 The stores, which sell beads, supplies for scrapbooks, artificial flowers, picture frames and many other products favored by hobbyists, resemble Bed, Bath and Beyond stores in size and layout: they have racetrack floor plans that lead customers along an aisle that circles the store, with merchandise in central and perimeter areas. The average shopper spends $18 each visit, said Laura Richardson, an analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill, an investment firm in Boston. 
Sales appear to have been bolstered by the stay-at-home trend that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. For the third quarter, sales grew 16 percent at Michaels, 25 percent at A. C. Moore and 14 percent at Jo-Ann, compared with the period a year earlier. At A. C. Moore, the only chain to report on the fourth quarter, sales increased 31.5 percent compared with the previous year.
Michaels Stores, with 840 stores in 48 states, including its Aaron Brothers art supply subsidiary, is a favorite among analysts. Its shareholders have been rewarded with 30 percent growth in annual earnings per share, on average, since 1997, and share prices, while fluctuating, have increased more than 400 percent. 
"In the last four years, we've performed with the best of retail," the chief executive, R. Michael Rouleau, said. "Yet our stock is undervalued; we should be valued like a Lowe's or Home Depot." Ms. Richardson agreed, citing price-to-earnings ratios of 35 for Lowe's, 40 for Home Depot and a mere 22 for Michaels.
Mark Mandel, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey in New York, said that Michaels plans to open 75 stores a year for the next four to five years, and that it is moving upscale in ambience and upgrading its inventory management system. "It's a long turnaround story," he said, starting in 1996, when Mr. Rouleau joined the company.
But Michaels has had significant problems. In 1998, it was named one of America's worst-governed companies by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, the huge pension fund. It said the board was dominated by the family of the chairman, Sam Wyly, a Texas billionaire -- four of five directors were relatives. The family's control of a compensation committee led to "golden parachutes for directors and repricing of stock options to protect them from loss during Michaels' less-stellar years," Calpers said three years ago.
In July, changes were made to bolster the accountability of the Michaels board. That occurred during an unsuccessful proxy fight by Mr. Wyly for control of Computer Associates International of Islandia, N.Y., in which he said that company's management had not been accountable to shareholders. "He was a man in a glass house who shouldn't throw stones," said William R. Armstrong, an analyst at C. L. King & Associates, a brokerage firm in Albany.
Sam Wyly stepped down as chairman, switching places with his brother, Charles J. Wyly Jr. Today, they are the only family members on the board. Calpers sees significant improvements at Michaels. "Has Sam Wyly reformed? My opinion is yes," said Ted White, the director for corporate governance at Calpers. 
Mr. Wyly would not comment directly, but Eric Andrus, a company spokesman, said: "Michaels is now a model of good corporate governance practices, shareholder accountability and outstanding management team performance."
The stock, which climbed 170 percent last year, closed on Friday at $30.14. Mr. Armstrong has a $38 price target on the stock for the next 12 months, and Mr. Mandel said he expects 23 percent growth in earnings per share each year over the next five years.
A. C. Moore, one-tenth the size of Michaels, has also been hot. "Moore has high sales productivity and is beating expectations," Mr. Mandel said. The chain, with stores from South Carolina to Massachusetts, is expanding in its region.
Bernard Sosnick, an analyst at Fahnestock & Company in New York, called A. C. Moore a strong growth stock. Though its current stock price of $31.90 is far above its 52-week low of $7.94, he still sees it as a good buy.
JO-ANN STORES appeals to fewer analysts because the company is going through "too many changes," Mr. Mandel said. The chain, found in every state but Hawaii, has 1,000 stores, but its sales per square foot are far below those of Michaels or A. C. Moore, and it carries heavy debt.
"We are focusing on debt right now," said Brian P. Carney, Jo-Ann's chief financial officer, who plans to erase $100 million of its $325 million in debt over two years. The company has trimmed its merchandise lines and plans to close the weakest 10 percent of its stores. 
The stock now trades at $9.64. David Rodgers, an analyst at McDonald Investments in Cleveland, has a price goal of $12 on the stock for the next 12 months.

HEADLINE: Will Bush Bring the Party With Him? 

BYLINE:  By Andrew Kohut; Andrew Kohut is director of the Pew Research Center for People and the Press.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
George W. Bush has set the modern presidential record for stratospheric approval ratings -- only Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman had longer runs of nearly universal public support. The politics of the coming year will be determined by the durability and the breadth of these ratings as the midterm elections approach. Those hoping -- or worrying -- that Mr. Bush's high approval scores will falter by November should know it is not likely, if history is any guide.
 Even if Mr. Bush's ratings were to start sliding today, odds are they would still be very respectable by Election Day. Boosts in public support for wartime presidents don't dissipate that quickly. The percentage of Americans approving President Harry Truman's performance ultimately fell to the mid-30's in the fall of 1946, and his party lost control of Congress that year. However, it took almost a year for his ratings to slide below 50 percent. Similarly, it took more than 10 months for President George H. W. Bush to fall from the high public esteem he had achieved by the end of the Persian Gulf war. It is a pretty good bet that he would have been returned to office had the election been held in November 1991, when he still had a 55 percent approval rating even though Americans thought the economy was in pretty poor shape. 
 There is no reason to believe the current President Bush's approval scores will begin to slide. The war effort in Afghanistan is judged a success by most Americans, and the failure to capture Osama bin Laden is not likely to be held against Mr. Bush. If anything, Mr. bin Laden's elusiveness will serve to perpetuate public concerns about another terrorist attack, which in turn will sustain feelings of national unity and support for the president. The use of force in Somalia or Sudan would probably produce the same result.
The question is not so much whether Mr. Bush's ratings will falter this year but the larger political significance of those ratings. Will he be able to convince the public to take his positions on divisive issues? And will his party benefit from his broad popularity? There has been only a modest bump in support for the Republicans in recent polls about preferences for next year's Congressional elections. Gallup found a 5-point Republican margin in a survey last month questioning voters on their intentions for 2002; Bloomberg reported a 4-point Democratic advantage in a Princeton Survey Research poll; and a Pew Center survey found a dead heat.
A December poll for NBC and The Wall Street Journal found no advantage to either political party in this year's likely campaign pitches -- for the Republicans, a message based on Mr. Bush's conduct of the war, his education policies and the stimulus plan; for the Democrats, a pitch featuring the Democratic approach to stimulating the economy and improving health care and education. To this point, Mr. Bush's broad approval ratings have not led to a significantly changed view of the two parties.
In contrast, the president's former Democratic rivals, Al Gore and Bill Clinton, have lost a lot of ground relative to him. The Bloomberg poll last month retesting the 2000 election had Mr. Gore losing to Mr. Bush by 31 percentage points and Gallup found significantly more Americans blaming Mr. Clinton than Mr. Bush for the recession. Little wonder that the Democratic Party has anointed Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle as its new face.
Still, the president may not be able to use his personal popularity to bring people to his side on the issues. Back in October the public steadfastly stood with the Democrats on federalizing airport screening jobs, contrary to Mr. Bush's position on this very high-profile issue.
Tax cuts to business get tepid support from the public as a way of stimulating the economy -- only 48 percent approval in a Los Angeles Times poll in November. By a 2-to-1 margin respondents in an NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll in October favored rolling back the tax cut over going further into deficit spending to pay for homeland defense.
Worries about entitlements and health care have been suspended, not resolved. The public continues to give very high priority to health care and believes it to be overlooked these days in Washington. The Republican Party is highly vulnerable to charges that its tax cut has put severe limits on spending in this and other human services areas.
Four years ago, we had an extraordinary political occurrence: the party of a president about to be impeached picked up seats in a midterm election. In 2002 we could see the party of a president with an approval rating probably between 65 and 75 percent not only failing to gain seats, but perhaps even losing some. It should be recalled that the Democrats got their boost in 1998 when the Republicans overplayed their hand on the Monica Lewinsky scandal close to Election Day. If economic troubles continue and the Republicans invite the perception that they are using Mr. Bush's success in the war as a cover for domestic vulnerabilities, American voters may not respond favorably.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Vicious Cycles; 
Which Will Recover First: The Economy or the Politicians?

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
TEN months into the first recession of the 21st century, the economic cycle appears to be moving in the right direction. The bear market on Wall Street is over. Industrial activity is showing signs of bottoming out. The pace of job losses is slowing -- even with Ford's announcement last week of huge layoffs. And though Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, says the economy is not yet out of the woods, most other forecasters are predicting a recovery by no later than mid-year.
 As a political matter, though, the troubled economy is just moving front and center. 
 After a period in which the two parties focused more on the campaign against terrorism than on their campaigns against each other, they have re-engaged full force over their very different approaches to economic policy. Each believes that the outcome of this year's midterm Congressional elections may hinge on the economic downturn and the questions of who is to blame and what should be done.
It is not yet clear who has the advantage. Should the recession end quickly -- if this one is of average length, it will be over in another month -- the issue could be neutralized, leaving the political landscape dominated by President Bush's stratospheric approval ratings.
But some analysts say the economy will do no better than to limp along for much of the rest of the year, an outcome that could help Democrats in their effort to label this the Bush recession.
Making the outlook even more difficult to read, the aftereffects of recessions often ripple through society, and hence through politics, long after they come to a technical end.
The last recession ended in March 1991, just as the current president's father was wrapping up the war against Iraq, and more than a year and a half before the first President Bush would face the voters again. Yet even though the economy was growing again, unemployment continued to rise for 15 more months, right into the heart of the 1992 presidential campaign. By June 1992, as Bill Clinton pointed out every chance he got, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent, a full percentage point above where it stood when the recession ended.
Already, some analysts are projecting that this recovery, too, could be jobless, with layoffs continuing into the fall. That possibility helps explain why the administration continues to push for a stimulus package, including additional tax cuts, even as the recession shows signs of drawing to a close. 
"So long as any willing and able worker can't find work, we need to do something about it," Mr. Bush said last weekend, reflecting the White House's sensitivity to the political lesson of 1992. "The unemployment rate is 5.8 percent, but if you're unemployed, it's 100 percent for you."
More broadly, a bad patch in the economy can alter the ground on which political battles are fought. In this case, a relatively shallow recession, after a decade of growth, has led to the abrupt disappearance of the projected budget surplus. 
With that pot of gold gone, both parties are scrambling to save pieces of their agendas, which had extended to ambitious and expensive goals like modernizing the military, helping retirees deal with health care costs, paying off the national debt and putting Social Security on sound footing for the baby boom generation.
AS they scale back their aspirations, both parties are trying to determine whether the electorate's view of the economy was changed in any meaningful way by the boom in the 1990's and the subsequent bust. Republicans in particular see signs of the emergence of a broad-based investor class that will look more to Wall Street for evidence of impending recovery, or of fresh trouble, than to the unemployment figures. 
Some analysts see evidence that increased economic sophistication in general has left voters more likely to view a recession as a cyclical phenomenon without political roots.
"It would be perfectly normal for the Democrats to have a big advantage under these circumstances, in the middle of a president's term and with a recession, but they don't seem to," said Charles E. Cook, an analyst of Congressional races. "I wouldn't necessarily say the Republicans have a big advantage, but the fact that the Democrats don't is news. People understand there doesn't have to be a villain behind every recession."
To the degree there has to be a villain, Osama bin Laden fits the bill in a way that makes it even more difficult for Democrats to pin the blame on Mr. Bush and his fellow Republicans. So rather than attacking Mr. Bush as directly responsible for rising unemployment, Democrats are concentrating their attacks on Mr. Bush's role in the dissipation of the budget surplus. 
Their strategy is to cast the disappearance of the surplus -- caused in part by Mr. Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut -- as evidence of fiscal mismanagement, in the hope that voters will view fiscal trouble in turn as a cause of the economy's difficulties.
Democrats are also pressing the argument that Republicans sacrificed the surplus, and the opportunity it presented to address a range of problems, to tax cuts that will go overwhelmingly to the wealthy.
Republicans are firing back that Tom Daschle, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, is in effect calling for tax increases, a step Republicans say would be lethal to the economy as it struggles back to its feet.
There are substantive problems with both arguments. Reducing the surplus and even running a deficit for a few years is the orthodox fiscal policy response to a recession, undermining the claim by Democrats that Republicans are leading the economy off a cliff. (Economists say the Democrats are on firmer ground with their assertion that the disappearance of the surplus over the long run would leave the nation ill-prepared for the costs associated with the rapid aging of the population in coming decades.)
For all that Mr. Bush has made an issue of Mr. Daschle's purported desire to raise taxes -- "Not over my dead body," the president said last weekend -- Mr. Daschle has stopped short of calling for tax increases or even delays in the tax cuts Mr. Bush signed into law last June. Mr. Daschle has even called for modest tax cuts. 
But in stretching their arguments toward the limits of credibility, the two parties are inadvertently reminding voters: this is not about economics, it is about politics. And those are two different things.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE; 
Complex Web of Relationships in Boom and Bust

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
The cast of characters in the Enron drama is lengthy, and their relationships are complex.

THE EXECUTIVES
 Kenneth L. Lay gained national fame as the chairman and chief executive of Enron, a company that reshaped the nation's energy markets -- and notoriety as the company flamed out spectacularly. 
 A man with a doctorate in economics and an evangelical belief in free markets, Mr. Lay turned an old-fashioned gas pipeline operator into the world's biggest energy trader. But when Enron faltered, he could not explain the company's finances to the satisfaction of Wall Street or of Dynegy Inc., a rival that offered to rescue Enron but ultimately walked away from a proposed merger.
Mr. Lay's longtime No. 2, Jeffrey K. Skilling, fostered a culture at Enron described as creative and cutthroat. He led the company into new markets, setting up trading desks for paper, chemicals, water rights and high-speed Internet service. 
Mr. Skilling was chief executive for six months, resigning last August. He said last month that he was stunned by the company's rapid decline. 
Enron replaced its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, in October, seeking to placate investors and regulators who had begun questioning a set of unusual partnerships he arranged to shift debt off the company's books. Two weeks later, the company revised its accounting for the partnerships, wiping away about $600 million in profits it had reported over the previous five years. Mr. Fastow earned $30 million from his investments in the deals.

THE BOARD
Enron recruited prominent people to its board of directors, but given the company's collapse, analysts give them low marks. The directors include Wendy L. Gramm, the former chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the wife of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. 
Ms. Gramm serves on the board's audit committee, which is responsible for the company's accounting and financial reporting. Until 1998, she owned Enron shares; when the Gramms decided that the stock presented conflict of interest issues, she sold her shares for $300,000. Since then, the company has placed her board pay in a "deferred account" that can be tapped later.
Also on the board is Dr. John Mendelsohn, president of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, one of Houston's most prestigious institutions. Enron has donated more than $600,000 to the center in the last five years. Another audit committee member, Lord John Wakeham, was in Margaret Thatcher's inner circle when she was Britain's prime minister.

THE LAWYERS
No corporate crisis would be complete without celebrity lawyers, and the Enron debacle has enlisted some of the biggest. David Boies, who took on Microsoft in the federal antitrust suit, is representing Mr. Fastow. Robert S. Bennett, who represented President Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones scandal, is representing Enron in Washington.

THE POLITICIANS
Mr. Lay -- "Kenny Boy" to his friend George W. Bush -- is a major contributor to both political parties. Mr. Lay and other Enron executives have given more than $550,000 to Mr. Bush in his political career. 
Enron's executives met with Vice President Dick Cheney four times last year to discuss energy matters. When Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton, a unit of the company built Houston's new baseball stadium, Enron Field. Before he became the president's top economic counselor, Lawrence B. Lindsey was a paid adviser to Enron. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political strategist, and I. Lewis Libby, Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, were investors in the company.
The ties reach far beyond the White House. The Republican national chairman, Marc Racicot, the former governor of Montana, was a lobbyist for the company until last week. In Texas, Mr. Bush's successor, Rick Perry, has been criticized for appointing a top Enron executive to the state's Public Utility Commission.

THE ACCOUNTANTS
Joseph F. Berardino, chief executive of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, Enron's longtime auditor, is caught in the Enron net. In December, he told Congress that Enron might have illegally hidden information from its auditors. Last week, Andersen disclosed that its employees had destroyed documents related to its auditing of Enron -- even after the government began investigating Enron's fall.
If the story seems to take on the breadth of a Cecil B. DeMille epic, that may only be appropriate. For there is a cast of thousands: the company's investors, including Enron employees who saw their retirement savings disappear virtually overnight. Their loss -- and their anger -- guarantee that the investigations of Enron are only beginning.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE; 
Audacious Climb to Success Ended in a Dizzying Plunge

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Not long ago, the Enron Corporation's name was part of the lexicon of corporate and political power. The company's contacts and influence in the White House and Congress bred envy among competitors. It was a driving force behind a radical shift in the nation's energy policy, and its fortune seemed guaranteed for years.
 But in a matter of weeks, Enron has been transformed into shorthand for a corporate scandal, one that has engulfed company executives and Wall Street accountants, raised questions for politicians and regulators in Washington, and cost employees and other shareholders tens of billions of dollars as the company tumbled into bankruptcy protection. 
 Yet much about Enron -- how the business operated and how it failed -- has remained largely unknown. How could America's seventh-biggest corporation, run and staffed by so many smart people, evaporate virtually overnight? Who got rich off the deals that eventually crippled the company, leaving thousands suffering? Was this downfall the result of crime or spectacular blunders? 
And finally, who in industry and government knew what, and when?
Competitors and analysts said the ultimate cause of Enron's brutal collapse was a culture of greed and arrogance that bred excessive secrecy. As some of the company's secrets began to be revealed last fall -- stunning Wall Street with tales of mysterious partnerships that had been used to pretty up Enron's books -- the stage was set for disaster. 
Whispers in the energy markets and the company's growing financial weakness set off a swift loss of confidence among traders and bankers. Sources of financing evaporated, a merger deal collapsed and, finally, Enron hobbled into bankruptcy court. As creditors quarrel over its remains, investigators in Congress, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are demanding answers.
Enron executives had hoped to make the company a new model for American industry. And indeed, the tale of the company's rapid rise and astonishing collapse will be studied for years -- but as an object lesson in the dangers of relying on financial juggling for big profits, and the hazards of a business that corporate executives and directors, Wall Street analysts and government regulators barely understood.
"The woods were filled with smart people at Enron, but there were really no wise people, or people who could say 'this is enough,' " said John Olson, a veteran energy industry analyst with the investment firm Sanders Morris Harris. "Given an adrenaline-driven culture, given an obsession with 15 percent a year or better earnings growth, you had this situation develop where Enron was set to metastasize."

Transforming Itself
A Company Thrives, Then Pays the Price
It started in the heady takeover days of the 1980's.
After his pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas, successfully fended off a hostile takeover, Kenneth L. Lay, a onetime naval officer with a doctorate in economics, realized that the key to the company's survival was to make itself too big to devour. 
So in 1985 Mr. Lay orchestrated the sale of his company to one of the largest pipeline companies in the world, Internorth of Nebraska. The merged company, with Mr. Lay in charge, announced plans to change its name to Enteron -- until company executives learned that this was also another word for the digestive tract. Someone struck a few letters out of the new name, and Enron was born.
The company, with headquarters in Houston, faced enormous challenges. Beyond being saddled with huge debts brought on by the merger, Enron was in a rougher, deregulated marketplace.
Enron decided to transform itself. No longer would it simply be in the business of moving and selling gas; instead, it would become part of the commodities-trading world, buying and selling electricity and natural gas as if they were pork belly futures.
To accomplish the transformation, Mr. Lay had as his protege Jeffrey K. Skilling, a consultant with McKinsey & Company. Mr. Skilling brought a new dynamic to the once-staid business. Mr. Skilling was able to understand how the markets could be used to liberate Enron from its reliance on the old world of hard assets. 
Business boomed, and in 1990 Mr. Skilling left McKinsey to run the Enron Finance Corporation, a division that the growing company had created just for him. 
By 1995, Enron had become the biggest participant in the natural gas business, controlling one-fifth of the North American market. In 1997, Mr. Skilling was named president and chief operating officer of Enron.
Things took off from there. Ideas that made millions in one commodity, the Enron executives reasoned, could work equally well with any other. Electricity, wood pulp, steel, advertising time on television, insurance against credit defaults -- all became fodder for the rapidly growing Enron finance and trading empire. Shifting the bulk of its trading to the Internet, Enron was widely recognized as the biggest e-commerce company in the world -- and carried a bubble-era stock price to match. At its peak, Enron had annual revenues of more than $100 billion, and employed more than 20,000 people.
Mr. Skilling, dizzy with the profits that accrued as Enron moved into one new trading market after another, wanted to rid the company of all its hard assets. But other executives pressed forward with plans to give Enron a global reach. It built power plants around the globe. It decided to become a force in the global water business. On the trading side, it splashed its way into the trendy market for high-speed data and Internet capacity.
All told, these efforts represented a collective investment of more than $10 billion, but they were producing next to nothing in returns.
But few of Enron's problems were evident to the company's supporters on Wall Street. Through Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, the company set up a series of limited partnerships, organized in such a way that, by company executives' reckoning, they could be treated as separate entities. It was like a magic financial elixir that provided the answers to many of Enron's growing problems: if there were any assets or debts on the books that the company did not want, they could simply be shed to the partnerships.
But the partnerships were the poison that would finally be the company's undoing. Last fall, as Enron's stock was falling, its auditors, Arthur Andersen, said that some of the partnerships had to be treated as part of Enron; combining them with the company wiped out more than $1 billion in stockholders' equity and contributed to a $618 million third-quarter loss. 
Wall Street, long complacent, by now was demanding answers about the partnerships. The Securities and Exchange Commission opened a formal investigation. Each time Enron seemed to have provided every answer, a new surprise popped out. The markets for the company's stocks and bonds plummeted, triggering even more financial demands on Enron, including the acceleration of payment terms on some debt.
By mid-November, the company had revised its third-quarter earnings downward again, this time adding that, because of the debt terms, it might have to make a $690 million payment in the coming week. The next day, the company disclosed that the financial problems might trigger a requirement to immediately repay $4 billion. A delicate dance to sell itself to an archcompetitor, Dynegy, fell apart amid accusations of deceit.
With the market shaken, other energy traders began to shun Enron, for fear of being caught up in the company's collapse.
On Dec. 2, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection. Its dreams of greatness were over.

A Changed Market
An Energy Middleman Creates Its Own Niche
Enron was not merely the largest player in the nation's deregulated energy markets. It helped create them.
The trading of natural gas and electricity used to be tightly regulated. Utilities built power plants under the guidance of state officials and charged rates that allowed them to recover their costs plus a profit. It was a monopoly system that promoted stability but also inefficiency. On the natural gas side, interstate pipelines, including those owned by Enron, transported gas from producers to utilities and other consumers at set prices along fixed delivery routes. 
But after oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980's, many users of natural gas switched to cheaper fuel oil, and Enron, led by Mr. Lay, helped convince federal regulators that pipelines would falter unless they were freed to shop for customers and for the best deals from producers. Once the market began to open up, gas prices began to fluctuate wildly. Enron stepped in with new products that allowed customers to lock up long-term gas supplies at stable prices -- with Enron taking a cut.
By the 1990's, the federal government was similarly speeding the deregulation of wholesale electricity markets, an effort strongly backed by Enron and other energy companies. New, independent power producers were free to build plants and sell power, and an ever-growing amount of electricity was traded among utilities, unregulated power generators and power marketing companies. 
Enron moved aggressively, seeking to gain the biggest shares of trading in these new and fast-growing markets -- lining up supply contracts to buy power and gas while at the same time cutting deals to sell the energy to customers, often over the long term.
Analysts estimate that at its peak Enron accounted for about one-quarter of the nation's energy trading -- not producing much energy itself, but serving mostly as a middleman.
More significantly, Enron dominated the trading of financial contracts, or derivatives, based on the value of gas and electricity traded at physical "hubs" around the nation. At some hubs, rival energy traders say, Enron accounted for a much higher percentage of trading of some products, giving it enormous influence in the marketplace. 
What remains a point of contention is how Enron used its power. The company always maintained that it took only small profits on individual trades, and instead made money by packaging and arranging complex deals for customers. 
But in the wake of its collapse, to many investors Enron appeared more like a giant energy hedge fund, making bets on energy prices. Last year California officials went further, accusing Enron, and other power traders, of profiting by manipulating prices there and driving up electricity costs by billions of dollars in late 2000 and early 2001. (California's deeply flawed deregulation scheme played a large role in the price spikes, as the state had not built a major power plant in a decade.) 
Enron denied any wrongdoing in California. But in securities filings last year, the company acknowledged that its enormous gains in energy-trading profits were partly due to overall higher natural gas prices -- which had soared along with the price of electricity, as gas is an important fuel used for generating power -- and price volatility. 
The company's critics observe that while energy prices were rising, Enron was riding high, but that it began to falter this summer -- when prices for electricity and gas collapsed. It may not be a coincidence, they say, that Enron's house of cards tumbled at the same time energy costs sharply retreated, and those profits were no longer able to mask severe problems at the company.

Alarms Unraised
Limited Oversight And a 'Black Hole'
Flying high after being unshackled from regulation, Enron crashed quickly last fall after a series of revelations about its bookkeeping practices -- in particular, concealing huge chunks of debt by transferring them into still-murky partnerships. 
By reducing the debt on its books, the company looked healthier and its profits looked more robust, even as the results of its trading operations and energy sales were flagging. Stock analysts and shareholders could breathe easier, as could credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, which assess a company's health for lenders.
But within weeks, the company found itself in bankruptcy, under investigation and the target of lawsuits from burned investors and former trading partners.
Many questions remain unanswered, but one thing is certain: As a result of Enron's successful lobbying, Washington was largely out of the business of regulating those products the company sold.
If the regulators in Washington were asleep, it was because the company had made their beds and turned off the lights. The company's financial successes were in no small part the byproduct of its political and regulatory campaigns to deregulate the marketplace. It created what one executive last year referred to as a "regulatory black hole." 
But there were still traditional corporate mechanisms and institutions in place that should have raised alarms and kept executives in check.
"The fact that things declined so fast strongly suggests a breakdown of basic corporate governance," said David Ruder, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who teaches at Northwestern University School of Law. 
Auditors who had multiple and potentially conflicting roles did not raise alarms about improper financial statements. Directors did not closely question management and the accountants and thus failed to ferret out the accounting irregularities. Lawyers set up partnerships that concealed the true financial plight of the company. Ratings agencies yielded to the entreaties of management and only reluctantly downgraded credit ratings. And some Wall Street analysts like David Fleischer of Goldman Sachs continually recommended the stock, even as it plummeted.
Experts said the newness of Enron's trading products and techniques might have ultimately confounded executives and auditors who were supposed to supervise the enterprise. 
"This appears to be a board that, like other companies that have gotten into trouble, was composed of people interested in solidifying relationships rather than meaningful review and oversight," said James D. Cox, an authority on corporate law and accounting at Duke University School of Law. 
For all the blame now being assigned, Professor Cox and other experts say the biggest failure -- at least based on what has become public so far -- appears to rest with the company's auditors, Arthur Andersen.
"It appeared that the accounting firm was reviewing a financial product which they didn't understand," Professor Cox said.
While Andersen executives have said that they were misled by their client, Mr. Cox and other experts said that auditors had to be aggressive in questioning management.
"The job of the auditors is to ask tough questions and not to just blithely rely on what they hear from the executives," said Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington University School of Law.
With the disclosure last week that Andersen employees had destroyed large numbers of documents related to the firm's audits of Enron, investigators will be aiming many of their toughest questions at the accountants.

A Bush Connection
Financial Bonds And New Questions
Beginning in the early 1990's, Enron pursued its campaigns for energy deregulation by hiring dozens of Washington's most influential lobbyists and showering Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill with large campaign contributions.
But Enron and its chairman, Mr. Lay, forged their deepest financial bonds with two presidents: George H. W. Bush and, more recently, his son George W. Bush. 
Mr. Lay was one of the leading contributors and fund-raisers for the elder Mr. Bush. In 1992, he served as chairman of the Republican National Convention, which was held in Houston, and he sat with Mr. Bush in the presidential box that week.
When Mr. Bush's son ran for president, Mr. Lay was one of his 214 so-called Pioneers, who each raised at least $100,000 for the campaign. Mr. Lay was also a transition adviser to Mr. Bush after the disputed election in 2000.
By the time Mr. Bush was inaugurated in January 2001, Enron and a number of its executives, including Mr. Lay, had contributed more money to Mr. Bush over his political career than anyone else, an amount exceeding $550,000. Enron then wrote a check for $100,000 for Mr. Bush's inaugural committee, and Mr. Lay added another $100,000. 
Last winter, the perennial questions about access given to large campaign contributors were asked about Enron. Mr. Lay had weighed in on nominees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, supplying Mr. Bush's chief personnel adviser with a list of preferred candidates.
And Curtis L. Hebert Jr., chairman of the commission until last August, said he had an unsettling conversation with Mr. Lay last winter in which Mr. Lay offered him a deal: If he changed his views on electricity deregulation, Enron would continue to support him in his job. "I was offended," Mr. Hebert said.
Mr. Lay said at the time that he had no sway over Mr. Hebert's job prospects, and that "the final decision on this was going to be the president's, certainly not ours."
After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, there was almost no discussion in Washington about Enron's connections to the White House. Even in the weeks before the company filed for bankruptcy in December, Democrats stood by the president in the war on terrorism and said little about the company's ties to the Bush administration. 
But four Congressional inquiries were begun after it was revealed that many employees lost their life savings when Enron's stock collapsed, but executives were able to cash out millions of dollars in stock.
The Enron issue finally hit the White House last week after the administration acknowledged that Enron executives had six meetings last year with administration officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney.
The Justice Department announced that it was opening a criminal investigation of the energy company's collapse, including whether it had defrauded investors by deliberately concealing information about its finances. Attorney General John Ashcroft and his chief of staff recused themselves from the inquiry because Mr. Lay and Enron had contributed more than $50,000 to Mr. Ashcroft's 2000 senatorial campaign.
More disclosures followed. On Thursday, the White House disclosed that Mr. Lay had called two of Mr. Bush's cabinet officers -- Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans -- before the company filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Evans said Mr. Lay had sought government help with its dire financial condition. And on Friday, the administration said that Peter R. Fisher, an under secretary of the Treasury, was contacted repeatedly last fall by Enron's president, Greg Whalley, for help arranging bank loans. President Bill Clinton's treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin, now a top executive at Citicorp, one of Enron's chief lenders, also called Mr. Fisher.
Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, described the contacts with the two cabinet officers as "a case where a contributor called up and asked for something but did not get it." Mr. Fisher also did not intervene on the company's behalf. Mr. Bush himself has said he never discussed Enron's troubles with the cabinet members or Mr. Lay.
Democrats are eager to question Mr. Lay at Congressional hearings this month and turn up the heat on the White House. Republican strategists are worried that there might be more revelations.
"I'm very worried that we have not gotten to the end of the onion skin here, there's more to peel back," a longtime Republican strategist said. "I'm concerned this will distract the White House from its domestic agenda."

The Human Cost
Losses Abroad, Devastation at Home
Enron's collapse has been felt far from Washington as well. In Japan, the company's woes triggered billions of dollars of withdrawals from money market funds that had invested heavily in Enron stock. In India, a deal to sell a huge power plant that was built as part of the company's expanding overseas empire has fallen apart. Enron's energy customers in the United States have had to scramble to find new suppliers.
But it is the lost jobs and lost retirement savings that have put a human face on the collapse. 
In Houston, more than 4,000 Enron workers were set adrift in a local job market that has also experienced layoffs by two of the city's other largest employers, Continental Airlines and Compaq Computer.
Out of a job or still working, many Enron employees -- and many retirees -- have seen their retirement savings plans, which were overinvested in Enron stock, plummet in value as the stock price has plunged to near nothing.
Charles Prestwood, an Enron retiree from Conroe, Tex., told the Senate Commerce Committee last month that he lost nearly $1.3 million in savings.
"We, the rank and file, got burned," Mr. Prestwood said. "I thought that people had to treat us honestly and deal fairly with us. In my neck of the woods, what happened is not right."
Though the employees' and retirees' situation bears some comparison to that of the investors who chased other kinds of Internet fairy dust -- no one complained about retirement funds being overinvested in Enron stock when it was at $90 a share -- it has prompted calls for legislation to change the rules governing retirement plans. On Thursday, President Bush instructed his economic team to develop a plan to protect retirement accounts from similar corporate failures. 
Steve Berman, a lawyer in Seattle who has filed a class-action suit against Enron representing many employees and other investors, said he knew of at least 14,000 employees who participated in the company's 401(k) stock plan. Many thousands of others will also probably be affected, he said, as public investors in Enron stock.
Mr. Berman said many of his clients worked for, or invested in, old energy companies that were then bought by Enron. "They thought they had a safe, secure, boring investment that they could retire on or pass on to their kids," he said.
He has clients who have lost $400,000 to $3 million in the collapse, he said. "That's significant because it tells you that these are people who were earning a lot of cash, thus probably at the midpoint or near the end of their careers. Now, on the verge of retirement, they're left with nothing."
Lara Leibman, 31, of Houston who lost her job in governmental affairs at Enron after four and a half years, said today she was wavering between sorrow and anger.
"It was a dynamic, exciting place to work, and people there would let you try new things," she said. "People can complain about the corporate culture at Enron, but that doesn't represent the employee culture, the thousands of wonderful people who worked there." 
"There's an overwhelming sadness about the way Enron has destroyed so many lives," Ms. Leibman said. "I know people who worked there 20 years and they've lost everything."
Ms. Leibman said she was particularly troubled by recent disclosures about the destruction of records by the firm's accountants, and retention bonuses of up to $5 million paid to high-ranking executives shortly before the company went bankrupt.
"It's beginning to sound like a John Grisham novel," she said.

PERSON: Cyrus R. Vance 

HEADLINE: Cyrus R. Vance, a Confidant Of Presidents, Is Dead at 84 

BYLINE:  By MARILYN BERGER 

 BODY:
Cyrus R. Vance, who after two decades in public service was appointed secretary of state, and who then took the rare step of resigning from the nation's highest cabinet post on a matter of principle, died yesterday afternoon at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. He was 84.
 The cause was pneumonia and other complications, said Elva Murphy, his longtime secretary. 
 Mr. Vance was secretary of state from 1977 until 1980, when he resigned in protest over President Jimmy Carter's decision to try a military rescue of American hostages in Iran, an action that he considered ill advised and futile. He was soon proved right. 
After more than 20 years in and out of government, during which he served several presidents, Mr. Vance submitted his resignation with what he called "a heavy heart." His doubts that the elaborate rescue would succeed, and his fears that it would sabotage diplomatic efforts to free the 52 American hostages, brought him to what he called "one of the most painful days of my life." 
His opposition to the rescue mission was the immediate cause of his resignation, but he had already come to see that President Carter was increasingly rejecting his advice in favor of that of his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski. 
As it turned out the rescue attempt failed. Of the eight American helicopters sent on the mission, three broke down in the first stage of the operation. It was decided to abandon the mission, but there was more humiliation ahead for the United States. One of the remaining helicopters collided on the ground with a transport plane and both craft burned. Eight servicemen died in the fire and the rest fled. 
The failed mission became an issue in the 1980 political campaign in which Mr. Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan. The hostages were not released until the day of Mr. Reagan's inauguration, 444 days after they were taken captive. 
Mr. Vance said in 1999 that he had watched from the sidelines with "frustration and sadness" as relations between the United States and Iran "plunged into increasing hostility, mistrust, name calling and mutual recrimination." In an address at the Asia Society, Mr. Vance called for the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Iran. 
Mr. Vance -- who had decided to leave office whether the rescue succeeded or failed -- was only the second secretary of state in the history of the United States to resign on a matter of principle, joining what another secretary of state, Dean Acheson, called "the most exclusive club in America." William Jennings Bryan, the only other secretary of state to resign, was a pacifist who resigned in 1915 over policies by Woodrow Wilson that he thought might lead to war.

An Obligation to Serve
That Mr. Vance allowed principle to get in the way of his career came as no surprise to the people who knew him best. To them, Cyrus Vance, the tall, lanky, patrician lawyer with the open face of a prep school boy was Mr. Integrity, Mr. Honesty. He was the epitome of the American establishment, that small group of men who moved seamlessly from the prep schools of New England and the Ivy League colleges of the East to the law firms of Wall Street, with time out for service in government. Then they would return again to private practice, bringing with them the old values of family, work and public service.
After his return to private practice, Mr. Vance was repeatedly called back to the public arena to use his quiet negotiating skills on some of the bloodiest conflicts of the 1980's and 1990's: in the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia; in South Africa; and in a disintegrating Yugoslavia. There, he successfully negotiated a cease-fire in Croatia to allow a United Nations peacekeeping force to enter and disarm warring militias. 
In accepting one assignment after another, Mr. Vance was only doing what he believed was expected of him. He said, "A lot of us were raised in families where we were taught that we were very fortunate, that we were going to have a good education, and that we had the responsibility to return to the community some of the benefits and blessings we had, and that there was an obligation to participate in government service at the local, state and national level." 
This, in a nutshell, was the unself-conscious voice of the establishment -- the one that Jimmy Carter ran against so vigorously that his campaign manager, Hamilton Jordan, once said: "If, after the inauguration, you find a Cy Vance as secretary of state and Zbigniew Brzezinski as head of national security, then I would say we failed. And I'd quit." 
Mr. Vance was Mr. Carter's first appointee, followed soon after by Mr. Brzezinski. Mr. Jordan did not quit. 
In both his personal approach to the job and his overall philosophy, Mr. Vance presented a striking contrast to his flamboyant predecessor, Henry A. Kissinger. A calm, publicity-shy diplomat who was more a mediator than a policy maker, Mr. Vance was one of the most modest and unpretentious men ever to hold the post. He was a popular figure around the State Department as he loped through the hallways in his pinstripes or tweeds, occasionally rumpled but always well tailored. 
When he took office, Mr. Vance vowed to limit his travel abroad and eschew Mr. Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy -- a pledge that quickly fell by the wayside. But while he adopted some of Mr. Kissinger's tactics, he harbored doubts about his strategy. Mr. Vance was deeply skeptical that any master plan could provide answers for individual foreign policy problems. He did not think in terms of a Soviet grand design to encircle and undo the West any more than he thought about a grand design for American foreign policy. His method was "to slog it out," putting together solutions to individual problems.
Prof. Norman A. Graebner, a historian of American diplomacy at the University of Virginia, said, "The general attitude toward the acceptance of the Soviet position in the world and the fact that revolutionary pressures in the third world were genuine and that it was America's task to live with those realities was most pronounced during those first Carter years." 
The president and his secretary of state pursued a moderate course, characterized by the strategic arms negotiations, the Panama Canal Treaties, the normalization of relations with China and the settlement that brought majority rule to Zimbabwe, the former British colony that had been known as Rhodesia. During the historic talks at Camp David in 1979, Mr. Vance developed an effective working relationship with two of the Israeli negotiators, Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman. It became crucial in working out the landmark agreement that established peace between Egypt and Israel. 
Mr. Vance shared with Mr. Carter the conviction that the advancement of human rights around the world was in America's national interest. And from his years in the Pentagon, Mr. Vance knew the limits of the use of military force to solve nonmilitary problems. He was secretary of the Army in 1962 when the Army was called in to open the doors of the University of Mississippi to blacks. The walkie-talkies failed, providing a lesson that he still carried years later when he heard of the plan to rescue the hostages in Tehran. If a problem like that could occur in Mississippi, he wondered how a complicated mission in a country in the throes of revolution half a world away could succeed.

On the Outside, Looking In
But the Carter administration had been rocked by a series of events in 1979: the fall of the shah of Iran, the appearance of a Soviet brigade in Cuba, the fall of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua, the taking of American hostages in Tehran and, finally, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. "All these were attributed to a failure of will and courage on the part of President Carter," Professor Graebner said, and that is when Mr. Carter "went ideological with behavior that became extremely appealing to the right wing. The effort to rescue the hostages was part of that, and at that point, Vance found himself increasingly on the outside looking in." 
To Mr. Brzezinski, Mr. Vance was not hardheaded enough about world realities. In his book "Power and Principle," Mr. Brzezinski wrote that Mr. Vance, "as a member of both the legal profession and the once-dominant WASP elite, operated according to their values and rules, but those values and rules were of declining relevance not only in terms of domestic American politics but particularly in terms of global conditions." 
Paul C. Warnke, an admirer of Mr. Vance's, who served as his chief arms control adviser, said Mr. Vance suffered from the vice of his own virtue. "He thought he could work with Zbig," Mr. Warnke said. "But Zbig not only used guerrilla tactics, he was in closer proximity to the president."
Mr. Vance was always circumspect about his relationship with Mr. Brzezinski, but years later, in an interview for this article, he reluctantly acknowledged that he had probably been mistaken when he agreed to Mr. Brzezinski's appointment. "I had some reservations about him," he said, "but I knew the president wanted him very badly. I now realize my instinctive feeling on that was right."
When Mr. Carter gave the order to rescue the hostages in Iran, it was clear that Mr. Brzezinski had won the contest, and Mr. Vance decided to resign. He recorded some of this story in his 1983 book, "Hard Choices." 
His son, Cyrus Vance Jr., said last night that the family was proud of him when he stepped down, because he had acted on his principles. "I don't think he ever failed to follow those principles in his entire professional life," he said.
Mr. Vance came to the Carter cabinet with impeccable credentials. In 1957, Lyndon B. Johnson, then the majority leader of the Senate, asked Mr. Vance, then 40 years old, to leave his Wall Street law firm to serve as counsel for a Senate armed services subcommittee on preparedness. The Soviet Union had launched the world's first man-made satellite, Sputnik, and the United States was trying to catch up in the race for space. Mr. Johnson was to call on Mr. Vance repeatedly; the younger man helped draft the act establishing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, and served as counsel for Senate investigations of missile and space satellite programs and Defense Department budgeting. 
Mr. Vance knew the Pentagon inside and out when Robert S. McNamara, John F. Kennedy's secretary of defense, asked him to come to work. He rose from general counsel in 1961 to secretary of the Army and finally to deputy secretary of defense in charge of running the Pentagon. He helped Mr. McNamara impose a reorganization of defense management practices intended to make the services work with one another. 
President Johnson sent him to Panama as part of a peacemaking team in 1964, after student riots in the Canal Zone had been put down at a cost of 27 lives. Almost 15 years later, Mr. Vance presided over the successful negotiations and Senate ratification of the Panama Canal Treaties, under which the United States agreed to cede control of the canal to Panama by 2000. 
By 1967, a painful back ailment forced Mr. Vance back into civilian life, but he was repeatedly called back for delicate assignments. Mr. McNamara asked him to go to Detroit when riots broke out there in 1967. Although Mr. Vance was criticized in some quarters for being slow to call in federal troops, he won praise from black leaders for easing the crisis. 
That same year, Mr. Vance was credited with forestalling a war between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus. "Cyrus Settles Cyprus" was the headline carried in The Economist. In 1968 President Johnson sent Mr. Vance to South Korea to reassure President Park Chung Hee of Washington's support after North Korea had breached the armistice agreement and seized the Pueblo, an American intelligence-gathering ship.
Although Mr. Vance was not one of the formulators of the Johnson administration's policies in Vietnam, he had supported the war effort. But in 1968, as a member of the group of so-called Wise Men assembled to review the war effort, he joined others to call for an end to the bombing and a negotiated settlement.
He was sent to Paris in 1968 as deputy to W. Averell Harriman, the chief United States negotiator, who was trying to work out a settlement with the North Vietnamese. Mr. Vance was forced to devote much of his time to such fine points as the shape of the negotiating table. When the furniture was finally arranged, however, South Vietnam, encouraged to expect a Republican victory in the election and a better deal from Richard M. Nixon, refused to negotiate. "In my mind," Mr. Vance recorded in an oral history for the Lyndon B. Johnson Library, "this was one of the great tragedies in history, that the South Vietnamese double-crossed the United States, which I clearly feel they did." 
That kind of language was uncharacteristically strong for him. Outwardly he was so mild that he was once called "a man who leaves no footprints." Because of that reputation, he surprised his State Department colleagues with the force of his advocacy and the clarity of his goals, chiefly to bring the nuclear menace under control and to improve relations with the Soviet Union. 
He fought when he had to, as he did early on as secretary of state when he vigorously supported the appointment of Mr. Warnke to head the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. He knew Mr. Warnke would be opposed by Senator Henry Jackson of Washington and other hard-liners, but he believed the agency needed to be led by a firm advocate of arms control. "He went to the wall for Paul," one former State Department official said. He won.

An Early Interest in Law
Cyrus Roberts Vance was born in Clarksburg, W. Va., on March 27, 1917, the second son of John Carl and Amy Roberts Vance. His father was an insurance broker and landowner who worked in a government agency during World War I. His mother came from a Philadelphia Main Line family and was active in civic affairs.
Cyrus was only 5 years old when his father died. In the ensuing years, the boy developed an exceptionally close relationship with his first cousin, best friend and mentor, John W. Davis, who had been a member of Congress, ambassador to Britain and Democratic candidate for president in 1924. It was through Mr. Davis that Mr. Vance said he developed an early interest in the law. 
As a student at the Kent School in Connecticut, Cyrus served as senior prefect, played football and hockey, and rowed on the 1934 crew that made the Henley Regatta. He went on to Yale, where he found among his classmates R. Sargent Shriver, William Scranton, Stanley Resor and William Bundy. He would serve in government with all of them.
At Yale he was remembered as a hard-working and conscientious economics major. He received a bachelor's degree in 1939 and graduated from Yale Law School with honors in 1942. In later years he was to win more than a dozen honorary degrees, and in 1969 President Johnson bestowed on him the Medal of Freedom, the government's top civilian award.

From the Navy to a Career
Mr. Vance served in the Navy during World War II and saw action on destroyers at Bougainville, Tarawa, the Philippines, Saipan and Guam. He was discharged in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant, senior grade. After a year at the Mead Corporation, he was admitted to the New York bar in 1947 and joined Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, where he was to remain for his entire legal career.
On Feb. 15, 1947, he married Grace Elsie Sloane, a Bryn Mawr graduate and daughter of the board chairman of the W. & J. Sloane furniture company. Mr. Vance is survived by his wife, their five children, Cyrus R. Jr., Elsie, Amy, and twins, Grace Roberts and Camilla; and by two grandchildren, Simon and Clare. His funeral will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 19 at Heavenly Rest Church, on Fifth Avenue and 90th Street in Manhattan. 
Over the years Mr. Vance served on the boards of directors of corporations, among them I.B.M., Pan American Airways, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, U.S. Steel and The New York Times.
He also served as a trustee of the New York Presbyterian Hospital, the Yale Urban Institute and the Yale Corporation, and was chairman of the board of the Rockefeller Foundation. He was vice chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations until 1987, and a member of the United Nations Association and the Trilateral Commission. From 1970 to 1972, he served on a committee to investigate police corruption in New York City, and in 1987 he was named to the New York Commission on Government Integrity, established to investigate corruption at all levels of government in the state. From 1988 to 1990, Mr. Vance was chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
As president of the New York City Bar Association in 1975 and 1976, he made a stubborn but not too successful effort to persuade the lawyers to devote Saturdays to providing the city's needy with free legal advice.
To those, like Mr. Brzezinski, who referred occasionally to the "once-dominant WASP elite," Mr. Vance said: "The establishment is still alive and reasonably healthy. I think you'll find the establishment, with its moral force and integrity, will be playing a larger role in the future."
Mr. Vance never dwelled on his own legacy, but when asked at 70 how he wanted to be remembered, he said, "I hope for being a reasonably decent, honest person who tried to do some things for the country that might have lasting effect and create a better life for a large number of people."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A credit in some copies on Sunday with the obituary of Cyrus R. Vance misspelled the name of a picture agency. It is Corbis-Bettmann, not Corbis-Bettman.
The obituary of former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance on Jan. 14 (and in late editions on Jan. 13) misstated the rarity of resignations from that post over matters of principle. Historians generally agree that there were three, not two. Besides Mr. Vance, who objected in 1980 to the attempt at a military rescue of American hostages in Iran, and William Jennings Bryan (1915), over policies he felt might lead the country to war, Lewis Cass resigned in 1860 because he considered President James Buchanan weak on secessionists.

HEADLINE: The Fiscal State of the States 

BYLINE:  By William T. Pound; William T. Pound is executive director of the National Conference of State Legislatures.

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Legislatures in 39 states will begin their regular sessions this month facing fiscal challenges unseen in at least a decade. Some of the problem is of their own making; during the cash-flush 1990's, America's state legislators passed tax cuts totaling $35 billion. Yet they were also responding to public demand for increased spending and are the victims of a slowing economy. Now, forced to find solutions, they may provide Congress with some ideas for reducing the federal deficit.
 The last decade, especially the last seven years, was one of robust revenue growth for states. Legislators had significant latitude in budget decisions. On top of tax cuts, states boosted funding for schools, improved roads and bridges, extended health coverage to poor children and helped senior citizens with prescription drug expenses. And they put some money away for a rainy day. Now that rainy day has come -- with a vengeance. 
 The effect of the recession on state finances is staggering. According to a December survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures, 43 states report revenues are below forecasts. Spending is already above budgeted levels in 19 states, and another seven expect cost overruns.
Practically no state has escaped unscathed in the current economic climate, and in some cases the budget holes are deep. California has an estimated $12 billion gap, larger than the general-fund budgets of 36 states. While smaller in dollar terms, the budget gaps in other states are no less painful.
Michigan cut spending and canceled capital projects. Ohio's plan to cover a $1.5 billion shortfall included spending cuts, tax increases and withdrawals from the tobacco settlement and rainy-day funds. Colorado canceled nearly $400 million in transportation and capital projects. Florida cut about $1 billion from its $20 billion budget and suspended a scheduled tax cut. Some state parks are closing in Tennessee. Nearly all state programs are vulnerable, even elementary and secondary education, which typically enjoys protection during a recession.
At the same time that state officials are dealing with a steep decline in revenue growth, they face a re-emerging challenge on the spending side of the ledger: Medicaid. The program is squeezing state budgets due to increases in prescription drug prices, demands by providers for higher payments and growth in the population eligible to participate in the programs. On average, Medicaid expenses rose 14 percent last year, more than double targeted estimates. This year's forecast is for 8.8 percent growth, and analysts are hoping they are on target.
Although the current economic decline began even before the events of Sept. 11, the terrorist attacks have exacerbated state budget problems. Tourism, which is crucial to many large states like New York, California and Florida, is down, and all states must also now address higher security costs.
Among state fiscal analysts there is a general consensus that economic conditions will not improve soon. That means state legislators have to close current-year budget gaps while enacting reduced budgets for next year. In legislatures that operate under term limits, many lawmakers are looking at budget reductions for the first time in their careers.
There is good news, though. State legislatures in the latter half of the 1990's wisely boosted reserve accounts, commonly referred to as rainy-day funds, to historic levels. As recently as 1995, those funds amounted to about $7 billion. By the end of 2001, the amount had more than tripled to $23 billion. Consequently, states are much better prepared to meet the current fiscal crisis than they were a decade ago. This is important because -- unlike the federal government -- nearly all states live under balanced-budget requirements.
Perhaps these rainy-day funds would be even more bountiful had states made more modest tax cuts. But tax cuts are often politically irresistible, never more so than when the budget is at a surplus, as was the case in many states in the late 1990's.
State legislators must face the consequences of the evaporating federal budget surplus, too. They have to be vigilant about maintaining federal commitments to Medicaid, welfare reform, highway and mass transit programs and children's health. And they are wary of new federal mandates for educational testing as well as new costs for security-related initiatives. Legislators must also deal with changes to the federal tax code, like last year's to the estate tax, that could deplete state coffers by billions of dollars.
During the last quarter century, most recently in the early 1990's, state legislatures have often had to wrestle with fiscal crises, and for the most part, they have adapted successfully. They are the places where America debates its most difficult public policy questions, and their solutions are often innovative. The challenges of the rainy-day economy are substantial, but they are not insurmountable.

Negotiating the Darkness, Fortified by Poets' Strength

BYLINE:  By MARY KARR 

 BODY:
The events of Sept. 11 nailed home many of my basic convictions, including the notion that lyric poetry dispenses more relief -- if not actual salvation -- during catastrophic times than perhaps any art form.
 After the disaster, we did what perhaps most families did. We prayed in gratitude and fury and desperate petition. We watched hours of news. And we read poetry. I probably faxed more copies of poems -- and received more faxes from other devoted readers -- in the following weeks than I had in years, though as a professor at Syracuse University, I essentially butter my biscuit with the reading of poetry. 
 The diverse crowd of readers I swapped poems with encompassed colleagues, secretaries and administrators; but also The New York Times's conservative columnist William Safire; the poet Sharon Olds; my agent, Amanda Urban; my godson's parents in England; neighbors; the novelists Salman Rushdie and Don DeLillo; and my insurance-selling sister. 
The first poems I turned to were those of fury. The political satires the Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert lobbed against Soviet oppression dispensed a particularly warming fire. In "The Monster of Mr. Cogito" (translated by John and Bogdana Carpenter), he poses as a chivalrous figure fighting not a dragon but an invisible enemy, "The shimmering of nothingness." Mr. Cogito's monster very much resembles the one behind the World Trade Center attack:
it is difficult to describe
escapes definition
it is like an immense depression 
spread out over the country
it can't be pierced 
with a pen 
with an argument 
or a spear.
We only know the monster by "it's suffocating weight/and the death it sends down." The fury I felt at the invisible enemy was embodied in the hilarious, almost Quixote-esque figure of Mr. Cogito walking out at dawn:
carefully equipped
with a long sharp object
he calls to the monster 
on the empty streets
he offends the monster 
provokes the monster . . .
he calls -- 
come out contemptible coward
But just as we still stare helpless into our television screens, hoping for some glimpse of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, so this eager knight peers into fog, seeing only "the huge snout of nothingness."
European poets like Herbert who endured war have resounded the loudest and longest in these months. Asked to read for The New Yorker's benefit shortly after the attacks, I struggled with whether or not to include the Holocaust survivor Paul Celan's agonized poem about the digging in mass graves (translated from German by Michael Hamburger). It was somber and furious with the God whose universe contained the graves' possibility:
There was earth inside them, and
they dug.
They dug and they dug, so their day 
went by for them, their night. And they did not praise God,
who, so they heard, wanted all this, 
who, so they heard, knew all this.
They dug and heard nothing more; 
they did not grow wise, invented no song, 
thought up for themselves no language. 
They dug.
The cadence of the poem drummed out the relentless dirge of a people's grief, but was it perhaps too dark? The digging at ground zero was only blocks away, and perhaps the poem would fall on the audience like another blow.
The editor of The New Yorker, David Remnick, ultimately persuaded me to read it. He reminded me that its conclusion suggests not just digging toward the lost, but also a collective digging into history, how one person in despair and loneliness digs toward the salvation of someone else. The poem concludes with a moment of awakening, the sound of a ring striking metal as one human being reaches another.
On one, o none, o no one, o you: 
Where did the way lead when it led nowhere? 
O you dig, and I dig, and I dig towards you, 
and on our finger the ring awakes.
Poetry is about such instantaneous connection -- one person groping from a dark place to meet with another in an instant that strikes fire.
After the benefit, strangers wrote in gratitude for the Celan poem, though I regretted not being able to include Whitman's long passage from "I Sing the Body Electric," which describes the body in its various attitudes of beauty and in this section winds up with firefighters, whose recent courage we as a country have been so star-struck by.
But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, 
It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, 
It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him. . . . 
The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trousers and waist-straps, 
The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, 
The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curved neck and the counting. . . . 
Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with the wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count.
Memoir has permitted me to relay to readers the yards of intricate information I could never roll into a lyric poem, but prose never works in a reader's mind with poetry's instant infusion of feeling.
Poetry is economical. And for the gravely pained, swift relief is of the essence. A poem's brevity touches most readers when the mental focus required by a lengthy prose work just won't do. The poet Philip Larkin once wrote that the reader puts the penny of attention into the poem's slot and immediately gets a feeling as payoff.
A short poem is also, arguably, the most portable art form. Maybe pianists can recall whole concertos note by note, or painters can evoke in their minds the most subtle brush strokes. From a great novel a few sentences might linger, a character or scene. But those are abbreviations, not the novel itself.
Only lyric poetry yields the artwork in its entirety, anytime, anywhere. And it arrives in common language -- the same tool we use to get gas pumped into a dry tank. While standing in a bank teller's long line, I can rerun a whole sonnet in my head and enjoy a rush of tenderness that sometimes disperses my impatience as if a wand had been waved. The act plugs me into the great invisible company of Shakespeare or Dickinson.
It's strange that an act so solitary -- reciting a silent poem -- can invoke that sense of being drawn into the human community. Long works of prose are rabbit holes that let me vanish from this world into alternate realms. But lyric poetry's alchemy yields for me a strange and sudden kinship with the actual world and its citizens.
Since the bombings, I've turned perhaps most often to the work of the 90-year-old Polish exile and Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz. In "On Prayer," translated here by former poet laureate Robert Hass, Mr. Milosz bestows a way to pray onto even the most faithless.
You ask me how to pray to someone who is not. 
All I know is that prayer constructs a velvet bridge 
And walking it we are aloft, as on a springboard, 
Above landscapes the color of ripe gold 
Transformed by a magic stopping of the sun. 
That bridge leads to the shore of Reversal 
Where everything is just the opposite and the word is 
Unveils a meaning we hardly envisioned. 
Notice: I say we; there, every one, separately, 
Feels compassion for those tangled in the flesh 
And knows that if there is no others shore 
We will walk that aerial bridge all the same.
James Joyce once said that everyone starts out as a poet, then realizes it's too hard. For those of us with the hubris to keep writing verses that will seldom reach the exalted status the great works do (much less buy dinner or cover a mortgage), there's a great joy in the absurdity of one's enterprise. It's the joy derived from true wonder at poetry's redemptive quality, like taking your Little League slugger bat into the cathedral of Yankee Stadium.
Here I stand, bat cocked, ready for whatever impossible pitch history flings. It may be a presumptuously comic posture, but the cathedral itself offers me the constant consolations of magnificence.

HEADLINE: Down, but Not Out, in the Valley; 
Signs of a Rebound Appear in the High-Tech Heartland

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF and MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Jan. 13 

 BODY:
If this is a snapshot of Silicon Valley during the worst of times, the picture is not half bad.
 Houses on the market are receiving multiple bids, restaurant traffic is still respectable and the chip industry is glimpsing new growth. 
 Yes, the nation's high-technology heartland is in its deepest recession in recent memory, after tens of thousands of layoffs, and is burdened by unprecedented gluts of office space and manufacturing capacity. But some longtimers here believe that the region is already shaking off the dot-com calamity of the last 18 months. They say Silicon Valley's extraordinary productivity -- based on a foundation of entrepreneurship, venture capital and engineering talent -- will revive sooner than some economists have predicted. 
A report to be released on Monday suggests that the consequences of the recent Internet commerce collapse may be less permanent than some have feared. For all it has endured recently, Silicon Valley appears to be faring favorably, compared with many areas of the country, in terms of quality of life measures like the amount of land designated as open space, the report says.
The region's storied innovation still has a strong pulse as evidenced by a spate of new products that include advanced wireless phones, next-generation data equipment and the iMac pedestal computer, which Apple Computer introduced last week. Various seeds of economic recovery are manifest in the survey, prepared by Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a coalition of corporate, government and civic groups that annually compiles a broad economic index of the region.
"The world thinks we've fallen off a cliff," said Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, a research firm in Mountain View that prepared the 2002 Index of Silicon Valley, the sixth such annual survey. "But the dot-com bubble burst, and we're moving on."
California released job data on Friday that appeared to bolster the report's conclusions. The state's Economic Development Department said December unemployment in Santa Clara County -- the heart of the Valley -- was 6.1 percent, down from 6.6 percent in November.
The employment report is "not yet evidence of a turnaround," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. "But it's evidence the downturn may no longer be escalating." 
Mr. Levy, who helped review the Joint Venture survey before its release, summed it up by saying, "The downturn has not attacked or disrupted fundamental long-term strengths of Silicon Valley."
To be sure, some economists say that while the downturn may not have disabled Silicon Valley the way, for example, the aerospace collapse hit Los Angeles in the early 1990's, the Valley remains in deep shadow.
"It's not a depression, but it's very close," said Ken Rosen, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies the regional economy. "It's the most serious recession the Valley has faced in the postwar era." 
Professor Rosen and other economists who share his gloom note that the human cost of the dot-com meltdown -- the lost jobs and failed dreams -- has yet to be fully tallied. 
But the pain is far from universal.
"Everywhere around me I see people who have jobs and haven't lost their BMW's and who are buying cool new iMacs," said Brian Reid, a computer science professor at the new campus that Carnegie Mellon University is creating in Mountain View. Last year, Mr. Reid lost his job when Lucent Technologies closed its small research laboratory here. But several months later, he was hired as the first faculty member for what the university, based in Pittsburgh, hopes will one day become a major technical training center.
Mr. Reid's optimism is reinforced by the Joint Venture findings this year. Despite the fact that the region lost an estimated 25,000 jobs, or 1.8 percent of its total employment in 2001 -- the first net job loss here in nine years -- value added per employee, a key productivity measure, increased by 4.6 percent, to $170,000. That number is a striking contrast to the national average of $56,000.
And while average pay declined 2 percent last year, to $76,800, the dip came after a 22 percent gain in 2000 -- and the average is still more than twice the national average of $35,300.
While much has been made of the collapse in venture capital investment the last year, Mr. Henton said the falloff simply represented a return to the more modest growth rate of the period preceding 1999. In 1998, venture capital investment in Valley companies was $3 billion. By 2000, it had soared to $21 billion. In 2001, the amount of venture capital invested was back down to a more earthly level of $6 billion.
Some venture capitalists say the worst days may be behind. William B. Elmore, a partner with Foundation Capital, an investment firm in Menlo Park, said that Foundation was now looking ahead after shutting down six of its companies last year and laying off employees at its 37 other start-ups.
Among the firms still actively investing in 2001 were Mobius Venture Capital, formerly Softbank.
"What's incredible here is the strength of the ecosystem," said Greg Galanos, a managing director at Mobius, who invested the firm's money in nine companies last year -- mostly in the wireless "last mile" market for high-speed Internet connectivity.
"The big change between the bubble and now is everyone was in 'hog the puck' mode before," he said, using a hockey metaphor to describe his perception that investment firms are now more willing to share stakes in companies, rather than be sole backers.
One of Mr. Galanos's start-ups is a small company called Danger Research, based in Palo Alto. This spring, the company plans to begin selling a wireless cellular phone and data handset that is intended to permit Web browsing and e-mail. The company displayed its phone at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. 
"We were well received," said Andy Rubin, co-founder and chief executive of Danger. "It wasn't like the crazy energy of two years ago, but I got the feeling that there is new energy there, and it is building. The fear is gone."
The most promising segment of the Valley right now may be the oldest: the semiconductor industry. 
"What we're seeing is the first phase of the upturn for the next cycle," said George M. Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association. "The order patterns are improving, the inventories are in line, and as a consequence, we're having to build to demand again."
Good news for chip makers is good news for the Valley. The semiconductor industry's four-decade history of industrial innovation has regularly created entirely new industries -- from the electronic watch to the PC to the hand-held computer to whatever may lie just ahead.
The skeptics, however, argue that the fallout from the dot-com bust is still settling and will do so for at least the rest of the year. 
Professor Rosen of the Haas School noted, for example, that the unemployment figures were more damning than they might look at first glance. Not only is the rate high, he said, but it is drawn from a larger population base -- meaning far more people are jobless here than were in the last recession a decade ago.
Meanwhile, the commercial real estate market is still reeling. The commercial vacancy rate of 18.3 percent in San Francisco, just north of Silicon Valley and a former center of dot-com activity, is the highest recorded by Cushman & Wakefield since the real estate firm started keeping figures in 1970. And the vacancy rate of 18 percent in San Jose, the southern tip of the Valley, is near historic highs as well, with brokers saying they are braced for even more vacancies from the business bankruptcies they expect in 2002.
In addition to its economic assessment, the Joint Venture index tries to paint a broad picture of the quality of life in the high-technology region each year. In 2001, the group noted, there was a range of social and environmental improvements.
Last year, for example, a full 25 percent of the Valley's total land area was protected as open space, up 2 percent from the previous year. And in 2001, the Valley's cities approved construction of the largest number of new moderately priced housing units in four years. (Such housing is intended for families that make no more than 80 percent of the local median income.)
But that increase in approvals, according to some advocates of such housing, did not solve a "silent crisis" for moderately priced housing in the region. 
The economic downturn "has been a double whammy for a lot of families," said Lisa Milton, a community organizer for Peninsula Interfaith Action, a nondenominational religious organization that is trying to create community support for less expensive housing in Silicon Valley. "Families are stuck with the same rent," she said, "but they've lost their jobs."
The Joint Venture report found that only 15 percent of all homes sold in Santa Clara County were affordable for households with the median income of $87,300 in 2001. 
Moreover, the gap between rich and poor has not improved in the region, compared with the rest of the country. Nationally, household incomes in the lowest 20 percent of the work force rose 15 percent from 1993 to 2000. But in Santa Clara County, incomes in the lowest 20 percent grew less than 1 percent when adjusted for inflation and the significant increase in the cost of living in that period.
Ms. Milton said she knew of a household in East Palo Alto, just across Route 101 from one of the nation's wealthiest communities, where 24 people were living in a four-bedroom house. 
But for those in the Valley still fortunate enough to be plugged into the technoeconomy, the evidence of a comeback is indisputable. 
Last Thursday, on the other side of the freeway, in affluent Palo Alto, a two-bedroom house went on sale for $725,000 and sold quickly for 10 percent above the asking price.
And at the Palo Alto restaurant Il Fornaio, long the lunchtime hangout for venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, both the daytime and evening crowds are still gathering. But now, unlike the boom times, companies are not booking private dining rooms every Friday night and packing in employees for sumptuous feasts.
"And they're not buying as much wine -- not as much on the high end," said Alain Kocher, the restaurant's manager.
In the wounded commercial real estate market, meanwhile, one company's vacant offices can be another company's affordable sublet. 
Hernan Santos, senior director for Cushman & Wakefield in Silicon Valley, said that Archway Digital, a networking company in Sunnyvale, recently expanded from an office of around 20,000 square feet to one of 45,000 feet. The new space was subleased from Ariba, a big software company, which had lined up the property during the dot-boom, then found it did not have the business to fill it out. Mr. Santos said he had done several such deals, in which start-ups sublet space from older companies that were forced to pull back from boom-time expansion plans. 
It is all part of the regenerative cycle that has long characterized Silicon Valley and that is reflected in another recent optimistic survey of the local economy. The study, After the Bubble: Sustaining Economic Prosperity, was conducted for three regional planning organizations. It estimates that from 1995 to 2000 the Internet commerce boom was responsible for a mere 10 percent of the productivity growth for the nine-county Bay Area, of which Silicon Valley is a key component. The other 90 percent, in other words, represented real economic improvements, and the bursting of the dot-com bubble was simply a noisy anomaly. 
"The bulk of what occurred was more fundamental productivity improvement," said Lenny Mendonca, a director at the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, which performed the study for the Bay Area Council, the Bay Area Economic Forum and the Association of Bay Area Governments. "We certainly have an overhang of commercial real estate to work off," Mr. Mendonca said, "but if you look at a three-to-five-year time frame, we are very optimistic."

Concerns on Space and Revenue Spur Growth of Paid Obituaries

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Alice Lindsay and Rebecca Lee Thomas were both 83-year-old widows with active charitable and social lives. Both died in neighboring northern Colorado towns on the same day. Both deaths were recorded in staff-written obituaries in The Fort Collins Coloradoan.
 But there was a difference. The article on Mrs. Lindsay was 45 words long. Her 51-year marriage and her volunteer work went unmentioned. The newspaper published 230 words about Mrs. Thomas, detailing her careers as a beautician and nurse. "She will be remembered by the many great friends she leaves behind as a fun-loving lady with incredible style," it said. 
 The difference was not a matter of news judgment, but of money. Mrs. Thomas's obituary cost $93.60, according to an owner of the funeral chapel that handled the arrangements. Alice Lindsay's family, according to her undertaker, declined to pay $98.20 to publish the article they wrote. Her obituary was free, and minimal.
The notion of selling obituaries, often while keeping them typographically indistinguishable from regular news, was first adopted by a few small newspapers nearly two decades ago. But it accelerated the last year, as advertising revenue fell and newsprint prices increased. And more of the newspapers involved have substantial circulations, like The Portland Press Herald, in Maine, which circulates 77,000 copies daily and 123,000 on Sundays.
Like The Coloradoan and Florida Today, in Melbourne, The Press Herald prints its fee policy near the obituaries. At The Asbury Park Press in New Jersey, which prints 15 lines of each obituary free, and charges $5 a line thereafter, there is no visible distinction between free and paid obituaries.
Obituary pages have for generations been central to a newspaper's role in its community. Big-city papers, from The New York Times and The Washington Post to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, publish staff-written obituaries of prominent local, regional or national figures. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the deaths of other people are noted, if at all, in paid notices that resemble classified advertisements.
In smaller communities, where people know one another and each death has more resonance, obituaries, like wedding and birth notices, mark important moments in community life and have been allotted space and resources accordingly.
Still, no matter what the size of a newspaper, a staff-written obituary, with its stress on worldly accomplishment, its emotional detachment and its restriction on the number of survivors it will list, often grates on family members.
Bruce Keidan, the obituary editor of The Post-Gazette, said: "The family isn't really your audience. I want people to read the obituary section because there's interesting stuff in there. If we write for the families, the families will read it when they lose somebody, but no one else will." 
He added, "I certainly have tried here to preserve the distinction between news material and classified advertising. It is the difference between biography, the business I'm in, and eulogy, which is what makes up most of the paids."
By contrast, W. Raymond Ollwerther, the executive editor of The Asbury Park Press, said he switched to paid obituaries in 1998 in response to families' concerns. "A great many newspapers make distinctions between prominent people and everyday people," he said. "Our policy allows the everyday people to have a much fuller tribute to their life -- and makes the page much more readable over all."
When a death is newsworthy -- a teenager dying in a car crash, for instance, or the death of a prominent local politician or businessman -- The Press publishes a separate news article.
Asked about the trend, James Naughton, the president of the Poynter Institute, a Florida organization that studies newspapers, said: "Newspapers have for many years had the ability to sell death notices to funeral homes and individuals and to publish obituaries. Combining the two or confusing the two is taking advantage of the families" of the deceased.
He added that if newspapers cede to outsiders control over the content of articles, "They might as well abandon the entire staff and let people write whatever they want and then it wouldn't be a newspaper and we wouldn't worry about it."
The trend toward paid obituaries, noted a few years ago by U.S. News & World Report, is rapidly accelerating. Steven S. Duke, a researcher at the Readership Institute at Northwestern University, wrote in a recent study, "Space and revenue concerns led newspapers to run fewer, shorter obituaries, or shift them from a news item to a classified advertising revenue category." 
The Press Herald has just made the switch. Its editor, Jeannine A. Guttman, said last week: "Because of the very difficult economic situation newspapers are in, they are turning to a very painful choice. And it is painful. It's one that no one relishes or jumps into with glee. We decided, rather than cut our news staff, or our news hole, or other resources, we would do this instead." All obituaries, except newsworthy ones, are handled by the advertising department. 
Some newspapers give the news department the job of writing paid obituaries. At The Coloradoan, obituaries are written by editorial assistants. One of them, Amanda Koubek, said that except for stylistic fixes, "We don't edit the information that the funeral home sends us."
Relatives who like an obituary can have it published twice, as Mrs. Thomas's son did. 
The Coloradoan's publisher, Dorothy M. Bland, said that she had no problem with this practice. A newspaper is an advertising-supported enterprise, she said, so "any article is paid for." Asked if any bought-and-paid-for words in a newspaper constitute an advertisement, she said, "It depends on your definition."
The distinction between free and paid is hard to catch in The Asbury Park Press. Visually, there is none. Content is something else. The paid obituaries tend to be more idiosyncratic. Few include the cause of death. One listed a fishing buddy as a survivor. 
"I think we are serving people better by this policy," Mr. Ollwerther said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about the growing use of paid obituaries in newspapers misstated the practice of The Washington Post. The Post, which publishes unpaid obituaries, says its policy is to write one about any resident of the area whose relatives request it, provided the family agrees to include all information the paper deems newsworthy. The Post does not base its obituary decisions solely on the prominence of the subject.

GRAPHIC: Photo: In many papers, like The Asbury Park Press in New Jersey, publication of obituaries is often paid for by survivors. Here, only an actress's obituary ran as a news article.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Anew Calvin Klein campaign taps a nurturing mood that was evolving before Sept. 11.

BYLINE:  By Patricia Winters Lauro 

 BODY:
CALVIN KLEIN advertising has been called everything from sexy to outrageous to borderline pornographic.
 Now here's a new description: poignant. 
 In February, the Calvin Klein Cosmetics unit of the Dutch conglomerate Unilever will begin running advertising that may reflect the mood of the times. There will be snippets of film, in home-video style, of family moments -- shot in retro black and white and set to the 1960's Burt Bacharach tune "What the World Needs Now Is Love." 
The centerpiece of the $35 million global campaign is a 30-second television commercial that opens on Christy Turlington, the longtime model for the Eternity fragrance, singing the tune to a sleeping child. The spot cuts to other simple moments in the family's life, like children giggling in a bubble bath and a birthday party with extended family, as the soundtrack swells to the family singing the song. The spot ends on a partial rendition of the song by the recording artist Aimee Mann. A different commercial shows Ms. Turlington and a lover singing the tune to each other.
Print advertising that will begin in March in major fashion and specialty magazines will use scenes from the spots, and the tag line "Love, sweet love."
The advertising was created by Klein Cosmetics' in-house agency, CRK Advertising in New York, in conjunction with Neil Kraft, of KraftWorks Advertising in New York, who is the campaign's creative director. The fashion photographer Juergen Teller was the director and photographer.
That the song seems to capture a national state of mind after Sept. 11 is a coincidence, as the campaign was already in the works, said Hilary Dart, president of Calvin Klein Cosmetics in New York. Mr. Klein personally selected the song and asked Ms. Mann -- who was nominated for an Academy Award for her work on the soundtrack of the film "Magnolia" -- to sing her own version, Ms. Dart said.
Some analysts say the campaign may fit a new sentiment toward honesty and simplicity that was evolving before Sept. 11. Allan Mottus, editor of The Informationist, a cosmetics trade publication in New York, said that consumers have been rejecting the status symbols and artifice of the booming 1990's dot-com economy and seeking out things that seem more real and uncluttered -- a trend that has only accelerated since the terrorist attacks.
"We were already heading in the direction of a stronger value system, and it sounds like Calvin is hitting on it," said Mr. Mottus. "Fashion merchandise signaling status is just dead. It's not what Americans want right now."
The campaign is Unilever's way to attract new consumers to the Eternity brand without losing its heritage. Introduced in 1988, Eternity was an immediate hit, and its advertising became synonymous with the sounds of the surf and black-and-white beach scenes of Ms. Turlington embracing a mate or sometimes their children.
"Eternity has always been about love, family love, commitment and sharing," Ms. Dart said. "We wanted to protect that brand essence, and add more intimate, life-evolving moments that the public would connect with."
It was especially important that the advertising appeal across generations since Eternity is a "master brand" that is sold to men and women ages 22 to 54, said Ms. Dart. (Underscoring that point, Ms. Turlington's mother appears briefly in one spot.) But it was Mr. Klein's idea to bring music to the previously silent campaign, she added, and make an emotional connection with viewers. (Mr. Klein was not available for an interview.)
Eternity, a top-10 prestige fragrance sold mostly in department stores, is considered a classic that competes with other mainstays, like Chanel No. 5. According to the NPD Group, a market research company in Port Washington, N.Y., the $1.6 billion prestige fragrance category has been sluggish.
"The category had modest growth, but we started seeing a downturn this summer that was exacerbated by Sept. 11," said Natalie Granik Seidman, NPD's director for client services.
Mr. Mottus said "Love, Sweet Love" alone is so fitting that Mr. Klein may again have scored another advertising coup. Klein advertising has been at the forefront of ad trends since the days when a teenage Brooke Shields announced there was nothing between her and her Calvin Klein jeans. In the 80's, ads for the Obsession fragrance by Klein explored the idea of psychological obsession, changing the way fragrances were marketed.
Calvin Klein advertising became known for its edginess and eroticism. But in the mid-1990's, some racier campaigns came under attack and one for the jeans brand was pulled after critics complained it mimicked the trappings of child pornography.
All that, however, is history.
"When Calvin hits them," Mr. Mottus said, "he usually hits them out of the ballpark."

HEADLINE: Turkey's Leader Visits U.S. to Plead for Urgent Economic Aid 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Turkey's prime minister arrives in Washington on Monday to ask for urgent help for his economy, bringing a last-minute offering to make the case: a $5 billion bailout for the nation's banks.
 Parliament passed the bailout in a midnight session last Thursday, completing a last requirement to get a $10 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. 
 The prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, with an entourage of 200 government officials and business leaders, now hopes to persuade the I.M.F. to come through with the loan promptly, and to convince the Bush administration that Turkey's strategic importance warrants special trade help.
Experts here and in Washington predict mixed results. The I.M.F. board is expected to approve the loan later this month, but the Bush administration is unlikely to grant any trade preferences. 
Improving the fragile economy of Turkey, which has sustained economic setbacks similar to Argentina's in recent months, is the key to survival for Mr. Ecevit and his coalition. The government is trying to turn around the economy before elections scheduled for 2004, and analysts give them good odds of clinging to power, barring a renewed financial crisis.
"There is an optimistic mood in the country at the moment that things are getting better, but any indication to the contrary would undermine the entire process of economic recovery," said Ilter Turan, a political scientist at Bilgi University in Istanbul.
Indeed, the Turkish government is eager to portray the country as back on the road to financial stability after a bumpy ride over the last year that ended with bleak statistics: the economy shrank by 8.5 percent in 2001, consumer inflation ended the year at 68.5 percent, the national currency lost more than 50 percent of its value, 27,000 businesses closed their doors and 1.5 million people lost their jobs.
But there was some good news. Under international pressure, the government took steps to insulate banking and other industries from the demands of politicians, who have traditionally used state-owned banks and government contracts to extract campaign contributions. Analysts said that injecting new capital into weak banks and other regulatory steps should speed up the pace of mergers and help restore the industry's health.
Parliament also passed laws to bring greater integrity to public purchasing and to liberalize the tobacco industry by reducing subsidies to farmers and paving the way to privatize Tekel, the state-owned tobacco and alcohol monopoly.
The reforms did not come easily. Kemal Dervis, the economy minister, threatened to resign unless the bank bailout passed last week, according to the Turkish press. In the end, the three coalition parties voted for the bill and the opposition members of Parliament walked out.
Last year exports grew 15 percent, though partly as a result of the devalued lira. The Istanbul stock market recorded some year-end gains as Turkey benefited from the realization that the Argentine default would not lead to a collapse in other emerging markets.
"We are off to a better start this year, but we cannot talk about good economic conditions yet," said Akin Ongor, an executive at Garanti Bank and an official with the private Foreign Economic Relations Board.
Mr. Ongor, who will be making the trip to Washington, said the delegation would press officials in the Bush administration to eliminate quotas on Turkish textiles, reduce restrictions on the country's steel and adopt preferences that put Turkey on an equal footing with European countries.
Mr. Ecevit and others also are scheduled to meet with officials in New York, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to press for better business ties.
Senior Turkish officials, including Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, have talked publicly about leveraging the country's strategic relationship with the United States, which has become more important since the events of Sept. 11, into a closer economic partnership. They complained that Americans bought only $3 billion worth of Turkish goods last year compared with $3.5 billion in American products imported by Turkey, which has a population of about 70 million.
But American trade officials in Washington said the Turks should be prepared for a disappointing response from Washington. While there may be small concessions on textiles, which account for half of Turkey's exports to the United States, they said the administration would not cut steel restrictions or end textile quotas, which are to be eliminated on Dec. 31, 2004.
Mr. Ecevit is likely to be disappointed, too, when President Bush raises the issue of $2 billion owed to Motorola by Turkey's second-largest cellular phone company, Telsim.
The State Department and American lobbyists have already pressed the Turkish government unsuccessfully to persuade Telsim's owners to repay the debt. Administration officials said they expect Mr. Bush to raise the matter again.
Analysts said the disputed loan has harmed Turkey's ability to attract foreign investment, but Turkish officials said they cannot force Telsim, a private company, to repay the debt.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Hails Japan's Resolve in Sinking of Mystery Ship 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage has hailed Japan's sinking last month of a mystery vessel tentatively identified as a North Korean drug-running ship, a sign of the Bush administration's hardening attitudes toward North Korea. 
 "I salute the government of Japan and the guardians of Japan for having taken this resolute action," Mr. Armitage said in Washington in an interview with Japanese reporters on Friday. 
 Referring to the ship, which went down Dec. 22 with all its crew members on board, Mr. Armitage said, "I believe the ship to be North Korean."
Japanese defense officials say American military satellites first tracked the boat as it entered Japanese waters. In the interview, Mr. Armitage offered more support, saying, "Should the government of Japan request any assistance from the United States, you can be absolutely sure we will provide it."
Last week Chinese intelligence allowed Japan to intercept a Chinese boat carrying 330 pounds of amphetamines, with a street value in Japan of about $70 million. Japanese police say the packaging -- vacuum packed bags of 2.2 pounds each, packed 15 to a crate -- was identical to a 1,243-pound load of North Korean amphetamines confiscated off the coast of Japan two years ago.
Japanese police intelligence officials have said the boat that sank three weeks ago was also smuggling amphetamines. The Japanese Coast Guard has retrieved items written in Korean, including a candy wrapper manufactured in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
The ship sank, probably after an explosion on board, inside an economic zone claimed by China. Last week, Chikage Oge, Japan's minister of land, infrastructure and transport, said she favored salvaging the boat in April, when seas are calmer.
The amphetamines seized last week were of a very high quality and probably came from a state-run factory in North Korea, Japanese police investigators have said. Those investigators say North Korea's military manages about 20,000 acres of poppy plantations.
Drug smuggling appears to be increasingly important to North Korea's economy as cash remittances from Koreans in Japan have waned and aid from the former Soviet bloc has dried up.
"I believe they are trafficking in drugs," Yoichi Masuzoe, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said last week. 
Last month's shootout with the boat that sank seems to be part of a toughening Japanese policy toward North Korea. On Friday, Kyodo news service reported that prosecutors are investigating a Sapporo boat dealer who may have illegally sold seven used fishing boats to North Korea from 1997 to 1999. Japan maintains export controls on the sale of boats to North Korea. 
Kyodo reported today, quoting Defense Agency officials, that Japan was considering revising its laws to enable the Maritime Self-Defense Force to send ships to deal with conflicts in Japanese waters without waiting for a request from the Japan Coast Guard.
After reports surfaced of North Korean boats kidnapping people from Japanese beaches, Japan's Self-Defense Forces, as its military is called, starting maintaining a roster of suspicious North Korean boats. Distributed to Coast Guard units, the booklet currently contains photographs and descriptions of 27 North Korean boats believed to be used for drug smuggling or spying operations.

HEADLINE: Stock Show Seeking Room to Roam 

BYLINE:  By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: DENVER, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
His name is Exquisite No. 013. He is a heavy-boned, thick-beamed Hereford bull from western Kansas. He is taking a two-week holiday here and he has certainly earned it, having put on more than 2,000 pounds before the age of 2.
 Thanks to his easy-fleshing aptitude, which is ranch jargon for having gained a whole lot of weight without having eaten a whole lot of feed, Exquisite is worth at least $20,000. To show off his precocious bulk and fecund potential, he starts off every morning here with a spray wash, blow dry and comb down. 
 It's then, however, that the young bull's Denver vacation gets all twisted up in the politics of the New West, where folks love to dress like cowboys but where most of them live in semiurban sprawl.
Here at the National Western Stock Show, which is celebrating its 96th anniversary and is the largest event of its kind on earth, Exquisite has no choice but to display his magnificent beefy self in a stockyard that is over-crowded, run-down and within snorting distance of a major interstate.
Ranchers at the show complain there is not enough space to exercise their livestock. Horse breeders say practice rings are so congested as to be a danger to both horse and rider. After a few days here, livestock can become skittish and fatigued. In the eye of an expert buyer, even a fine specimen like Exquisite can end up looking stale.
A sure cure for these big-city, stock-show blues is to be found in the pocketbooks of the voters of Denver. Just as they were asked in the 1990's to tax themselves to pay for a new football stadium for the Denver Broncos and a new baseball stadium for the Colorado Rockies, they are now being asked to tax themselves to pay for a bigger, better stock show complex.
"We have got to have a modern, up-to-date facility that people like to come to," said Pat Grant, president of the National Western and chief cheerleader for a $48 million expansion plan. "For each livestock species -- cattle, hogs, sheep and horses -- we need more space."
To explain how urgent the need is, Mr. Grant invoked big money, hometown pride and the insidious threat of cowboy competition. The 627,000 people who attended the stock show last year, he said, left behind about $80 million with Denver hotels, restaurants and other assorted merchants. The National Western, he added, is the jewel in the crown of Denver's reputation as the capital of the intermountain West.
And if the voters of Denver don't pony up some money, he warned, the stock show could lose out to cities like Houston and Tulsa, Okla., where voters have already proved loyal to their cow town heritage and done the right thing.
These arguments have yet to ignite a flame beneath Denver's mayor or members of the City Council, whose approval is the surest route for putting stock show expansion on the ballot in November.
"The stock show is a part of our Western image that we truly treasure," Mayor Wellington Webb said. "But we have some other issues we have to address."
First among those issues is the severely overcrowded Denver jail, which has been forced to triple-bunk inmates and release nonviolent offenders. Last November, voters failed to approve $300 million for a new jail. Second, Denver's economy is no longer booming. Unemployment has spiked since Sept. 11, to 5.2 percent from less than 3 percent, primarily because of layoffs in the telecommunications industry.
And finally, as the mayor explained it, voters are weary of endless importuning for subsidies from sports teams, museums and botanical gardens.
"We have passed more bond issues in the past 10 years than some states," he said. "Now, each facility will have to wait its turn."
The most devoted attendees at the National Western are not from Denver. They come from ranches and farms that are spread from south Texas to North Dakota. These people describe the stock show as by far the best venue in the West to show off premium breeding livestock and find buyers eager to pay top dollar. The stock show could certainly do with a major facelift, they say, but they doubt it will happen any time soon.
"We are asking people who don't know cows, who go to the 7-Eleven to buy their milk, to spend their tax dollars for a stock show and rodeo that serves and honors agriculture," said Gary Hodgson, a rancher who lives in Brush, Colo., about 70 miles from Denver. "The chances of city voters approving a new stock show are unfortunately zilch."
Such pessimism, which seemed all but unanimous among rural participants at the stock show this weekend, may well be wrong, according to Dana Hoag, a professor of agriculture economics at Colorado State University.
"The idea of being a cowboy appeals to many people living in Colorado cities and suburbs," Professor Hoag said, citing opinion surveys he has done in the state in recent years.
For many Coloradans, especially upper-middle-class professionals with disposable income, the line between city and ranch has been blurred in recent years. Professor Hoag said a growing number of well-off city people are investing in horses, land and ranch apparel -- and they see themselves as cowboys.
Whether these urban buckaroos are sufficiently numerous in Denver to tip the political balance in favor of $48 million for a makeover of the National Western remains to be seen.
When asked about the vote, Jack Rogers, a rancher who owns Exquisite No. 013, threatened the people of Denver.
"You can put down that I am not coming back to this show unless they improve it," said Mr. Rogers, a partner in Rogers Hereford Ranch in Long Island, Kan.
For the past eight years, he said, he and his eight-member ranch crew have been hauling about 25 bulls to the National Western from Long Island (population 180). He said that altogether they spend about $15,000 in Denver during the show.
Having made his threat about never coming back, Mr. Rogers smiled and said he didn't mean it. No matter how crowded the stockyards, no matter how noisy the interstate, he said he has to come back to the National Western.
"If you are going to show a bull," he said, "this is the show to come to." He usually sells about half the bulls he brings. As of today, Exquisite No. 013 was still available.

HEADLINE: Grand Jury Examines Allegations Tax Assessors Took Bribes 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
A federal grand jury in Manhattan is investigating allegations that some of the city's veteran tax assessors routinely reduced property tax bills in the 1990's for the owners of skyscrapers, apartment houses, factories and warehouses in Manhattan in return for millions of dollars in bribes.
 One former tax assessor has pleaded guilty to accepting $4.1 million in bribes, and law enforcement officials say the investigation is continuing and involves other charges of corruption concerning many other commercial properties in Manhattan. 
 There have been whispers periodically about corruption and criminal investigations among the tax lawyers, property owners and appraisers who inhabit the insular world of property tax assessments, which generate more than one-fifth of the city's roughly $40 billion annual budget. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, however, have refused to discuss their investigation, which has been under way for at least three years.
But it recently came to light that one former tax assessor, Joseph Marino, pleaded guilty in April 2000 to taking $4.1 million in bribes between 1991 and January 1997 in return for lowering tax assessments on Manhattan buildings. Prosecutors did not announce the plea with any of the usual fanfare, perhaps because of the continuing investigation. 
At Mr. Marino's sentencing hearing in September 2000, his lawyer said that the bribes came by check from Albert Schussler, a tax consultant known for a knack for persuading tax assessors to lower their assessments and for a stellar client list, which included the Resnick real estate family, Aaron Gural, Stephen L. Green and dozens of others. 
No property owners have been publicly implicated in the scheme, and there is no record that Mr. Schussler, 84, has been charged with any crime. He did not return seven calls requesting comment. A lawyer familiar with the case said Mr. Schussler was cooperating with the authorities.
But the size of Mr. Marino's bribes has shocked many people in the industry and has led them to wonder how many others -- assessors, tax consultants, tax lawyers or owners -- may be involved.
"It seems like an astronomical amount of money," said William K. Block, a lawyer who specializes in property tax law and a former deputy commissioner of finance. "You're probably talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in assessment cuts."
A spokesman for the United States attorney's office, Herbert Hadad, would not discuss the case because it was part of a continuing investigation. He acknowledged that the only public mention of Mr. Schussler's name and role came up at the sentencing hearing for Mr. Marino, 73. Mr. Marino was sentenced to four years in prison, but because of his poor health, he has not begun to serve his term.
The commissioner for the city's Department of Investigation, Edward J. Kuriansky, would not comment.
James Moses, a spokesman for the city's Finance Department, in which 160 tax assessors work, was also reluctant to discuss the matter. "Our agency will review this matter with the Department of Investigation," Mr. Moses said, "and seek guidance in improving safeguards against corruption."
Tomorrow, the Finance Department will publish tentative tax assessments for the city's 960,000 properties for the fiscal year beginning July 1. Property taxes, part of the city's lifeblood, raised $8.2 billion last year. But each year, at least 45,000 property owners challenge their assessment before the Tax Commission.
According to the Finance Department, assessments on commercial buildings are set at 45 percent of the market value. In turn, taxes on commercial buildings are about 10 percent of the assessed value.
The assessment is based largely on an income and expense statement filed by the property owner, and also on personal inspections by an assessor and a review of comparable buildings. But according to landlords, appraisers and tax lawyers, estimating the value of a property is more art than science.
Tax assessors like Mr. Marino, who had worked for the city since 1949, estimate the value of all the commercial properties within a specific tax district. His last district before retiring in 1996 was in Manhattan, between West 41st Street and West 96th Street, west of Eighth Avenue and Central Park West. But during the recession and municipal layoffs in the early 1990's, he assessed the value of all properties in an even wider swath of some of the most expensive real estate in the world: from 40th Street to 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues and from 14th Street to 40th Street between Second and Third Avenues.
The early 1990's were also a time when landlords saw the value of their property drop by half and rents plummet. They scrambled to convince the city that their assessments should be adjusted downward. When rents started rising again in 1996 and 1997, property owners were not as quick to prod assessors to catch up with market conditions.
Mr. Marino pleaded guilty to secretly accepting millions of dollars in bribes in return for cutting assessments on various unspecified properties. In return, his lawyer said, he received checks from Mr. Schussler.
"I accepted bribes for the favor of creating a lower assessment for real estate tax purposes," Mr. Marino said when he pleaded guilty in April 2000, according to a transcript of the hearing.
Five months later at his sentencing hearing, Mr. Marino's lawyer, Steven R. Kartagener, said that his client had "conspired" with Mr. Schussler. He said that Mr. Schussler sent checks totaling $4.1 million to a company run by Mr. Marino's nephew, who paid $2 million in taxes on the money, before it got to Mr. Marino.
"We concede it was a sham," Mr. Kartagener said.
Mr. Marino's nephew, Robert Marino, would not discuss his uncle.
"I don't know what transpired with my uncle," he said. "I'm a self-employed appraiser. I'm not charged, indicted or involved."
Mr. Kartagener told the judge that his client was a "degenerate gambler" who had squandered most of the money in Atlantic City, although he had also used some money to provide for his extended family.
Mr. Schussler long ago became a wealthy man, a co-owner in the landmark Ansonia building and Nevada Towers, two apartment houses on the Upper West Side. He was a generous contributor to charities and a member of the Real Estate Board of New York's Real Property Tax Subcommittee.
Mr. Schussler was also known as a highly paid tax consultant or tax representative. Unlike tax lawyers who represent property owners before the Tax Commission, tax representatives do what is known as field work, meaning they talk to assessors while they are in the field preparing their assessments, before the tax roll is published in January. The Finance Department has encouraged property owners or their representatives to talk to assessors about issues that might affect the valuation of a property, anything from the pending bankruptcy of a major tenant to the need for major capital repairs.
According to property owners who know him, Mr. Schussler appeared to be especially good at this job, although, they added, they were unaware of any wrongdoing. Tax lawyers usually charge property owners a contingency fee of 10 percent to 25 percent of what they "save" a client in taxes if they win an appeal to the Tax Commission. Mr. Schussler negotiated a stiff fee based not on the percentage of savings but on the size of the property.
Jeffrey Gural, a property owner and a principal at Newmark & Company, a real estate firm, said that he became increasingly concerned about the growing use of tax representatives in the mid-1990's. Mr. Gural, son of Aaron Gural, said he found that consultants did far better in appealing tax assessments than "when I did it myself." He said he met with the finance commissioner at the time, Joseph Lhota, and suggested that he look into the matter.
"I wasn't comfortable that this was on the up and up, although I had no evidence of wrongdoing," he said. "To our industry, it was the equivalent of hiring a lobbyist. It turns out the lobbyists may have been corrupt."
Some tax consultants who are former city tax assessors are furious that they may be smeared as corrupt, but they acknowledge that some unscrupulous assessors have worked closely with tax representatives and lawyers to lower tax bills illegally for certain property owners. Lower tax bills for certain owners meant not lost revenue for city coffers, but instead higher tax bills for other owners.

HEADLINE: Spencer Abraham's Dream Car 

 BODY:
Coming from an administration fixated on producing more of the same old fossil fuels, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's promise on Wednesday of a major government investment in fuel-cell cars powered by pollution-free hydrogen seemed almost revolutionary. Yet environmentalists who have parsed the announcement are not turning cartwheels. And for good reason. Despite hydrogen's immense promise, the administration's plan is in fact a setback for greater near-term fuel efficiency, for reducing our reliance on Middle Eastern oil and for slowing global warming. 
 It is also nothing new. The Clinton administration invested in fuel cell technology, both for mobile sources of pollution like cars and stationary sources like buildings. Fuel cells use stored hydrogen and oxygen to create electricity, emitting only water vapor. Yet there is no infrastructure in place for delivering hydrogen to cars, and a commercially viable vehicle with an on-board system for converting natural gas into hydrogen is, by many estimates, decades away. 
 Meanwhile, the administration is getting rid of the only program that seemed to be making any headway -- a joint industry-government undertaking begun by Vice President Al Gore called the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. Mr. Abraham belittled the program because it had no chance of reaching Mr. Gore's lofty target of a commercially viable car that could get 80 miles a gallon by 2004. Nevertheless, the investment so far -- $1.5 billion from Washington, at least that much from Detroit -- has not only created useful technologies, but also contributed crucially to the development of a viable hybrid gas-and-battery-powered car capable of well over 40 miles per gallon. Detroit plans to bring hybrid models to market in the next two years; the Japanese are already there. 
Any federal pressure on Detroit to proceed with this program and develop high-mileage family sedans in the near term appears now to have vanished. Yet the next 10 to 20 years are vitally important to anyone who cares about urban smog, about acid rain (vehicles contribute to that, too) and about global warming. Americans will buy 150 million vehicles during the next decade, and Mr. Abraham's program won't do a thing to reduce the amount of oil they will consume. Nor will it do anything to reduce America's near-term dependence on foreign oil, which was supposed to be one of the main objectives of the Bush energy program.
One small source of hope is that the administration has yet to slam the door on a possible increase in fuel economy standards. Although the White House offered no support last summer when a group of moderate Republicans led by Sherwood Boehlert of New York tried to mandate higher mileage for gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s, Mr. Abraham may yet recommend some slight improvement in mileage standards, which have remained largely untouched for over a decade.
Tiny improvements, however, are not going to arrest global warming. Mr. Abraham calls his new vehicle the Freedom Car, presumably because it will free us from fossil fuels and the countries that produce them. We hope he is right. In the meantime, though, the only people set free are the manufacturers, now relieved of the obligation (absent strong new fuel economy standards) to produce serious breakthroughs in the next few years.

HEADLINE: Colombia Rebels Quitting Safe Havens as Peace Talks Fail 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Colombian rebels announced today that they would peacefully withdraw from five towns the government handed over as a safe haven for peace talks, a move likely to put an end to negotiations that began with high hopes but collapsed without ever reaching any meaningful accords.
 After efforts to restart the peace effort failed on Saturday, President Andres Pastrana gave the rebels until Monday night to withdraw from the huge demilitarized zone, which for three years has been under rebel control. 
 Unless there is a breakthrough in talks, military units on the northern and southern borders of the rebel-held zone were expected to retake this town and four other communities as early as 9:30 p.m. Monday.
Tonight, James LeMoyne, a United Nations envoy to Colombia, announced that he was meeting with rebel commanders and was in close contact with the presidential palace in Bogota. He held out hope for peace, saying: "It is very hard. Time goes by, and there are differences. I want to say I found a willingness for peace on both sides." 
The rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, on Saturday offered Mr. Pastrana a blueprint for talks to overcome the stalemate. But the president, who for three years had overlooked numerous guerrilla abuses of the demilitarized zone to keep the dialogue going, saw the rebel proposal as a stalling tactic. 
Hours after reviewing the 14-point proposal, he said in a nationally televised address that it was "not satisfactory."
While military occupation of the towns is expected to be peaceful -- a rebel statement even proposes that a ceremony be held -- many people here and across this country believe that the end of the peace effort will lead to an escalation in violence. 
Indeed, while the rebels said they would turn over the "urban core of the five towns," they did not mention the swath of jungles and cattle fields where guerrilla units camp. And many experts believe that the rebels, unlikely to directly confront thousands of army troops who are positioned to enter this region, may instead stage attacks elsewhere in the country.
"We will attack the economy of the country," said one low-level rebel, explaining that bridges and other infrastructure may become new targets in the rebel campaign to topple Colombia's government.
Adam Isacson, who follows Colombia's war closely for the Center for International Policy in Washington, said that "if you're the FARC right now, you're not thinking of fighting the military in the Caguan," the region the rebels have controlled. 
"You would want to direct your attention to other areas," he said. "Maybe they're thinking about taking out the economy, the electrical grids and all the infrastructure."
The new developments will be watched closely in Washington, where an increasing number of Bush administration officials and members of Congress have come to support a tougher stand against the rebels.
The United States has branded the FARC a terrorist group, since the organization has killed Americans in addition to carrying out widespread kidnappings of Colombians and attacks on civilian centers.
Although the United States policy now prohibits military aid for counterinsurgency operations, an all-out war in this strategically situated country may lead to a renewed debate about the merits of directing aid to battle the insurgents.
The withdrawal of the rebels also creates other problems. For those in this town and other communities in the demilitarized zone, the absence of rebels means a probable infusion of their archenemies, right-wing paramilitary units looking to kill rebel sympathizers.
"Now, the dirty war begins," said a former town official. "Assassinations. Informants. There will be killings here and there."
Although Mr. Pastrana has promised to safeguard civilians, many here doubt the government has the ability or desire to provide protection. Many residents here say the military works hand-in-hand with the paramilitaries, which are outlawed militiamen financed by landowners who despise the rebels.
"We are, of course, terrified," said a 36-year-old woman in the town of San Vicente, who asked that her name not be used. "We think that if we stay, we will be killed. Once the military comes in here, the paramilitaries will come in and begin their work."
Mr. LeMoyne has taken note of the looming danger, telling reporters this morning that he planned to stay in the zone to "demonstrate to the civilian population that we are with them" and to ask the other "armed actors to respect the civilian population."
Residents said they hoped that media attention and the presence of the United Nations would help avert violence. Some families have fled the zone, or melded into more rural areas. Most, though, plan to stay.
Those who believe they are at high risk include grocers and merchants who sold to the rebels, public officials and members of the small, unarmed public security force, which was created at the urging of the rebels.
"We believe we are the biggest targets, because we are in constant contact with the FARC," said Victor Ayala, 54, one of the coordinators of the force here.
The rebels, in their last proposal to the government, had hoped to overcome government objections to earlier demands that the military drop air force flights over the rebel zone and increased patrols and other restrictions just outside it.
In their proposal, the FARC seemed to drop those conditions, and suggested that a special commission examine "threats" on the zone's border. 
Mr. Pastrana, who for three months been trying to get the rebels to talk about a possible cease-fire, said the offer was not enough. He told the nation that the rebel group had until 9:30 p.m. Monday to vacate the zone he had created for them.
"Only a public manifestation in this sense can stop the clock," said Mr. Pastrana, who was under pressure from the army and the public to take a harder line.
Today, the rebels seemed to have the last word, saying the president's deadline "unilaterally changed everything accorded in these three years and subsequently closes the possibilities to the actual process."
Simon Trinidad, a rebel commander, blamed the "constant warmongers" who have put up obstacles "for the possibilities of peace, with social justice."

HEADLINE: A Failure to Account 

 BODY:
Harvey Pitt was recently quoted in Barron's as saying that "there is nothing rotten with the accounting profession." What makes the assessment alarming, instead of just laughable, is that Mr. Pitt is the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Pitt was a prominent Washington litigator who represented Arthur Andersen and other major accounting firms before being appointed to the S.E.C. by President Bush. We can only hope that the latest revelations in the Enron saga will prompt him to change his view and to take on a forceful role in regulating his former clients and protecting the integrity of financial markets. 
 Even within the context of the Enron story, the disclosure by Arthur Andersen that it had destroyed "a significant but undetermined number" of documents relating to its work for Enron was breathtaking. Yet it was only the latest in a series of betrayals of the public trust by major accounting firms. 
 Enron may have been deceitful in recent years, using off-the-books partnerships to exaggerate revenues and hide debt. It was Arthur Andersen, however, that signed off on the energy trading company's deceptive financial reports. Andersen's relationship with Enron has long been cozy, and its eagerness to peddle profitable consulting services may have been another reason why it went easy on the audits. It is awkward enough for auditors to get paid by the companies whose books they must review without creating additional conflicts of interest. Arthur Levitt, the former S.E.C. chairman, sought unsuccessfully to ban such conflicts. The industry resisted.
Disturbingly, Mr. Pitt prefers to be less confrontational and believes accounting firms should be given more freedom to regulate themselves. But the industry has proved unable or unwilling to discipline its own members to any meaningful degree, despite frequent promises to undertake tougher self-regulation and tighter peer review. 
The Enron debacle is exceptional only in its scale. Other former Wall Street favorites have engaged in creative accounting to pump up their stock prices. Lucent, Sunbeam, Waste Management, Xerox and Cendant are only some of the more notorious cases of companies forced to restate previously reported earnings, causing their stock prices to crater. People lost billions of dollars, misled by phony numbers ratified by the accountants. 
The public's trust in the integrity of markets, and in the reliability of companies' disclosed financial data, has been one of America's competitive advantages since the adoption of its security laws in the 1930's. The danger in the wake of Enron and similar scandals is that investors, understandably wary about the safeguards they once relied on, may decide to avoid buying company shares altogether. A majority of Americans are now invested in the stock market, but they will not long participate in a game they know to be rigged against them. 
Justice demands no less than a full accounting in the Enron case. But the nation's economic well-being also demands a broader response from Mr. Pitt and Congress to shore up the credibility of financial markets. Investors, as absentee owners, must be able to trust the information public companies report about their businesses. Buying shares in a company cannot simply be an act of faith.

HEADLINE: The Goal: More Miles Per Gallon 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "U.S. Ends Car Plan on Gas Efficiency; Looks to Fuel Cells" (front page, Jan. 9) contained good news for those of us who support free-market solutions to America's energy needs. While the auto industry has been financing such research without taxpayer help, the money pledged by the Bush administration for fuel cell research certainly beats the fuel-mandates approach, which would destroy jobs, hurt the economy and sacrifice vehicle safety. 
 Mandating outrageously high mileage standards on sport utilities, pickups and minivans, as is currently being discussed in the Senate, is a misguided approach. The technology does not yet exist to make these vehicles run at high fuel-mileage levels, so automakers would have no choice but to drastically alter operations. This would cost thousands of auto jobs. Let's allow the American free market system to meet America's energy needs.

HEADLINE: Growing Pains for Los Angeles' Airport 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
The inauguration of a flight connecting a distant Los Angeles suburb with Hermosillo, a provincial city in Mexico, would not seem cause for toasts and speeches. But Mayor James K. Hahn himself led the festivities recently at the Ontario, Calif., airport, saying he was making a point about the future.
 The Los Angeles mayor used the event to kick-start his plan for resolving what many experts regard as a kind of slow-motion air travel crisis. With Los Angeles International Airport badly overburdened and the communities around it fighting its expansion, the mayor is pushing new routes to the area's smaller airports, like Ontario's. 
 But the real symbolism of the ceremony there may have come when that first Aeromexico flight prepared to depart: only 11 passengers showed up, a clear sign that this airport, about 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, is far from popular.
Even before Sept. 11, the Los Angeles region was facing enormous political and logistical problems with air travel, which is critical to its economic vigor. The terrorism crisis has only made the issue knottier. The sudden need for increased security has made any solution far more expensive. And the number of passengers has plunged since the attacks, creating uncertainty about just what the future needs will be.
Perhaps worse, the concerns over terrorism appear to have sapped whatever will may have existed to face up to local opposition and take the step that many planners prefer, a major expansion of Los Angeles International Airport, known as LAX.
To some, the mayor of a metropolis as sprawling as this one is wise to promote far-flung airports. But the airlines and many people in business say Mr. Hahn's plan is doomed to failure because few want to fly out of the more remote airports like Ontario's. They accuse the mayor of wishfully thinking that other communities will accept what those around LAX are rejecting.
The region around Ontario, an area far to the east known as the Inland Empire, supports expansion as an economic boon. But the linchpin of the mayor's plan is the construction of a big international airport at what was once a major Air Force base at El Toro, in the middle of Orange County.
That plan faces rigid opposition, too, and in March residents will vote for the third time in recent years on a referendum on whether to turn the old base into an airport or a public park. Polls indicate that the park plan will win, potentially leaving the mayor without space for handling the 30 million passengers a year intended for El Toro.
"The pre-Sept. 11 environment wasn't encouraging," said Jack Weiss, a member of the Los Angeles City Council who favors expanding the main airport. "Post-Sept. 11, I think there has been, properly, a shift with the focus on security, not expansion. But the two should not be mutually exclusive."
The mayor's aides say it is a matter of social equity.
"LAX has had to shoulder the bulk of the region's air traffic," said Troy Edwards, a deputy mayor in charge of the airport planning. "It's not fair for the people who live around there, and it's also not economically efficient."
Asked what the city had planned if the El Toro airport is not built, he said nothing.
"The big drop in traffic after September has just made the problem more dangerous," said Steven P. Erie, a professor of urban planning at the University of California at San Diego. "It lulls us into a sense of complacency, a feeling that we won't have to deal with this for another 5 or 10 years. And that just isn't true."
He added: "The problem is air traffic is going to come back. This is a real crisis and it won't go away that easily."
The Southern California Association of Governments, a regional planning body, has said that long-term travel projections should remain largely the same, despite the decline after Sept. 11.
The Los Angeles airport underwent its last major expansion in 1984, for the Olympics. Its capacity then was 40 million passengers a year. In 2001 it handled an estimated 62 million passengers. Under the mayor's plan, it is intended to handle 78 million passengers in 2025.
Even that goal will involve a step-by-step tearing down and rebuilding of most of the terminals. In addition, because the airport is one of the country's most dangerous as measured by near-misses by planes, runways will have to be reconfigured.
Los Angeles' previous mayor, Richard J. Riordan, had proposed expanding LAX to handle nearly 100 million passengers a year. But in the face of local opposition he stopped pressing the issue. In October, Mayor Hahn officially announced that his focus would be on security rather than expansion.
The real growth in regional capacity is expected to come at Ontario and El Toro, under the mayor's proposal. Ontario's current traffic of about 6 million passengers a year is expected to grow to 30 million a year by 2025. El Toro would also be built to handle 30 million passengers a year.
The benefit, proponents say, is that it would move the airport capacity closer to places where the population is shifting, particularly the Inland Empire.
Airline executives dismiss this notion as fanciful. They argue that travelers prefer large hubs because they offer more flights and more airlines.
"At the end of the day, people fly where they want to fly," said Michael Whitaker, a vice president for governmental affairs at United Airlines, the biggest carrier at Los Angeles. If the airport congestion in Los Angeles gets worse and routes get pushed to the more remote airports, he added, many flyers will go to San Francisco, Phoenix or even Denver.
Many here hope that the El Toro vote in March will settle the issue. But there are already signs that the planning headaches may not end then. Opponents of that airport have vowed to fight in the courts as long as it takes to kill it.
"If the vote fails?" asked Larry Agran, the mayor of Irvine and one of the staunchest opponents of El Toro. "I think we'd be in trench warfare for another 20 years."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 17, 2002

 CORRECTION:

HEADLINE: AMID FISCAL CRISIS, MEDICAID IS FACING CUTS FROM STATES 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR and ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Medicaid, the insurance program for 44 million low-income people, is in a fiscal crisis, forcing state legislatures convening around the country this month to look for ways to cut benefits and reduce payments to hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacies.
 The 36-year-old program, which pays for one-third of all births and nearly two-thirds of all nursing home patients, is caught in the financial vise of soaring costs and declining state revenues. 
 Overall Medicaid spending grew by 11 percent last year, and many states report that spending on prescription drugs, which are covered by Medicaid, is rising at an annual rate of more than 20 percent.
At the same time, state revenues are declining because of the national recession, and most states, unlike the federal government, must balance their budgets.
"I think it's quite serious," said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican who is chairman of the National Governors Association, noting that Medicaid now represented the fastest-growing item in state budgets. States are struggling to decide which services to trim and which groups should bear the brunt. 
"These are terrible choices," Mr. Engler said, "extraordinarily difficult." 
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat and former chairman of the governors association, agreed, saying that Medicaid was "under enormous pressure everywhere because of the catastrophic increase in health care costs, particularly pharmaceutical costs and hospital costs."
The political fallout has already begun. Parents of children with severe illnesses and disabilities held a rally on Wednesday at the Capitol in Little Rock, Ark., to protest new cuts in Medicaid and requirements that families pay some of the costs in the form of co-payments.
Ray Hanley, the Medicaid director in Arkansas, said, "We are getting our brains beat out by health care providers and advocates" for patients who rely on the program.
C. J. Moorman, the father of a Medicaid patient, a 16-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, said, "They could easily co-pay a family to death."
Governors of both parties are putting pressure on the federal government to increase its contribution to Medicaid, which is financed by the federal government and the states.
The need is particularly acute in a recession, officials say, because many people turn to Medicaid when they lose their jobs and their health insurance. 
"The need for Medicaid goes up just when the states' ability to pay for it goes down," said Vernon K. Smith, the former Medicaid director of Michigan, who is now a health policy consultant.
The situation in Oklahoma illustrates the hard choices facing many states. The board of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, the state Medicaid agency, voted on Thursday to adopt stricter income tests for pregnant women, children and the elderly, blind and disabled; to reduce dental services for adults; to reduce payments for prescription drugs; and to delay indefinitely a scheduled increase of 3 percent in payments to hospitals and doctors. The state also decided to eliminate its Medicaid program for people deemed "medically needy" because of very high medical bills.
The cuts will affect at least 50,000 of the 461,000 Medicaid recipients in Oklahoma. Under the new policy, for example, Medicaid will no longer cover children 6 to 18 in families with incomes that are 100 percent to 185 percent of the federal poverty level ($14,631 to $27,065 for a family of three).
In Indiana, Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon, a Democrat, is trying to cut the state contribution to Medicaid by $251 million, or about 10 percent, over the next two years. State officials made a first round of cuts last fall, reducing payments to hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacies by about 5 percent. The nursing homes and drugstores filed suit to block the cuts. At a forum this month, state officials unveiled a "Medicaid balanced budget plan" with two dozen options for further cuts.
Prescription drug spending for Medicaid recipients in Indiana grew 20 percent last year, to $549 million, and state officials estimate that it will rise more than 50 percent in the next two years, to $845 million.
To control costs, Indiana officials will develop a list of "preferred drugs" and want to require prior authorization for anyone trying to fill prescriptions for more than four brand-name drugs in a month.
In Idaho, Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, a Republican, told the State Legislature on Wednesday: "Prescription drugs are quickly becoming our single largest Medicaid expense. Prescriptions are expected to cost almost 40 percent more this year than they did two years ago." He, too, wants to require prior authorization. But drug companies oppose such requirements, saying they limit patients' access to medicines.
Like many governors, Mr. Kempthorne lamented that Medicaid was taking resources that might be used for other programs. If the state does nothing, he said, "we will see Medicaid growth that continues to outpace that of education and economic development."
In Maine, Gov. Angus King, an independent, proposed on Tuesday a 5.6 percent cut in Medicaid payments to doctors, with slightly deeper cuts for hospitals and nursing homes. Doctors said some Medicaid patients would inevitably be turned away if the Legislature approved the cuts.
Governor Dean of Vermont, a state that takes pride in its health policies, said he was committed to controlling Medicaid costs by reducing benefits, like podiatry or dental coverage, but not the number of people eligible for basic insurance coverage. He said it made no sense to preserve a generous benefit package for fewer and fewer people.
In his State of the State address on Tuesday, Mr. Dean declared, "As I have said annually for the past decade, I will not allow any child to be cut from the health care rolls."
New York has felt the same fiscal pressures as other states, but with special intensity. The state has lost hundreds of millions in tax revenue as a result of damage done to its economy by the Sept. 11 attacks. Layoffs increased the number of people without health insurance, and many turned to a special temporary program known as disaster-relief Medicaid, which makes benefits available with little screening or paperwork.
Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, has led the bipartisan effort by governors to persuade Congress to provide billions of dollars in additional aid for Medicaid.
In Illinois, Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, announced last month that he was cutting state Medicaid payments to hospitals by $114 million, or 13 percent, to help fill a $500 million gap in the state budget. After an outcry by hospital executives, Mr. Ryan said on Tuesday that he would restore $24 million to hospitals.
To help pay for the restorations, Illinois officials said they would reduce Medicaid payments to doctors, dentists, chiropractors and other health care professionals.
Ohio's Medicaid director, Barbara Coulter Edwards, said the state had expected to see a net increase of about 43,000 in its Medicaid rolls from July to December. The actual increase, driven by the recession, was 84,000, raising the total number of recipients to 1.4 million. "While our service budget has not been cut, for which we're grateful, we have a real challenge because we're having to serve more people within it," Ms. Edwards said.
Advocates for low-income people are already sounding alarms here in Washington, arguing that Congress and the administration must confront the problem or face renewed growth in the number of uninsured. "I think this is going to be a very tough year for low-income and low-wage working families who depend on Medicaid as a lifeline," said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group.
In recent years, Medicaid has been an important tool for extending coverage to children and families. In fact, state officials said, their success in adding people to the Medicaid rolls, encouraged by the federal government, is one reason the program is such a burden on states today.
Medicaid provides health insurance for one-fifth of all children and is the largest source of federal grants to states, accounting for nearly one-fifth of state budgets.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: GUNS; 
Kabul Tries to Disarm Its Citizens In a Step Toward Law and Order

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Starting Monday, people here whose jobs require them to carry guns will also have to carry government identification cards, the authorities said today. It is part of an ambitious plan by Afghanistan's interim rulers to end the ubiquity of weapons in this heavily armed society.
 Disarming Afghanistan's 24 million people is critical to restoring order in the country, according to Gen. Bismullah Khan, a Northern Alliance commander who oversees security in Kabul and its surrounding province. 
 General Khan said that crime had spiked in Kabul in the chaotic aftermath of the Taliban rule, as Northern Alliance soldiers, militia members, irregular troops, security guards and any number of other people with guns roam this city. 
Traumatized by two decades of war and repression, the people of Kabul now face the more pedestrian, but equally lethal, dangers of banditry and car-jacking as well as the threat of death by violence.
Once the ID cards are issued, the authorities plan to require civilians to register their weapons with the police. At that time, they will take on the sensitive issue of who is allowed to keep guns in their homes.
"We haven't decided to go house to house yet," General Khan said, "but we are studying how to do it." Officials said they hoped to carry out the program across the country.
The Taliban government also believed that guns destabilized society and it, too, devoted considerable resources to collecting weapons. Successive rulers of Afghanistan have discovered, however, that with an estimated 700,000 armed men, reducing the corrosive influence of guns is an extremely difficult task.
It is complicated by the fact that after 23 years of nearly constant war, people here do not feel safe without a gun. Firearms are deeply embedded in the Afghan culture, as the image of a mujahedeen fighter with an AK-47 strapped to his shoulder attests.
"After 23 years of war, you can't expect there to be a sense of security in Afghanistan," General Khan said.
Even telling soldiers from civilians is tricky. Security guards wear military-style uniforms and carry machine guns. Some civilians, like Habib Samadi, wear camouflage fatigues because it helps them navigate checkpoints in the city.
Mr. Samadi just lost his older brother to violence. The brother, Walid Samadi, a cabdriver, had accepted a job as a driver for three Northern Alliance soldiers while they were in Kabul, the capital they had helped wrest from the Taliban.
A week later, Walid Samadi's brothers spotted his taxi, now painted black, cruising the streets of the city. They identified it by a placard on the rear that said "good luck."
Two men were arrested and confessed to having killed Walid Samadi. His body was dumped in a well in a remote part of the Shamali Valley, north of here. The soldiers said they had ordered him out of the car and shot him in the face, chest and back as he pleaded for his life.
It is a tragic but hardly unusual story. From taxi drivers to school workers, everyone here seems to know a recent crime victim.
"Whenever there is a knock at the door or a small noise outside, I jump," said Naima Samadi, as she huddled in her unheated home, cradling a photo of her slain son. "I am afraid that my other sons will be killed."
The lawlessness extends beyond the capital. In southern Afghanistan, where the interim government has little control and the United States continues to bomb suspected hide-outs of Taliban fighters and Al Qaeda terrorists, the lack of security is hampering relief efforts.
The United Nations has not been able to distribute food in Kandahar, the former stronghold of the Taliban, because of fears that armed bandits will attack its convoys and workers.
"Security continues to be a significant obstacle to reaching people," said Jordan Dey, a spokesman for the World Food Program.
Last week, Afghanistan's interim government took its first step to combat the lawlessness. It ordered between 300 and 400 Northern Alliance troops, who had been loitering in Kabul since the Taliban fled their advance on Nov. 9, to leave the city.
Today, the interior minister, Yunus Qanooni, said the bulk of the soldiers had moved to barracks outside Kabul. Those still here are waiting for quarters to be readied.
While Kabul is peaceful enough by day, there has been a surge in nighttime robberies by people wearing uniforms, some of whom claim to be looking for weapons or fugitive Taliban members.
Abdul Karim, director of research for the Kabul Police, said there had been 15 such robberies during one week, from Dec. 30 to Jan. 6. 
That compares with 100 reported cases of all serious crimes: robbery, murder, drug smuggling and the like in the last two months. "This is not a normal situation," Mr. Karim said. "When there are no guns in the hands of people, the number of robberies will decrease. Right now, it's a very difficult situation to control."
The police are also hopelessly outgunned. Mr. Karim said there were only 100 trained police officers in Kabul, constituting 30 percent of the force. The other 70 percent, some of them former soldiers, were hired off the street to help with assignments.
"Our problem is that we lack the basic elements of a police department," Mr. Qanooni said. "It was completely destroyed by the Taliban. We must rebuild it from zero."
While the government creates a new police force, the military is starting to confiscate weapons from troops no longer on active duty. Gen. Qalandar Big, who runs the main ammunition depot here, said he had collected 2,000 guns.
General Big showed off a small collection of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers that he said came from Northern Alliance troops. But he became evasive when asked where the 2,000 weapons were, saying they had not yet been delivered to him. "We have not faced resistance," General Big said. "Most people in Afghanistan are in favor of turning in their weapons."
Still, he noted that when the Taliban abandoned Kabul, they left very few weapons behind. Many of those people remain at large, in the rugged hills of eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border. They constitute another armed and dangerous group.
Confiscating weapons from civilians poses its own difficulties. When the Taliban collected guns from families, for example, people often turned in one, while keeping a spare.
Mr. Qanooni said the government would rather entice than compel people to surrender their weapons. The most basic solution, he said, would be to provide economic opportunities so that people no longer believed that they needed a gun to survive.
"We need to give jobs to the mujahedeen," he said. Failing that, Mr. Qanooni said the government could offer to buy guns from their owners. "If we spent $200 million, we could buy all of them," he said. "Unfortunately, we do not have it."
Perhaps the thorniest challenge is to break the cycle of violence in Afghanistan. The murder of Walid Samadi was the second violent death in his family; his eldest brother Farid, an engineering student, was killed by a shell during the Afghan civil war in 1994.
Asked whether he wanted to carry a gun, Walid's younger brother, Habib, shook his head vigorously. "We don't like to carry weapons," he said. "We hate weapons." After looking at his grief-stricken mother, he added, "Of course it would be good for the security of our family."

HEADLINE: Kelly Seeks Incentives to Stem Police Exodus 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER and KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
In an effort to stem the flow of officers leaving the New York Police Department, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly is preparing to ask the Legislature to allow officers some retirement benefits while still on the job.
Officials are alarmed that despite adulation for the police after Sept. 11, an exodus continues in part because of low pay, attractive job opportunities in the private sector and a pension mechanism that is making retirement irresistible because of vast amounts of overtime logged in recent months.
 Twice as many police officers retired in 2001 as in 2000, police officials said. Their reasons varied, but the most significant seem to be a growing dissatisfaction with salary levels. The annual base salary for a beginning officer in the city is $31,305, which lags behind such places as Suffolk County and Los Angeles by roughly $10,000. 
Mr. Kelly's proposals, which come two weeks into his second tour as New York's police commissioner, underscore how seriously he considers the need to slow attrition within the department, an issue that has been vexing city officials for much of the past two years. 
"I need to get a better sense of what works and what doesn't work, what do we go forward with," Mr. Kelly said.
Officials in Albany said they were happy to keep an open mind about any solutions Mr. Kelly might offer.
In an interview, Mr. Kelly said he was still refining his proposals, given what he is learning in meeting with officers, union leaders and commanders. He outlined several options that, he said, he was seriously considering, including allowing officers who have the 20 years of service necessary for retirement to use their highest-earning year as the basis for their pension even if it was not their last year on the force.
Mr. Kelly did not provide cost estimates for his proposals but he acknowledged that they might have potentially limiting budget implications. "There are things I would like to see done that at the end of the day may not be able to be done," he said. 
The commissioner also called for quick and decisive support among lawmakers during this session, hopefully within a month. "Ideally, I would like to see something sooner than that," he said.
A spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki cited the governor's "great respect for Commissioner Kelly," and said, "We look forward to hearing his ideas."
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said through a spokesman that "if the city believes legislation is needed, we would consider it."
Under the city pension system, after 20 years of service, uniformed police officers are entitled to a pension equal to half of their gross earnings, including overtime, in their last year on the force. With tax breaks and a special pension bonus of about $10,000 a year, that can come close to an officer's take-home pay before retirement.
Overtime opportunities increased greatly for police officers in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, and in many cases, veteran officers have seen their paychecks grow by as much as 20 percent. The higher earning would translate into pensions more lucrative than they ever expected, if they retire now.
Mr. Kelly said that the impact of overtime on retirement deepened because of a decision in the last days of the Giuliani administration to pay overtime to captains and above. Traditionally, officers of that rank did not get overtime.
He did not rule out seeking approval for more than one of the several options he is considering. Among these are allowing officers eligible for retirement to begin collecting an annual pension bonus, known as the defined benefit, even if they choose not to retire. A variation on this would allow 20-year veterans to put the pension bonus into an investment-only escrow account that could not be drawn on until retirement. Such an account would be subject to market fluctuation.
Mr. Kelly said he was also studying the feasibility of asking lawmakers to allow officers to put their entire monthly pension benefit into an escrow account while they continue to work past 20 years. Known as the Deferred Retirement Option, or Drop Plan, this would allow officers to collect their pension and their salary. Presumably, they would invest the pension, allowing them to have a nest egg of as much as a half-million dollars or more upon retirement. 
One senior police official said that the commissioner has talked of hiring an outside firm to survey the 40,000-member force to find out what incentives might persuade officers not to retire. The consultant would also study retention methods used by other police departments.
For the last few years, a booming economy has drawn officers in droves into higher-paying private-sector jobs in New York and across the country.
In New York, though, the problem has been particularly acute, in part because of the pay scale but also because of a sense among officers that the public did not appreciate them in the aftermath of two particularly painful incidents: the 1999 killing of a West African street peddler, Amadou Diallo, by police officers in the Bronx, and the 1997 torture of a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, in a Brooklyn station house.
The departures have been compounded by the difficulties the city has had finding new recruits.
Reaction among union leaders to Mr. Kelly's proposals varied.
"I think all these ideas are decent ideas, but what is happening is it is being done piecemeal," said Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents 29,000 members. "The main problem that has to be fixed is the salary issue. We have to give our members a decent livable wage."
A total of 807 officers, nearly a quarter of the 3,776 who resigned or retired last year, had less than five years on the job, officials said.
Some in the Police Department say many officers leave the force at the minimum age because they cannot afford to pay their bills. These officers fear that any proposal that allows pension funds to be deferred -- paid out and invested, but not collected -- until officers retire will not help greatly with retention.
But the head of the union that represents 30,000 law-enforcement officers around the State of Florida said its deferred retirement program has made officers and government officials happy.
"It's win, win, for both sides," said Ernie W. George, the president of the Florida Police Benevolent Association and a police sergeant in West Palm Beach.
Thomas J. Scotto, the president of the union that represents detectives in the New York Police Department, said he favored the proposals Mr. Kelly is considering and has supported such issues for years. "The incentive is, 'Don't let them lose it,' " Mr. Scotto said. "Let them stay active. Pay them as they stay active."
Not everyone is convinced that the loss of officers through attrition would have dire consequences. With crime down significantly over the past decade, some believe that New York, which still has among the most police officers per capita of the nation's largest cities, can afford a smaller force, especially given its looming budget problems.
 "No one has proven that you need 40,000 cops to sustain the city's low crime rate," said Harvey Robins, who was the director of the mayor's office of operations under Mayor David N. Dinkins.

HEADLINE: The Fiscal State of the States 

BYLINE:  By William T. Pound; William T. Pound is executive director of the National Conference of State Legislatures.

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Legislatures in 39 states will begin their regular sessions this month facing fiscal challenges unseen in at least a decade. Some of the problem is of their own making; during the cash-flush 1990's, America's state legislators passed tax cuts totaling $35 billion. Yet they were also responding to public demand for increased spending and are the victims of a slowing economy. Now, forced to find solutions, they may provide Congress with some ideas for reducing the federal deficit.
 The last decade, especially the last seven years, was one of robust revenue growth for states. Legislators had significant latitude in budget decisions. On top of tax cuts, states boosted funding for schools, improved roads and bridges, extended health coverage to poor children and helped senior citizens with prescription drug expenses. And they put some money away for a rainy day. Now that rainy day has come -- with a vengeance. 
 The effect of the recession on state finances is staggering. According to a December survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures, 43 states report revenues are below forecasts. Spending is already above budgeted levels in 19 states, and another seven expect cost overruns.
Practically no state has escaped unscathed in the current economic climate, and in some cases the budget holes are deep. California has an estimated $12 billion gap, larger than the general-fund budgets of 36 states. While smaller in dollar terms, the budget gaps in other states are no less painful.
Michigan cut spending and canceled capital projects. Ohio's plan to cover a $1.5 billion shortfall included spending cuts, tax increases and withdrawals from the tobacco settlement and rainy-day funds. Colorado canceled nearly $400 million in transportation and capital projects. Florida cut about $1 billion from its $20 billion budget and suspended a scheduled tax cut. Some state parks are closing in Tennessee. Nearly all state programs are vulnerable, even elementary and secondary education, which typically enjoys protection during a recession.
At the same time that state officials are dealing with a steep decline in revenue growth, they face a re-emerging challenge on the spending side of the ledger: Medicaid. The program is squeezing state budgets due to increases in prescription drug prices, demands by providers for higher payments and growth in the population eligible to participate in the programs. On average, Medicaid expenses rose 14 percent last year, more than double targeted estimates. This year's forecast is for 8.8 percent growth, and analysts are hoping they are on target.
Although the current economic decline began even before the events of Sept. 11, the terrorist attacks have exacerbated state budget problems. Tourism, which is crucial to many large states like New York, California and Florida, is down, and all states must also now address higher security costs.
Among state fiscal analysts there is a general consensus that economic conditions will not improve soon. That means state legislators have to close current-year budget gaps while enacting reduced budgets for next year. In legislatures that operate under term limits, many lawmakers are looking at budget reductions for the first time in their careers.
There is good news, though. State legislatures in the latter half of the 1990's wisely boosted reserve accounts, commonly referred to as rainy-day funds, to historic levels. As recently as 1995, those funds amounted to about $7 billion. By the end of 2001, the amount had more than tripled to $23 billion. Consequently, states are much better prepared to meet the current fiscal crisis than they were a decade ago. This is important because -- unlike the federal government -- nearly all states live under balanced-budget requirements.
Perhaps these rainy-day funds would be even more bountiful had states made more modest tax cuts. But tax cuts are often politically irresistible, never more so than when the budget is at a surplus, as was the case in many states in the late 1990's.
State legislators must face the consequences of the evaporating federal budget surplus, too. They have to be vigilant about maintaining federal commitments to Medicaid, welfare reform, highway and mass transit programs and children's health. And they are wary of new federal mandates for educational testing as well as new costs for security-related initiatives. Legislators must also deal with changes to the federal tax code, like last year's to the estate tax, that could deplete state coffers by billions of dollars.
During the last quarter century, most recently in the early 1990's, state legislatures have often had to wrestle with fiscal crises, and for the most part, they have adapted successfully. They are the places where America debates its most difficult public policy questions, and their solutions are often innovative. The challenges of the rainy-day economy are substantial, but they are not insurmountable.

Negotiating the Darkness, Fortified by Poets' Strength

BYLINE:  By MARY KARR

 BODY:
The events of Sept. 11 nailed home many of my basic convictions, including the notion that lyric poetry dispenses more relief -- if not actual salvation -- during catastrophic times than perhaps any art form.
 After the disaster, we did what perhaps most families did. We prayed in gratitude and fury and desperate petition. We watched hours of news. And we read poetry. I probably faxed more copies of poems -- and received more faxes from other devoted readers -- in the following weeks than I had in years, though as a professor at Syracuse University, I essentially butter my biscuit with the reading of poetry. 
 The diverse crowd of readers I swapped poems with encompassed colleagues, secretaries and administrators; but also The New York Times's conservative columnist William Safire; the poet Sharon Olds; my agent, Amanda Urban; my godson's parents in England; neighbors; the novelists Salman Rushdie and Don DeLillo; and my insurance-selling sister. 
The first poems I turned to were those of fury. The political satires the Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert lobbed against Soviet oppression dispensed a particularly warming fire. In "The Monster of Mr. Cogito" (translated by John and Bogdana Carpenter), he poses as a chivalrous figure fighting not a dragon but an invisible enemy, "The shimmering of nothingness." Mr. Cogito's monster very much resembles the one behind the World Trade Center attack:
it is difficult to describe
escapes definition
it is like an immense depression 
spread out over the country
it can't be pierced 
with a pen 
with an argument 
or a spear.
We only know the monster by "it's suffocating weight/and the death it sends down." The fury I felt at the invisible enemy was embodied in the hilarious, almost Quixote-esque figure of Mr. Cogito walking out at dawn:
carefully equipped
with a long sharp object
he calls to the monster 
on the empty streets
he offends the monster 
provokes the monster . . .
he calls -- 
come out contemptible coward
But just as we still stare helpless into our television screens, hoping for some glimpse of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, so this eager knight peers into fog, seeing only "the huge snout of nothingness."
European poets like Herbert who endured war have resounded the loudest and longest in these months. Asked to read for The New Yorker's benefit shortly after the attacks, I struggled with whether or not to include the Holocaust survivor Paul Celan's agonized poem about the digging in mass graves (translated from German by Michael Hamburger). It was somber and furious with the God whose universe contained the graves' possibility:
There was earth inside them, and
they dug.
They dug and they dug, so their day 
went by for them, their night. And they did not praise God,
who, so they heard, wanted all this, 
who, so they heard, knew all this.
They dug and heard nothing more; 
they did not grow wise, invented no song, 
thought up for themselves no language. 
They dug.
The cadence of the poem drummed out the relentless dirge of a people's grief, but was it perhaps too dark? The digging at ground zero was only blocks away, and perhaps the poem would fall on the audience like another blow.
The editor of The New Yorker, David Remnick, ultimately persuaded me to read it. He reminded me that its conclusion suggests not just digging toward the lost, but also a collective digging into history, how one person in despair and loneliness digs toward the salvation of someone else. The poem concludes with a moment of awakening, the sound of a ring striking metal as one human being reaches another.
On one, o none, o no one, o you: 
Where did the way lead when it led nowhere? 
O you dig, and I dig, and I dig towards you, 
and on our finger the ring awakes.
Poetry is about such instantaneous connection -- one person groping from a dark place to meet with another in an instant that strikes fire.
After the benefit, strangers wrote in gratitude for the Celan poem, though I regretted not being able to include Whitman's long passage from "I Sing the Body Electric," which describes the body in its various attitudes of beauty and in this section winds up with firefighters, whose recent courage we as a country have been so star-struck by.
But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, 
It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, 
It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him. . . . 
The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trousers and waist-straps, 
The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, 
The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curved neck and the counting. . . . 
Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with the wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count.
Memoir has permitted me to relay to readers the yards of intricate information I could never roll into a lyric poem, but prose never works in a reader's mind with poetry's instant infusion of feeling.
Poetry is economical. And for the gravely pained, swift relief is of the essence. A poem's brevity touches most readers when the mental focus required by a lengthy prose work just won't do. The poet Philip Larkin once wrote that the reader puts the penny of attention into the poem's slot and immediately gets a feeling as payoff.
A short poem is also, arguably, the most portable art form. Maybe pianists can recall whole concertos note by note, or painters can evoke in their minds the most subtle brush strokes. From a great novel a few sentences might linger, a character or scene. But those are abbreviations, not the novel itself.
Only lyric poetry yields the artwork in its entirety, anytime, anywhere. And it arrives in common language -- the same tool we use to get gas pumped into a dry tank. While standing in a bank teller's long line, I can rerun a whole sonnet in my head and enjoy a rush of tenderness that sometimes disperses my impatience as if a wand had been waved. The act plugs me into the great invisible company of Shakespeare or Dickinson.
It's strange that an act so solitary -- reciting a silent poem -- can invoke that sense of being drawn into the human community. Long works of prose are rabbit holes that let me vanish from this world into alternate realms. But lyric poetry's alchemy yields for me a strange and sudden kinship with the actual world and its citizens.
Since the bombings, I've turned perhaps most often to the work of the 90-year-old Polish exile and Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz. In "On Prayer," translated here by former poet laureate Robert Hass, Mr. Milosz bestows a way to pray onto even the most faithless.
You ask me how to pray to someone who is not. 
All I know is that prayer constructs a velvet bridge 
And walking it we are aloft, as on a springboard, 
Above landscapes the color of ripe gold 
Transformed by a magic stopping of the sun. 
That bridge leads to the shore of Reversal 
Where everything is just the opposite and the word is 
Unveils a meaning we hardly envisioned. 
Notice: I say we; there, every one, separately, 
Feels compassion for those tangled in the flesh 
And knows that if there is no others shore 
We will walk that aerial bridge all the same.
James Joyce once said that everyone starts out as a poet, then realizes it's too hard. For those of us with the hubris to keep writing verses that will seldom reach the exalted status the great works do (much less buy dinner or cover a mortgage), there's a great joy in the absurdity of one's enterprise. It's the joy derived from true wonder at poetry's redemptive quality, like taking your Little League slugger bat into the cathedral of Yankee Stadium.
Here I stand, bat cocked, ready for whatever impossible pitch history flings. It may be a presumptuously comic posture, but the cathedral itself offers me the constant consolations of magnificence.

HEADLINE: Down, but Not Out, in the Valley; 
Signs of a Rebound Appear in the High-Tech Heartland

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF and MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Jan. 13 

 BODY:
If this is a snapshot of Silicon Valley during the worst of times, the picture is not half bad.
 Houses on the market are receiving multiple bids, restaurant traffic is still respectable and the chip industry is glimpsing new growth. 
 Yes, the nation's high-technology heartland is in its deepest recession in recent memory, after tens of thousands of layoffs, and is burdened by unprecedented gluts of office space and manufacturing capacity. But some longtimers here believe that the region is already shaking off the dot-com calamity of the last 18 months. They say Silicon Valley's extraordinary productivity -- based on a foundation of entrepreneurship, venture capital and engineering talent -- will revive sooner than some economists have predicted. 
A report to be released on Monday suggests that the consequences of the recent Internet commerce collapse may be less permanent than some have feared. For all it has endured recently, Silicon Valley appears to be faring favorably, compared with many areas of the country, in terms of quality of life measures like the amount of land designated as open space, the report says.
The region's storied innovation still has a strong pulse as evidenced by a spate of new products that include advanced wireless phones, next-generation data equipment and the iMac pedestal computer, which Apple Computer introduced last week. Various seeds of economic recovery are manifest in the survey, prepared by Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a coalition of corporate, government and civic groups that annually compiles a broad economic index of the region.
"The world thinks we've fallen off a cliff," said Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, a research firm in Mountain View that prepared the 2002 Index of Silicon Valley, the sixth such annual survey. "But the dot-com bubble burst, and we're moving on."
California released job data on Friday that appeared to bolster the report's conclusions. The state's Economic Development Department said December unemployment in Santa Clara County -- the heart of the Valley -- was 6.1 percent, down from 6.6 percent in November.
The employment report is "not yet evidence of a turnaround," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. "But it's evidence the downturn may no longer be escalating." 
Mr. Levy, who helped review the Joint Venture survey before its release, summed it up by saying, "The downturn has not attacked or disrupted fundamental long-term strengths of Silicon Valley."
To be sure, some economists say that while the downturn may not have disabled Silicon Valley the way, for example, the aerospace collapse hit Los Angeles in the early 1990's, the Valley remains in deep shadow.
"It's not a depression, but it's very close," said Ken Rosen, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies the regional economy. "It's the most serious recession the Valley has faced in the postwar era." 
Professor Rosen and other economists who share his gloom note that the human cost of the dot-com meltdown -- the lost jobs and failed dreams -- has yet to be fully tallied. 
But the pain is far from universal.
"Everywhere around me I see people who have jobs and haven't lost their BMW's and who are buying cool new iMacs," said Brian Reid, a computer science professor at the new campus that Carnegie Mellon University is creating in Mountain View. Last year, Mr. Reid lost his job when Lucent Technologies closed its small research laboratory here. But several months later, he was hired as the first faculty member for what the university, based in Pittsburgh, hopes will one day become a major technical training center.
Mr. Reid's optimism is reinforced by the Joint Venture findings this year. Despite the fact that the region lost an estimated 25,000 jobs, or 1.8 percent of its total employment in 2001 -- the first net job loss here in nine years -- value added per employee, a key productivity measure, increased by 4.6 percent, to $170,000. That number is a striking contrast to the national average of $56,000.
And while average pay declined 2 percent last year, to $76,800, the dip came after a 22 percent gain in 2000 -- and the average is still more than twice the national average of $35,300.
While much has been made of the collapse in venture capital investment the last year, Mr. Henton said the falloff simply represented a return to the more modest growth rate of the period preceding 1999. In 1998, venture capital investment in Valley companies was $3 billion. By 2000, it had soared to $21 billion. In 2001, the amount of venture capital invested was back down to a more earthly level of $6 billion.
Some venture capitalists say the worst days may be behind. William B. Elmore, a partner with Foundation Capital, an investment firm in Menlo Park, said that Foundation was now looking ahead after shutting down six of its companies last year and laying off employees at its 37 other start-ups.
Among the firms still actively investing in 2001 were Mobius Venture Capital, formerly Softbank.
"What's incredible here is the strength of the ecosystem," said Greg Galanos, a managing director at Mobius, who invested the firm's money in nine companies last year -- mostly in the wireless "last mile" market for high-speed Internet connectivity.
"The big change between the bubble and now is everyone was in 'hog the puck' mode before," he said, using a hockey metaphor to describe his perception that investment firms are now more willing to share stakes in companies, rather than be sole backers.
One of Mr. Galanos's start-ups is a small company called Danger Research, based in Palo Alto. This spring, the company plans to begin selling a wireless cellular phone and data handset that is intended to permit Web browsing and e-mail. The company displayed its phone at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. 
"We were well received," said Andy Rubin, co-founder and chief executive of Danger. "It wasn't like the crazy energy of two years ago, but I got the feeling that there is new energy there, and it is building. The fear is gone."
The most promising segment of the Valley right now may be the oldest: the semiconductor industry. 
"What we're seeing is the first phase of the upturn for the next cycle," said George M. Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association. "The order patterns are improving, the inventories are in line, and as a consequence, we're having to build to demand again."
Good news for chip makers is good news for the Valley. The semiconductor industry's four-decade history of industrial innovation has regularly created entirely new industries -- from the electronic watch to the PC to the hand-held computer to whatever may lie just ahead.
The skeptics, however, argue that the fallout from the dot-com bust is still settling and will do so for at least the rest of the year. 
Professor Rosen of the Haas School noted, for example, that the unemployment figures were more damning than they might look at first glance. Not only is the rate high, he said, but it is drawn from a larger population base -- meaning far more people are jobless here than were in the last recession a decade ago.
Meanwhile, the commercial real estate market is still reeling. The commercial vacancy rate of 18.3 percent in San Francisco, just north of Silicon Valley and a former center of dot-com activity, is the highest recorded by Cushman & Wakefield since the real estate firm started keeping figures in 1970. And the vacancy rate of 18 percent in San Jose, the southern tip of the Valley, is near historic highs as well, with brokers saying they are braced for even more vacancies from the business bankruptcies they expect in 2002.
In addition to its economic assessment, the Joint Venture index tries to paint a broad picture of the quality of life in the high-technology region each year. In 2001, the group noted, there was a range of social and environmental improvements.
Last year, for example, a full 25 percent of the Valley's total land area was protected as open space, up 2 percent from the previous year. And in 2001, the Valley's cities approved construction of the largest number of new moderately priced housing units in four years. (Such housing is intended for families that make no more than 80 percent of the local median income.)
But that increase in approvals, according to some advocates of such housing, did not solve a "silent crisis" for moderately priced housing in the region. 
The economic downturn "has been a double whammy for a lot of families," said Lisa Milton, a community organizer for Peninsula Interfaith Action, a nondenominational religious organization that is trying to create community support for less expensive housing in Silicon Valley. "Families are stuck with the same rent," she said, "but they've lost their jobs."
The Joint Venture report found that only 15 percent of all homes sold in Santa Clara County were affordable for households with the median income of $87,300 in 2001. 
Moreover, the gap between rich and poor has not improved in the region, compared with the rest of the country. Nationally, household incomes in the lowest 20 percent of the work force rose 15 percent from 1993 to 2000. But in Santa Clara County, incomes in the lowest 20 percent grew less than 1 percent when adjusted for inflation and the significant increase in the cost of living in that period.
Ms. Milton said she knew of a household in East Palo Alto, just across Route 101 from one of the nation's wealthiest communities, where 24 people were living in a four-bedroom house. 
But for those in the Valley still fortunate enough to be plugged into the technoeconomy, the evidence of a comeback is indisputable. 
Last Thursday, on the other side of the freeway, in affluent Palo Alto, a two-bedroom house went on sale for $725,000 and sold quickly for 10 percent above the asking price.
And at the Palo Alto restaurant Il Fornaio, long the lunchtime hangout for venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, both the daytime and evening crowds are still gathering. But now, unlike the boom times, companies are not booking private dining rooms every Friday night and packing in employees for sumptuous feasts.
"And they're not buying as much wine -- not as much on the high end," said Alain Kocher, the restaurant's manager.
In the wounded commercial real estate market, meanwhile, one company's vacant offices can be another company's affordable sublet. 
Hernan Santos, senior director for Cushman & Wakefield in Silicon Valley, said that Archway Digital, a networking company in Sunnyvale, recently expanded from an office of around 20,000 square feet to one of 45,000 feet. The new space was subleased from Ariba, a big software company, which had lined up the property during the dot-boom, then found it did not have the business to fill it out. Mr. Santos said he had done several such deals, in which start-ups sublet space from older companies that were forced to pull back from boom-time expansion plans. 
It is all part of the regenerative cycle that has long characterized Silicon Valley and that is reflected in another recent optimistic survey of the local economy. The study, After the Bubble: Sustaining Economic Prosperity, was conducted for three regional planning organizations. It estimates that from 1995 to 2000 the Internet commerce boom was responsible for a mere 10 percent of the productivity growth for the nine-county Bay Area, of which Silicon Valley is a key component. The other 90 percent, in other words, represented real economic improvements, and the bursting of the dot-com bubble was simply a noisy anomaly. 
"The bulk of what occurred was more fundamental productivity improvement," said Lenny Mendonca, a director at the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, which performed the study for the Bay Area Council, the Bay Area Economic Forum and the Association of Bay Area Governments. "We certainly have an overhang of commercial real estate to work off," Mr. Mendonca said, "but if you look at a three-to-five-year time frame, we are very optimistic."

Concerns on Space and Revenue Spur Growth of Paid Obituaries

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
Alice Lindsay and Rebecca Lee Thomas were both 83-year-old widows with active charitable and social lives. Both died in neighboring northern Colorado towns on the same day. Both deaths were recorded in staff-written obituaries in The Fort Collins Coloradoan.
 But there was a difference. The article on Mrs. Lindsay was 45 words long. Her 51-year marriage and her volunteer work went unmentioned. The newspaper published 230 words about Mrs. Thomas, detailing her careers as a beautician and nurse. "She will be remembered by the many great friends she leaves behind as a fun-loving lady with incredible style," it said. 
 The difference was not a matter of news judgment, but of money. Mrs. Thomas's obituary cost $93.60, according to an owner of the funeral chapel that handled the arrangements. Alice Lindsay's family, according to her undertaker, declined to pay $98.20 to publish the article they wrote. Her obituary was free, and minimal.
The notion of selling obituaries, often while keeping them typographically indistinguishable from regular news, was first adopted by a few small newspapers nearly two decades ago. But it accelerated the last year, as advertising revenue fell and newsprint prices increased. And more of the newspapers involved have substantial circulations, like The Portland Press Herald, in Maine, which circulates 77,000 copies daily and 123,000 on Sundays.
Like The Coloradoan and Florida Today, in Melbourne, The Press Herald prints its fee policy near the obituaries. At The Asbury Park Press in New Jersey, which prints 15 lines of each obituary free, and charges $5 a line thereafter, there is no visible distinction between free and paid obituaries.
Obituary pages have for generations been central to a newspaper's role in its community. Big-city papers, from The New York Times and The Washington Post to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, publish staff-written obituaries of prominent local, regional or national figures. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the deaths of other people are noted, if at all, in paid notices that resemble classified advertisements.
In smaller communities, where people know one another and each death has more resonance, obituaries, like wedding and birth notices, mark important moments in community life and have been allotted space and resources accordingly.
Still, no matter what the size of a newspaper, a staff-written obituary, with its stress on worldly accomplishment, its emotional detachment and its restriction on the number of survivors it will list, often grates on family members.
Bruce Keidan, the obituary editor of The Post-Gazette, said: "The family isn't really your audience. I want people to read the obituary section because there's interesting stuff in there. If we write for the families, the families will read it when they lose somebody, but no one else will." 
He added, "I certainly have tried here to preserve the distinction between news material and classified advertising. It is the difference between biography, the business I'm in, and eulogy, which is what makes up most of the paids."
By contrast, W. Raymond Ollwerther, the executive editor of The Asbury Park Press, said he switched to paid obituaries in 1998 in response to families' concerns. "A great many newspapers make distinctions between prominent people and everyday people," he said. "Our policy allows the everyday people to have a much fuller tribute to their life -- and makes the page much more readable over all."
When a death is newsworthy -- a teenager dying in a car crash, for instance, or the death of a prominent local politician or businessman -- The Press publishes a separate news article.
Asked about the trend, James Naughton, the president of the Poynter Institute, a Florida organization that studies newspapers, said: "Newspapers have for many years had the ability to sell death notices to funeral homes and individuals and to publish obituaries. Combining the two or confusing the two is taking advantage of the families" of the deceased.
He added that if newspapers cede to outsiders control over the content of articles, "They might as well abandon the entire staff and let people write whatever they want and then it wouldn't be a newspaper and we wouldn't worry about it."
The trend toward paid obituaries, noted a few years ago by U.S. News & World Report, is rapidly accelerating. Steven S. Duke, a researcher at the Readership Institute at Northwestern University, wrote in a recent study, "Space and revenue concerns led newspapers to run fewer, shorter obituaries, or shift them from a news item to a classified advertising revenue category." 
The Press Herald has just made the switch. Its editor, Jeannine A. Guttman, said last week: "Because of the very difficult economic situation newspapers are in, they are turning to a very painful choice. And it is painful. It's one that no one relishes or jumps into with glee. We decided, rather than cut our news staff, or our news hole, or other resources, we would do this instead." All obituaries, except newsworthy ones, are handled by the advertising department. 
Some newspapers give the news department the job of writing paid obituaries. At The Coloradoan, obituaries are written by editorial assistants. One of them, Amanda Koubek, said that except for stylistic fixes, "We don't edit the information that the funeral home sends us."
Relatives who like an obituary can have it published twice, as Mrs. Thomas's son did. 
The Coloradoan's publisher, Dorothy M. Bland, said that she had no problem with this practice. A newspaper is an advertising-supported enterprise, she said, so "any article is paid for." Asked if any bought-and-paid-for words in a newspaper constitute an advertisement, she said, "It depends on your definition."
The distinction between free and paid is hard to catch in The Asbury Park Press. Visually, there is none. Content is something else. The paid obituaries tend to be more idiosyncratic. Few include the cause of death. One listed a fishing buddy as a survivor. 
"I think we are serving people better by this policy," Mr. Ollwerther said.

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
Credit card companies go to great lengths online to develop products that will corral teenage consumers.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
FOR Internet retailers, the teenage market is much like the China market. Both are huge and largely inaccessible because the targets speak completely different languages than most mainstream American merchants. 
 E-tailers simply cannot ignore the under-18 population, since this group spends roughly $155 billion a year in the United States, according to Teen Research Unlimited, a consulting firm. And 80 percent of those teenagers are online already. But they spend a paltry $1 billion of their cash online, according to Jupiter Media, an Internet research firm, a level that speaks to the inability of online merchants to entice teenagers to do more than download free music, play games and ping each other with instant messages. 
 But analysts have long said that the e-tailers are not solely to blame. Because the preferred currency of the Web -- the credit card -- remains out of reach for many teenagers and preteenagers, young people often have to ask their parents for the plastic if they want to buy something online. Adding this layer of parental screening to the purchase process is enough to send teenagers straight to the mall, where their friends are their only shopping companions. 
That is not to say that the three major credit card companies have not tried to penetrate the teenage market with products meant to start young consumers' spending online. MasterCard International is reportedly testing a teenage-oriented card, although Mastercard will not talk about such a project. Visa USA rolled out its Visa Buxx card in 2000, to mixed results. 
And American Express killed its year-old Cobaltcard effort in November, after its dot-com partner, the Zowi Corporation, suspended operations. But analysts said Cobaltcard, which was aimed squarely at the youth market, was dying a slow death anyway, with too few teenagers interested for the companies to justify the higher-than-expected cost of keeping it alive. 
"The idea of a teen card is a good one," said Aaron McPherson, an analyst with IDC, a consulting firm. "The card companies just haven't found the right formula, yet." 
The three main components of that formula, Mr. McPherson and other said, include the fees associated with the cards, how they are marketed and the ways teenagers can use them. Companies seem to agree that the cards should simply be so-called stored value devices, or debit cards, allowing parents or others to put cash value into the card account through an advance from the parent's credit card account or some other means. 
Since the teenage users are not taking on debt with such cards, the approach has enabled card companies to deflect critics who accuse them of cultivating a population of future debt addicts. 
Pricing has been a trickier proposition. Because the credit card companies do not charge interest for these cards, the companies must instead charge use fees. The Capital One Visa Buxx card, for instance, charges $2 a month to put money into the account, and $1 each time a customer checks the account balance at an A.T.M. 
According to Zack Martin, associate editor of Thomson Financial's Card Marketing magazine, an industry publication, many teenagers "get the card thinking it's a good idea, but they realize they're getting nickel-and-dimed on fees, so they don't use them anymore." 
Another big drawback, analysts said, is that the credit card companies have been unable to figure out how to market the cards in a way that will appeal to both parents and teenagers. Mr. Martin, of Card Marketing, said: "Some people say you need to advertise it to the teens, with ads that are so obnoxious parents wouldn't want them to have it. That way the teen will want it more." 
Visa said that it had not yet planned its marketing approach for 2002, but that the organization was pleased with the progress of Visa Buxx. Rhonda Bentz, a Visa spokeswoman, would not disclose use or profitability figures, but said that six Visa card issuers now offered Visa Buxx, "and many more are looking at it this year." 
Ms. Bentz said she was not sure whether the Visa Buxx program had induced more teenagers to shop online. Internet merchants are uncertain, too, because the card numbers do not distinguish between Visa Buxx accounts and typical Visa accounts. But some e-tailers are hopeful the debit-card programs will eventually make a difference in sales, even if they suspect the programs are not doing much now. 
Consider Bertelsmann's CDNow music Web site. According to Sharon Siegel, who is senior vice president for marketing for CDNow and BMG Music Service, about a third of CDNow's visitors are from 12 to 24, "so a big chunk are teens." And yet, only about 3 percent of the site's paying customers are teenagers. 
The dearth of credit cards available to teenagers "is clearly an obstacle" to their spending more on the site, Ms. Siegel said. That is why CDNow is likely to promote the Visa Buxx product after Bertelsmann finishes integrating CDNow's operations with those of the BMG Music Service. 
Mr. McPherson, the IDC analyst, said teenagers would warm to the idea of online debit cards much more quickly if more companies followed the lead of Coca-Cola's RocketCash, which has developed an online scrip for teenagers. About 2.3 million young people have deposited cash into their RocketCash accounts, which function like debit cards at scores of online merchants. 
Mr. McPherson was even more enthusiastic about the company's customer loyalty promotions, like the one RocketCash has conducted with Sprite since late 2000. In that effort, Sprite customers find RocketCash codes beneath their bottle tops. The codes are redeemable for RocketCash, which itself can be redeemed for merchandise at several online stores, like Magazines.com. 
"We see loyalty programs like this as a way to prime the pump, and get more teens to try it out," Mr. McPherson said. If big brands are involved, marketing might be more effective. 
Still, even if Visa, American Express and MasterCard were to put a card in the hands of every teenage Internet user, analysts said it might not increase their online spending, since teenagers may still prefer the mall in most instances. Meanwhile, the few online categories that are aimed specifically at young shoppers seem to manage without the widespread use of teenage debit cards. 
One example is Delia's, which sells apparel and accessories to teenage girls through catalogs, stores and a Web site (www.delias.com). Delia's has more than three million customers who shop online, with more than half of them buyers, according to Evan Guillemin, the company's chief operating officer. 
Mr. Guillemin estimated that 1 percent or less of the company's online customers use debit cards, while 5 percent to 10 percent pay by check. The rest, he said, use their parents' credit cards. 
"If you can deliver the right merchandise in a way that's compelling for the kid, and establish their trust, they'll find a way to buy it from you," he said. "Most kids have access to a credit card, one way or another."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Anew Calvin Klein campaign taps a nurturing mood that was evolving before Sept. 11.

BYLINE:  By Patricia Winters Lauro

 BODY:
CALVIN KLEIN advertising has been called everything from sexy to outrageous to borderline pornographic.
 Now here's a new description: poignant. 
 In February, the Calvin Klein Cosmetics unit of the Dutch conglomerate Unilever will begin running advertising that may reflect the mood of the times. There will be snippets of film, in home-video style, of family moments -- shot in retro black and white and set to the 1960's Burt Bacharach tune "What the World Needs Now Is Love." 
The centerpiece of the $35 million global campaign is a 30-second television commercial that opens on Christy Turlington, the longtime model for the Eternity fragrance, singing the tune to a sleeping child. The spot cuts to other simple moments in the family's life, like children giggling in a bubble bath and a birthday party with extended family, as the soundtrack swells to the family singing the song. The spot ends on a partial rendition of the song by the recording artist Aimee Mann. A different commercial shows Ms. Turlington and a lover singing the tune to each other.
Print advertising that will begin in March in major fashion and specialty magazines will use scenes from the spots, and the tag line "Love, sweet love."
The advertising was created by Klein Cosmetics' in-house agency, CRK Advertising in New York, in conjunction with Neil Kraft, of KraftWorks Advertising in New York, who is the campaign's creative director. The fashion photographer Juergen Teller was the director and photographer.
That the song seems to capture a national state of mind after Sept. 11 is a coincidence, as the campaign was already in the works, said Hilary Dart, president of Calvin Klein Cosmetics in New York. Mr. Klein personally selected the song and asked Ms. Mann -- who was nominated for an Academy Award for her work on the soundtrack of the film "Magnolia" -- to sing her own version, Ms. Dart said.
Some analysts say the campaign may fit a new sentiment toward honesty and simplicity that was evolving before Sept. 11. Allan Mottus, editor of The Informationist, a cosmetics trade publication in New York, said that consumers have been rejecting the status symbols and artifice of the booming 1990's dot-com economy and seeking out things that seem more real and uncluttered -- a trend that has only accelerated since the terrorist attacks.
"We were already heading in the direction of a stronger value system, and it sounds like Calvin is hitting on it," said Mr. Mottus. "Fashion merchandise signaling status is just dead. It's not what Americans want right now."
The campaign is Unilever's way to attract new consumers to the Eternity brand without losing its heritage. Introduced in 1988, Eternity was an immediate hit, and its advertising became synonymous with the sounds of the surf and black-and-white beach scenes of Ms. Turlington embracing a mate or sometimes their children.
"Eternity has always been about love, family love, commitment and sharing," Ms. Dart said. "We wanted to protect that brand essence, and add more intimate, life-evolving moments that the public would connect with."
It was especially important that the advertising appeal across generations since Eternity is a "master brand" that is sold to men and women ages 22 to 54, said Ms. Dart. (Underscoring that point, Ms. Turlington's mother appears briefly in one spot.) But it was Mr. Klein's idea to bring music to the previously silent campaign, she added, and make an emotional connection with viewers. (Mr. Klein was not available for an interview.)
Eternity, a top-10 prestige fragrance sold mostly in department stores, is considered a classic that competes with other mainstays, like Chanel No. 5. According to the NPD Group, a market research company in Port Washington, N.Y., the $1.6 billion prestige fragrance category has been sluggish.
"The category had modest growth, but we started seeing a downturn this summer that was exacerbated by Sept. 11," said Natalie Granik Seidman, NPD's director for client services.
Mr. Mottus said "Love, Sweet Love" alone is so fitting that Mr. Klein may again have scored another advertising coup. Klein advertising has been at the forefront of ad trends since the days when a teenage Brooke Shields announced there was nothing between her and her Calvin Klein jeans. In the 80's, ads for the Obsession fragrance by Klein explored the idea of psychological obsession, changing the way fragrances were marketed.
Calvin Klein advertising became known for its edginess and eroticism. But in the mid-1990's, some racier campaigns came under attack and one for the jeans brand was pulled after critics complained it mimicked the trappings of child pornography.
All that, however, is history.
"When Calvin hits them," Mr. Mottus said, "he usually hits them out of the ballpark."

HEADLINE: Turkey's Leader Visits U.S. to Plead for Urgent Economic Aid 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Turkey's prime minister arrives in Washington on Monday to ask for urgent help for his economy, bringing a last-minute offering to make the case: a $5 billion bailout for the nation's banks.
 Parliament passed the bailout in a midnight session last Thursday, completing a last requirement to get a $10 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. 
 The prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, with an entourage of 200 government officials and business leaders, now hopes to persuade the I.M.F. to come through with the loan promptly, and to convince the Bush administration that Turkey's strategic importance warrants special trade help.
Experts here and in Washington predict mixed results. The I.M.F. board is expected to approve the loan later this month, but the Bush administration is unlikely to grant any trade preferences. 
Improving the fragile economy of Turkey, which has sustained economic setbacks similar to Argentina's in recent months, is the key to survival for Mr. Ecevit and his coalition. The government is trying to turn around the economy before elections scheduled for 2004, and analysts give them good odds of clinging to power, barring a renewed financial crisis.
"There is an optimistic mood in the country at the moment that things are getting better, but any indication to the contrary would undermine the entire process of economic recovery," said Ilter Turan, a political scientist at Bilgi University in Istanbul.
Indeed, the Turkish government is eager to portray the country as back on the road to financial stability after a bumpy ride over the last year that ended with bleak statistics: the economy shrank by 8.5 percent in 2001, consumer inflation ended the year at 68.5 percent, the national currency lost more than 50 percent of its value, 27,000 businesses closed their doors and 1.5 million people lost their jobs.
But there was some good news. Under international pressure, the government took steps to insulate banking and other industries from the demands of politicians, who have traditionally used state-owned banks and government contracts to extract campaign contributions. Analysts said that injecting new capital into weak banks and other regulatory steps should speed up the pace of mergers and help restore the industry's health.
Parliament also passed laws to bring greater integrity to public purchasing and to liberalize the tobacco industry by reducing subsidies to farmers and paving the way to privatize Tekel, the state-owned tobacco and alcohol monopoly.
The reforms did not come easily. Kemal Dervis, the economy minister, threatened to resign unless the bank bailout passed last week, according to the Turkish press. In the end, the three coalition parties voted for the bill and the opposition members of Parliament walked out.
Last year exports grew 15 percent, though partly as a result of the devalued lira. The Istanbul stock market recorded some year-end gains as Turkey benefited from the realization that the Argentine default would not lead to a collapse in other emerging markets.
"We are off to a better start this year, but we cannot talk about good economic conditions yet," said Akin Ongor, an executive at Garanti Bank and an official with the private Foreign Economic Relations Board.
Mr. Ongor, who will be making the trip to Washington, said the delegation would press officials in the Bush administration to eliminate quotas on Turkish textiles, reduce restrictions on the country's steel and adopt preferences that put Turkey on an equal footing with European countries.
Mr. Ecevit and others also are scheduled to meet with officials in New York, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to press for better business ties.
Senior Turkish officials, including Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, have talked publicly about leveraging the country's strategic relationship with the United States, which has become more important since the events of Sept. 11, into a closer economic partnership. They complained that Americans bought only $3 billion worth of Turkish goods last year compared with $3.5 billion in American products imported by Turkey, which has a population of about 70 million.
But American trade officials in Washington said the Turks should be prepared for a disappointing response from Washington. While there may be small concessions on textiles, which account for half of Turkey's exports to the United States, they said the administration would not cut steel restrictions or end textile quotas, which are to be eliminated on Dec. 31, 2004.
Mr. Ecevit is likely to be disappointed, too, when President Bush raises the issue of $2 billion owed to Motorola by Turkey's second-largest cellular phone company, Telsim.
The State Department and American lobbyists have already pressed the Turkish government unsuccessfully to persuade Telsim's owners to repay the debt. Administration officials said they expect Mr. Bush to raise the matter again.
Analysts said the disputed loan has harmed Turkey's ability to attract foreign investment, but Turkish officials said they cannot force Telsim, a private company, to repay the debt.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Hails Japan's Resolve in Sinking of Mystery Ship 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage has hailed Japan's sinking last month of a mystery vessel tentatively identified as a North Korean drug-running ship, a sign of the Bush administration's hardening attitudes toward North Korea. 
 "I salute the government of Japan and the guardians of Japan for having taken this resolute action," Mr. Armitage said in Washington in an interview with Japanese reporters on Friday. 
 Referring to the ship, which went down Dec. 22 with all its crew members on board, Mr. Armitage said, "I believe the ship to be North Korean."
Japanese defense officials say American military satellites first tracked the boat as it entered Japanese waters. In the interview, Mr. Armitage offered more support, saying, "Should the government of Japan request any assistance from the United States, you can be absolutely sure we will provide it."
Last week Chinese intelligence allowed Japan to intercept a Chinese boat carrying 330 pounds of amphetamines, with a street value in Japan of about $70 million. Japanese police say the packaging -- vacuum packed bags of 2.2 pounds each, packed 15 to a crate -- was identical to a 1,243-pound load of North Korean amphetamines confiscated off the coast of Japan two years ago.
Japanese police intelligence officials have said the boat that sank three weeks ago was also smuggling amphetamines. The Japanese Coast Guard has retrieved items written in Korean, including a candy wrapper manufactured in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
The ship sank, probably after an explosion on board, inside an economic zone claimed by China. Last week, Chikage Oge, Japan's minister of land, infrastructure and transport, said she favored salvaging the boat in April, when seas are calmer.
The amphetamines seized last week were of a very high quality and probably came from a state-run factory in North Korea, Japanese police investigators have said. Those investigators say North Korea's military manages about 20,000 acres of poppy plantations.
Drug smuggling appears to be increasingly important to North Korea's economy as cash remittances from Koreans in Japan have waned and aid from the former Soviet bloc has dried up.
"I believe they are trafficking in drugs," Yoichi Masuzoe, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said last week. 
Last month's shootout with the boat that sank seems to be part of a toughening Japanese policy toward North Korea. On Friday, Kyodo news service reported that prosecutors are investigating a Sapporo boat dealer who may have illegally sold seven used fishing boats to North Korea from 1997 to 1999. Japan maintains export controls on the sale of boats to North Korea. 
Kyodo reported today, quoting Defense Agency officials, that Japan was considering revising its laws to enable the Maritime Self-Defense Force to send ships to deal with conflicts in Japanese waters without waiting for a request from the Japan Coast Guard.
After reports surfaced of North Korean boats kidnapping people from Japanese beaches, Japan's Self-Defense Forces, as its military is called, starting maintaining a roster of suspicious North Korean boats. Distributed to Coast Guard units, the booklet currently contains photographs and descriptions of 27 North Korean boats believed to be used for drug smuggling or spying operations.

HEADLINE: Stock Show Seeking Room to Roam 

BYLINE:  By BLAINE HARDEN

DATELINE: DENVER, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
His name is Exquisite No. 013. He is a heavy-boned, thick-beamed Hereford bull from western Kansas. He is taking a two-week holiday here and he has certainly earned it, having put on more than 2,000 pounds before the age of 2.
 Thanks to his easy-fleshing aptitude, which is ranch jargon for having gained a whole lot of weight without having eaten a whole lot of feed, Exquisite is worth at least $20,000. To show off his precocious bulk and fecund potential, he starts off every morning here with a spray wash, blow dry and comb down. 
 It's then, however, that the young bull's Denver vacation gets all twisted up in the politics of the New West, where folks love to dress like cowboys but where most of them live in semiurban sprawl.
Here at the National Western Stock Show, which is celebrating its 96th anniversary and is the largest event of its kind on earth, Exquisite has no choice but to display his magnificent beefy self in a stockyard that is over-crowded, run-down and within snorting distance of a major interstate.
Ranchers at the show complain there is not enough space to exercise their livestock. Horse breeders say practice rings are so congested as to be a danger to both horse and rider. After a few days here, livestock can become skittish and fatigued. In the eye of an expert buyer, even a fine specimen like Exquisite can end up looking stale.
A sure cure for these big-city, stock-show blues is to be found in the pocketbooks of the voters of Denver. Just as they were asked in the 1990's to tax themselves to pay for a new football stadium for the Denver Broncos and a new baseball stadium for the Colorado Rockies, they are now being asked to tax themselves to pay for a bigger, better stock show complex.
"We have got to have a modern, up-to-date facility that people like to come to," said Pat Grant, president of the National Western and chief cheerleader for a $48 million expansion plan. "For each livestock species -- cattle, hogs, sheep and horses -- we need more space."
To explain how urgent the need is, Mr. Grant invoked big money, hometown pride and the insidious threat of cowboy competition. The 627,000 people who attended the stock show last year, he said, left behind about $80 million with Denver hotels, restaurants and other assorted merchants. The National Western, he added, is the jewel in the crown of Denver's reputation as the capital of the intermountain West.
And if the voters of Denver don't pony up some money, he warned, the stock show could lose out to cities like Houston and Tulsa, Okla., where voters have already proved loyal to their cow town heritage and done the right thing.
These arguments have yet to ignite a flame beneath Denver's mayor or members of the City Council, whose approval is the surest route for putting stock show expansion on the ballot in November.
"The stock show is a part of our Western image that we truly treasure," Mayor Wellington Webb said. "But we have some other issues we have to address."
First among those issues is the severely overcrowded Denver jail, which has been forced to triple-bunk inmates and release nonviolent offenders. Last November, voters failed to approve $300 million for a new jail. Second, Denver's economy is no longer booming. Unemployment has spiked since Sept. 11, to 5.2 percent from less than 3 percent, primarily because of layoffs in the telecommunications industry.
And finally, as the mayor explained it, voters are weary of endless importuning for subsidies from sports teams, museums and botanical gardens.
"We have passed more bond issues in the past 10 years than some states," he said. "Now, each facility will have to wait its turn."
The most devoted attendees at the National Western are not from Denver. They come from ranches and farms that are spread from south Texas to North Dakota. These people describe the stock show as by far the best venue in the West to show off premium breeding livestock and find buyers eager to pay top dollar. The stock show could certainly do with a major facelift, they say, but they doubt it will happen any time soon.
"We are asking people who don't know cows, who go to the 7-Eleven to buy their milk, to spend their tax dollars for a stock show and rodeo that serves and honors agriculture," said Gary Hodgson, a rancher who lives in Brush, Colo., about 70 miles from Denver. "The chances of city voters approving a new stock show are unfortunately zilch."
Such pessimism, which seemed all but unanimous among rural participants at the stock show this weekend, may well be wrong, according to Dana Hoag, a professor of agriculture economics at Colorado State University.
"The idea of being a cowboy appeals to many people living in Colorado cities and suburbs," Professor Hoag said, citing opinion surveys he has done in the state in recent years.
For many Coloradans, especially upper-middle-class professionals with disposable income, the line between city and ranch has been blurred in recent years. Professor Hoag said a growing number of well-off city people are investing in horses, land and ranch apparel -- and they see themselves as cowboys.
Whether these urban buckaroos are sufficiently numerous in Denver to tip the political balance in favor of $48 million for a makeover of the National Western remains to be seen.
When asked about the vote, Jack Rogers, a rancher who owns Exquisite No. 013, threatened the people of Denver.
"You can put down that I am not coming back to this show unless they improve it," said Mr. Rogers, a partner in Rogers Hereford Ranch in Long Island, Kan.
For the past eight years, he said, he and his eight-member ranch crew have been hauling about 25 bulls to the National Western from Long Island (population 180). He said that altogether they spend about $15,000 in Denver during the show.
Having made his threat about never coming back, Mr. Rogers smiled and said he didn't mean it. No matter how crowded the stockyards, no matter how noisy the interstate, he said he has to come back to the National Western.
"If you are going to show a bull," he said, "this is the show to come to." He usually sells about half the bulls he brings. As of today, Exquisite No. 013 was still available.

HEADLINE: Grand Jury Examines Allegations Tax Assessors Took Bribes 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
A federal grand jury in Manhattan is investigating allegations that some of the city's veteran tax assessors routinely reduced property tax bills in the 1990's for the owners of skyscrapers, apartment houses, factories and warehouses in Manhattan in return for millions of dollars in bribes.
 One former tax assessor has pleaded guilty to accepting $4.1 million in bribes, and law enforcement officials say the investigation is continuing and involves other charges of corruption concerning many other commercial properties in Manhattan. 
 There have been whispers periodically about corruption and criminal investigations among the tax lawyers, property owners and appraisers who inhabit the insular world of property tax assessments, which generate more than one-fifth of the city's roughly $40 billion annual budget. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, however, have refused to discuss their investigation, which has been under way for at least three years.
But it recently came to light that one former tax assessor, Joseph Marino, pleaded guilty in April 2000 to taking $4.1 million in bribes between 1991 and January 1997 in return for lowering tax assessments on Manhattan buildings. Prosecutors did not announce the plea with any of the usual fanfare, perhaps because of the continuing investigation. 
At Mr. Marino's sentencing hearing in September 2000, his lawyer said that the bribes came by check from Albert Schussler, a tax consultant known for a knack for persuading tax assessors to lower their assessments and for a stellar client list, which included the Resnick real estate family, Aaron Gural, Stephen L. Green and dozens of others. 
No property owners have been publicly implicated in the scheme, and there is no record that Mr. Schussler, 84, has been charged with any crime. He did not return seven calls requesting comment. A lawyer familiar with the case said Mr. Schussler was cooperating with the authorities.
But the size of Mr. Marino's bribes has shocked many people in the industry and has led them to wonder how many others -- assessors, tax consultants, tax lawyers or owners -- may be involved.
"It seems like an astronomical amount of money," said William K. Block, a lawyer who specializes in property tax law and a former deputy commissioner of finance. "You're probably talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in assessment cuts."
A spokesman for the United States attorney's office, Herbert Hadad, would not discuss the case because it was part of a continuing investigation. He acknowledged that the only public mention of Mr. Schussler's name and role came up at the sentencing hearing for Mr. Marino, 73. Mr. Marino was sentenced to four years in prison, but because of his poor health, he has not begun to serve his term.
The commissioner for the city's Department of Investigation, Edward J. Kuriansky, would not comment.
James Moses, a spokesman for the city's Finance Department, in which 160 tax assessors work, was also reluctant to discuss the matter. "Our agency will review this matter with the Department of Investigation," Mr. Moses said, "and seek guidance in improving safeguards against corruption."
Tomorrow, the Finance Department will publish tentative tax assessments for the city's 960,000 properties for the fiscal year beginning July 1. Property taxes, part of the city's lifeblood, raised $8.2 billion last year. But each year, at least 45,000 property owners challenge their assessment before the Tax Commission.
According to the Finance Department, assessments on commercial buildings are set at 45 percent of the market value. In turn, taxes on commercial buildings are about 10 percent of the assessed value.
The assessment is based largely on an income and expense statement filed by the property owner, and also on personal inspections by an assessor and a review of comparable buildings. But according to landlords, appraisers and tax lawyers, estimating the value of a property is more art than science.
Tax assessors like Mr. Marino, who had worked for the city since 1949, estimate the value of all the commercial properties within a specific tax district. His last district before retiring in 1996 was in Manhattan, between West 41st Street and West 96th Street, west of Eighth Avenue and Central Park West. But during the recession and municipal layoffs in the early 1990's, he assessed the value of all properties in an even wider swath of some of the most expensive real estate in the world: from 40th Street to 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues and from 14th Street to 40th Street between Second and Third Avenues.
The early 1990's were also a time when landlords saw the value of their property drop by half and rents plummet. They scrambled to convince the city that their assessments should be adjusted downward. When rents started rising again in 1996 and 1997, property owners were not as quick to prod assessors to catch up with market conditions.
Mr. Marino pleaded guilty to secretly accepting millions of dollars in bribes in return for cutting assessments on various unspecified properties. In return, his lawyer said, he received checks from Mr. Schussler.
"I accepted bribes for the favor of creating a lower assessment for real estate tax purposes," Mr. Marino said when he pleaded guilty in April 2000, according to a transcript of the hearing.
Five months later at his sentencing hearing, Mr. Marino's lawyer, Steven R. Kartagener, said that his client had "conspired" with Mr. Schussler. He said that Mr. Schussler sent checks totaling $4.1 million to a company run by Mr. Marino's nephew, who paid $2 million in taxes on the money, before it got to Mr. Marino.
"We concede it was a sham," Mr. Kartagener said.
Mr. Marino's nephew, Robert Marino, would not discuss his uncle.
"I don't know what transpired with my uncle," he said. "I'm a self-employed appraiser. I'm not charged, indicted or involved."
Mr. Kartagener told the judge that his client was a "degenerate gambler" who had squandered most of the money in Atlantic City, although he had also used some money to provide for his extended family.
Mr. Schussler long ago became a wealthy man, a co-owner in the landmark Ansonia building and Nevada Towers, two apartment houses on the Upper West Side. He was a generous contributor to charities and a member of the Real Estate Board of New York's Real Property Tax Subcommittee.
Mr. Schussler was also known as a highly paid tax consultant or tax representative. Unlike tax lawyers who represent property owners before the Tax Commission, tax representatives do what is known as field work, meaning they talk to assessors while they are in the field preparing their assessments, before the tax roll is published in January. The Finance Department has encouraged property owners or their representatives to talk to assessors about issues that might affect the valuation of a property, anything from the pending bankruptcy of a major tenant to the need for major capital repairs.
According to property owners who know him, Mr. Schussler appeared to be especially good at this job, although, they added, they were unaware of any wrongdoing. Tax lawyers usually charge property owners a contingency fee of 10 percent to 25 percent of what they "save" a client in taxes if they win an appeal to the Tax Commission. Mr. Schussler negotiated a stiff fee based not on the percentage of savings but on the size of the property.
Jeffrey Gural, a property owner and a principal at Newmark & Company, a real estate firm, said that he became increasingly concerned about the growing use of tax representatives in the mid-1990's. Mr. Gural, son of Aaron Gural, said he found that consultants did far better in appealing tax assessments than "when I did it myself." He said he met with the finance commissioner at the time, Joseph Lhota, and suggested that he look into the matter.
"I wasn't comfortable that this was on the up and up, although I had no evidence of wrongdoing," he said. "To our industry, it was the equivalent of hiring a lobbyist. It turns out the lobbyists may have been corrupt."
Some tax consultants who are former city tax assessors are furious that they may be smeared as corrupt, but they acknowledge that some unscrupulous assessors have worked closely with tax representatives and lawyers to lower tax bills illegally for certain property owners. Lower tax bills for certain owners meant not lost revenue for city coffers, but instead higher tax bills for other owners.

HEADLINE: Spencer Abraham's Dream Car 

 BODY:
Coming from an administration fixated on producing more of the same old fossil fuels, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's promise on Wednesday of a major government investment in fuel-cell cars powered by pollution-free hydrogen seemed almost revolutionary. Yet environmentalists who have parsed the announcement are not turning cartwheels. And for good reason. Despite hydrogen's immense promise, the administration's plan is in fact a setback for greater near-term fuel efficiency, for reducing our reliance on Middle Eastern oil and for slowing global warming. 
 It is also nothing new. The Clinton administration invested in fuel cell technology, both for mobile sources of pollution like cars and stationary sources like buildings. Fuel cells use stored hydrogen and oxygen to create electricity, emitting only water vapor. Yet there is no infrastructure in place for delivering hydrogen to cars, and a commercially viable vehicle with an on-board system for converting natural gas into hydrogen is, by many estimates, decades away. 
 Meanwhile, the administration is getting rid of the only program that seemed to be making any headway -- a joint industry-government undertaking begun by Vice President Al Gore called the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. Mr. Abraham belittled the program because it had no chance of reaching Mr. Gore's lofty target of a commercially viable car that could get 80 miles a gallon by 2004. Nevertheless, the investment so far -- $1.5 billion from Washington, at least that much from Detroit -- has not only created useful technologies, but also contributed crucially to the development of a viable hybrid gas-and-battery-powered car capable of well over 40 miles per gallon. Detroit plans to bring hybrid models to market in the next two years; the Japanese are already there. 
Any federal pressure on Detroit to proceed with this program and develop high-mileage family sedans in the near term appears now to have vanished. Yet the next 10 to 20 years are vitally important to anyone who cares about urban smog, about acid rain (vehicles contribute to that, too) and about global warming. Americans will buy 150 million vehicles during the next decade, and Mr. Abraham's program won't do a thing to reduce the amount of oil they will consume. Nor will it do anything to reduce America's near-term dependence on foreign oil, which was supposed to be one of the main objectives of the Bush energy program.
One small source of hope is that the administration has yet to slam the door on a possible increase in fuel economy standards. Although the White House offered no support last summer when a group of moderate Republicans led by Sherwood Boehlert of New York tried to mandate higher mileage for gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s, Mr. Abraham may yet recommend some slight improvement in mileage standards, which have remained largely untouched for over a decade.
Tiny improvements, however, are not going to arrest global warming. Mr. Abraham calls his new vehicle the Freedom Car, presumably because it will free us from fossil fuels and the countries that produce them. We hope he is right. In the meantime, though, the only people set free are the manufacturers, now relieved of the obligation (absent strong new fuel economy standards) to produce serious breakthroughs in the next few years.

HEADLINE: Colombia Rebels Quitting Safe Havens as Peace Talks Fail 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Colombian rebels announced today that they would peacefully withdraw from five towns the government handed over as a safe haven for peace talks, a move likely to put an end to negotiations that began with high hopes but collapsed without ever reaching any meaningful accords.
 After efforts to restart the peace effort failed on Saturday, President Andres Pastrana gave the rebels until Monday night to withdraw from the huge demilitarized zone, which for three years has been under rebel control. 
 Unless there is a breakthrough in talks, military units on the northern and southern borders of the rebel-held zone were expected to retake this town and four other communities as early as 9:30 p.m. Monday.
Tonight, James LeMoyne, a United Nations envoy to Colombia, announced that he was meeting with rebel commanders and was in close contact with the presidential palace in Bogota. He held out hope for peace, saying: "It is very hard. Time goes by, and there are differences. I want to say I found a willingness for peace on both sides." 
The rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, on Saturday offered Mr. Pastrana a blueprint for talks to overcome the stalemate. But the president, who for three years had overlooked numerous guerrilla abuses of the demilitarized zone to keep the dialogue going, saw the rebel proposal as a stalling tactic. 
Hours after reviewing the 14-point proposal, he said in a nationally televised address that it was "not satisfactory."
While military occupation of the towns is expected to be peaceful -- a rebel statement even proposes that a ceremony be held -- many people here and across this country believe that the end of the peace effort will lead to an escalation in violence. 
Indeed, while the rebels said they would turn over the "urban core of the five towns," they did not mention the swath of jungles and cattle fields where guerrilla units camp. And many experts believe that the rebels, unlikely to directly confront thousands of army troops who are positioned to enter this region, may instead stage attacks elsewhere in the country.
"We will attack the economy of the country," said one low-level rebel, explaining that bridges and other infrastructure may become new targets in the rebel campaign to topple Colombia's government.
Adam Isacson, who follows Colombia's war closely for the Center for International Policy in Washington, said that "if you're the FARC right now, you're not thinking of fighting the military in the Caguan," the region the rebels have controlled. 
"You would want to direct your attention to other areas," he said. "Maybe they're thinking about taking out the economy, the electrical grids and all the infrastructure."
The new developments will be watched closely in Washington, where an increasing number of Bush administration officials and members of Congress have come to support a tougher stand against the rebels.
The United States has branded the FARC a terrorist group, since the organization has killed Americans in addition to carrying out widespread kidnappings of Colombians and attacks on civilian centers.
Although the United States policy now prohibits military aid for counterinsurgency operations, an all-out war in this strategically situated country may lead to a renewed debate about the merits of directing aid to battle the insurgents.
The withdrawal of the rebels also creates other problems. For those in this town and other communities in the demilitarized zone, the absence of rebels means a probable infusion of their archenemies, right-wing paramilitary units looking to kill rebel sympathizers.
"Now, the dirty war begins," said a former town official. "Assassinations. Informants. There will be killings here and there."
Although Mr. Pastrana has promised to safeguard civilians, many here doubt the government has the ability or desire to provide protection. Many residents here say the military works hand-in-hand with the paramilitaries, which are outlawed militiamen financed by landowners who despise the rebels.
"We are, of course, terrified," said a 36-year-old woman in the town of San Vicente, who asked that her name not be used. "We think that if we stay, we will be killed. Once the military comes in here, the paramilitaries will come in and begin their work."
Mr. LeMoyne has taken note of the looming danger, telling reporters this morning that he planned to stay in the zone to "demonstrate to the civilian population that we are with them" and to ask the other "armed actors to respect the civilian population."
Residents said they hoped that media attention and the presence of the United Nations would help avert violence. Some families have fled the zone, or melded into more rural areas. Most, though, plan to stay.
Those who believe they are at high risk include grocers and merchants who sold to the rebels, public officials and members of the small, unarmed public security force, which was created at the urging of the rebels.
"We believe we are the biggest targets, because we are in constant contact with the FARC," said Victor Ayala, 54, one of the coordinators of the force here.
The rebels, in their last proposal to the government, had hoped to overcome government objections to earlier demands that the military drop air force flights over the rebel zone and increased patrols and other restrictions just outside it.
In their proposal, the FARC seemed to drop those conditions, and suggested that a special commission examine "threats" on the zone's border. 
Mr. Pastrana, who for three months been trying to get the rebels to talk about a possible cease-fire, said the offer was not enough. He told the nation that the rebel group had until 9:30 p.m. Monday to vacate the zone he had created for them.
"Only a public manifestation in this sense can stop the clock," said Mr. Pastrana, who was under pressure from the army and the public to take a harder line.
Today, the rebels seemed to have the last word, saying the president's deadline "unilaterally changed everything accorded in these three years and subsequently closes the possibilities to the actual process."
Simon Trinidad, a rebel commander, blamed the "constant warmongers" who have put up obstacles "for the possibilities of peace, with social justice."

HEADLINE: A Failure to Account 

 BODY:
Harvey Pitt was recently quoted in Barron's as saying that "there is nothing rotten with the accounting profession." What makes the assessment alarming, instead of just laughable, is that Mr. Pitt is the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Pitt was a prominent Washington litigator who represented Arthur Andersen and other major accounting firms before being appointed to the S.E.C. by President Bush. We can only hope that the latest revelations in the Enron saga will prompt him to change his view and to take on a forceful role in regulating his former clients and protecting the integrity of financial markets. 
 Even within the context of the Enron story, the disclosure by Arthur Andersen that it had destroyed "a significant but undetermined number" of documents relating to its work for Enron was breathtaking. Yet it was only the latest in a series of betrayals of the public trust by major accounting firms. 
 Enron may have been deceitful in recent years, using off-the-books partnerships to exaggerate revenues and hide debt. It was Arthur Andersen, however, that signed off on the energy trading company's deceptive financial reports. Andersen's relationship with Enron has long been cozy, and its eagerness to peddle profitable consulting services may have been another reason why it went easy on the audits. It is awkward enough for auditors to get paid by the companies whose books they must review without creating additional conflicts of interest. Arthur Levitt, the former S.E.C. chairman, sought unsuccessfully to ban such conflicts. The industry resisted.
Disturbingly, Mr. Pitt prefers to be less confrontational and believes accounting firms should be given more freedom to regulate themselves. But the industry has proved unable or unwilling to discipline its own members to any meaningful degree, despite frequent promises to undertake tougher self-regulation and tighter peer review. 
The Enron debacle is exceptional only in its scale. Other former Wall Street favorites have engaged in creative accounting to pump up their stock prices. Lucent, Sunbeam, Waste Management, Xerox and Cendant are only some of the more notorious cases of companies forced to restate previously reported earnings, causing their stock prices to crater. People lost billions of dollars, misled by phony numbers ratified by the accountants. 
The public's trust in the integrity of markets, and in the reliability of companies' disclosed financial data, has been one of America's competitive advantages since the adoption of its security laws in the 1930's. The danger in the wake of Enron and similar scandals is that investors, understandably wary about the safeguards they once relied on, may decide to avoid buying company shares altogether. A majority of Americans are now invested in the stock market, but they will not long participate in a game they know to be rigged against them. 
Justice demands no less than a full accounting in the Enron case. But the nation's economic well-being also demands a broader response from Mr. Pitt and Congress to shore up the credibility of financial markets. Investors, as absentee owners, must be able to trust the information public companies report about their businesses. Buying shares in a company cannot simply be an act of faith.

HEADLINE: The Goal: More Miles Per Gallon 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "U.S. Ends Car Plan on Gas Efficiency; Looks to Fuel Cells" (front page, Jan. 9) contained good news for those of us who support free-market solutions to America's energy needs. While the auto industry has been financing such research without taxpayer help, the money pledged by the Bush administration for fuel cell research certainly beats the fuel-mandates approach, which would destroy jobs, hurt the economy and sacrifice vehicle safety. 
 Mandating outrageously high mileage standards on sport utilities, pickups and minivans, as is currently being discussed in the Senate, is a misguided approach. The technology does not yet exist to make these vehicles run at high fuel-mileage levels, so automakers would have no choice but to drastically alter operations. This would cost thousands of auto jobs. Let's allow the American free market system to meet America's energy needs.

HEADLINE: Growing Pains for Los Angeles' Airport 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
The inauguration of a flight connecting a distant Los Angeles suburb with Hermosillo, a provincial city in Mexico, would not seem cause for toasts and speeches. But Mayor James K. Hahn himself led the festivities recently at the Ontario, Calif., airport, saying he was making a point about the future.
 The Los Angeles mayor used the event to kick-start his plan for resolving what many experts regard as a kind of slow-motion air travel crisis. With Los Angeles International Airport badly overburdened and the communities around it fighting its expansion, the mayor is pushing new routes to the area's smaller airports, like Ontario's. 
 But the real symbolism of the ceremony there may have come when that first Aeromexico flight prepared to depart: only 11 passengers showed up, a clear sign that this airport, about 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, is far from popular.
Even before Sept. 11, the Los Angeles region was facing enormous political and logistical problems with air travel, which is critical to its economic vigor. The terrorism crisis has only made the issue knottier. The sudden need for increased security has made any solution far more expensive. And the number of passengers has plunged since the attacks, creating uncertainty about just what the future needs will be.
Perhaps worse, the concerns over terrorism appear to have sapped whatever will may have existed to face up to local opposition and take the step that many planners prefer, a major expansion of Los Angeles International Airport, known as LAX.
To some, the mayor of a metropolis as sprawling as this one is wise to promote far-flung airports. But the airlines and many people in business say Mr. Hahn's plan is doomed to failure because few want to fly out of the more remote airports like Ontario's. They accuse the mayor of wishfully thinking that other communities will accept what those around LAX are rejecting.
The region around Ontario, an area far to the east known as the Inland Empire, supports expansion as an economic boon. But the linchpin of the mayor's plan is the construction of a big international airport at what was once a major Air Force base at El Toro, in the middle of Orange County.
That plan faces rigid opposition, too, and in March residents will vote for the third time in recent years on a referendum on whether to turn the old base into an airport or a public park. Polls indicate that the park plan will win, potentially leaving the mayor without space for handling the 30 million passengers a year intended for El Toro.
"The pre-Sept. 11 environment wasn't encouraging," said Jack Weiss, a member of the Los Angeles City Council who favors expanding the main airport. "Post-Sept. 11, I think there has been, properly, a shift with the focus on security, not expansion. But the two should not be mutually exclusive."
The mayor's aides say it is a matter of social equity.
"LAX has had to shoulder the bulk of the region's air traffic," said Troy Edwards, a deputy mayor in charge of the airport planning. "It's not fair for the people who live around there, and it's also not economically efficient."
Asked what the city had planned if the El Toro airport is not built, he said nothing.
"The big drop in traffic after September has just made the problem more dangerous," said Steven P. Erie, a professor of urban planning at the University of California at San Diego. "It lulls us into a sense of complacency, a feeling that we won't have to deal with this for another 5 or 10 years. And that just isn't true."
He added: "The problem is air traffic is going to come back. This is a real crisis and it won't go away that easily."
The Southern California Association of Governments, a regional planning body, has said that long-term travel projections should remain largely the same, despite the decline after Sept. 11.
The Los Angeles airport underwent its last major expansion in 1984, for the Olympics. Its capacity then was 40 million passengers a year. In 2001 it handled an estimated 62 million passengers. Under the mayor's plan, it is intended to handle 78 million passengers in 2025.
Even that goal will involve a step-by-step tearing down and rebuilding of most of the terminals. In addition, because the airport is one of the country's most dangerous as measured by near-misses by planes, runways will have to be reconfigured.
Los Angeles' previous mayor, Richard J. Riordan, had proposed expanding LAX to handle nearly 100 million passengers a year. But in the face of local opposition he stopped pressing the issue. In October, Mayor Hahn officially announced that his focus would be on security rather than expansion.
The real growth in regional capacity is expected to come at Ontario and El Toro, under the mayor's proposal. Ontario's current traffic of about 6 million passengers a year is expected to grow to 30 million a year by 2025. El Toro would also be built to handle 30 million passengers a year.
The benefit, proponents say, is that it would move the airport capacity closer to places where the population is shifting, particularly the Inland Empire.
Airline executives dismiss this notion as fanciful. They argue that travelers prefer large hubs because they offer more flights and more airlines.
"At the end of the day, people fly where they want to fly," said Michael Whitaker, a vice president for governmental affairs at United Airlines, the biggest carrier at Los Angeles. If the airport congestion in Los Angeles gets worse and routes get pushed to the more remote airports, he added, many flyers will go to San Francisco, Phoenix or even Denver.
Many here hope that the El Toro vote in March will settle the issue. But there are already signs that the planning headaches may not end then. Opponents of that airport have vowed to fight in the courts as long as it takes to kill it.
"If the vote fails?" asked Larry Agran, the mayor of Irvine and one of the staunchest opponents of El Toro. "I think we'd be in trench warfare for another 20 years."

HEADLINE: AMID FISCAL CRISIS, MEDICAID IS FACING CUTS FROM STATES 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR and ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Medicaid, the insurance program for 44 million low-income people, is in a fiscal crisis, forcing state legislatures convening around the country this month to look for ways to cut benefits and reduce payments to hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacies.
 The 36-year-old program, which pays for one-third of all births and nearly two-thirds of all nursing home patients, is caught in the financial vise of soaring costs and declining state revenues. 
 Overall Medicaid spending grew by 11 percent last year, and many states report that spending on prescription drugs, which are covered by Medicaid, is rising at an annual rate of more than 20 percent.
At the same time, state revenues are declining because of the national recession, and most states, unlike the federal government, must balance their budgets.
"I think it's quite serious," said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican who is chairman of the National Governors Association, noting that Medicaid now represented the fastest-growing item in state budgets. States are struggling to decide which services to trim and which groups should bear the brunt. 
"These are terrible choices," Mr. Engler said, "extraordinarily difficult." 
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat and former chairman of the governors association, agreed, saying that Medicaid was "under enormous pressure everywhere because of the catastrophic increase in health care costs, particularly pharmaceutical costs and hospital costs."
The political fallout has already begun. Parents of children with severe illnesses and disabilities held a rally on Wednesday at the Capitol in Little Rock, Ark., to protest new cuts in Medicaid and requirements that families pay some of the costs in the form of co-payments.
Ray Hanley, the Medicaid director in Arkansas, said, "We are getting our brains beat out by health care providers and advocates" for patients who rely on the program.
C. J. Moorman, the father of a Medicaid patient, a 16-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, said, "They could easily co-pay a family to death."
Governors of both parties are putting pressure on the federal government to increase its contribution to Medicaid, which is financed by the federal government and the states.
The need is particularly acute in a recession, officials say, because many people turn to Medicaid when they lose their jobs and their health insurance. 
"The need for Medicaid goes up just when the states' ability to pay for it goes down," said Vernon K. Smith, the former Medicaid director of Michigan, who is now a health policy consultant.
The situation in Oklahoma illustrates the hard choices facing many states. The board of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, the state Medicaid agency, voted on Thursday to adopt stricter income tests for pregnant women, children and the elderly, blind and disabled; to reduce dental services for adults; to reduce payments for prescription drugs; and to delay indefinitely a scheduled increase of 3 percent in payments to hospitals and doctors. The state also decided to eliminate its Medicaid program for people deemed "medically needy" because of very high medical bills.
The cuts will affect at least 50,000 of the 461,000 Medicaid recipients in Oklahoma. Under the new policy, for example, Medicaid will no longer cover children 6 to 18 in families with incomes that are 100 percent to 185 percent of the federal poverty level ($14,631 to $27,065 for a family of three).
In Indiana, Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon, a Democrat, is trying to cut the state contribution to Medicaid by $251 million, or about 10 percent, over the next two years. State officials made a first round of cuts last fall, reducing payments to hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacies by about 5 percent. The nursing homes and drugstores filed suit to block the cuts. At a forum this month, state officials unveiled a "Medicaid balanced budget plan" with two dozen options for further cuts.
Prescription drug spending for Medicaid recipients in Indiana grew 20 percent last year, to $549 million, and state officials estimate that it will rise more than 50 percent in the next two years, to $845 million.
To control costs, Indiana officials will develop a list of "preferred drugs" and want to require prior authorization for anyone trying to fill prescriptions for more than four brand-name drugs in a month.
In Idaho, Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, a Republican, told the State Legislature on Wednesday: "Prescription drugs are quickly becoming our single largest Medicaid expense. Prescriptions are expected to cost almost 40 percent more this year than they did two years ago." He, too, wants to require prior authorization. But drug companies oppose such requirements, saying they limit patients' access to medicines.
Like many governors, Mr. Kempthorne lamented that Medicaid was taking resources that might be used for other programs. If the state does nothing, he said, "we will see Medicaid growth that continues to outpace that of education and economic development."
In Maine, Gov. Angus King, an independent, proposed on Tuesday a 5.6 percent cut in Medicaid payments to doctors, with slightly deeper cuts for hospitals and nursing homes. Doctors said some Medicaid patients would inevitably be turned away if the Legislature approved the cuts.
Governor Dean of Vermont, a state that takes pride in its health policies, said he was committed to controlling Medicaid costs by reducing benefits, like podiatry or dental coverage, but not the number of people eligible for basic insurance coverage. He said it made no sense to preserve a generous benefit package for fewer and fewer people.
In his State of the State address on Tuesday, Mr. Dean declared, "As I have said annually for the past decade, I will not allow any child to be cut from the health care rolls."
New York has felt the same fiscal pressures as other states, but with special intensity. The state has lost hundreds of millions in tax revenue as a result of damage done to its economy by the Sept. 11 attacks. Layoffs increased the number of people without health insurance, and many turned to a special temporary program known as disaster-relief Medicaid, which makes benefits available with little screening or paperwork.
Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, has led the bipartisan effort by governors to persuade Congress to provide billions of dollars in additional aid for Medicaid.
In Illinois, Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, announced last month that he was cutting state Medicaid payments to hospitals by $114 million, or 13 percent, to help fill a $500 million gap in the state budget. After an outcry by hospital executives, Mr. Ryan said on Tuesday that he would restore $24 million to hospitals.
To help pay for the restorations, Illinois officials said they would reduce Medicaid payments to doctors, dentists, chiropractors and other health care professionals.
Ohio's Medicaid director, Barbara Coulter Edwards, said the state had expected to see a net increase of about 43,000 in its Medicaid rolls from July to December. The actual increase, driven by the recession, was 84,000, raising the total number of recipients to 1.4 million. "While our service budget has not been cut, for which we're grateful, we have a real challenge because we're having to serve more people within it," Ms. Edwards said.
Advocates for low-income people are already sounding alarms here in Washington, arguing that Congress and the administration must confront the problem or face renewed growth in the number of uninsured. "I think this is going to be a very tough year for low-income and low-wage working families who depend on Medicaid as a lifeline," said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group.
In recent years, Medicaid has been an important tool for extending coverage to children and families. In fact, state officials said, their success in adding people to the Medicaid rolls, encouraged by the federal government, is one reason the program is such a burden on states today.
Medicaid provides health insurance for one-fifth of all children and is the largest source of federal grants to states, accounting for nearly one-fifth of state budgets.

HEADLINE: Kelly Seeks Incentives to Stem Police Exodus 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER and KEVIN FLYNN

 BODY:
In an effort to stem the flow of officers leaving the New York Police Department, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly is preparing to ask the Legislature to allow officers some retirement benefits while still on the job.
Officials are alarmed that despite adulation for the police after Sept. 11, an exodus continues in part because of low pay, attractive job opportunities in the private sector and a pension mechanism that is making retirement irresistible because of vast amounts of overtime logged in recent months.
 Twice as many police officers retired in 2001 as in 2000, police officials said. Their reasons varied, but the most significant seem to be a growing dissatisfaction with salary levels. The annual base salary for a beginning officer in the city is $31,305, which lags behind such places as Suffolk County and Los Angeles by roughly $10,000. 
Mr. Kelly's proposals, which come two weeks into his second tour as New York's police commissioner, underscore how seriously he considers the need to slow attrition within the department, an issue that has been vexing city officials for much of the past two years. 
"I need to get a better sense of what works and what doesn't work, what do we go forward with," Mr. Kelly said.
Officials in Albany said they were happy to keep an open mind about any solutions Mr. Kelly might offer.
In an interview, Mr. Kelly said he was still refining his proposals, given what he is learning in meeting with officers, union leaders and commanders. He outlined several options that, he said, he was seriously considering, including allowing officers who have the 20 years of service necessary for retirement to use their highest-earning year as the basis for their pension even if it was not their last year on the force.
Mr. Kelly did not provide cost estimates for his proposals but he acknowledged that they might have potentially limiting budget implications. "There are things I would like to see done that at the end of the day may not be able to be done," he said. 
The commissioner also called for quick and decisive support among lawmakers during this session, hopefully within a month. "Ideally, I would like to see something sooner than that," he said.
A spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki cited the governor's "great respect for Commissioner Kelly," and said, "We look forward to hearing his ideas."
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said through a spokesman that "if the city believes legislation is needed, we would consider it."
Under the city pension system, after 20 years of service, uniformed police officers are entitled to a pension equal to half of their gross earnings, including overtime, in their last year on the force. With tax breaks and a special pension bonus of about $10,000 a year, that can come close to an officer's take-home pay before retirement.
Overtime opportunities increased greatly for police officers in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, and in many cases, veteran officers have seen their paychecks grow by as much as 20 percent. The higher earning would translate into pensions more lucrative than they ever expected, if they retire now.
Mr. Kelly said that the impact of overtime on retirement deepened because of a decision in the last days of the Giuliani administration to pay overtime to captains and above. Traditionally, officers of that rank did not get overtime.
He did not rule out seeking approval for more than one of the several options he is considering. Among these are allowing officers eligible for retirement to begin collecting an annual pension bonus, known as the defined benefit, even if they choose not to retire. A variation on this would allow 20-year veterans to put the pension bonus into an investment-only escrow account that could not be drawn on until retirement. Such an account would be subject to market fluctuation.
Mr. Kelly said he was also studying the feasibility of asking lawmakers to allow officers to put their entire monthly pension benefit into an escrow account while they continue to work past 20 years. Known as the Deferred Retirement Option, or Drop Plan, this would allow officers to collect their pension and their salary. Presumably, they would invest the pension, allowing them to have a nest egg of as much as a half-million dollars or more upon retirement. 
One senior police official said that the commissioner has talked of hiring an outside firm to survey the 40,000-member force to find out what incentives might persuade officers not to retire. The consultant would also study retention methods used by other police departments.
For the last few years, a booming economy has drawn officers in droves into higher-paying private-sector jobs in New York and across the country.
In New York, though, the problem has been particularly acute, in part because of the pay scale but also because of a sense among officers that the public did not appreciate them in the aftermath of two particularly painful incidents: the 1999 killing of a West African street peddler, Amadou Diallo, by police officers in the Bronx, and the 1997 torture of a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, in a Brooklyn station house.
The departures have been compounded by the difficulties the city has had finding new recruits.
Reaction among union leaders to Mr. Kelly's proposals varied.
"I think all these ideas are decent ideas, but what is happening is it is being done piecemeal," said Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents 29,000 members. "The main problem that has to be fixed is the salary issue. We have to give our members a decent livable wage."
A total of 807 officers, nearly a quarter of the 3,776 who resigned or retired last year, had less than five years on the job, officials said.
Some in the Police Department say many officers leave the force at the minimum age because they cannot afford to pay their bills. These officers fear that any proposal that allows pension funds to be deferred -- paid out and invested, but not collected -- until officers retire will not help greatly with retention.
But the head of the union that represents 30,000 law-enforcement officers around the State of Florida said its deferred retirement program has made officers and government officials happy.
"It's win, win, for both sides," said Ernie W. George, the president of the Florida Police Benevolent Association and a police sergeant in West Palm Beach.
Thomas J. Scotto, the president of the union that represents detectives in the New York Police Department, said he favored the proposals Mr. Kelly is considering and has supported such issues for years. "The incentive is, 'Don't let them lose it,' " Mr. Scotto said. "Let them stay active. Pay them as they stay active."
Not everyone is convinced that the loss of officers through attrition would have dire consequences. With crime down significantly over the past decade, some believe that New York, which still has among the most police officers per capita of the nation's largest cities, can afford a smaller force, especially given its looming budget problems.
 "No one has proven that you need 40,000 cops to sustain the city's low crime rate," said Harvey Robins, who was the director of the mayor's office of operations under Mayor David N. Dinkins.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE HOMETOWN; 
Fall of Enron Ends Its Dance With Houston

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
The bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, which has cost more than 4,000 local employees their jobs and reverberated around the world, has also been painful for the Houston Ballet. Enron contributed to the ballet, including a donation for a recent charity performance of "The Nutcracker" for poor children.
 But a $15,000 payment from Enron arrived on a Friday, the company filed for bankruptcy two days later and the Houston Ballet found itself holding a worthless check. "We were hopeful, but it didn't clear," said Randy Penn, a ballet administrator. "Now we're in line with the other creditors." 
 The collapse of Enron, which erupted into a full-blown scandal last week, is rippling steadily through its stunned hometown, Houston. The company had been a civic dynamo whose influence and money were felt in almost every corner of the city. So as the investigations into possible corporate malfeasance consume Washington, the unanswered question in Houston is how much economic and civic damage will be wrought by Enron's fall.
Only a few months ago, Enron was the corporate gold standard in Houston. Its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, once was chairman of the local United Way. The professional baseball stadium was named Enron Field, after the company pledged $100 million over 30 years for the rights. Motorists stalled downtown in rush hour could see the company's new silver skyscraper rising on Smith Street.
These days, no one considers it good news that the layoffs have eased traffic.
"There's a big void, and who fills it and how they fill it are valid questions," said Paul Hobby, who runs an investment firm and whose family has long been influential in Houston. "There is this vacuum, this 'king is dead' feeling."
Mr. Hobby and other business leaders say they do not believe that Enron's demise foreshadows the sort of larger economic pain that gripped Houston after the collapse of oil prices in the 1980's. But there will be pain.
Besides $50,000 a year to the Houston Ballet, Enron gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Alley Theatre and other cultural institutions. Rare was the fund-raising drive that did not get some sort of Enron contribution, and Enron employees regularly volunteered at KIPP Academy, the charter school serving underprivileged children that was often praised by President Bush. 
For laid-off employees, many of whom are furious at company executives, the financial and emotional strain cannot be overstated; one fired Enron worker recently canceled his cancer surgery because the company had not arranged for health coverage for former workers to continue. The feelings of betrayal voiced by employees are visceral; while laid-off workers were given a $4,500 severance, other executives were given six- and seven-figure bonuses to stay.
"My husband gave his guts to that company for five and a half years," said one Enron wife, who asked that she not be named. "He worked his tail off to fulfill the duties he had to do with Enron. How many family vacations did he not go to? And we got left with nothing."
Allan Sommer, 40, was recruited by Enron two years earlier, taking a job as a vice president overseeing a technology division. So on Dec. 3, the day of the layoffs known locally as Black Monday, he called 220 of his employees into a company auditorium and delivered the bitter news. He even asked his wife to come down to lend him emotional support. Then, a week later, he was notified that he had been let go, too.
"I felt like I had a 'stupid' sign on my head," Mr. Sommer recalled. "I was so blinded by my dedication to the company that I didn't see it coming."
Like so many others, Mr. Sommer's finances have been devastated. He had rolled his 401(k) program from his previous company into Enron's retirement plan and chosen to invest it in the company's once-soaring stock. As the stock plummeted in recent months, Enron executives prohibited employees from removing their retirement money; the stock now trades at less than $1.
Mr. Sommer remains an optimist and had his first job interview last Friday, but he realizes that the clock is ticking: He has enough money to last until March. Others, he says, have it worse.
From his 43rd floor downtown office, Bill White can see the Enron towers through his window, and lately he has also been seeing ex-Enron employees looking for work. There was the young man now disillusioned with the corporate world. There was the old man who had been nearing retirement but now had to find work because he had lost everything.
"By the end of the conversations, my work as a Sunday school teacher was more important than any business counseling that I could give them," said Mr. White, president and chief executive of the Wedge Group, an investment firm. 
Even as Houston has suffered from other recent layoffs and felt the brunt of the national recession, Mr. White and the rest of the city's corporate leadership remain confident that the local economy will recover. But he agreed that it could stall, if only temporarily, the city's downtown revitalization boom because many Enron employees were the type of young professionals who have been buying the new lofts and townhouses. At least seven of the new restaurants downtown have closed.
The breadth of Enron's roots in Houston became evident last week when the city's entire United States attorney's office removed itself from the criminal investigation into the company because of family or other relationships with Enron employees. United States Attorney Michael Shelby has a brother-in-law who is a lawyer for Enron, while at least two lawyers in his office's fraud division are married to Enron employees.
Local real estate agents say it is too soon to know how deeply the bankruptcy will ripple into the housing market, since many Enron workers are searching for new jobs and hoping not to move. The city government has already sponsored a job fair for former Enron employees, as has the company. The Houston Opera announced it would grant free season ticket renewals for the nearly 100 Enron employees who had held tickets. And as another symbol of changed fortunes, the high-end toy store F. A. O. Schwarz offered discounted prices to laid-off Enron employees during the holiday season.
One Episcopal church, Palmer Memorial, has created a special support group since the Enron layoffs. The church's rector, the Rev. James Nutter, recalled that last summer congregants who worked at Enron approached him with concerns about the company's business culture. After one church member was let go in August, Mr. Nutter said he wrote a letter to Enron's chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, whom he had never met. As it turned out, Mr. Skilling resigned within a week.
And Mr. Nutter never mailed the letter. He filed it away after his secretary told him it was too heated.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
A Bubble No One Wanted to Pop

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
What the world is now awakening to is that the Enron Corporation was not much of a company, but its executives made sure that it was one hell of a stock. 
 In recent years, Enron came to exemplify the productivity miracle that new technologies were thought to have bestowed on astute companies across America. Now in bankruptcy, with the odor of scandal all around it, Enron, once an innovative energy company, has instead become an indictment of the anything-goes approach to business that characterized the late 1990's. The bull market euphoria convinced analysts, investors, accountants and even regulators that as long as stock prices stayed high, there was no need to question company practices. 
 "Enron is the prime example of all the things that were allowed to go wrong during the stock market mania," said William Fleckenstein, president of Fleckenstein Capital, a money management firm in Seattle. "This wall got built brick by brick in broad daylight in the 1990's by companies doing whatever they had to do to make their numbers, being willing to sacrifice the long-term well-being of the company so that the executives could get rich." 
And the Enron insiders became rich indeed. Thanks largely to munificent stock option grants, which they turned into shares, they sold $1.1 billion worth of stock from 1999 to mid-2001. 
Mostly on the strength of the highflying shares, Enron executives were able to convince investors, bankers, analysts, accountants, debt-rating agencies and even Enron's own employees that its promise was real, its financial results genuine and its growth never-ending. Never mind that the way it accounted for trades, as is common at energy trading companies, made its revenues appear to be far larger than the economic reality of its business.
Now the spotlight in the Enron follies is trained on the nation's capital. But the story of the company's rise and fall, and the retirement savings its workers lost, inevitably leads back to Wall Street.
Enron's executives were surely smart enough to know that once they had convinced bankers, brokers and accountants of the company's strength, all parties could pretty much be counted on to keep the myth of solidity alive, even after problems arose. When questions were first raised about partnerships that should have been listed in financial statements, true believers could be relied on to drown out naysayers.
Naturally, given the millions of dollars Wall Street firms generated selling Enron's shares and bonds to investors, analysts were among the most vociferous defenders of the company, even after its stock began to fall. David N. Fleischer, who followed Enron for Goldman, Sachs, recommended it until Oct. 17, the day after Enron disclosed that it had lost $618 million in the most recent quarter and that because earlier financial statements had been inaccurate, it was lopping $1.2 billion off its net worth. Even with the stock at 68 cents, Mr. Fleischer currently rates Enron a market performer. 
Across town at Lehman Brothers, Richard Gross continues to rate Enron a strong buy. Raymond C. Niles at Salomon Smith Barney did change his rating on Enron from buy to neutral, but not until Oct. 26, when the stock closed at $15.40. During the previous 12 months, Enron had traded as high as $84.63.
Of course, if a company wants to mislead its investors, analysts and accountants, there is probably little that can be done to stop it. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, has said that it was misled. 
But what is becoming evident about Enron is the decidedly ephemeral nature of its operations and its revenues. Beginning as a mundane natural gas pipeline company in the 1980's, Enron had morphed into a financial services firm by the late 1990's. It traded things like oil, but created new markets to trade oddities like weather and bandwidth. 
Because Enron operated in a largely unregulated arena and because of the way energy trading firms are allowed to account for their operations, the company recorded revenue that made the economic status of its business appear larger than it really was. Under accounting rules, when an energy trading company trades electricity or gas, it can count as revenues the whole amount of every transaction rather than simply the profit or loss, as a brokerage firm does.
It is similar to the way Priceline .com counted as revenues the whole sale price of plane tickets sold online rather than just commissions, as traditional travel agents do.
That is largely how Enron, a relative newcomer to the trading of commodities and related financial instruments, was able to produce $101 billion of revenue in 2000, up from $40 billion in 1999. By comparison, Goldman, Sachs, a highly regulated firm with a long history of trading in the field, generated $6.5 billion in trading revenue last year. 
Enron appears to have done nothing wrong in accounting for trading revenues, unlike its almost certainly improper accounting for dealings with entities off its balance sheets. But the larger-than-life revenue numbers allowed Enron's executives and other advocates to promote the idea that its operations were far grander than they were, worthy of a ranking near the top of the Fortune 500.
To a Wall Street obsessed not with earnings but with revenue growth, the performance propelled Enron's shares into the stratosphere, enriching executives and investors. "The way these revenues were accounted for at Enron essentially made them pro forma revenues, which have little basis in reality," one institutional money manager said. "Yet the size of the revenues allowed the company to expand its balance sheet by piling on debt. That is why the company unraveled so quickly."
The moment that rival trading firms and other customers at Enron began to lose confidence in the company, its business dried up. But its onerous debt of at least $31 billion remained, forcing it to make the largest bankruptcy filing in United States history. 
Mr. Fleckenstein and some other investors are concerned that other bombs like Enron's may be ticking, but that investors will have little help in spotting them before they blow. The combination of aggressive accounting -- like Enron's method of shifting big obligations off its balance sheet -- and a conflicted auditing firm, he said, are not limited to Enron. Aggressive accounting has become much more common in recent years, and as auditors have increased their consulting business among the companies whose books they vet, their willingness to sign off on debatable practices has grown. 
And as investors know only too well, analysts on Wall Street cannot be relied upon to dig deeply into companies' books. Eager to help their firms generate business selling securities to investors -- and reap their own rewards in bonuses -- Wall Street analysts have made a habit of missing corporate misdeeds altogether or ignoring what they see.
"Enron proves how meaningless financial statements have become," Mr. Fleckenstein said. "Until someone makes sure that financial statements have meaning, we will never get this problem behind us."

HEADLINE: A Consultant May Determine Hewlett Deal 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The next arena in the fight for the future of Hewlett-Packard is an unlikely one -- the offices in Rockville, Md., of Institutional Shareholder Services.
 Ram Kumar, Patrick S. McGurn and a handful of other analysts at Institutional Shareholder Services are scheduled to receive visits over the next few weeks from both the leading champions and the foremost critics of Hewlett-Packard's proposed merger with Compaq Computer. 
 Carleton S. Fiorina and Michael D. Capellas, the chief executives, respectively, of Hewlett and Compaq, joined by a couple of advisers and board members, will try to persuade I.S.S., a proxy voting consultant, that combining the two computer makers is a sound strategic step. And the dissident Hewlett-Packard director, Walter B. Hewlett, and his advisers will present the case that the merger plan is a bad one. 
After listening to both sides, I.S.S. will issue a recommendation to its hundreds of institutional clients for or against the deal. Its decision, expected two to three weeks before the vote on the merger, could be crucial, perhaps determining the deal's fate. That is because the company is such an influential adviser to institutional shareholders -- pension funds, investment managers and mutual funds -- and those institutions hold an estimated 57 percent of Hewlett-Packard's shares.
"As an institutional investor, if you're voting against I.S.S., you had better have some darn good reason," said Richard H. Koppes, former general counsel of the nation's largest pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers. Mr. Koppes was the general counsel of Calpers from 1986 to 1996, and he watched the influence of I.S.S. rise as institutional shareholders came to own larger and larger stakes in major corporations. Today, Mr. Koppes is a lawyer at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, and he advises companies on questions of corporate governance. 
In contested mergers or proxy fights for control of a corporate board, the rival sides often make pilgrimages to Rockville, Md., to woo I.S.S. -- just as they are doing in the Hewlett-Packard case. "They go in groups, and they kiss the ring," Mr. Koppes remarked. 
The advisory firm's recommendation, of course, will not sway all institutional shareholders. Some institutions -- particularly index funds, which buy a company's shares based on its proportionate size in the stock market -- delegate voting on proxy issues, including mergers, to I.S.S. But others, especially funds whose managers carefully study individual companies before investing, will note the Institutional Shareholder Services recommendation, but will make their own assessment of the merger.
An internal analysis at Hewlett-Packard found that as many as 20 percent of all shareholders would have their votes on the merger influenced or determined by the recommendation of I.S.S. And yet, a report last Friday by A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, estimated that only 8 or 9 percent of Hewlett's shareholders -- the index portion of the institutional investors -- would have their votes determined by the recommendation.
One of Hewlett-Packard's largest shareholders, Barclays Global Investors, which holds more than 3 percent of Hewlett shares, has already said that I.S.S. will vote its shares. Barclays made the announcement to remove any appearance of a conflict of interest, since Patricia C. Dunn, co-chairwoman of Barclays Global, is on Hewlett-Packard's board.
If Institutional Shareholder Services opposes the merger, the deal -- and the tenure of Ms. Fiorina, whose reputation is tied to the Compaq acquisition -- would appear to be in danger. It would represent a second unnerving setback, after the heirs of the Hewlett-Packard founders said they would vote their stock and that held by family foundations, totaling 18 percent, against the merger. 
I.S.S., founded in 1985, grew to be the largest firm in the field of corporate governance. The field traces its roots to the 1970's, when social activists organized to prod universities and foundations into selling or avoiding the shares of companies that did business in South Africa. They formed the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington, and began pursuing a broader agenda of opening up the governance of public corporations in the name of "shareholder democracy."
I.S.S. was founded by one of the early corporate governance advocates, Robert A. G. Monks. And both Jamie Heard, its current chief executive, and Mr. McGurn, vice president and director of corporate programs, worked at the Investor Responsibility Research Center.
The professionals in the corporate governance field typically have backgrounds in law and politics. Mr. McGurn, for example, is a graduate of the Georgetown law school, and he worked previously as an aide to former Senator Paul Laxalt, Republican of Nevada, and on the staff of the Republican National Committee. Of the corporate governance field, Mr. McGurn said, "It's definitely the collision of law, finance and politics."
While there are many corporate governance consultants, Institutional Shareholder Services is the leading proxy adviser, making recommendations on thousands of company initiatives. Last year, it merged with its largest rival, Proxy Monitor, so the combined firm has even more power and 270 employees.
Mr. Kumar, a 32-year-old lawyer, is the lead analyst on the Hewlett-Compaq deal. He is working with a team that, in addition to Mr. McGurn, includes Shirley Westcott, Steve Sears, Edward Seaton, Bemal Patel and Vittorio Lara, all analysts. 
The decision-making process at I.S.S. is consensual. "But Ram is honchoing the project and his name will appear on the report," Mr. McGurn said.
The report, Mr. Kumar said, will probably run more than 20 pages. In contested mergers, he said, I.S.S. examines broad sets of questions. First is the governance issue of how the board decided to pursue the merger. Was the board thorough and careful in weighing the deal and the alternatives? Was there open debate?
In this case, Mr. Kumar said, there seem to be no contentions that the process by which the decision was made had been flawed. Instead, he said, Mr. Hewlett and other opponents of the merger maintain that the economics do not make sense. "That's the crux of the issue here," he said.
And so the relevant questions include: Is the price too high? Are big mergers in the computer industry inherently too risky? What are the prospects of the combined company?
The guiding principle of any I.S.S. analysis, Mr. Kumar said, is whether a deal is likely to be good for shareholders over the coming two to five years. In the end, that is a tough judgment call -- and one that greatly depends on trends in technology and the competitive strengths and prospects of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq as a combined company or separately.
Does I.S.S. have the ability to make a well-informed judgment on technology? "I'm not an engineer," Mr. Kumar said. "We're laymen as far as technology goes. But I would argue we're intelligent laymen, and we're educating ourselves now."
For the last several weeks, and for the next month or so, he has been freed up from most other duties to focus on the Hewlett-Compaq deal. He has been bombarded with reports from stock analysts and presentations by the advisers from both sides.
And "we get to meet directly with the principals," Mr. Kumar said, "and that is the most valuable."

Wall Street Role Examined In the Rise and Fall of Enron
The collapse of the Enron Corporation promises to keep investors, lawmakers and corporate executives mesmerized for months to come.
 While the spotlight is now trained on the nation's capitol, the story of Enron's rise and almost instantaneous fall inevitably leads back to Wall Street and the obsession with stock market gains that characterized the late 1990's. News Analysis. Section A. 

A Vision of the Office of the Future
I.B.M. and Steelcase, the furniture company, will introduce today their model "smart office."

Key Vote for New Switzerland Airline
The effort to organize a new national airline for Switzerland passed a crucial test when voters in Zurich agreed to invest $181 million in Crossair, the company set to absorb the bankrupt flag carrier Swissair. The vote is part of the country's ambitious plan to reclaim its aviation prestige. C6.

Time's Exclusive Deal With Apple
When timecanada.com published Time's account of the new iMac computer a week ago Sunday night, and then pulled the article a few hours later, the site made it excruciatingly clear that there was indeed an exclusive deal between Apple Computer and the magazine. By the time Steven P. Jobs put his new iMac on display last Monday, the magazine and Josh Quittner, the author of a feverishly positive article, were the villains of the moment for journalists and Mac fans. Media. C2.

Dominating the Documentaries
Of the 16 documentaries competing at the Sundance Film Festival, five were produced by HBO, including "The Execution of Wanda Jean," about a woman on death row, left; five by the Independent Television Service for PBS; and one by "The American Experience" for PBS.

Robust Holiday Book Sales at Chains
Barnes & Noble and Borders reported unexpectedly strong sales during the holiday season, after months of dismal book sales. But their reports also suggested that the rising tide might not have lifted the biggest ships as high as it did the smallest. C7.

Newspapers Turn to Paid Obituaries
The notion of selling obituaries, often while keeping them typographically indistinguishable from regular news, was first adopted by a few small newspapers nearly two decades ago. Now larger newspapers have adopted the practice as paid obituaries accelerated last year, while advertising revenue fell and newsprint prices increased. C7.

ABC Executives Concede Missteps
A few days after the departure of Stu Bloomberg, the ABC co-chairman, network executives acknowledged that they made some major miscalculations the last two years that resulted in a surprisingly weak performance this television season. C8.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE HOMETOWN; 
Fall of Enron Ends Its Dance With Houston

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
The bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, which has cost more than 4,000 local employees their jobs and reverberated around the world, has also been painful for the Houston Ballet. Enron contributed to the ballet, including a donation for a recent charity performance of "The Nutcracker" for poor children.
 But a $15,000 payment from Enron arrived on a Friday, the company filed for bankruptcy two days later and the Houston Ballet found itself holding a worthless check. "We were hopeful, but it didn't clear," said Randy Penn, a ballet administrator. "Now we're in line with the other creditors." 
 The collapse of Enron, which erupted into a full-blown scandal last week, is rippling steadily through its stunned hometown, Houston. The company had been a civic dynamo whose influence and money were felt in almost every corner of the city. So as the investigations into possible corporate malfeasance consume Washington, the unanswered question in Houston is how much economic and civic damage will be wrought by Enron's fall.
Only a few months ago, Enron was the corporate gold standard in Houston. Its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, once was chairman of the local United Way. The professional baseball stadium was named Enron Field, after the company pledged $100 million over 30 years for the rights. Motorists stalled downtown in rush hour could see the company's new silver skyscraper rising on Smith Street.
These days, no one considers it good news that the layoffs have eased traffic.
"There's a big void, and who fills it and how they fill it are valid questions," said Paul Hobby, who runs an investment firm and whose family has long been influential in Houston. "There is this vacuum, this 'king is dead' feeling."
Mr. Hobby and other business leaders say they do not believe that Enron's demise foreshadows the sort of larger economic pain that gripped Houston after the collapse of oil prices in the 1980's. But there will be pain.
Besides $50,000 a year to the Houston Ballet, Enron gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Alley Theatre and other cultural institutions. Rare was the fund-raising drive that did not get some sort of Enron contribution, and Enron employees regularly volunteered at KIPP Academy, the charter school serving underprivileged children that was often praised by President Bush. 
For laid-off employees, many of whom are furious at company executives, the financial and emotional strain cannot be overstated; one fired Enron worker recently canceled his cancer surgery because the company had not arranged for health coverage for former workers to continue. The feelings of betrayal voiced by employees are visceral; while laid-off workers were given a $4,500 severance, other executives were given six- and seven-figure bonuses to stay.
"My husband gave his guts to that company for five and a half years," said one Enron wife, who asked that she not be named. "He worked his tail off to fulfill the duties he had to do with Enron. How many family vacations did he not go to? And we got left with nothing."
Allan Sommer, 40, was recruited by Enron two years earlier, taking a job as a vice president overseeing a technology division. So on Dec. 3, the day of the layoffs known locally as Black Monday, he called 220 of his employees into a company auditorium and delivered the bitter news. He even asked his wife to come down to lend him emotional support. Then, a week later, he was notified that he had been let go, too.
"I felt like I had a 'stupid' sign on my head," Mr. Sommer recalled. "I was so blinded by my dedication to the company that I didn't see it coming."
Like so many others, Mr. Sommer's finances have been devastated. He had rolled his 401(k) program from his previous company into Enron's retirement plan and chosen to invest it in the company's once-soaring stock. As the stock plummeted in recent months, Enron executives prohibited employees from removing their retirement money; the stock now trades at less than $1.
Mr. Sommer remains an optimist and had his first job interview last Friday, but he realizes that the clock is ticking: He has enough money to last until March. Others, he says, have it worse.
From his 43rd floor downtown office, Bill White can see the Enron towers through his window, and lately he has also been seeing ex-Enron employees looking for work. There was the young man now disillusioned with the corporate world. There was the old man who had been nearing retirement but now had to find work because he had lost everything.
"By the end of the conversations, my work as a Sunday school teacher was more important than any business counseling that I could give them," said Mr. White, president and chief executive of the Wedge Group, an investment firm. 
Even as Houston has suffered from other recent layoffs and felt the brunt of the national recession, Mr. White and the rest of the city's corporate leadership remain confident that the local economy will recover. But he agreed that it could stall, if only temporarily, the city's downtown revitalization boom because many Enron employees were the type of young professionals who have been buying the new lofts and townhouses. At least seven of the new restaurants downtown have closed.
The breadth of Enron's roots in Houston became evident last week when the city's entire United States attorney's office removed itself from the criminal investigation into the company because of family or other relationships with Enron employees. United States Attorney Michael Shelby has a brother-in-law who is a lawyer for Enron, while at least two lawyers in his office's fraud division are married to Enron employees.
Local real estate agents say it is too soon to know how deeply the bankruptcy will ripple into the housing market, since many Enron workers are searching for new jobs and hoping not to move. The city government has already sponsored a job fair for former Enron employees, as has the company. The Houston Opera announced it would grant free season ticket renewals for the nearly 100 Enron employees who had held tickets. And as another symbol of changed fortunes, the high-end toy store F. A. O. Schwarz offered discounted prices to laid-off Enron employees during the holiday season.
One Episcopal church, Palmer Memorial, has created a special support group since the Enron layoffs. The church's rector, the Rev. James Nutter, recalled that last summer congregants who worked at Enron approached him with concerns about the company's business culture. After one church member was let go in August, Mr. Nutter said he wrote a letter to Enron's chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, whom he had never met. As it turned out, Mr. Skilling resigned within a week.
And Mr. Nutter never mailed the letter. He filed it away after his secretary told him it was too heated.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
A Bubble No One Wanted to Pop

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
What the world is now awakening to is that the Enron Corporation was not much of a company, but its executives made sure that it was one hell of a stock. 
 In recent years, Enron came to exemplify the productivity miracle that new technologies were thought to have bestowed on astute companies across America. Now in bankruptcy, with the odor of scandal all around it, Enron, once an innovative energy company, has instead become an indictment of the anything-goes approach to business that characterized the late 1990's. The bull market euphoria convinced analysts, investors, accountants and even regulators that as long as stock prices stayed high, there was no need to question company practices. 
 "Enron is the prime example of all the things that were allowed to go wrong during the stock market mania," said William Fleckenstein, president of Fleckenstein Capital, a money management firm in Seattle. "This wall got built brick by brick in broad daylight in the 1990's by companies doing whatever they had to do to make their numbers, being willing to sacrifice the long-term well-being of the company so that the executives could get rich." 
And the Enron insiders became rich indeed. Thanks largely to munificent stock option grants, which they turned into shares, they sold $1.1 billion worth of stock from 1999 to mid-2001. 
Mostly on the strength of the highflying shares, Enron executives were able to convince investors, bankers, analysts, accountants, debt-rating agencies and even Enron's own employees that its promise was real, its financial results genuine and its growth never-ending. Never mind that the way it accounted for trades, as is common at energy trading companies, made its revenues appear to be far larger than the economic reality of its business.
Now the spotlight in the Enron follies is trained on the nation's capital. But the story of the company's rise and fall, and the retirement savings its workers lost, inevitably leads back to Wall Street.
Enron's executives were surely smart enough to know that once they had convinced bankers, brokers and accountants of the company's strength, all parties could pretty much be counted on to keep the myth of solidity alive, even after problems arose. When questions were first raised about partnerships that should have been listed in financial statements, true believers could be relied on to drown out naysayers.
Naturally, given the millions of dollars Wall Street firms generated selling Enron's shares and bonds to investors, analysts were among the most vociferous defenders of the company, even after its stock began to fall. David N. Fleischer, who followed Enron for Goldman, Sachs, recommended it until Oct. 17, the day after Enron disclosed that it had lost $618 million in the most recent quarter and that because earlier financial statements had been inaccurate, it was lopping $1.2 billion off its net worth. Even with the stock at 68 cents, Mr. Fleischer currently rates Enron a market performer. 
Across town at Lehman Brothers, Richard Gross continues to rate Enron a strong buy. Raymond C. Niles at Salomon Smith Barney did change his rating on Enron from buy to neutral, but not until Oct. 26, when the stock closed at $15.40. During the previous 12 months, Enron had traded as high as $84.63.
Of course, if a company wants to mislead its investors, analysts and accountants, there is probably little that can be done to stop it. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, has said that it was misled. 
But what is becoming evident about Enron is the decidedly ephemeral nature of its operations and its revenues. Beginning as a mundane natural gas pipeline company in the 1980's, Enron had morphed into a financial services firm by the late 1990's. It traded things like oil, but created new markets to trade oddities like weather and bandwidth. 
Because Enron operated in a largely unregulated arena and because of the way energy trading firms are allowed to account for their operations, the company recorded revenue that made the economic status of its business appear larger than it really was. Under accounting rules, when an energy trading company trades electricity or gas, it can count as revenues the whole amount of every transaction rather than simply the profit or loss, as a brokerage firm does.
It is similar to the way Priceline .com counted as revenues the whole sale price of plane tickets sold online rather than just commissions, as traditional travel agents do.
That is largely how Enron, a relative newcomer to the trading of commodities and related financial instruments, was able to produce $101 billion of revenue in 2000, up from $40 billion in 1999. By comparison, Goldman, Sachs, a highly regulated firm with a long history of trading in the field, generated $6.5 billion in trading revenue last year. 
Enron appears to have done nothing wrong in accounting for trading revenues, unlike its almost certainly improper accounting for dealings with entities off its balance sheets. But the larger-than-life revenue numbers allowed Enron's executives and other advocates to promote the idea that its operations were far grander than they were, worthy of a ranking near the top of the Fortune 500.
To a Wall Street obsessed not with earnings but with revenue growth, the performance propelled Enron's shares into the stratosphere, enriching executives and investors. "The way these revenues were accounted for at Enron essentially made them pro forma revenues, which have little basis in reality," one institutional money manager said. "Yet the size of the revenues allowed the company to expand its balance sheet by piling on debt. That is why the company unraveled so quickly."
The moment that rival trading firms and other customers at Enron began to lose confidence in the company, its business dried up. But its onerous debt of at least $31 billion remained, forcing it to make the largest bankruptcy filing in United States history. 
Mr. Fleckenstein and some other investors are concerned that other bombs like Enron's may be ticking, but that investors will have little help in spotting them before they blow. The combination of aggressive accounting -- like Enron's method of shifting big obligations off its balance sheet -- and a conflicted auditing firm, he said, are not limited to Enron. Aggressive accounting has become much more common in recent years, and as auditors have increased their consulting business among the companies whose books they vet, their willingness to sign off on debatable practices has grown. 
And as investors know only too well, analysts on Wall Street cannot be relied upon to dig deeply into companies' books. Eager to help their firms generate business selling securities to investors -- and reap their own rewards in bonuses -- Wall Street analysts have made a habit of missing corporate misdeeds altogether or ignoring what they see.
"Enron proves how meaningless financial statements have become," Mr. Fleckenstein said. "Until someone makes sure that financial statements have meaning, we will never get this problem behind us."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: GUANTANAMO BAY; 
In Cuba, Muted Acceptance Greets Presence of Prisoners

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
The Plaza of the Revolution stands quiet. The government newspapers are making nice. The president has refrained from uttering a single denunciation on the subject.
 In the balmy capital of this hemisphere's last Communist outpost, the arrival at the United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay of the first suspected terrorists from the war in Afghanistan has been met with a collective shrug. 
 Over its own longstanding discomfort with the American presence on the island, the government of Fidel Castro has publicly signaled its acceptance of the decision by the Bush administration to imprison hundreds of suspected Al Qaeda members at the American base on Cuba's eastern tip.
In cafes and private parlors, many Havana residents are echoing the government's line, but often with a little twist. They say they do not like the idea of hardened terrorists being imported to what they regard as sovereign Cuban soil, but they agree that this is not the time to make a fuss.
"America is bringing these prisoners here, and it is impossible for the Cuban people to fight it," said Jaime Jimenez, a Havana University student. "Nobody in the world wants these guys; Cuba doesn't want them either. But we have no option."
Mr. Jimenez made his remarks as the second installment of suspected terrorists were reported to be bound for the island aboard an American cargo plane. The first group of 20 prisoners, cuffed and shackled, arrived late last week. 
They are expected to be followed by several hundred other suspected members of Al Qaeda, who will be imprisoned in makeshift cells while they await their still uncertain fates.
Like many Cubans here, Mr. Jimenez said his concern was the security around Guantanamo Bay.
"What if these people come into Cuba?" Mr. Jimenez asked between sips of a mojito at a bar in the city's El Vedado neighborhood. "No wonder they don't want them in America."
According to Granma, the state newspaper, the Cuban government has offered to improve medical and sanitation services in the area around the base and has promised not to erect "any obstacles" to America's plan to imprison the suspected terrorists there.
"We are willing to cooperate in any other useful, constructive and humane way that may arise," the government said.
The naval station at Guantanamo Bay is one of the many points of contention in the two countries' difficult relationship. The United States leases the base under a 1903 agreement that was renewed as a perpetual lease in 1934, nearly three decades before Mr. Castro seized power.
The Cuban government objects to what it calls the "abusive conditions" imposed by the treaty, but any amendment to the lease agreement requires the consent of the United States as well. In the statement printed this weekend, the Cuban government said an "elemental sense of dignity and absolute disagreement" prevents it from cashing the $4,085 checks sent to Cuba as annual lease payments by the United States government.
It is unclear what prompted Cuba, which itself is on the United States list of states that sponsor terrorism, to go along with the American activities at Guantanamo. One reason may be a desire to ease its current economic difficulties. Tourism, one of the country's largest earners of foreign currency, has dropped sharply since the Sept. 11 attacks. Since then, the Cuban peso has lost nearly 20 percent of its value against the dollar.
"We have sugar, we have cigars, but none of them earn as much as tourism," said Jorge Rodriguez, a 30-year-old medical technician. "After Sept. 11, we lost a lot of tourism."
Although many Cubans echoed Mr. Rodriguez's sentiments, it remains a difficult task to gauge public opinion in a country as tightly controlled as Cuba. In a Havana paladar, one of the many privately run restaurants that have sprung up here, one of the employees began explaining himself.
"I have opinions that I express outside, and those that I express behind closed doors," he said.
A co-worker pulled the man aside, and after a moment, he returned.
"I am sorry, I cannot speak to you," he said.

HEADLINE: Andersengate 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Fed Chairman Arthur Burns, worried that the impending collapse of Penn Central would roil the capital markets, suggested that the Pentagon arrange a loan to prevent bankruptcy. George Shultz, then the Nixon budget director, argued that government intervention would send the wrong message about risk-reward to our economic system.
 The dispute was resolved when Bryce Harlow, the sage speechwriter-adviser, entered the Oval Office and said to President Nixon: "The board of Penn Central, in its infinite wisdom, has just hired your old law firm to help you decide. Mr. President, you can't touch this with a ten-foot pole." 
 Nixon took the advice not to meddle. The huge company went bankrupt -- and the markets quietly absorbed the shock. No scandal touched the White House (until later).
We had another non-intervention in the Enron collapse. Kenneth Lay, chairman of the nation's seventh-largest company and a longtime political contributor, called a couple of Bush cabinet secretaries to reveal his rapid unraveling. He was surely hoping for some government succor. The Bush Treasury and Commerce secretaries, without even consulting the president, decided not to mix in.
Then Robert Rubin, now a head of Citigroup, called a high official at Treasury. It was consistent for the man who, as Clinton Treasury secretary, arranged the bailout of Mexico to ask for government help in shoring up the credit rating of a customer that owed his bank $800 million.
Again, nothing was done by the Bush administration to intervene. Enron went down the drain -- but the capital markets survived. Many investors and employees learned the hard way that capitalism is a risky business, but if the taxpayer were to assume all such risk there would be no market punishment for any management inefficiency or corruption.
As a card-carrying scandalmonger, I am moved to ask: Where's the scandal? Democratic Representative Henry Waxman, after eight years with his eyes tightly shut, apparently thinks it scandalous that Bush's men -- at the first call from Mr. Lay -- did not promptly step in to save the company from the consequences of the greed or predations of its managers. Bush is thus damned for what he did not do.
But at the same time, other scandalmongers are damning Bush for what he may possibly have done -- such as getting briefed by anybody on his staff and thereby "knowing," or by having taken political contributions from today's villain back when Lay was a Houston hero. 
The dozen or so investigations may turn up something to embarrass the White House, especially if Bush pulls another "executive privilege" when Congress wants facts. But the scandal I see in this corporate debacle is non-political; it's professional.
This affair shows the accounting profession all too often to be in bed with the oldest profession. Accounting standards have been frequently prostituted by the new Uriah Heeps: these are executives in ever-merging firms afraid to challenge their clients' phony numbers and secret self-dealing because they might lose fees in the lucrative consulting business they run on the side. 
These no-account accountants seem to forget that the "p" in C.P.A. means "public." The Big Five are silent about Andersengate because they are eager to become the Big Four by carving up their competitor's carcass. That's why it's harder to find a major bean-counter willing to condemn publicly the failures of Arthur Andersen & Co. than to find a top Muslim cleric willing to criticize Osama bin Laden. 
Although Andersen executives may try to cop a plea by ratting on the client they so supinely and profitably enabled, they must explain why, as the biggest bankruptcy in history loomed, their supervisors were so eager to remind those working on the Enron account to destroy records. 
Self-dealing; asset-hiding; insider stock-dumping -- all these were supposedly beyond the ken of an audit committee and legal counsel blindly reliant on the ethics and standards of "professional" accountants. It's a scandal, all right, and wrongdoers should pay in heavy civil damages if not jail time.
But based on what we now know, it's not a political scandal. Bush's people, including former employees or consultants of Enron, did right by refusing to bail a campaign contributor out of its mess at public expense or by misleading investors. Taxpayers should be grateful.

The naval station at Guantanamo Bay is one of the many points of contention in the two countries' difficult relationship. The United States leases the base under a 1903 agreement that was renewed as a perpetual lease in 1934, nearly three decades before Mr. Castro seized power.
The Cuban government objects to what it calls the "abusive conditions" imposed by the treaty, but any amendment to the lease agreement requires the consent of the United States as well. In the statement printed this weekend, the Cuban government said an "elemental sense of dignity and absolute disagreement" prevents it from cashing the $4,085 checks sent to Cuba as annual lease payments by the United States government.
It is unclear what prompted Cuba, which itself is on the United States list of states that sponsor terrorism, to go along with the American activities at Guantanamo. One reason may be a desire to ease its current economic difficulties. Tourism, one of the country's largest earners of foreign currency, has dropped sharply since the Sept. 11 attacks. Since then, the Cuban peso has lost nearly 20 percent of its value against the dollar.
"We have sugar, we have cigars, but none of them earn as much as tourism," said Jorge Rodriguez, a 30-year-old medical technician. "After Sept. 11, we lost a lot of tourism."
Although many Cubans echoed Mr. Rodriguez's sentiments, it remains a difficult task to gauge public opinion in a country as tightly controlled as Cuba. In a Havana paladar, one of the many privately run restaurants that have sprung up here, one of the employees began explaining himself.
"I have opinions that I express outside, and those that I express behind closed doors," he said.
A co-worker pulled the man aside, and after a moment, he returned.
"I am sorry, I cannot speak to you," he said.

HEADLINE: Andersengate 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Fed Chairman Arthur Burns, worried that the impending collapse of Penn Central would roil the capital markets, suggested that the Pentagon arrange a loan to prevent bankruptcy. George Shultz, then the Nixon budget director, argued that government intervention would send the wrong message about risk-reward to our economic system.
 The dispute was resolved when Bryce Harlow, the sage speechwriter-adviser, entered the Oval Office and said to President Nixon: "The board of Penn Central, in its infinite wisdom, has just hired your old law firm to help you decide. Mr. President, you can't touch this with a ten-foot pole." 
 Nixon took the advice not to meddle. The huge company went bankrupt -- and the markets quietly absorbed the shock. No scandal touched the White House (until later).
We had another non-intervention in the Enron collapse. Kenneth Lay, chairman of the nation's seventh-largest company and a longtime political contributor, called a couple of Bush cabinet secretaries to reveal his rapid unraveling. He was surely hoping for some government succor. The Bush Treasury and Commerce secretaries, without even consulting the president, decided not to mix in.
Then Robert Rubin, now a head of Citigroup, called a high official at Treasury. It was consistent for the man who, as Clinton Treasury secretary, arranged the bailout of Mexico to ask for government help in shoring up the credit rating of a customer that owed his bank $800 million.
Again, nothing was done by the Bush administration to intervene. Enron went down the drain -- but the capital markets survived. Many investors and employees learned the hard way that capitalism is a risky business, but if the taxpayer were to assume all such risk there would be no market punishment for any management inefficiency or corruption.
As a card-carrying scandalmonger, I am moved to ask: Where's the scandal? Democratic Representative Henry Waxman, after eight years with his eyes tightly shut, apparently thinks it scandalous that Bush's men -- at the first call from Mr. Lay -- did not promptly step in to save the company from the consequences of the greed or predations of its managers. Bush is thus damned for what he did not do.
But at the same time, other scandalmongers are damning Bush for what he may possibly have done -- such as getting briefed by anybody on his staff and thereby "knowing," or by having taken political contributions from today's villain back when Lay was a Houston hero. 
The dozen or so investigations may turn up something to embarrass the White House, especially if Bush pulls another "executive privilege" when Congress wants facts. But the scandal I see in this corporate debacle is non-political; it's professional.
This affair shows the accounting profession all too often to be in bed with the oldest profession. Accounting standards have been frequently prostituted by the new Uriah Heeps: these are executives in ever-merging firms afraid to challenge their clients' phony numbers and secret self-dealing because they might lose fees in the lucrative consulting business they run on the side. 
These no-account accountants seem to forget that the "p" in C.P.A. means "public." The Big Five are silent about Andersengate because they are eager to become the Big Four by carving up their competitor's carcass. That's why it's harder to find a major bean-counter willing to condemn publicly the failures of Arthur Andersen & Co. than to find a top Muslim cleric willing to criticize Osama bin Laden. 
Although Andersen executives may try to cop a plea by ratting on the client they so supinely and profitably enabled, they must explain why, as the biggest bankruptcy in history loomed, their supervisors were so eager to remind those working on the Enron account to destroy records. 
Self-dealing; asset-hiding; insider stock-dumping -- all these were supposedly beyond the ken of an audit committee and legal counsel blindly reliant on the ethics and standards of "professional" accountants. It's a scandal, all right, and wrongdoers should pay in heavy civil damages if not jail time.
But based on what we now know, it's not a political scandal. Bush's people, including former employees or consultants of Enron, did right by refusing to bail a campaign contributor out of its mess at public expense or by misleading investors. Taxpayers should be grateful.

HEADLINE: A Consultant May Determine Hewlett Deal 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The next arena in the fight for the future of Hewlett-Packard is an unlikely one -- the offices in Rockville, Md., of Institutional Shareholder Services.
 Ram Kumar, Patrick S. McGurn and a handful of other analysts at Institutional Shareholder Services are scheduled to receive visits over the next few weeks from both the leading champions and the foremost critics of Hewlett-Packard's proposed merger with Compaq Computer. 
 Carleton S. Fiorina and Michael D. Capellas, the chief executives, respectively, of Hewlett and Compaq, joined by a couple of advisers and board members, will try to persuade I.S.S., a proxy voting consultant, that combining the two computer makers is a sound strategic step. And the dissident Hewlett-Packard director, Walter B. Hewlett, and his advisers will present the case that the merger plan is a bad one. 
After listening to both sides, I.S.S. will issue a recommendation to its hundreds of institutional clients for or against the deal. Its decision, expected two to three weeks before the vote on the merger, could be crucial, perhaps determining the deal's fate. That is because the company is such an influential adviser to institutional shareholders -- pension funds, investment managers and mutual funds -- and those institutions hold an estimated 57 percent of Hewlett-Packard's shares.
"As an institutional investor, if you're voting against I.S.S., you had better have some darn good reason," said Richard H. Koppes, former general counsel of the nation's largest pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers. Mr. Koppes was the general counsel of Calpers from 1986 to 1996, and he watched the influence of I.S.S. rise as institutional shareholders came to own larger and larger stakes in major corporations. Today, Mr. Koppes is a lawyer at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, and he advises companies on questions of corporate governance. 
In contested mergers or proxy fights for control of a corporate board, the rival sides often make pilgrimages to Rockville, Md., to woo I.S.S. -- just as they are doing in the Hewlett-Packard case. "They go in groups, and they kiss the ring," Mr. Koppes remarked. 
The advisory firm's recommendation, of course, will not sway all institutional shareholders. Some institutions -- particularly index funds, which buy a company's shares based on its proportionate size in the stock market -- delegate voting on proxy issues, including mergers, to I.S.S. But others, especially funds whose managers carefully study individual companies before investing, will note the Institutional Shareholder Services recommendation, but will make their own assessment of the merger.
An internal analysis at Hewlett-Packard found that as many as 20 percent of all shareholders would have their votes on the merger influenced or determined by the recommendation of I.S.S. And yet, a report last Friday by A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, estimated that only 8 or 9 percent of Hewlett's shareholders -- the index portion of the institutional investors -- would have their votes determined by the recommendation.
One of Hewlett-Packard's largest shareholders, Barclays Global Investors, which holds more than 3 percent of Hewlett shares, has already said that I.S.S. will vote its shares. Barclays made the announcement to remove any appearance of a conflict of interest, since Patricia C. Dunn, co-chairwoman of Barclays Global, is on Hewlett-Packard's board.
If Institutional Shareholder Services opposes the merger, the deal -- and the tenure of Ms. Fiorina, whose reputation is tied to the Compaq acquisition -- would appear to be in danger. It would represent a second unnerving setback, after the heirs of the Hewlett-Packard founders said they would vote their stock and that held by family foundations, totaling 18 percent, against the merger. 
I.S.S., founded in 1985, grew to be the largest firm in the field of corporate governance. The field traces its roots to the 1970's, when social activists organized to prod universities and foundations into selling or avoiding the shares of companies that did business in South Africa. They formed the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington, and began pursuing a broader agenda of opening up the governance of public corporations in the name of "shareholder democracy."
I.S.S. was founded by one of the early corporate governance advocates, Robert A. G. Monks. And both Jamie Heard, its current chief executive, and Mr. McGurn, vice president and director of corporate programs, worked at the Investor Responsibility Research Center.
The professionals in the corporate governance field typically have backgrounds in law and politics. Mr. McGurn, for example, is a graduate of the Georgetown law school, and he worked previously as an aide to former Senator Paul Laxalt, Republican of Nevada, and on the staff of the Republican National Committee. Of the corporate governance field, Mr. McGurn said, "It's definitely the collision of law, finance and politics."
While there are many corporate governance consultants, Institutional Shareholder Services is the leading proxy adviser, making recommendations on thousands of company initiatives. Last year, it merged with its largest rival, Proxy Monitor, so the combined firm has even more power and 270 employees.
Mr. Kumar, a 32-year-old lawyer, is the lead analyst on the Hewlett-Compaq deal. He is working with a team that, in addition to Mr. McGurn, includes Shirley Westcott, Steve Sears, Edward Seaton, Bemal Patel and Vittorio Lara, all analysts. 
The decision-making process at I.S.S. is consensual. "But Ram is honchoing the project and his name will appear on the report," Mr. McGurn said.
The report, Mr. Kumar said, will probably run more than 20 pages. In contested mergers, he said, I.S.S. examines broad sets of questions. First is the governance issue of how the board decided to pursue the merger. Was the board thorough and careful in weighing the deal and the alternatives? Was there open debate?
In this case, Mr. Kumar said, there seem to be no contentions that the process by which the decision was made had been flawed. Instead, he said, Mr. Hewlett and other opponents of the merger maintain that the economics do not make sense. "That's the crux of the issue here," he said.
And so the relevant questions include: Is the price too high? Are big mergers in the computer industry inherently too risky? What are the prospects of the combined company?
The guiding principle of any I.S.S. analysis, Mr. Kumar said, is whether a deal is likely to be good for shareholders over the coming two to five years. In the end, that is a tough judgment call -- and one that greatly depends on trends in technology and the competitive strengths and prospects of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq as a combined company or separately.
Does I.S.S. have the ability to make a well-informed judgment on technology? "I'm not an engineer," Mr. Kumar said. "We're laymen as far as technology goes. But I would argue we're intelligent laymen, and we're educating ourselves now."
For the last several weeks, and for the next month or so, he has been freed up from most other duties to focus on the Hewlett-Compaq deal. He has been bombarded with reports from stock analysts and presentations by the advisers from both sides.
And "we get to meet directly with the principals," Mr. Kumar said, "and that is the most valuable."

PERSON: Cyrus R. Vance 

HEADLINE: Cyrus R. Vance, Confidant of Presidents Who Resigned a Top Post, Dies at 84 

BYLINE:  By MARILYN BERGER

 BODY:
Cyrus R. Vance, who after two decades in public service was appointed secretary of state, and who then took the rare step of resigning from the nation's highest cabinet post on a matter of principle, died Saturday afternoon at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. He was 84.
 The cause was pneumonia and other complications, said Elva Murphy, his longtime secretary. 
 Mr. Vance was secretary of state from 1977 until 1980, when he resigned in protest over President Jimmy Carter's decision to try a military rescue of American hostages in Iran, an action that he considered ill advised and futile. He was soon proved right. 
After more than 20 years in and out of government, during which he served several presidents, Mr. Vance submitted his resignation with what he called "a heavy heart." His doubts that the elaborate rescue would succeed, and his fears that it would sabotage diplomatic efforts to free the 52 American hostages, brought him to what he called "one of the most painful days of my life." 
His opposition to the rescue mission was the immediate cause of his resignation, but he had already come to see that Mr. Carter was increasingly rejecting his advice in favor of that of his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski. 
As it turned, out the rescue attempt failed. Of the eight American helicopters sent on the mission, three broke down in the first stage of the operation. It was decided to abandon the mission, but there was more humiliation ahead for the United States. One of the remaining helicopters collided on the ground with a transport plane and both craft burned. Eight servicemen died in the fire and the rest fled. 
The failed mission became an issue in the 1980 political campaign in which Mr. Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan. The hostages were not released until the day of Mr. Reagan's inauguration, 444 days after they were taken captive. 
Mr. Vance said in 1999 that he had watched from the sidelines with "frustration and sadness" as relations between the United States and Iran "plunged into increasing hostility, mistrust, name calling and mutual recrimination." In an address at the Asia Society, Mr. Vance called for the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Iran. 
Mr. Vance -- who had decided to leave office whether the rescue succeeded or failed -- was only the second secretary of state in the history of the United States to resign on a matter of principle, joining what another secretary of state, Dean Acheson, called "the most exclusive club in America." William Jennings Bryan, the only other secretary of state to resign, was a pacifist who resigned in 1915 over policies by Woodrow Wilson that he thought might lead to war.

An Obligation to Serve
That Mr. Vance allowed principle to get in the way of his career came as no surprise to the people who knew him best. To them, Cyrus Vance, the tall, lanky, patrician lawyer with the open face of a prep school boy was Mr. Integrity, Mr. Honesty. He was the epitome of the American establishment, that small group of men who moved seamlessly from the prep schools of New England and the Ivy League colleges of the East to the law firms of Wall Street, with time out for service in government. Then they would return again to private practice, bringing with them the old values of family, work and public service.
After his return to private practice, Mr. Vance was repeatedly called back to the public arena to use his quiet negotiating skills on some of the most violent conflicts of the 1980's and 1990's: in the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia; in South Africa; and in a disintegrating Yugoslavia. There, he successfully negotiated a cease-fire in Croatia to allow a United Nations peacekeeping force to enter and disarm warring militias. 
In accepting one assignment after another, Mr. Vance was only doing what he believed was expected of him. He said, "A lot of us were raised in families where we were taught that we were very fortunate, that we were going to have a good education, and that we had the responsibility to return to the community some of the benefits and blessings we had, and that there was an obligation to participate in government service at the local, state and national level." 
This, in a nutshell, was the un-self-conscious voice of the establishment -- the one that Jimmy Carter ran against so vigorously that his campaign manager, Hamilton Jordan, once said: "If, after the inauguration, you find a Cy Vance as secretary of state and Zbigniew Brzezinski as head of national security, then I would say we failed. And I'd quit." 
Mr. Vance was Mr. Carter's first appointee, followed soon after by Mr. Brzezinski. Mr. Jordan did not quit. 
In both his personal approach to the job and his overall philosophy, Mr. Vance presented a striking contrast to his flamboyant predecessor, Henry A. Kissinger. A calm, publicity-shy diplomat who was more a mediator than a policy maker, Mr. Vance was one of the most modest and unpretentious men ever to hold the post. He was a popular figure around the State Department as he loped through the hallways in his pinstripes or tweeds, occasionally rumpled but always well tailored. 
When he took office, Mr. Vance vowed to limit his travel abroad and eschew Mr. Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy -- a pledge that quickly fell by the wayside. But while he adopted some of Mr. Kissinger's tactics, he harbored doubts about his strategy. Mr. Vance was deeply skeptical that any master plan could provide answers for individual foreign policy problems. He did not think in terms of a Soviet grand design to encircle and undo the West any more than he thought about a grand design for American foreign policy. His method was "to slog it out," putting together solutions to individual problems.
Prof. Norman A. Graebner, a historian of American diplomacy at the University of Virginia, said, "The general attitude toward the acceptance of the Soviet position in the world and the fact that revolutionary pressures in the third world were genuine and that it was America's task to live with those realities was most pronounced during those first Carter years." 
The president and his secretary of state pursued a moderate course, characterized by the strategic arms negotiations, the Panama Canal Treaties, the normalization of relations with China and the settlement that brought majority rule to Zimbabwe, the former British colony that had been known as Rhodesia. During the historic talks at Camp David in 1979, Mr. Vance developed an effective working relationship with two of the Israeli negotiators, Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman. It became crucial in working out the landmark agreement that established peace between Egypt and Israel. 
Mr. Vance shared with Mr. Carter the conviction that the advancement of human rights around the world was in America's national interest. And from his years in the Pentagon, Mr. Vance knew the limits of the use of military force to solve nonmilitary problems. He was secretary of the Army in 1962 when the Army was called in to open the doors of the University of Mississippi to blacks. The walkie-talkies failed, providing a lesson that he still carried years later when he heard of the plan to rescue the hostages in Tehran. If a problem like that could occur in Mississippi, he wondered how a complicated mission in a country in the throes of revolution half a world away could succeed.
But the Carter administration had been rocked by a series of events in 1979: the fall of the shah of Iran, the appearance of a Soviet brigade in Cuba, the fall of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua, the taking of American hostages in Tehran and, finally, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. "All these were attributed to a failure of will and courage on the part of President Carter," Professor Graebner said, and that is when Mr. Carter "went ideological with behavior that became extremely appealing to the right wing. The effort to rescue the hostages was part of that, and at that point, Vance found himself increasingly on the outside looking in." 
To Mr. Brzezinski, Mr. Vance was not hardheaded enough about world realities. In his book "Power and Principle," Mr. Brzezinski wrote that Mr. Vance, "as a member of both the legal profession and the once-dominant WASP elite, operated according to their values and rules, but those values and rules were of declining relevance not only in terms of domestic American politics but particularly in terms of global conditions." 
Paul C. Warnke, an admirer of Mr. Vance's who served as his chief arms control adviser, said Mr. Vance suffered from the vice of his own virtue. "He thought he could work with Zbig," Mr. Warnke said. "But Zbig not only used guerrilla tactics, he was in closer proximity to the president."

The Hard Choice to Leave
Mr. Vance was always circumspect about his relationship with Mr. Brzezinski, but years later, in an interview for this article, he reluctantly acknowledged that he had probably been mistaken when he agreed to Mr. Brzezinski's appointment. "I had some reservations about him," he said, "but I knew the president wanted him very badly. I now realize my instinctive feeling on that was right."
When Mr. Carter gave the order to rescue the hostages in Iran, it was clear that Mr. Brzezinski had won the contest, and Mr. Vance decided to resign. He recorded some of this story in his 1983 book, "Hard Choices." 
His son, Cyrus Vance Jr., said on Saturday that the family was proud of him when he stepped down, because he had acted on his principles. "I don't think he ever failed to follow those principles in his entire professional life," he said.
Mr. Vance came to the Carter cabinet with impeccable credentials. In 1957, Lyndon B. Johnson, then the majority leader of the Senate, asked Mr. Vance, then 40 years old, to leave his Wall Street law firm to serve as counsel for a Senate armed services subcommittee on preparedness. The Soviet Union had launched the world's first man-made satellite, Sputnik, and the United States was trying to catch up in the race for space. Mr. Johnson was to call on Mr. Vance repeatedly; the younger man helped draft the act establishing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, and served as counsel for Senate investigations of missile and space satellite programs and Defense Department budgeting. 
Mr. Vance knew the Pentagon inside and out when Robert S. McNamara, John F. Kennedy's secretary of defense, asked him to come to work. He rose from general counsel in 1961 to secretary of the Army and finally to deputy secretary of defense in charge of running the Pentagon. He helped Mr. McNamara impose a reorganization of defense management practices intended to make the services work with one another. 
President Johnson sent him to Panama as part of a peacemaking team in 1964, after student riots in the Canal Zone had been put down at a cost of 27 lives. Almost 15 years later, Mr. Vance presided over the successful negotiations and Senate ratification of the Panama Canal Treaties, under which the United States agreed to cede control of the canal to Panama by 2000. 
By 1967, a painful back ailment forced Mr. Vance back into civilian life, but he was repeatedly called back for delicate assignments. Mr. McNamara asked him to go to Detroit when riots broke out there in 1967. Although Mr. Vance was criticized in some quarters for being slow to call in federal troops, he won praise from black leaders for easing the crisis. 
That same year, Mr. Vance was credited with forestalling a war between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus. "Cyrus Settles Cyprus" was the headline carried in The Economist. In 1968 President Johnson sent Mr. Vance to South Korea to reassure President Park Chung Hee of Washington's support after North Korea had breached the armistice agreement and seized the Pueblo, an American intelligence-gathering ship.
Although Mr. Vance was not one of the formulators of the Johnson administration's policies in Vietnam, he had supported the war effort. But in 1968, as a member of the group of so-called Wise Men assembled to review the war effort, he joined others to call for an end to the bombing and a negotiated settlement.
He was sent to Paris in 1968 as deputy to W. Averell Harriman, the chief United States negotiator, who was trying to work out a settlement with the North Vietnamese. Mr. Vance was forced to devote much of his time to such fine points as the shape of the negotiating table. When the furniture was finally arranged, however, South Vietnam, encouraged to expect a Republican victory in the election and a better deal from Richard M. Nixon, refused to negotiate. "In my mind," Mr. Vance recorded in an oral history for the Lyndon B. Johnson Library, "this was one of the great tragedies in history, that the South Vietnamese double-crossed the United States, which I clearly feel they did." 
That kind of language was uncharacteristically strong for him. Outwardly he was so mild that he was once called "a man who leaves no footprints." Because of that reputation, he surprised his State Department colleagues with the force of his advocacy and the clarity of his goals, chiefly to bring the nuclear menace under control and to improve relations with the Soviet Union. 
He fought when he had to, as he did early on as secretary of state when he vigorously supported the appointment of Mr. Warnke to head the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. He knew Mr. Warnke would be opposed by Senator Henry Jackson of Washington and other hard-liners, but he believed the agency needed to be led by a firm advocate of arms control. "He went to the wall for Paul," one former State Department official said. He won.

An Early Interest in Law
Cyrus Roberts Vance was born in Clarksburg, W. Va., on March 27, 1917, the second son of John Carl and Amy Roberts Vance. His father was an insurance broker and landowner who worked in a government agency during World War I. His mother came from a Philadelphia Main Line family and was active in civic affairs.
Cyrus was only 5 years old when his father died. In the ensuing years, the boy developed an exceptionally close relationship with his first cousin, best friend and mentor, John W. Davis, who had been a member of Congress, ambassador to Britain and Democratic candidate for president in 1924. It was through Mr. Davis that Mr. Vance said he developed an early interest in the law. 
As a student at the Kent School in Connecticut, Cyrus served as senior prefect, played football and hockey, and rowed on the 1934 crew that made the Henley Regatta. He went on to Yale, where he found among his classmates R. Sargent Shriver, William Scranton, Stanley Resor and William Bundy. He would serve in government with all of them.
At Yale he was remembered as a hard-working and conscientious economics major. He received a bachelor's degree in 1939 and graduated from Yale Law School with honors in 1942. In later years he was to win more than a dozen honorary degrees, and in 1969 President Johnson bestowed on him the Medal of Freedom, the government's top civilian award.
Mr. Vance served in the Navy during World War II and saw action on destroyers at Bougainville, Tarawa, the Philippines, Saipan and Guam. He was discharged in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant, senior grade. After a year at the Mead Corporation, he was admitted to the New York bar in 1947 and joined Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, where he was to remain for his entire legal career.
On Feb. 15, 1947, he married Grace Elsie Sloane, a Bryn Mawr graduate and daughter of the board chairman of the W. & J. Sloane furniture company. Mr. Vance is survived by his wife, their five children, Cyrus R. Jr., Elsie, Amy, and twins, Grace Roberts and Camilla; and by two grandchildren, Simon and Clare. His funeral will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday at Heavenly Rest Church, on Fifth Avenue and 90th Street in Manhattan. 
Over the years Mr. Vance served on the boards of directors of corporations, among them I.B.M., Pan American Airways, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, U.S. Steel and The New York Times.
He also served as a trustee of the New York Presbyterian Hospital, the Yale Urban Institute and the Yale Corporation, and was chairman of the board of the Rockefeller Foundation. He was vice chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations until 1987, and a member of the United Nations Association and the Trilateral Commission. From 1970 to 1972, he served on a committee to investigate police corruption in New York City, and in 1987 he was named to the New York Commission on Government Integrity, established to investigate corruption at all levels of government in the state. From 1988 to 1990, Mr. Vance was chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
As president of the New York City Bar Association in 1975 and 1976, he made a stubborn but not too successful effort to persuade the lawyers to devote Saturdays to providing the city's needy with free legal advice.
To those, like Mr. Brzezinski, who referred occasionally to the "once-dominant WASP elite," Mr. Vance said: "The establishment is still alive and reasonably healthy. I think you'll find the establishment, with its moral force and integrity, will be playing a larger role in the future."
Mr. Vance never dwelled on his own legacy, but when asked at 70 how he wanted to be remembered, he said, "I hope for being a reasonably decent, honest person who tried to do some things for the country that might have lasting effect and create a better life for a large number of people."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The obituary of former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance on Jan. 14 (and in late editions on Jan. 13) misstated the rarity of resignations from that post over matters of principle. Historians generally agree that there were three, not two. Besides Mr. Vance, who objected in 1980 to the attempt at a military rescue of American hostages in Iran, and William Jennings Bryan (1915), over policies he felt might lead the country to war, Lewis Cass resigned in 1860 because he considered President James Buchanan weak on secessionists.

PERSON: Cyrus R. Vance 

HEADLINE: Cyrus R. Vance, Confidant of Presidents Who Resigned a Top Post, Dies at 84 

BYLINE:  By MARILYN BERGER 

 BODY:
Cyrus R. Vance, who after two decades in public service was appointed secretary of state, and who then took the rare step of resigning from the nation's highest cabinet post on a matter of principle, died Saturday afternoon at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. He was 84.
 The cause was pneumonia and other complications, said Elva Murphy, his longtime secretary. 
 Mr. Vance was secretary of state from 1977 until 1980, when he resigned in protest over President Jimmy Carter's decision to try a military rescue of American hostages in Iran, an action that he considered ill advised and futile. He was soon proved right. 
After more than 20 years in and out of government, during which he served several presidents, Mr. Vance submitted his resignation with what he called "a heavy heart." His doubts that the elaborate rescue would succeed, and his fears that it would sabotage diplomatic efforts to free the 52 American hostages, brought him to what he called "one of the most painful days of my life." 
His opposition to the rescue mission was the immediate cause of his resignation, but he had already come to see that Mr. Carter was increasingly rejecting his advice in favor of that of his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski. 
As it turned, out the rescue attempt failed. Of the eight American helicopters sent on the mission, three broke down in the first stage of the operation. It was decided to abandon the mission, but there was more humiliation ahead for the United States. One of the remaining helicopters collided on the ground with a transport plane and both craft burned. Eight servicemen died in the fire and the rest fled. 
The failed mission became an issue in the 1980 political campaign in which Mr. Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan. The hostages were not released until the day of Mr. Reagan's inauguration, 444 days after they were taken captive. 
Mr. Vance said in 1999 that he had watched from the sidelines with "frustration and sadness" as relations between the United States and Iran "plunged into increasing hostility, mistrust, name calling and mutual recrimination." In an address at the Asia Society, Mr. Vance called for the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Iran. 
Mr. Vance -- who had decided to leave office whether the rescue succeeded or failed -- was only the second secretary of state in the history of the United States to resign on a matter of principle, joining what another secretary of state, Dean Acheson, called "the most exclusive club in America." William Jennings Bryan, the only other secretary of state to resign, was a pacifist who resigned in 1915 over policies by Woodrow Wilson that he thought might lead to war.

An Obligation to Serve
That Mr. Vance allowed principle to get in the way of his career came as no surprise to the people who knew him best. To them, Cyrus Vance, the tall, lanky, patrician lawyer with the open face of a prep school boy was Mr. Integrity, Mr. Honesty. He was the epitome of the American establishment, that small group of men who moved seamlessly from the prep schools of New England and the Ivy League colleges of the East to the law firms of Wall Street, with time out for service in government. Then they would return again to private practice, bringing with them the old values of family, work and public service.
After his return to private practice, Mr. Vance was repeatedly called back to the public arena to use his quiet negotiating skills on some of the most violent conflicts of the 1980's and 1990's: in the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia; in South Africa; and in a disintegrating Yugoslavia. There, he successfully negotiated a cease-fire in Croatia to allow a United Nations peacekeeping force to enter and disarm warring militias. 
In accepting one assignment after another, Mr. Vance was only doing what he believed was expected of him. He said, "A lot of us were raised in families where we were taught that we were very fortunate, that we were going to have a good education, and that we had the responsibility to return to the community some of the benefits and blessings we had, and that there was an obligation to participate in government service at the local, state and national level." 
This, in a nutshell, was the un-self-conscious voice of the establishment -- the one that Jimmy Carter ran against so vigorously that his campaign manager, Hamilton Jordan, once said: "If, after the inauguration, you find a Cy Vance as secretary of state and Zbigniew Brzezinski as head of national security, then I would say we failed. And I'd quit." 
Mr. Vance was Mr. Carter's first appointee, followed soon after by Mr. Brzezinski. Mr. Jordan did not quit. 
In both his personal approach to the job and his overall philosophy, Mr. Vance presented a striking contrast to his flamboyant predecessor, Henry A. Kissinger. A calm, publicity-shy diplomat who was more a mediator than a policy maker, Mr. Vance was one of the most modest and unpretentious men ever to hold the post. He was a popular figure around the State Department as he loped through the hallways in his pinstripes or tweeds, occasionally rumpled but always well tailored. 
When he took office, Mr. Vance vowed to limit his travel abroad and eschew Mr. Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy -- a pledge that quickly fell by the wayside. But while he adopted some of Mr. Kissinger's tactics, he harbored doubts about his strategy. Mr. Vance was deeply skeptical that any master plan could provide answers for individual foreign policy problems. He did not think in terms of a Soviet grand design to encircle and undo the West any more than he thought about a grand design for American foreign policy. His method was "to slog it out," putting together solutions to individual problems.
Prof. Norman A. Graebner, a historian of American diplomacy at the University of Virginia, said, "The general attitude toward the acceptance of the Soviet position in the world and the fact that revolutionary pressures in the third world were genuine and that it was America's task to live with those realities was most pronounced during those first Carter years." 
The president and his secretary of state pursued a moderate course, characterized by the strategic arms negotiations, the Panama Canal Treaties, the normalization of relations with China and the settlement that brought majority rule to Zimbabwe, the former British colony that had been known as Rhodesia. During the historic talks at Camp David in 1979, Mr. Vance developed an effective working relationship with two of the Israeli negotiators, Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman. It became crucial in working out the landmark agreement that established peace between Egypt and Israel. 
Mr. Vance shared with Mr. Carter the conviction that the advancement of human rights around the world was in America's national interest. And from his years in the Pentagon, Mr. Vance knew the limits of the use of military force to solve nonmilitary problems. He was secretary of the Army in 1962 when the Army was called in to open the doors of the University of Mississippi to blacks. The walkie-talkies failed, providing a lesson that he still carried years later when he heard of the plan to rescue the hostages in Tehran. If a problem like that could occur in Mississippi, he wondered how a complicated mission in a country in the throes of revolution half a world away could succeed.
But the Carter administration had been rocked by a series of events in 1979: the fall of the shah of Iran, the appearance of a Soviet brigade in Cuba, the fall of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua, the taking of American hostages in Tehran and, finally, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. "All these were attributed to a failure of will and courage on the part of President Carter," Professor Graebner said, and that is when Mr. Carter "went ideological with behavior that became extremely appealing to the right wing.

Really Cool Parrot
 Hard as it may be to believe, there was a time (say, about 30 years ago) when having a black-light poster in your room was the epitome of cool. Black-light posters use inks that fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light, absorbing the UV radiation and re-emitting it as visible light -- preferably in the most garish colors imaginable. 
 In nature, when it comes to the most garish colors imaginable, few animals can beat the parrot. So it is not surprising that parrot plumage contains fluorescent pigments that add to the bird's glowing look in natural light, which contains ultraviolet, as well as visible rays. 
The question for a researcher at the University of Glasgow and colleagues was whether a parrot's fluorescence serves some function. As they report in the journal Science, fluorescence appears to make the parrot the epitome of cool, at least to the opposite sex.
The researchers studied wild budgerigars, or budgies, with fluorescent yellow patches on their crowns and cheeks. The scientists took two budgies of the same sex, and applied sunscreen to the fluorescent plumage of one (to block the absorption of UV and, thus, the fluorescence) and petroleum jelly to the other (which slickens the plumage but does not absorb UV). Then a budgie of the opposite sex was allowed to choose one of the birds for a mate.
The researchers found that the birds showed a significant preference for those without the sunscreen, indicating that fluorescence, far from being just a byproduct of a parrot's pigmentation, is actually an adaptive sexual signal. 

Dual Benefit for Shipping
The ballast water used to stabilize cargo ships has a bad reputation among conservationists for the damage it can cause to ecosystems by introducing invasive marine organisms when it is pumped out in a port or along a coast. Ballast water has a bad reputation among shipping companies, too, because the dissolved oxygen in the water can cause rust and corrosion in the tanks that hold it.
Over the years, techniques have been devised to reduce the problem of invasive species, and other methods have been developed to deal with corrosion. Now, research shows that a new technique may help with both problems. 
The process, developed in Japan, involves bubbling nitrogen gas through the water to deoxygenate it. The technique is intended to prevent corrosion. But the new research, led by a scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California, shows that the deoxygenated water also kills the larvae of several known invaders, including the zebra mussel. 
The researchers, who published their work in the journal Biological Conservation, point out that deoxygenation would probably not kill all potentially invasive species. But because it provides an economic benefit to shippers, by reducing the need for expensive repainting or other treatments for corroded tanks, it may be more likely to be used than other methods for killing organisms in ballast water that do not offer such economic incentives.

The Interfering Iceberg
A giant Antarctic iceberg that has been slowly drifting since it broke off the Ross Ice Shelf nearly two years ago is posing a threat to emperor and Adelie penguins on Ross Island. The iceberg is jammed up against the northern coast of the island, forcing breeding penguins to cross it to reach the sea and food for their young. An official with New Zealand's Antarctic agency estimated that the birds had to walk an additional 30 miles each way.
The time and distance involved can leave the birds with little food for their offspring. The survival rate of penguin chicks, already fairly low, may be reduced even further. Emperor and Adelie penguins have large breeding colonies, numbering in the tens of thousands of breeding pairs, on the island.

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD; 
In an 1881 Ballet, Optimism as It Used to Be

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS Jan. 14

 BODY:
Innocence can be disturbing. Yes, on a wintry Paris evening early in the 21st century, it can be a tad unsettling to be abruptly transported to the sunny optimism of the late 19th century, when Science was conquering Backwardness for the sake of Humanity and Western nations were celebrating a relatively peaceful European century around the flag of Progress.
 Still, in its day, the triumph of civilization seemed credible. In 1881, the idea was translated into a ballet called "Excelsior" that ran at La Scala in Milan for 103 performances. Two years later, it played to packed houses in Paris for nine months before touring Rome, Naples, Turin, Florence, Venice, London, Vienna and St. Petersburg. It then returned to Paris for 300 more performances to coincide with the Universal Exhibition of 1889. It spoke for an era. 
 This month, for its first visit to the Palais Garnier, La Scala Ballet again brought "Excelsior" to Paris, albeit for just five performances, ending last Saturday. But times are different. The 20th century buried innocence and with it the illusion that science and technology could tame humanity's worst instincts. Today a ballet that confidently portrays Light defeating Obscurantism can at most stir nostalgia for a paradise lost.
Still, as choreography, "Excelsior" did not stop the clock. Late-19th-century productions involving as many as 600 dancers, as well as elephants and horses, may be a thing of the past, but this work created a new form of dance, one that led not to the narrative ballets of Marius Petipa or the abstract choreography of George Balanchine, but to the high-kicking showgirls of the music hall and Broadway. "Excelsior" was a cradle of popular entertainment.
The "Excelsior" presented here this month (and for six performances in Milan starting Jan. 24) is an updated and slimmed-down version of Luigi Manzotti's 1881 choreography that was created in 1967 by Ugo Dell'Ara, with Romualdo Marenco's original music arranged by Fiorenzo Carpi and Bruno Nicolai. Their objective was to reduce the number of dancers to a more modest 100 or so and to simplify the narrative. Even so, the ballet's kitsch spirit survives.
Manzotti, who also created ballets called "Amor" and "Sport," was of course being utterly serious. "It is the titanic battle of Progress against Retrogression that I offer to the public of Milan," he wrote of "Excelsior." "It is the greatness of Civilization that, for the good of all peoples, destroys the ancient power of Obscurantism that kept them in the shadows of slavery and ignominy." "Excelsior" was soon known as a ballet a la Jules Verne.
The work is a series of ornate tableaus that successively portray the arrival of the first steamboat, the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, the discovery of the electric battery by Alessandro Volta, the invention of the telegraph, the opening of the Suez Canal, the first attempt to build a canal across Panama and the tunneling under Mount Cenis that linked Italy and France in 1871. The last of 11 scenes, "Apotheosis," is a festival of nations with flag-waving dancers decked out in symbolic costumes.
The struggle between good and evil is personified by Light (Viviana Durante) and Civilization (Isabel Seabra), aided by the newly liberated Slave (Roberto Bolle), who together try to outwit the maneuvers of Obscurantism (Mick Zeni), a skeletal figure who dances and mimes his victories and setbacks until he is finally swallowed up by the earth. Other dancers represent Peace, Perseverance, Courage, Invention, Human Genius, Concord, Cosmopolitanism and, most appropriately, two civil engineers.
Manzotti's optimism reflected the upbeat mood of Italy just 20 years after it finally achieved unification. An economic and cultural boom was feeding confidence in the future, while the values of a new bourgeoisie reinforced national pride and faith in the superiority of Western civilization. And in philosophical terms, Romanticism was giving way to Positivism: progress could now be quantified.
"Excelsior" also allowed Manzotti to display progress in stage machinery. And in the spirit of a grand spectacle, this production, directed by Filippo Crivelli, shows a steamboat following two rowboats onstage, as well as a train crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, the flashes of Volta's new battery, a ship waiting to enter the Suez Canal, the meeting of the tunnel diggers under Mount Cenis and the sky opening up for the "Apotheosis."
Marenco's score is similarly descriptive, echoing Turkish and Middle Eastern airs for the Suez scene, borrowing mechanical sounds to portray machines, telegraphs and pickaxes, putting wind and percussion to work when Obscurantism is up to no good and peppering the final festival of nations with borrowed phrases from the likes of "La Marseillaise" and "God Save the Queen."
The solos and pas de deux offer insight into the prevailing classical style before the Ballets Russes shattered traditional choreography 30 years later. But it is the ensemble dancing that in its day was both daring and innovative, not only because of its high kicks, but also because of the geometric forms created by successive groups. Understandably, given the later popularity of showgirl dancing, Mr. Crivelli and his team were wary of presenting a parody.
But they did not shrink from parading kitsch before a Paris audience that was successively amused and amazed. Whether it was through angelic harpists with wings, muscular Moors wearing pencil-thin moustaches, tribesmen in flowing turbans, little boys with blackened faces and dark wigs or flag-carrying dancers in costumes that made them look like patriotic cheerleaders, the Palais Garnier was given a glimpse of utopia a la Manzotti.
The problem with utopias is that they can be adapted to every occasion. Thus in the 1930's a production of "Excelsior" in the Teatro San Carlos in Naples turned the "Apotheosis" scene into a paean to Fascist Italy. On the other hand, the ballet was revived in Florence in 1967 to lift that city's spirits after the disastrous floods there a year earlier. Manzotti clearly jumped the gun in announcing the arrival of a better tomorrow, but perhaps he should not be faulted for offering it as a goal.

HEADLINE: Mixed Blessings of Canada's Currency 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
The Krave's Candy Company of Winnipeg, Manitoba, exports about half of its Clodhoppers chocolate-and-cashew-nut candies to the United States. Likewise, Nova Chemicals of Calgary, Alberta, ships a big fraction of its polyethylene output south across the border.
 At first glance, they and other Canadian exporters ought to be jumping for joy at the unremitting decline in the Canadian dollar's value against the American dollar, because their costs are paid in the cheap currency and much of their revenue earned in the rich one. 
 But Krave's and Nova have very different tales to tell. 
Krave's is indeed reaping the benefits of a weak currency. "It has helped us tremendously this past year," said Christopher Emery, a co-founder of the company. At the beginning of 2001, Krave's built its budget on an assumption of each American dollar turning into 1.4 Canadian dollars; it wound up averaging about 1.57 Canadian for each American dollar, and the difference, Mr. Emery said, "is gravy."
But Nova has been hammered by the same exchange-rate trend. In 2000, Nova thought the Canadian dollar had gone as low as it could, and it adopted a strategy of hedging against the risk of a rise. The strategy assumed that the Canadian dollar would not fall below 70 American cents in value (about 1.43 to the dollar); when it averaged 67 American cents for the year, the hedging reduced Nova's earnings by 16 million Canadian dollars. 
The company continued to hedge last year, but it said it would not report the results until its 2001 annual report is published in the spring.
The value of the Canadian dollar peaked at $1.04 in April 1974 and has fallen more or less steadily since then. In 2001 it lost 6.25 percent of its value and briefly reached a record low of 62.3 American cents on Dec. 24; yesterday it was worth 62.71 cents.
Though the Canadian economy has not slowed as much as that of the United States, it may not pick up as rapidly either, which may further undermine the currency. "The market has a perception that Canada will lag the United States in recovery," said Edward Carmichael, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Canada in Toronto. If that happens, "we'll see the currency stay at these levels or go even weaker."
Still, Mr. Carmichael sees reason for optimism in a forecast for improved commodity prices in the second half of the year, which could strengthen the Canadian dollar. 
Meanwhile, to try to stimulate the stagnating economy, the Bank of Canada is widely expected to cut its target for overnight interest rates, presently at 2.25 percent, by another quarter-point on Tuesday, a move that would make holding Canadian dollars even less attractive.
The weak currency has made many Canadian exporters more competitive in the United States market, by allowing them to cut prices or to invest in improvements at the same prices.
And the United States is increasingly the only market that matters: America now takes almost seven-eighths of Canadian exports, a share that has risen steadily since Ottawa and Washington signed a free trade agreement in 1988 and joined with Mexico in the North American free trade agreement in 1994. Canada is also the United States' biggest trading partner.
Krave's Candy illustrates this trend, too. It exported nothing two years ago. But the weakening Canadian dollar "got us to the table," Mr. Emery said. "I don't know if we could do it at 1.3 to the dollar."
Gerald B. Fedchun, president of the Canadian Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association, gives the weakening dollar at least some of the credit for a surge in his members' output, from 12.5 billion Canadian dollars' worth in 1991 to 30 billion last year. "It gives us a bit of a competitive edge," Mr. Fedchun said. "We've certainly increased our market share."
But the currency's decline is "really a double-edged sword," said Jayson Myers, chief economist at Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, an industry group based in Ottawa.
Many Canadian companies, including exporters, are also big importers of American goods, especially the goods most needed to step up productivity and compete successfully without the crutch of a falling exchange rate -- machinery, computers and telecommunications equipment. Recruiting highly qualified employees from outside the country is also more difficult.
According to Mr. Myers, the weak currency has also made it more difficult for Canadian subsidiaries of American companies to get a green light for new products and investments. From the parent's point of view, he said, "as the dollar falls, the value of their investment also falls."
Dennis Darby, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble's Canadian unit, said that while his company offers the same brands to consumers in Canada and the United States, in Canada "we may not have as many variants." Mr. Darby said that "exchange rates are always a factor on where we do our sourcing and where we're going to launch our products."
Exporters like Nova that thought they saw a bottom for the currency have paid dearly. The forward contracts, options and other hedging devices they used in recent years to lock in what looked like low exchange rates had to be unwound at a loss when the rate fell even lower. 
"The irony is that companies that locked in future receivables at the best rates in history have lost money," said Barry M. Wainstein, head of global foreign exchange and money markets at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.
As a result, many Canadian companies have scaled back their hedging programs. Lorne Gorber, director of investor relations at Abitibi-Consolidated, said the company, a Montreal-based pulp and paper producer, was still doing some hedging, but had shortened its programs from three to two years, and was "not doing as much as in the past."
Each move of one United States cent in the value of the Canadian dollar moves Abitibi's operating profit by 36 million Canadian dollars and its net earnings by 21 million Canadian dollars.
Despite the bargain-basement exchange rate, total Canadian exports to the United States have been down in recent months -- by 11 percent in October 2001, compared with October 2000. Analysts said the effects of the exchange rate on trade flows are being outweighed, at least for now, by weakening demand south of the border.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
A Cloud Over Sundance, But the Parties Go On

BYLINE:  By ELVIS MITCHELL 

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
In the opening of the documentary "Derrida," a blissful examination of the life of the philosopher Jacques Derrida by the directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman, a blur of movement whooshes across the screen while a voice says, "There's a future which is predictable."
 This kernel of reflection from "Derrida" summarizes the fare here at the Sundance Film Festival, which is celebrating the Sundance Institute's 20th anniversary.. 
 There's the anticipation of the films in the drama competition, which street buzz indicated would be stronger than it has been, and the audience's hopes swell.
Then when the lights go down in the theaters, the predictable future emerges through many of the movies at the festival. 
The combination of several factors has shaped feelings about the festival beyond this. There is the important anniversary for an event that has visibly altered the shape of filmmaking, and there is the residue of the slumping economy. Though Main Street was a scramble of visitors dashing from one party to the next, as it was last year, a bit of a cloud hangs over the festival. Perhaps the absence of the competing Slamdance Festival on Main Street -- it was moved to another location away from the center of the action last year -- and its alternative energy is also being felt a little this year. Add up all of these elements and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, and the sum is a year in which no one feels much like celebrating.
Yet one of the best films so far this year at Sundance -- and yes, this is a documentary -- is a celebration: "Amandla! A Revolution in Four Part Harmony," a filmed look at the triumph of the blacks in South Africa over the brutal reign of apartheid through the subversive power of music. The picture uses the music of the slain activist and performer Vuyisile Mini, whose songs were so mesmerizing and lovely that white schoolteachers would insist on having the children sing them, blind to the protest lodged deep in each song; Mini's artistry brings to mind the effects of the spirituals sung by African-American slaves, which also vibrated with coded messages of rage and sadness. 
A particularly stirring portion of the film, directed by Lee Hirsch, shows Mini's friends and family singing one of his songs as his body is exhumed for reburial. (He was originally interred in a potter's field.) 
The waves of emotion evoked by the suffering described on camera by peppery, talented people robbed of youth but not of dignity becomes a living thing. And even though apartheid has been over for more than a decade, the wounds still ooze and the music is a reminder of the country's racist horrors and of the resourcefulness of those who fought it.
Several documentaries focus on vastly different topics, eccentrics being one. Ray Johnson, the artist and antic surrealist, is the willful oddball subject of director Andrew Moore's film, "How to Draw a Bunny." Mr. Moore's work has a structure not dissimilar to a murder mystery, one in which the victim's life is unfurled to make sense of the impact he had on the world.
His agent is unabashed in describing Johnson as a demanding client, while another says Johnson's abrasiveness grew out of his approach to life: "Everything was like a work of art." Johnson's languid, distracted manner is slightly maddening in the interview section and in scenes of him whipping through one of his performance pieces. (He's slightly confounded by the reaction to one of his stagings, in which he dropped foot-long hot dogs from a helicopter; people ate them.)
As for "Derrida," it is a pleasure to watch as the subject shows himself to be self-deprecating, quick-witted and self-aware, even making fun of his own vanity while making statements that require pondering.
Given that this is an important anniversary for the festival, it's fitting that the familiar faces were present in more than the documentary films. Mark Ruffalo, a co-star in "You Can Count on Me," which ran at the 2000 Sundance Festival, bravely pours himself into the role of a self-absorbed weasel in "XX/XY," an intermittently successful comedy-drama about Gen X-ers falling in and out of bed. It reflects the independent cinema of 1993 as well as being partly set in that year.
John Malkovich makes the transition from actor and movie subject to director with "The Dancer Upstairs," one of the Sundance premieres. Mr. Malkovich's deftness with actors and material is informed by maturity, regret and pained wit; it resonates with the forlorn emotional intelligence of Graham Greene. Set in Latin America, the picture follows an investigator (Javier Bardem in a seemingly placid turn that gathers momentum and thoughtfulness) tracking down a mysterious and increasingly mythic revolutionary leader. Though the picture has its longueurs, its rhythms take hold and pull you in. It makes assumptions of its audience's patience (like the films of Raul Ruiz, whom Mr. Malkovich has worked with) that it rewards.
Quentin Tarantino has not been present, but his influence was well represented. One of the films in the dramatic competition, "Narc," a crackle of a noir by the director Joe Carnahan, is an heir to the ultraviolent genre assault of Mr. Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs," which signaled a shift in the independent film world when it had its premiere at Sundance 10 years ago..
The film, which features Jason Patric as a down-on-his-luck cop assigned to keep an eye on a fellow detective (Ray Liotta), has a greatest-hits smell. Mr. Patric is back in the ratty demimonde he inhabited in "Rush." Mr. Liotta slams through the sets doing another volatile cop, and the climax -- with two men tied to chairs and tortured -- is a bloody nod to Mr. Tarantino. Still, it's compelling. "Narc" has the velocity of a hot slug from the barrel of a gun.
Sundance runs through Sunday. It's identity has yet to be fully shaped. It's still early with many movies ahead.

HEADLINE: Net Surges 69% at Fannie Mae On Record Mortgage Activity 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
Fannie Mae, the largest buyer of United States mortgages, said today that its fourth-quarter net income rose 69 percent as homeowners refinanced loans at a record pace and lower interest rates cut its cost of capital.
 The company, one of three government-sponsored enterprises involved in the housing market, posted net income of $1.97 billion, or $1.92 a share, compared with net income of $1.16 billion, or $1.12 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 Excluding the effect of changes in the market value of its derivatives holdings and a one-time accounting change, Fannie Mae said it earned $1.44 billion, or $1.40 a share, a penny above analysts' expectations. 
The prospect that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low to bolster the economy this year may help Fannie Mae by keeping mortgage rates around 7 percent, making homes more affordable for consumers, investors said.
"They are one of only five companies that have compounded earnings growth of at least 14 percent a year since 1987, and I don't see any reason for that to end in 2002," said Walter Harrison, portfolio manager of the Granum Value Fund.
Shares of Fannie Mae, based in Washington, rose 95 cents, to $79.
Fannie Mae, along with Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank system, is a government-sponsored enterprise. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are shareholder-owned companies that buy mortgages from banks and lenders. The companies hold the loans or package them into bonds that are sold to investors. 
The company's mortgage investments grew $101 billion, to $698 billion last year as banks made a record $2 trillion in mortgage loans. For 2002, the National Association of Realtors expects mortgage rates to average 7.3 percent, up from 6.96 percent in 2001. Even so, the trade group expects home sales to fall just 0.5 percent from 2001's record pace.

Atrade group will issue voluntary guidelines aimed at measuring Internet campaigns.

BYLINE:  By Andrew Zipern 

 BODY:
IN an effort to standardize the often puzzling formulas used to gauge the effectiveness of Internet marketing, a trade group will release a set of guidelines today for measuring online advertising campaigns.
 The Interactive Advertising Bureau, a New York-based trade group generally referred to as the I.A.B., developed the voluntary guidelines in collaboration with eight prominent Web publishers and two advertising technology firms. According to the group, the 10 participants creating the specifications together represent nearly two-thirds of total industry revenue. 
 The Ad Campaign Measurement and Audit Guidelines are intended to make uniform the various incompatible systems that evaluate the viewing (and clicking) of Internet advertisements. Although marketers once praised the accountability of Internet ad delivery, they have subsequently de-emphasized it. The once much vaunted measurability of Internet advertisements has revealed that the path a consumer takes from seeing an ad on a Web page to actually making a purchase is rather lightly traveled. 
"The problem is that the click-through is not really a good measure," said Hairong Li, an assistant professor of advertising at Michigan State University and the editor of the Journal of Interactive Advertising. "People won't click unless they have a real need at that moment," he said. "But even if you do not click, you still see the message. So we've found that branding is really the essence of advertising."
But branding is tricky to quantify in any medium, and lacking basic standardization, it has been exceedingly hard to track online. "Everybody has measured things differently," said Greg Stuart, the president of the bureau. "They weren't doing anything wrong. But there was no standard identified so that publishers, agencies and advertisers were all on the same page."
The bureau says that its new guidelines will drastically cut down on confusion and data discrepancies. According to Mr. Brown, the new methodology will ultimately provide "the building blocks to do rating points and reach frequency, which is the language and the tools of media planners, and a language we need to speak; it's the foundation for pushing the industry forward."
A team of consultants from PricewaterhouseCoopers took six months to complete what is known as the process audit, and came up with five crucial measures to gauge Internet marketing: ad impressions, clicks, page impressions, total visits and unique visits.
Tom Hyland, the chairman of the PricewaterhouseCoopers New Media Group, said participants were already using each of these yardsticks but often in different ways. He also said that the new standards would make possible independent verification and auditing of advertising data, similar to that done in financial accounting or print circulation.
Trying to stay afloat during the worst media recession in years, advertisers and Web publishers have recently grown increasingly aggressive in their online marketing efforts. Techniques that were once considered offensive -- like the use of pop-under ads or commercials with unexpected audio -- have become common even on mainstream Web sites.
Still, the state of online advertising is not as desperate as some in the old media make it out to be. According to Jupiter Media Metrix, an Internet research firm, total online ad spending was almost $5.69 billion last year, or more than 3 percent of the total advertising market. Furthermore, total online ad dollars spent -- and the percentage of the entire advertising market those dollars represent -- have sharply increased each year since 1996. Jupiter Media Metrix predicts that over $15 billion a year, or fully 7 percent of all advertising spending, will move online by 2006.
Given the industry's overall growth, some participants in the process seemed surprised that a commonly agreed upon ratings standard had not been established earlier. "We apologize for having taken so long," Mr. Stuart said. "But the retrenching has allowed us to get very focused."
Mr. Stuart indicated that meeting the voluntary guidelines could cost some publishers and marketing companies hundreds of thousands of dollars. Scott Spencer, a director of product management at DoubleClick, the Internet advertising network, said his company was already "very close to meeting all of the requirements that the bureau agreed to, without needing any changes."
Once in common use, Mr. Spencer said, the new standards "will make the marketplace much more efficient and take out uncertainty for advertisers and publishers alike." In addition to the advertising technology companies Avenue A and DoubleClick, AOL, CNET, Disney, Forbes Online, MSN, Terra Lycos, New York Times Digital and Yahoo participated in the bureau's review process.
Anke Audenaert, director of global market research for Yahoo, said the standards were largely a response to the "advertisers that have been asking for it." Most advertisers used the same rating concepts, she said, "but each defined the concepts differently."
Because the bureau's guidelines are voluntary -- "for antitrust reasons," Mr. Stuart said -- there is some question whether they will be widely adopted. I/PRO, a San Francisco-based Internet company, issued similar ad traffic measurement guidelines yesterday, saying they were "the online auditing industry's first public standard."
Jeff Dieffenbach, I/PRO's director of product management, said the standards could be used for general traffic measurement as well as ad measurement.
The I/PRO guidelines, however, were a surprise to Mr. Stuart. "I really thought their business had closed," he said. "The I.A.B. is the only organization that can bring to bear this kind of change in the industry."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: KABUL; 
U.N. Pleads for Afghan Aid While U.S. Jets Raid Compound

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
With Afghanistan's interim government unable to pay its workers and foreign aid only trickling in, the United Nations made an impassioned plea today to foreign governments, asking them to increase their financial donations.
 A spokesman for the United Nations, Ahmad Fawzi, said Afghanistan needed $100 million within a few days to pay six months of back salaries, as well as the next six months of wages, to its 235,000 employees. Less than $10 million has been given. 
 "The administration needs several million dollars tomorrow or there will be no country when the billions are ready," Mr. Fawzi said at a briefing here in the Afghan capital. "It is time for the international community to stop talking and start delivering help." 
Afghanistan did win a promise of money from its neighbor, Pakistan, with whom it has had a thorny relationship, not least because Islamabad supported Taliban rule. Pakistan said today that it would donate $100 million to Afghanistan.
While diplomats here worked to rebuild the nation, American warplanes bombed a Qaeda training compound at Zawar Kili near the Pakistani border today for the 10th time in 11 days, but senior Pentagon officials said the operation was nearly complete.
Senior military officials said recent bombing at Zawar Kili had destroyed nearly 60 buildings, closed 50 cave entrances and demolished tanks and artillery equipment at the 9-square-mile complex which has been used by Al Qaeda to store equipment and train and hide soldiers moving into Pakistan. "It is now time to go look elsewhere," said Rear Adm. John D. Stufflebeem, the deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Senior military officials also said the Pentagon is reviewing plans to cut back on the fighter-jet patrols flying over New York City, Washington and, sporadically, 30 other American cities since Sept. 11. 
The officials said the patrols have become an immense strain on crews, while also costing the Pentagon more than $100 million a month. Scaling the missions back, however, could run into opposition from local politicians who want to maintain a sense of security in their cities.
Senior military officials said the North American Aerospace Defense Command was preparing to recommend that the Pentagon scale back patrols over American cities, while increasing the number of aircraft on "ground alert." 
As part of the Pentagon's desire to decrease its presence in Afghanistan, it was sending to Cuba those prisoners who could provide no further information regarding the war, Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley of the United States Central Command said today. "We don't want to be a long-term presence on the ground in Afghanistan," he said. "To put semipermanent detention facilities there doesn't pass the common-sense test." The United States is now holding 414 prisoners in Afghanistan.
Among the prisoners sent to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were an Australian, David Hicks, and at least one British citizen, whose identity has not been confirmed. A spokesman for the British Embassy said the prisoner had identified himself as British but had no passport.
As many as six other British citizens are believed to have been captured in Afghanistan, but it is not clear where they are being held. Six French citizens have also been captured, but a spokesman for the French Embassy said his government had not been told that any of them had been sent to Guantanamo.
All of the allies have expressed concern that their citizens not be exposed to the death penalty, which could be a complicating factor as the Pentagon figures out what to do with the prisoners. Victoria Clarke , a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, said that the United States had not yet begun interrogating the prisoners in Cuba, suggesting that specific charges could be some time away.
While international humanitarian organizations have complained that the prisoners are being caged in inhumane conditions, she insisted that they were being treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention, but also appropriately, given what is thought to be their capacity for violence. "You're talking about people who are incredibly dangerous -- incredibly dangerous -- who are willing to blow themselves up or do anything possible to hurt and kill others," Ms. Clarke said.
The international peacekeeping force is also taking shape more slowly than expected. German troops began joint patrols with Afghan soldiers in Kabul today. But the number of peacekeepers on the ground is only 1,100 of a planned total of 4,500.
A British Army spokesman, Maj. Guy Richardson, said the force would not reach full strength until mid-February, almost a month late. He did not explain the delay. --------------------

Call to Topple Iraqi Leader
(By The New York Times), WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 -- Increasing the pressure on the Bush administration to expand the war beyond Afghanistan, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democrats' vice presidential nominee in 2000, said the battle against terrorism would not be won until President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was toppled.
"The unique threat to American security by Saddam Hussein's regime is so real, grave and imminent that, even if no other nation were to stand with us, we must be prepared to act alone," said Mr. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2004. He is also a co-sponsor in the Senate of legislation to finance opposition forces in Iraq.
"If we make it clear that we are prepared to act decisively against Saddam, I am convinced that many others will join us," he said in a speech at Georgetown University.

HEADLINE: Many on Campuses Disdain Historian's Practice 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
After accusations first surfaced that the author Stephen E. Ambrose had copied passages of Prof. Thomas Childers's book on World War II aviators, Professor Childers surprised colleagues and students at the University of Pennsylvania by saying he would continue to use Mr. Ambrose's books in his classes.
 But as it became apparent that Mr. Ambrose had failed to attribute language from other people's work in his latest book, "The Wild Blue," Professor Childers stood before his packed lecture class on World War II and announced he would cease using the popular historian's books. 
 The revelations about Mr. Ambrose's book are fueling a debate on several campuses over whether universities should continue to assign works by scholars who have been accused of appropriating someone else's work. The discussion is lively at Penn, where similarities between passages in Mr. Ambrose's best seller and Professor Childers's 1995 account of his uncle's aviation crew, "Wings of Morning," tripped the first disclosures over Mr. Ambrose's prose. But it also extends to the University of Virginia, where some professors are pondering whether to use Mr. Ambrose's work amid an unfolding plagiarism scandal that has led to the expulsion of 17 students over the last year. While professors appear somewhat divided in their reactions, students at this urban Ivy League campus appeared to favor dropping Mr. Ambrose's work. They note that Penn, like most other universities, has strict rules against cheating and plagiarism, forbidding students from using published materials without thorough attribution. They said there should not be a double standard. 
"They're telling us not to plagiarize," Sumit Walia, a sophomore majoring in economics, said on his way to class this morning. "But what kind of message does it send if they accept it at the very highest levels?"
Ray Groller, a sophomore chemistry major, also opposed using Mr. Ambrose's books, a debate that has played out in the student newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian.
"Teachers are supposed to be role models in students lives," Mr. Groller said. "They should try to lead by example."
He said he had found himself tempted "lots of times" to appropriate quotations he had come across and pass them off as his own. "But the thought of the consequences kept me from doing it," he said. 
Still, there is a great deal of disagreement. At Virginia, Kenneth W. Thompson, a history professor, said he would continue to assign Mr. Ambrose's "Rise to Globalism" in his course on American foreign policy.
"If we discontinued books that I at least have used because of some evidence of human fallibility, I'd run out of books tomorrow," Professor Thompson said. "This is an imperfect world with people who do make mistakes."
While Mr. Ambrose's scholarly works, including biographies of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon, are mainstays of college reading lists, his more recent works appear on them less frequently.
Mr. Ambrose did not respond to a request for comment, but he has told The New York Times that he did not consider his mistake to be plagiarism. He said that if he came across passages from another author that fit the story he was telling, he would drop the passages into his text and credit the book in footnotes. Most scholars concur that such extended passages require the use of quotation marks. Mr. Ambrose has apologized for his technique.
Among academics, Mr. Ambrose's popularity had provoked soul searching and no small measure of envy. History professors on Internet chat groups wondered what the success of Mr. Ambrose and other popular historians said about their own failure to write readable books. 
"The reason why historians tend to get envious -- and there's lots of Schadenfreude about Stephen Ambrose -- is that we don't tell good stories," said David Carlton, a history professor at Vanderbilt University who had participated in a chat session.
Also mentioned in the broader campus discussions about professional integrity is Joseph J. Ellis, author of the Pulitzer-Prize winning book "Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation." Professor Ellis was suspended from teaching at Mount Holyoke College after admitting that in classroom talks he had falsely claimed to have served in Vietnam. But his scholarship has not been questioned, and there has been no movement to drop his books in college courses. 
Professor Carlton said historians had misgivings about the trade-offs they suspected Mr. Ambrose and other popular writers of making, and he noted that Mr. Ellis, for one, "got in trouble for turning that storytelling technique to his own life." 
"What Ambrose did is something I could haul students before the honor council for," Professor Carlton said. "And I actually have students who have trouble understanding why they should be hauled before the honor council for doing something like that."
Professor Childers said that while he initially praised Mr. Ambrose's swift apology, his feelings changed when he read the author's description of his method. It was not just a matter of using quotation marks, the professor said, but of toiling to write a good passage rather than appropriating one.
"I just can't conceive of that," Professor Childers said in his office, after reading Mr. Ambrose's comments aloud. "It doesn't take so much effort. Find the words. Write it yourself."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Help Points Troubled Man Toward Bachelor's Degree

BYLINE:  By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
Peter Beltre lives by his favorite expression.
 "You can give a problem a million dollars," he likes to say, "but that won't make it go away." 
 Mr. Beltre, a 35-year-old Bronx resident who has manic depression and bipolar disorder, has found ways to live a productive life despite his mental illness. 
"I overcame my depression through a lot of hard work," he said, "and by setting goals for myself that I'm now achieving."
A native New Yorker, Mr. Beltre said his problems began when he went to Boston College in 1984 on an academic grant that covered one year's tuition. After that, he could no longer afford to go, and had to come home and live with his parents.
"I loved Boston College," he said. "I had so many friends there, but after a while, I barely had enough in my pockets to go and see a movie."
In 1986, Mr. Beltre enrolled at the City College of the City University of New York. Two years later, he took a leave of absence to work as an activities coordinator for Club Med. 
"That was one of the best things I ever did in my life," he said. "I got to see places like Florida, the Bahamas and Martinique, places I could never afford to see now."
By 1992, Mr. Beltre was back in New York and living on his own.
"Suddenly," he said, "the pressure of life, the responsibility of having to work for a living, to pay bills and take care of myself, started to affect me. I didn't have that bachelor's degree I needed, either, and the whole thing just started to get me down."
Unhappy with who he was and with everything he had not achieved, he went from job to job, unable to get his life on track. "My thoughts just became incoherent, and I couldn't sleep at night," he said. "I was an overachiever who wanted to do more things in life, and I became frustrated and hyperactive."
Mr. Beltre began getting therapy and taking medication. In 1998, he found a job he liked, earning $15 a hour as an electrician at a Manhattan hotel. By January 2000, however, Mr. Beltre said his mental state began deteriorating again.
"I was disgusted with it, and determined to beat it," he said. "I recognized my symptoms, so I took myself to a hospital and went from there."
Mr. Beltre said that he spent one month in the hospital but that by the time he was able to work again, he had lost his hotel job, and began falling behind on his rent.
Then came a number of frustrating months as Mr. Beltre tried catching up on his rent, which is $720 a month. He used up his savings and worked whenever or wherever possible to make at least partial rent payments on his one-bedroom apartment just blocks from Fordham University in the Bronx.
At the time, he was getting $524 a month in Social Security disability, but after groceries and day-to-day living expenses, there was not much left for the rent, he said.
Eventually, Mr. Beltre owed his landlord $3,600.
"That was the low point," he said. "I needed help, badly."
It arrived in different forms. 
Mr. Beltre got a $2,000 loan from Social Security, and managed to earn an additional $1,100. 
The remaining $500 was provided in February by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"For Mr. Beltre, that money served as a bridge over a difficult time," said Bonda Lee-Cunningham, the director of member services at the agency. "With a little help, we thought he'd be on his way."
He was. After paying the back rent, Mr. Beltre continued to turn his life around.
Last January, he got married, and by spring he had enrolled full time at CUNY's New York City Technical College in Brooklyn. In October, Mr. Beltre and his wife, Teresa Morales, had a daughter, Karen.
He also learned that some of his credits were able to be transferred from City College to his new school, leaving him just two semesters shy of a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.
In addition to his disability income, Mr. Beltre now collects $250 a month in unemployment benefits that he can continue to get through May, while he goes to school. 
"Things are finally working out for me," he said. "I have a wife who loves me and a beautiful daughter, and that has really helped me cure my mental illness. Now I just want to get this degree, and get myself back in the rat race."

FLEETBOSTON DELAYS RELEASE OF ITS RESULTS

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The FleetBoston Financial Corporation, a banking and financial services company, said yesterday that it would delay releasing its quarterly results until later this month because it wants to assess how the financial crisis in Argentina will affect its loans there. The company, based in Boston, was originally scheduled to release results on Wednesday. 
FleetBoston said that excluding the undetermined effect related to Argentina, its fourth-quarter earnings will be in line with the 3 cents a share that it had forecast in December. FleetBoston has about $6 billion in loans and an additional $475 million in government debt in Argentina. Last month it announced a $150 million charge to write down Argentine government securities and loans, bringing total Argentine-related charges to $200 million last year.

HEADLINE: AT&T and Others Brace for Trouble From Argentina 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Argentina's currency devaluation and debt default could create problems for some of the biggest United States and European telecommunications companies.
 Already, the international arm of the United States wireless carrier Nextel Communications has missed a debt payment to banks, mainly as a result of the Argentine crisis. And other telecommunications companies with a big presence in Argentina -- including AT&T, BellSouth, Verizon Communications and Telefonica of Spain -- all could feel the pinch of a decline in hard-currency revenue and could find themselves in uncertainty over planning as they await regulatory changes. 
 Venture capital investors are also exposed, including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst of Dallas, which financed the expansion of telecommunications and cable television companies within Argentina and into neighboring countries. 
"We already knew when we got into Argentina that doing business here is different than in Europe or the U.S.," Alejandro Rossi, general manager of Argentine operations for AT&T Latin America, said in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires. "But the situation is so uncertain that it's not prudent to decide anything right now." 
Argentina has welcomed foreign telecommunications investment since the early 1990's. Just two years ago, it was considered one of the industry's most dynamic Latin American markets, despite a recession that had already begun. Argentina's currency board system, which pegged the peso to the dollar and effectively put the nation's monetary policy in the hands of the United States Federal Reserve, also made Argentina one of the most stable and, for some companies, profitable telecommunications markets -- with revenue in dollars and, in some cases, rate increases pegged to the Consumer Price Index in the United States.
In all, foreign companies invested more than $12 billion in Argentina the last decade, building a highly sophisticated telecommunications network replete with mobile phones, fiber optic systems and Internet services centers. About half that foreign investment came the last two years, after Argentina largely deregulated telecommunications. 
But four years of recession and an abrupt shift in exchange rate policy this month, which allowed the peso to devalue at least 40 percent in trading on Friday, have put considerable strain on the foreign telephone companies and their Argentine subsidiaries. Few of the ventures are turning a profit, and some, like the international arm of Nextel, have begun to default on their obligations.
That unit, Nextel International, which provides wireless telephone service mainly to businesses in Argentina and three other countries in Latin America, missed an $8.3 million payment to banks on Dec. 31. Nextel followed Impsat Fiber Networks, an Argentine company backed by Morgan Stanley and British Telecommunications, which missed a $13.9 million bond payment earlier last month. Nextel and Impsat have hired the same Los Angeles investment bank, Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, to help restructure their debt.
Even with government-approved rate increases expected in coming months, revenue for the Argentine telecommunications industry is expected to decline this year to $7.79 billion from $7.87 billion in 2001, according to Pyramid Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. Before the crisis, Pyramid had been projecting revenue of $8.6 billion.
As foreign players came into Argentina, the number of telephones for 100 inhabitants climbed to 22 in 2001, from only 10 in 1990, according to the International Telecommunications Union.
By last year, however, growth of conventional telephone service appeared to reach a plateau, while growth rates for wireless and data communications services also slowed, said Jonathan Tirone, a Pyramid analyst. The slowdown comes at a bad time for companies like OptiGlobe of Bethesda, Md., which operates centers in Latin America that play host to other companies' Web sites.
"Argentina has been very frustrating for us," said Bob Rouse, chief executive of OptiGlobe, which spent more than $80 million the last two years to build a sophisticated data center in Buenos Aires. "We have to consider our investment there a sunk cost."
Mr. Rouse said the devaluation would actually be positive for operations in Argentina, even though revenue, when transferred from devalued pesos to dollars, is expected to decline 30 to 40 percent. This is because most operating expenses, like salaries for local employees, will also be in pesos, requiring fewer dollars to cover expenses for the unprofitable subsidiary. 
Although some foreign companies see devaluation as providing a temporary respite for expenses, the investments remain denominated in hard currency. So the prospect of declining hard-currency revenue worries the biggest investors in the sector, which are pinning their hopes on further rate increases from the federal government.
The largest United States telephone companies in Argentina, BellSouth and Verizon Communications, are anxiously watching events. Spokesmen for both companies said they had no plans to trim their Argentine holdings for now, mainly because their Argentine operations account for only a fraction of each company's overall business. 
BellSouth's Movicom unit, for example, which began offering wireless service in Argentina in 1989, accounts for less than 2 percent of overall revenue. And Verizon's CTI Holdings wireless unit in Argentina contributes less than 2 percent of total sales.
But like most other foreign telephone companies, BellSouth and Verizon are deferring any new large investments in Argentina until basic economic policies in the country are better defined. As a result, communications officials in Argentina now worry that technological innovation could come to a halt.
The return to uncertainty for telecommunications and other industries in Argentina is reminiscent of the situation in South America before governments in the region embarked on nationalization programs at different stages in the 20th century, according to Walter Molano, author of the 1997 book "The Logic of Privatization: The Case of Telecommunications in the Southern Cone of Latin America."
In Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, among others, the first phone systems were financed and operated by investors from Britain, France, Canada and the United States around the end of the 19th century. But as populist governments removed incentives for investment and maintenance of the systems through policies that limited rate increases and management's leeway in hiring and firing, the region's telephone networks fell into disrepair and were nationalized. They remained dysfunctional until free-market-oriented governments privatized systems in the 1990's. 
"The uncertainty over everything in Argentina could lead to a quick decay of its telecommunications assets," said Mr. Molano, who is chief of research for BCP Securities, a Connecticut investment firm that focuses on Latin America. "It's not unreasonable to think that renationalization of telecommunications could be the endgame."
Telecommunications companies are hoping that the new government of President Eduardo Duhalde will bring stability to the Argentine economy, enabling them to return to a regular business routine. But executives dread the possibility that Peronists will become more involved in the economy, potentially contributing to more instability.
"We're not among those that are contemplating leaving Argentina," said Mr. Rossi of AT&T Latin America. "But we would really like some greater visibility as to what is going on."

HEADLINE: Private Sector, Public Doubts 

BYLINE:  By David Callahan; David Callahan is research director of Demos, a public-policy research organization in New York City.

 BODY:
The emerging story of Enron's collapse is about an abuse of corporate power. Top Enron executives were allowed to sell off hundreds of millions of dollars of the doomed company's stock before it turned worthless -- at which point employees and most shareholders took devastating losses. Federal and state investigators are now focusing on possible criminal misconduct, yet the more interesting question is whether Enron's collapse will undermine public trust in business.
 In the last century, Americans' trust in major financial and Wall Street institutions has gyrated considerably. These shifts have been accompanied by larger changes in American politics: public trust in American business tends to determine how much Americans look to the federal government to regulate corporate behavior. It may also influence young people's desire to work in the business world, as opposed to pursuing other livelihoods like education, government service or medicine. 
 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, public backlash against the abuses of the robber barons paved the way for Progressive Era reforms. Likewise, the excesses of Wall Street in the 1920's and the crash of 1929 produced considerable distrust of America's financial institutions and the business class and aided the rise of New Deal liberalism. That distrust dissipated during the 1950's and early 1960's, a period of economic growth and relative social quiescence.
In the late 1960's, however, public trust in business plummeted once more. Between 1966 and 1971, those expressing "a great deal of confidence" in people running "major companies" fell from 55 percent to 27 percent, according to the National Opinion Research Corporation. Distrust of corporate America helped fuel two of the most important American political movements of the era, environmentalism and consumer protection efforts.
The public's attitude toward business shifted again in the 1980's. During a period when trust in nearly every major public institution fell, Americans' faith in major corporations rose in the 1980's and 90's, according to opinion polls. Neither insider trading on Wall Street nor the savings and loan scandal undermined this public trust. According to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, over the last two decades public trust in corporations reached its peak in 1994, when conservative Republicans took over Congress. This trust in corporations helped produce a politics that has been reluctant to impose new tax or regulatory burdens that might diminish corporate profits.
If the Enron scandal were unique, it would be naive to expect any lasting ramifications from this episode. However, the Enron revelations come in the wake of an erosion in trust of business generally and of Wall Street in particular. As stock prices have plummeted in the last two years, Americans have learned that some investment advisers have major conflicts of interest because they work for firms that often benefit from the rise of the very stocks for which they are supposed to be providing objective analysis. And long before questions arose about Enron, we learned that dishonest accounting procedures allowed several technology companies to mislead investors.
A clear policy agenda is suggested by Enron's collapse: more federal oversight of corporate governance, private pensions and accounting procedures. The links between the Bush administration and Enron also highlight the need for campaign finance reform to reduce the access of big corporate donors to our highest government officials. If a prolonged scandal reveals more links between the Bush administration and Enron, the public may be more convinced than ever that Washington politicians are doing the bidding of corporate campaign contributors at the expense of average Americans.
Right now, the causes and consequences of Enron's collapse are still unfolding. In time, this scandal could be seen as something of a turning point. The impact of this story on Americans' trust of corporations and financial institutions, and perhaps on their politics as well, will depend on what happens next.

Executive Shifts At 4 Companies

BYLINE:  By Andrew Zipern 

 BODY:
Top executives at four companies are changing posts.
 Louis M. Schultz, 58, chairman and chief executive at Initiative Media Worldwide in New York, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is in talks to step down and take another post at Interpublic, executives who were told about the discussions said yesterday. 
 Mr. Schultz, a longtime media executive at Interpublic agencies like Campbell-Ewald and Western Initiative Media, has led Initiative during a turbulent period that included the recent loss of a review for the consolidated account of a mainstay client, the Walt Disney Company, with billings estimated at $500 million. 
Patty Kerr, a spokeswoman for Initiative, said she could not comment on reports this week in Advertising Age and Adweek that Mr. Schultz was being replaced. The executives told about the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Interpublic was looking at internal and external candidates to succeed Mr. Schultz.
Maxxcom in Toronto, a division of the MDC Corporation that owns and operates agencies, named Harold Reiter president and chief executive, succeeding Beverly Morden, who resigned, according to Maxxcom.
Mr. Reiter had been executive vice president for the Canadian operations of Tyco Capital in Burlington, Ontario, a financial services company that is part of Tyco International. Maxxcom owns majority and minority stakes in agencies including Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami and Margeotes/Fertitta & Partners in New York.
Under Ms. Morden, the top Maxxcom executive since 1999, the agency company made many acquisitions but began suffering as the economy slowed. An effort by Goldman, Sachs to find investors or buyers for Maxxom proved unsuccessful. In a statement, Maxxcom highlighted Mr. Reiter's experience in areas like "operations management." 
Holly Pavlika, 46, was named executive vice president and executive creative director at the New York office of Grey Direct, part of the Grey Global Group. She succeeds Bob Feinberg, who is retiring after 12 years. Ms. Pavlika had been president and executive creative director at Pavlika Chinnici in New York, part of Margeotes/Fertitta.
At Rodale, the magazine and book publishing company, Steven P. Murphy, 47, president and chief operating officer, based in Emmaus, Pa., and New York, was named president and chief executive. He assumes the latter duties from Ardath Rodale, 72, based in Emmaus, Pa., who continues as chairwoman.

HEADLINE: Putting an End to Warlord Government 

BYLINE:  By Barnett R. Rubin; Barnett R. Rubin, author of "The Fragmentation of Afghanistan," is director of studies at New York University's Center on International Cooperation.

 BODY:
In defeating the Taliban, American policymakers have had to make hard choices in the struggle to reconcile sometimes conflicting military and political goals. Next week, when they meet in Tokyo, the United States and other donor nations will face equally hard choices in deciding how to help rebuild Afghanistan.
 The difficulties of timing assaults on Taliban and Qaeda forces and the unpredictable rhythms of military operations in the early months of the war led the United States to arm anti-Taliban warlords well before Afghans reached agreement on a successor regime. The elimination of the Taliban regime made possible the establishment of a new administration, but at the price of empowering some corrupt and brutal figures. 
 The Bonn accords contain mechanisms for making the Afghan government more representative. They call for a loya jirga to choose a new government in six months, provide for the integration of armed groups into national security forces and arrange for an international stabilization-assistance force. They also aim to co-opt regional warlords by giving them official roles. For example, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, whose forces helped secure the victory at Mazar-i-Sharif, is now deputy defense minister.
The purpose of the accords is to establish a stable government, which means ending direct supplies of money and arms to warlords. Yet the United States has been supporting various anti-Taliban commanders who are helping in the search for Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden. In the battle for Kandahar the United States came close to undermining Hamid Karzai, now head of the interim Kabul administration, by arming his local rivals. The immediate operational requirements of the battle against Al Qaeda and the Taliban have thus worked against the goal of consolidating the interim administration's authority.
The Afghan administration will not be able to establish that authority unless financial and military aid to warlords ceases in favor of an effort to build national security forces. The international stabilization force may well need to extend its presence beyond Kabul to provide security during the transition from warlord control.
In addition to controlling warlords, the new Afghan government will also have to deal with the new problem of how to distribute and coordinate billions of dollars of international aid. If international agencies and donor countries controlling the aid are more interested in taking credit and defending turf than in strengthening Afghan institutions, they could exacerbate fragmentation and cynicism in Afghan society. Armies of expatriates -- consultants, United Nations bureaucrats, aid workers of every kind -- can drive up local prices. Such projects tend to skim local talent, offering engineers and teachers steady work as drivers or translators -- and keeping them from building and teaching. Worst of all, competition among agencies and donors can undermine reconstruction politically. As happened with humanitarian aid in Somalia, reconstruction aid in Afghanistan could become simply a new political currency to be fought over by warlords, who will play one aid agency against another and all of them against the central government. 
The early signs on this front are not promising. At a meeting in Brussels last month, the major donor countries brushed aside a statement from Afghanistan's interim finance minister that the Afghans would prefer a single reconstruction fund to coordinate planning. The donors were cool to this request partly because of legitimate concerns over how to manage a single fund, but also because they want to fly the flag over their own projects. In Tokyo, donors must consult with the Afghan authorities on how to design a coherent plan for distributing aid, which will soon be as important to achieving political stability in Afghanistan as controlling the warlords in the post-Taliban government.

HEADLINE: A Federal Reserve Governor to Step Down 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON. Jan. 14 

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve governor, Laurence H. Meyer, said today that he would step down from the seven-member board when his term expires at the end of the month. 
 Appointed by President Bill Clinton, Mr. 
Meyer has served since June 20, 1996, and had said he would not seek renomination. Mr. Meyer, in a letter to President Bush, said his resignation would be effective Jan. 31. 
 Mr. Meyer's departure, along with the resignation of another governor, Edward W. Kelley Jr., who left at the end of last month, will leave two vacancies on the board. 
Both Mr. Meyer, 57, and Mr. Kelley, who had served on the board for over 14 years, had announced last year that they intended to leave. 
The Federal Reserve's chief policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, will hold its first meeting of the year on Jan. 29-30 to discuss rate policy. Mr. Meyer will not attend that meeting, the Fed said. 
In an effort to revive the economy, which fell into recession in March, the Fed cut interest rates 11 times last year. 
Before becoming a Fed governor, Mr. Meyer was president of an economics consulting and forecasting firm based in Missouri. He was also an economics professor at Washington University in St. Louis. 
Mr. Bush has already had a chance to put his imprint on the Fed. He has appointed two governors, Susan Schmidt Bies and Mark W. Olson, both of whom took part in their first interest-rate meeting on Dec. 11.

HEADLINE: A Fuel Cell Initiative Too Costly for Use in Cars 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
The goal of the research partnership between Washington and the auto industry -- a midsize car that would go 80 miles to a gallon with no loss of performance or carrying capacity -- was a stretch, critics said, when it was established by President Bill Clinton in 1993. As it turned out, they were right.
 But a successor program announced by the Energy Department last week, centering on fuel cells instead of hybrid diesel-electric systems, is in some ways an even larger leap, as portrayed by auto executives and fuel cell experts. 
 Fuel cells -- which convert hydrogen into electric current cleanly, quietly and very efficiently -- could turn up over the next few years in cellphones and laptop computers, and a while after that, in lawn mowers, scooters and perhaps vacuum cleaners. But not in cars, at least not soon. 
"Cars, in the industry view, are down the line," said Peter Hoffman, editor and publisher of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Letter.
Among the problems, a practical technology for storing hydrogen in the quantities needed for a vehicle has yet to be invented. The carmakers hope for a metal that can absorb hydrogen and later release it when heated. But for now, they are working with tanks in which hydrogen is stored at pressures up to 10,000 pounds a square inch, a level seldom seen in consumer products.
And even if the technology for attaching the hydrogen to a metal for storage was perfected, the infrastructure for distributing and retailing it does not now exist. That is a formidable challenge, as the people who tried to sell a much simpler alternative vehicle fuel -- natural gas -- discovered to their sorrow in the 1990's. Natural gas cars require hardly any new technology, and natural gas lines reach tens of millions of homes and businesses, but extending them to filling stations proved impractical.
And natural gas has a cost advantage over gasoline. Perhaps the biggest problem for fuel cells is that, for now at least, the cost is roughly 10 times that of internal-combustion engines for the same amount of power.
Mr. Hoffman, the author of "Tomorrow's Energy: Hydrogen, Fuel Cells and the Prospects for a Cleaner Planet," said that since mobile fuel cells were not now commercially available their price was not clear, but that estimates ranged from $1,500 to $3,000 a kilowatt of capacity. A car would require about 50 kilowatts, which implies a propulsion system costing $75,000 to $150,000.
The cost could come down somewhat if the body were made of something besides ordinary steel and aluminum, as cars today are. But that, too, requires inventions.
At General Motors, which is eager to produce fuel cells, executives say they may not have to make the fuel cells as cheap as gasoline engines, since a fuel cell car would earn its keep in higher fuel economy and the electric motors would not need expensive components like catalytic converters or transmissions. But they would still have to cut the cells' cost by at least 80 percent, the executives say.
Ford and DaimlerChrysler, in conjunction with Ballard Power Systems, a fuel cell manufacturer near Vancouver, British Columbia, have built prototypes and invested heavily in bringing costs down. Ballard says it has supplied fuel cells to Honda, Hyundai, Nissan and Volkswagen, as well. Researchers have reported great progress on making the cells small enough for automotive use, but they still have a long way to go on costs.
Manhattan Scientifics, a fuel cell company that is preparing several products for commercialization, said it thought that customers would pay $3,000 a kilowatt, but only for cells that generate about a watt and thus cost $30 or so. That would be enough for cellphones or laptop computers, not cars.
The company's chief operating officer, Jack Harrod, said he also hoped to sell units for lawn mowers and scooters, but not until the price was below $500 a kilowatt, and he thought it might need to get down to $250. Ordinary gasoline engines in cars produce a kilowatt for about $30, industry experts say.
A house is an easier choice, experts say, since even a midsize suburban home with central air-conditioning uses only five or six kilowatts at peak, making the cost disadvantage per kilowatt less of a problem. There is also no storage problem if the house has natural gas, from which hydrogen can easily be extracted. And a house uses energy 24 hours a day, which would extend the benefits of efficiency and low pollution; most cars, by contrast, are on the road two hours a day or so.
For car executives to justify the cost of fuel cells, whatever that turns out to be, they are considering branching out into entirely new areas. Christopher E. Borroni-Bird, director of design and technology fusion at General Motors, suggested using fuel-cell-equipped cars to generate electric current when they are parked, and plugging them in to deliver power to the grid.
Carmakers are optimistic that they can eventually push the price way down, although unlike the old partnership the new one has no timetable, or even specific goals, according to Jennie Sweet of the United States Council for Automotive Research, the private-industry side of the partnership. And it is also not as complete a break with the old program; the old partnership included fuel cell research, and the new one will continue research on diesel-electric hybrids.
Another problem for the new partnership is the all-or-nothing nature of a fuel cell vehicle. While the old partnership never produced the 80-miles-a-gallon sedan, it did advance some technologies that now have a toehold in the market and are infiltrating deeper into auto assembly plants and showrooms. The old partnership goaded Toyota and Honda, which were not members, into putting hybrid electric-gasoline models on the road, and American manufacturers are in various stages of developing their own hybrid models for sale.

PERSON: Henry S. Reuss 

HEADLINE: Henry Reuss, Liberal in Congress, Dies at 89 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
Henry S. Reuss, for 28 years a leading liberal in Congress on issues from interest rates to pollution to Watergate to aid for New York City, died on Saturday in San Rafael, Calif. He was 89.
 The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son, Michael Reuss. 
 Though brought up as a Republican, from 1955 to 1983 he represented Milwaukee's North Side as a Democrat. He said he changed parties in 1950 because of his antipathy for Wisconsin's Republican senator Joseph R. McCarthy. In 1952 he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination to challenge Mr. McCarthy, who was then at the height of his influence because of his claims of Communists in government. 
As chairman of the House Banking Committee from 1975 to 1981, Mr. Reuss sought increased disclosure of banking activity. A House colleague for 13 years, Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, today called him "a crusader for financial regulation to keep the big boys honest."
"He would have been out to skin somebody alive for the way Enron double-dealt on their securities operation," Mr. Obey said.
Mr. Reuss's interests ranged far beyond that committee's work. In 1959, he was the first in Congress to propose what became the Peace Corps in 1961 after the idea was taken up in the 1960 presidential campaign, first by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey and then by Senator John F. Kennedy.
Mr. Reuss was a strong advocate of environmental protection, not merely through legislation but also through his own action. In 1970, he discovered a dusty 1899 statute, the Refuse Act, which allowed individuals to force action against polluters and be entitled to half the fines imposed. He took action against 149 Wisconsin companies.
In 1964, he was the author of legislation to establish the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, a 1,200-mile path tracing the southernmost reach of glaciers in Wisconsin. He hiked the trail in lederhosen.
In 1972, he pushed for an inquiry by the Banking Committee into Watergate, an effort that was thwarted when the Nixon White House persuaded a few Democrats to desert Mr. Reuss and Wright Patman of Texas, the committee chairman, and halt the investigation. 
Three years later, at 62, he unseated Mr. Patman, 81, from the chairmanship. It was part of a burst of activity by younger Democrats against elderly chairmen, three of whom they ousted in the biggest setback to the seniority system in a century. He then voluntarily gave up that chairmanship to take over the Joint Economic Committee in 1981, with the goal of checking President Ronald Reagan's economic polices. He did not seek re-election in 1982.
Mr. Reuss grew up in the German section of Milwaukee, the son of a bank executive. He graduated from Cornell in 1933 and Harvard Law School in 1936. He won a Bronze Star as an infantryman in World War II, and served in the military government of Germany and later as deputy general counsel for the Marshall Plan.
The last of his six books, "When Government Was Good: Memories of a Life in Politics," argued in 1999 that a golden age existed from 1948 to 1968, when the nation proved that it could achieve full employment, secure civil rights and prevent nuclear war. Another such age might come, he said, but it would require citizen rededication.
He quoted from a commencement address he had recently given at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee: "Pericles was right when he told the Athenians that the citizen who takes no part in public affairs is not merely unambitious but useless. If you will combine the private aim of getting ahead in life with the public pursuit of justice, you will help restore the essence of democracy -- informed and lively participation by its citizens. And that can produce a government which feels compelled neither to do everything nor to do nothing."
Besides his son, Michael, of Portland, Ore., he is survived by his wife of 60 years, Margaret Reuss; two daughters, Jacqueline Reuss of Paris and Anne Reuss of Chicago; seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: U.S. Loses Trade Case to Europeans on Offshore Tax Havens 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM with ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
The United States lost its final appeal today in a dispute with Europe over tax policies. The ruling is considered all but certain to renew trans-Atlantic trade tensions and could cost American companies billions of dollars in higher taxes.
 Affirming earlier rulings, an appeals panel of the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based group that regulates trade, held that the offshore tax havens allowed by United States tax law amounted to an illegal trade subsidy and must be scrapped. 
 The dispute between the United States and the European Union over tax havens has been going on for years, but negotiations were suspended while the case was before the appeals board. 
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said that today's ruling was not unexpected but that he was "disappointed by the outcome."
"We will be consulting closely with Congress and affected U.S. interests regarding next steps," he added.
The next step is for a W.T.O. arbitration panel to determine the level of trade sanctions the Europeans will be allowed to impose. That will probably occur in April. 
Under American law, exporters can avoid paying taxes on some overseas sales by channeling profits through subsidiaries in places like Guam and the Virgin Islands. This saves American companies -- including giants like General Electric, General Motors, Microsoft and Boeing -- more than $4 billion a year in taxes.
In dollar terms, that makes this the largest trade case in history.
The European Union contends that the tax breaks give American exporters an unfair edge in international commerce. The United States holds that the tax advantage is no greater than comparable tax breaks in Europe. European companies, for example, do not have to pay value-added taxes on exported goods. There is no difference between the Clinton and Bush administrations' positions on the issue.
Many academic tax experts have argued for years that it was bad policy to lower companies' taxes simply because they have subsidiaries overseas. But lawmakers have accepted the argument that tax havens are necessary to allow American companies to compete in international trade, and the law has strong support in both parties in Congress.
Companies will continue to receive the breaks unless the law is changed.
United States trade authorities say they think that the European Union brought this case primarily out of bitterness against Washington for using the W.T.O. to pry open European markets for bananas and hormone-treated beef. But European officials say that is not the case, and they point in particular to the advantage the tax break gives Boeing in its competition with the European consortium Airbus Industrie for global aircraft sales.
The W.T.O. first ruled against the United States in February 2000. In response, Congress tinkered with the law that fall. But the European Union said the new law was no better than the old one, and last August, the World Trade Organization agreed. Today's ruling came on an appeal of the decision last August.
"Now it is up to the U.S. to comply with the W.T.O.'s findings to settle this matter once and for all," said Pascal Lamy, trade commissioner of the European Union.
The Europeans have threatened to impose tariffs as high as 100 percent on a broad list of American goods including iron, steel and aircraft. If that were to happen, the United States would surely retaliate with stiff sanctions of its own.
But few people who follow trade matters expect an all-out trade war. "Trans-Atlantic trade is so vast and so beneficial that neither side can afford a breakdown," an American trade official said today.
The issue, therefore, is what concessions Washington will have to make to mollify the Europeans and comply with world trade rules.
"The United States respects its W.T.O. obligations, which serve America's interests," Mr. Zoellick said, "and we intend to continue to cooperate with the E.U. in order to manage and resolve this dispute. This is an especially sensitive dispute that, at its core, raises questions of a level playing field with regard to tax policy."

HEADLINE: On Road Trip, Bush Offers Jokes on Pretzels and Serious Talk on Trade Issues 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: AURORA, Mo., Jan. 14 

 BODY:
President Bush traveled along the Mississippi River today to argue that increasing international trade is one way out of the American recession, while nursing and joking about the wounds he suffered Sunday night when he fainted after choking on a pretzel.
 Mr. Bush appeared in a good mood despite a half-dollar-size abrasion on his left cheek that the White House said was the result of hitting a coffee table or the floor as he fell off the couch in the White House residence. 
 Ari Fleischer, the president's spokesman, said Mr. Bush's doctor checked the president again early this morning at the White House and approved the two-day swing through Illinois, Missouri and Louisiana after concluding that the incident had no deeper cause than swallowing the pretzel the wrong way. 
Mr. Bush was alone at the time of the incident except for his two dogs, who were with him on the couch as he watched a football game.
He said today that he did not remember much about what happened, including the details of his fall.
"The next thing I know," he told a laughing crowd in this farming town in southwest Missouri, "Barney, the Scottish terrier, is wondering what the heck happened."
Mr. Fleischer said Vice President Dick Cheney was notified of the incident shortly afterward "as a courtesy."
The incident is certain to go down in the annals of odd presidential accidents and collapses, including the stomach illness that befell Mr. Bush's father at a state dinner in Tokyo, Jimmy Carter's collapse in a foot race near Camp David and the freakish train collision that nearly ended Theodore Roosevelt's term prematurely.
It was unclear how much danger Mr. Bush was in during the choking incident. But this morning, aboard Air Force One, the president was clearly determined to defuse the reports with humor: he sent a bag of several pounds of pretzels to the reporters in the back of his plane, inscribed "From Potus -- chew slowly." (Potus is the acronym for President of the United States.)
Mr. Bush seemed vigorous this morning in Moline, Ill., while visiting a John Deere factory that exports a quarter of the combine harvesters it makes. He enjoyed a few moments at the controls of one of the machines, then argued that the Senate should approve legislation empowering him to negotiate trade accords that cannot be amended by Congress.
Here in Aurora, he told an audience of farmers, "I know there are a lot of farmers around who say, 'You know, we've heard that before. Every trade agreement trades out the farmer.' "
But, he insisted, "that's not the way it's going to be."
He urged them to examine the agreement negotiated with China, allowing Beijing into the World Trade Organization. "We've opened up the Chinese markets to U.S. farmers," Mr. Bush said.
In fact, the accord, largely negotiated by the Clinton administration, calls for gradual openings, and it is unclear how fully China will comply.
Mr. Bush may have picked a bad day to herald the benefits of trade, because as he traveled, the United States suffered a few setbacks.
Though he made no mention of it, the World Trade Organization ruled against the United States in a long-running dispute about tax breaks given to large companies that export their goods. The decision is bound to sour the conservative wing of the Republican Party, which has argued, along with some of the left, that Congress gave up too much sovereignty to the trade organization. 
Nor did Mr. Bush explicitly mention farm supports, a delicate issue for any free-market politician whose ideology would argue against government supports but whose electoral survival instincts make it plain he should say nothing against them. Mr. Bush's audiences today made it plain that they expected supports to remain or increase.
But the managing director of the International Monetary Fund argued in a speech today that the subsidies only weaken the poorest nations, which depend far more heavily on the agricultural industry, and in the end breeds resentment of the United States and the West.
"It is unconscionable for the United States, Japan and the European Union to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on maintaining marginal activities for the benefit of a few of their citizens," said the head of the monetary fund, Horst Kohler.
The subsidies are "devastating agricultural sectors that are central to peace and development in poor countries," Mr. Kohler said.
Mr. Bush argued that the more he could open markets, the more workers could be employed in factories like the John Deere one he visited. 
Robert W. Lane, the chairman and chief executive of Deere & Company, said, "Our workers understand that connection."
Mr. Lane noted that exports accounted for about $1.7 billion in revenues for the company. Deere's business in Russia and the former Soviet republics collapsed with the fall of the ruble in 1998, he said, and never recovered.
While John Deere derives roughly a quarter of its revenues from abroad, it also produces many of its products in China, Germany, India, Argentina and other countries and imports many of the parts for its farm equipment. Mr. Bush made no mention of the overseas production, a constant sore point among the unions that argue that American manufacturers are shifting too many production lines to low-wage nations.
Instead, Mr. Bush wove together all of his favorite themes: the need to protect "the homeland" to assure economic recovery, the need to cut taxes and the need to reduce reliance on foreign oil. "We're too reliant upon parts of the world that may like us, may not like us, for our sources of energy," he said.
From Missouri, he headed to New Orleans for what he said would be a "good dinner," presumably forgoing the usual Air Force One pretzel snacks on the way.

HEADLINE: Schools Chief Offers Possible Cuts in Budget 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy submitted about $600 million in possible cuts in the education budget yesterday for the fiscal year starting July 1, opening what will most likely be an intense round of negotiations with the Bloomberg administration.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has asked all city agencies to propose budget cuts of 5 percent to 20 percent to close an impending $4 billion budget gap. 
 Mr. Levy met privately with the members of the Board of Education yesterday and detailed $597 million in possible cuts, one person who attended the meeting said. But they included $372 million in cuts that would require changes in city, state or federal rules about how certain money is spent. 
The proposed cuts would not affect educational programs like after-school classes or art and music instruction, the person who attended the meeting said, and they would probably not involve laying off teachers or other school personnel. A Board of Education official said that layoffs at board headquarters were possible.
The latest proposed cuts are different from the $150 million in cuts that Mr. Levy made just before school began last September. Those cuts, which amounted to 1.3 percent of the Board of Education's $11.5 billion budget for the current school year, resulted from a shortfall in revenue the board had expected from the city and the state.
Instead, Mr. Levy outlined some possible savings in administrative costs yesterday and suggested shifting revenue from the federal government or other sources to cover expenses now paid for by the city.
For example, he predicted that $20 million could be saved if schools, district offices and the board headquarters conserved electricity.
One major expense that Mr. Levy is anticipating in the next fiscal year is raises for the city's 80,000 teachers, who have been working without a contract since November 2000. Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers' union, has asked for a 22 percent raise for teachers, whose salaries start at $31,910. But recently, she has warned her members to lower their expectations because of the economic downturn.
Nonetheless, Ms. Weingarten has been quietly lobbying Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Legislature to include at least $300 million in this year's budget for teacher raises.

HEADLINE: Crony Capitalism, U.S.A. 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Four years ago, as Asia struggled with an economic crisis, many observers blamed "crony capitalism." Wealthy businessmen in Asia didn't bother to tell investors the truth about their assets, their liabilities or their profits; the aura of invincibility that came from their political connections was enough. Only when a financial crisis came along did people take a hard look at their businesses, which promptly collapsed. 
 Does this sound familiar? 
 On the face of it, the sudden political storm over Enron is puzzling. After all, the Bush administration didn't save the company from bankruptcy. But then why did the administration dissemble so long about its contacts with Enron? Why did George W. Bush make the absurd claim that Enron's C.E.O., Kenneth Lay, opposed him in his first run for governor, and that the two men got to know each other only after that race? And why does the press act as if there may be a major scandal brewing? 
 Because the administration fears, and the press suspects, that the latest revelations in the Enron affair will raise the lid on crony capitalism, American style.
 Cronyism is hardly novel in America; the Clinton administration took us to the edge of a trade war on behalf of Chiquita bananas, a major campaign contributor. But the Bush administration, with its sense of entitlement, seems unconcerned by even the most blatant conflicts of interest -- like the plan of Marc Racicot, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, to continue drawing a seven-figure salary as a lobbyist. (He now says he won't lobby -- but he will still receive that salary.)
 The real questions about Enron's relationship with the administration involve what happened before the energy trader hit the skids. That's when Mr. Lay allegedly told the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that he should be more cooperative if he wanted to keep his job. (He wasn't, and he didn't.) And it's when Enron helped Dick Cheney devise an energy plan that certainly looks as if it was written by and for the companies that advised his task force. Mr. Cheney, in clear defiance of the law, has refused to release any information about his task force's deliberations; what is he hiding?
 And while Enron has imploded, other energy companies retain the administration's ear. Just days before the latest Enron revelations, the administration signaled its intention to weaken pollution rules on power plants; late last week it announced its decision to proceed with a controversial plan to store radioactive waste in Nevada. Each of these decisions was worth billions to companies with very strong connections to Mr. Bush. CBSMarketWatch.com declared, in its story about the nuclear waste decision, that "one group of major energy-business political donors just hit the jackpot."
 Notice the source of that quote. In recent months, while political reporters have been busy waving the flag, business reporters have taken the lead in telling us what's really going on. And they seem disgusted by what they see. It was CBSMarketWatch's executive editor, not some whining political commentator, who warned that "a small group of business leaders exert enormous clout over Bush and his team in getting the rules changed to their benefit."
 And the business magazine Red Herring has published the biggest expose to date of the secretive Carlyle Group, an investment company whose story sounds like the plot of a bad TV series. Carlyle specializes in buying down-and-out defense contractors, then reselling them when their fortunes miraculously improve after they receive new government business. Among the company's employees is former President George H. W. Bush. Among the group's investors, until late October, was the bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia. 
 Another administration would have regarded the elder Bush's role at Carlyle as unseemly; this administration apparently does not. And Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld recently gave his old college wrestling partner Frank Carlucci, head of Carlyle, a very nice gift: Mr. Rumsfeld decided to proceed with the much-criticized Crusader artillery system, which even the Pentagon wanted to cancel. The result was another turnaround for a Carlyle-owned company.
 Sad to say, none of this is clearly illegal -- it just stinks to high heaven. That's why the Bush administration will try to keep the Enron story narrowly focused on one company during its death throes. Just remember that the real story is much bigger.

HEADLINE: Institutions Brace For Cuts By the City 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Late last week the city's new budget director, Mark Page, sent a memo to the Department of Cultural Affairs, along with all the other city agencies, asking them for cuts of 25 percent in their building plans over the next four years. 
 This notice, coupled with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's recent warning that Lincoln Center's $1.2 billion redevelopment may have to be put off, has left institutions as internationally renowned as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and as community-focused as the Queens Museum of Art girding for cutbacks. 
 The cultural institutions with the most to lose -- that is, those with the highest capital commitments from the city between now and 2005 -- are the Met, which has been promised $26.2 million to nearly double its exhibition space, including new areas for education and research; the New York Botanical Garden, which is expecting $31.3 million for various projects, including roof repairs and repaving; the Museum of Modern Art, which is awaiting $30 million to help increase its space and build temporary quarters in Long Island City, Queens; Queens Museum of Art, due for $23.7 million to double its space; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, promised $24 million (and another $8.8 million in 2006 and 2007) for a new downtown site; and the Aquarium in Coney Island, which is expecting $31.4 million for refurbishment of its main hall and other repairs. 
Now, because of Sept. 11 and the softened economy, all of these projects could be derailed or at least delayed, depending on how far along they are. The mayor is due to announce a complete preliminary budget on Feb. 14, said his spokesman, Edward Skyler. 
In the memo, Mr. Page, director of the Office of Management and Budget, asked agencies to submit their proposals for cuts in fiscal years 2002 to 2005 by tomorrow to assist in closing the budget gap and reducing the city's debt, "effectively extending your four-year capital program to five years." The agencies are already coping with cuts of up to 15 percent in their expense budgets.
"My guess is, when they get to capital, they will focus on what they have to do with transportation and building efforts having to do with the city's survival," said Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, a citywide arts advocacy group. "Since no one wants to go back to the days when they didn't paint the bridges, cultural projects will be at the bottom of the list. And when they get to the bottom of the list, there's going to be nothing left."
More than any other recent mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani allocated money for capital projects for arts groups. During his eight years in office, Mr. Giuliani committed $484.7 million from the capital budget to cultural affairs, compared to $223.7 million in Mayor David N. Dinkins's single term and $126.3 million during the last term of Mayor Edward I. Koch. Allocating this money does not necessarily mean awarding it, however, and the strong economy allowed Mr. Giuliani not only to commit more to capital projects, but also to come through on more of his pledges than other mayors had in the past. 
In 2001, the city's commitment to capital spending on cultural institutions jumped to $162.4 million from $20.9 million the year before. And the city's capital commitment was to increase hugely in 2002 -- to $599.7 million, according to the Independent Budget Office, the city's nonpartisan fiscal watchdog agency, which relies for its numbers on the city's Office of Management and Budget. 
Can the city make good on all these allocations? Mr. Skyler said, "No decisions have been made regarding that." But every indication from the mayor and New York's economic indicators makes it seem unlikely.
The day after his inauguration, Mr. Bloomberg said Lincoln Center's redevelopment and projects like it might have to be put off. "It, like everything else, is going to have to be put in line, and we'll see when we add up what's possible what we can afford this year," he said at a news conference on Jan. 2. "I think that most institutions understand that, given the rough economic times where the city doesn't have enough money and fund-raising from private donors for organizations like that is probably harder, some of these things are just going to get postponed."
Under Mr. Giuliani, the city agreed to provide Lincoln Center with $240 million over the redevelopment project's 10-year span. Mr. Bloomberg has expressed the hope that when the city's economy improves, financing for capital projects can be resumed.
In most capital projects, city money does not make up the bulk of the budget; arts groups know they have to raise most of their money from a combination of other sources, including individuals, foundations and state government. 
Nevertheless, city money matters a lot, not only financially but also as an important commitment that helps draw other contributors. 
Organizations like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which is well into a $650-million capital project to which the city already gave $20.7 million between 1997 and 2001, cannot help but be concerned, even though Met officials say the museum has raised more than $580 million of its goal so far. "We are nervous," said David E. McKinney, president of the Met. "We're working as we speak on a new central kitchen and we're counting on $5 million from the city, and if we don't get that, we've got a problem." The new kitchen will allow the Met to return its current kitchen area to use as a sculpture court and to create new cafeterias for the public and the staff. 
Nevertheless, Ms. Munn of the New York City Arts Coalition said she suspected there wouldn't be a total shut-off of the spigot, that the mayor might allow some continued financial support for planning and design. "I don't think anyone wants to stop building the cultural infrastructure of the city," Ms. Munn said. "It's a very real asset." 
Some large capital projects are moving along in the face of the uncertainty from the city. The Museum of Modern Art, for example, plans to open MOMA QNS, its new 160,000-square-foot temporary exhibition and storage space in Long Island City, in June. Its director, Glenn D. Lowry, said the foundations were being poured for the expansion of its Manhattan home on 53rd Street, with structural steel soon to follow, and that $520 million of its $650 million fund-raising goal had been reached. Mr. Lowry said the museum was even likely to increase its goal to $800 million over the next seven years. The Modern has already received $35 million from the city, and another $30 million has been committed over the next four years.
Nevertheless, Mr. Lowry said the museum now plans to pull back from a gut renovation and reduce the degree of work in the nonpublic areas. In addition, Mr. Lowry said, the Modern may cut costs in some areas and delay its completion (the renovated museum is due to open in 2005). "We're still in the review process," he said. 
Construction on the new $115 million home at Columbus Circle for Jazz at Lincoln Center is well under way, though the project is still short $33 million of its fund-raising goal. Of the $25 million pledged by the city, Jazz has so far received $5.7 million.
Several arts executives with longtime dealings with the city predicted that projects on which construction hadn't begun would be the main casualties. Said one, "Any cultural institution that doesn't have a hole in the ground or a building partly up is going to find itself out of this budget."
The Queens Museum of Art, for example, only just selected an architect, Eric Owen Moss of Los Angeles, to design an expansion that would double its space; preliminary models have been on view at the Architectural League of New York in Manhattan. The bulk of financing for the project, which is being managed by the city's Department of Design and Construction and the Department of Cultural Affairs, comes from the city. "It all looks uphill now, but I'm certain it will move forward," said Carma Fauntleroy, the interim executive director.
In this climate, many say the idea of a new Frank Gehry $900 million, 500,000-square-foot Guggenheim Museum rising on the East River in Lower Manhattan seems like a pipe dream. Mr. Gehry was traveling and could not be reached for comment.
Apart from the uncertainty of city financing, the Guggenheim is retrenching, having laid off staff members, reduced its number of exhibitions and sought new board members in response to tough economic times.
Nevertheless, the museum says it is moving ahead. Laurie Beckelman, the Guggenheim's deputy director for special projects, said the museum had recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the city to build at the downtown site. 
"It took 16 years to build Frank Lloyd Wright's uptown Guggenheim, and this is long term," Ms. Beckelman said. 
"We've got time and we're patient," she added. "We have to be."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 16 about cuts in grants from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs misstated the planned use of $26.2 million that had been expected by the Metropolitan Museum. It was for new public and staff cafeterias, a new Roman Court and other proj ects, not for a doubling of the exhibition space.

HEADLINE: Argentines Line Up to Escape to the Old World 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
Liliana Cardamone's father came to Argentina from Italy as a child because his parents dreamed of a better life here. But on Friday morning, Ms. Cardamone was standing in a long line outside the Italian Embassy, preparing to claim Italian nationality so that she and her husband and two small children can move to her father's homeland.
 "It pains me to do this, and I haven't told my father yet for fear of how he will react," Ms. Cardamone, 34, said as she waited in line with her cousin Guillermo Clasadonte, who also hopes to leave Argentina. "But we can't stand it any longer." 
 "We have put up with so much for so long, hoping that the situation will get better," she said, "but it is obvious it will be years before we get out of this mess, and I don't want my children to have to go through this."
Mr. Clasadonte, who is 28 and unemployed, said he had already discussed emigration with his father, who heartily approves. "He has been here more than 40 years and is living on a pension, but things are so bad that he still has to work to survive," Mr. Clasadonte said. "He wants to go back, too." 
After four years of recession and now a 40 percent devaluation of the peso, an increasingly battered and dispirited middle class is giving up and trying to get out, in an alarming exodus that threatens to sap the country's strength and cuts straight to its sense of identity. 
On top of food riots last month, a rotation of five presidents, and a debt default, Argentines are finding the daily lines outside embassies especially traumatic. Like the United States, this is a country built by immigrants, many of whom still have dual citizenship or can apply for a passport based on family ancestry, making it easier and all the more enticing to leave. These days television news programs are full of grainy and nostalgic images of ships from Europe docking here a century ago with their hopeful new arrivals on board. 
Though it may be early to talk about a brain drain, President Eduardo Duhalde, who took office Jan. 1, expressed concern last week at the forces that are "bleeding the energy" of the country. But his plea to be patriotic and remain until times get better clearly does not convince everyone.
In contrast to those in other Latin American countries, a majority of Argentina's 36 million people are of Italian descent. Many others can claim Spanish nationality, and there is also a significant Anglo-Argentine colony, as well as a Jewish population that was estimated at more than 300,000 people at its peak but is now losing numbers as a result of departures to Israel.
The emigration to Italy has been accelerated by efforts by clubs of descendants from regions like Venice that are recruiting for jobs in factories or offices. But it also helps that passport requirements by Italy are less demanding than those of Spain, said Myriam Benotti, who runs a citizenship consulting service here that is now receiving inquiries from 50 families a week. People can claim Italian nationality based on ancestry on one side going back a number of generations, and then apply for a passport. Spain generally sets a shorter limit on the number of generations for which a claim can be made. 
"A lot of people don't speak Italian and don't really intend to stay in Italy," she said. "The idea is to get European citizenship so as to be able to go to Spain or some other country, or even to go to the United States."
Officials at the American Embassy here say the impact of the crisis so far has been minimal. The population with dual citizenship here eligible to relocate to the United States is relatively small. Argentina is one of more than two dozen countries where, because of a history of people using visas correctly, they do not need visas to travel to the United States for business or tourism.
Neither the Italian nor the Spanish Embassy here was willing to provide figures on the number of Argentines claiming dual citizenship or requesting a passport. But the lines that begin forming in front of each embassy before dawn and often stretch for two blocks or more by the opening of business hours suggest that the numbers run into the tens of thousands.
"The count is double today what it was just a month ago," when the government put a freeze on withdrawals from bank accounts, "and even then the count was way above what it was a year ago," said Claudia Bas, who works for a citizenship consultancy firm, as she handed out fliers to people waiting in line outside the embassy. "It seems like everyone wants to get out of here."
In a recent poll, nearly half of those surveyed said they would leave Argentina if they could. The most eager to emigrate were people between the ages of 30 and 42 who had a high-school education or better, with women more willing to relocate than men.
Claudio Donoso, 27, an unemployed man who was waiting with Maria Laura Giambelluca, his 19-year-old girlfriend, to request an Italian passport, expressed disdain for President Duhalde and other politicians. "It's always the same old garbage from the same old people, and I just can't stand it anymore," he said.
For Laura Malosetti, 40, and her husband, Pablo Sercovich, 38, the reasons are more economic than political. They have worked hard to build a business raising chickens and pigs in the countryside, but no longer have faith in Mr. Duhalde's assurances that the economy is bound to improve.
"All our friends have been gradually leaving, our savings have been eaten up, and now they have frozen the bank accounts," Ms. Malosetti said. "Our big fear is that we wait too long and that everything collapses beneath us."
Mr. Sercovich, whose mother was Italian, already has his passport and will leave Argentina within a month. As soon as he gets a job, whether in Italy or Spain, she and their four children, whose ages range from 5 to 15, plan to follow, she said.
"To have to leave one's own country causes great anguish, but it is better to start over somewhere else than to remain here," she said. "Argentina has become like quicksand: the more you move, the deeper you sink."

HEADLINE: How Troubled P.S. 307 Climbed Off the Bottom 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
This is Melanie Brown's second year as a teacher, and her second year teaching the same children, moving up with them from fourth to fifth grade to provide consistency and build on the personal relationship between teacher and students. Ms. Brown is just 24, but her style is brisk and authoritative.
 As she taught a lesson this week in how to determine perimeter, it was evident that her greatest strength was her mastery of the material. She loved showing the children that a skinny geometric figure could have the same perimeter as a similar but bulkier figure. She did not betray the fear of math that seems to paralyze many teachers. She breezily added up columns of numbers in her head, while reciting sums out loud so the students could follow along. 
 Ms. Brown is a teacher at Public School 307 in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, designated by the State Education Department three years ago as one of the 100 or so worst schools in New York City. Last week, the state took P.S. 307 off the so-called SURR list, for schools under registration review, saying that test scores had improved enough that it was no longer in danger of being shut down for educational failure. 
Although the school is still a borderline case, there have been many improvements that can be credited for the school's progress, from a new principal to drastically reduced class sizes, rewards for good attendance and extra instruction for third through sixth graders two hours a week before school.
But it is hard not to believe that the sheer talent of teachers like Ms. Brown -- who was hired after an unhappy year as a paralegal through a new recruiting program aimed at career changers -- and the more experienced teacher who took her under her wing, Aissatou Diop, deserve as much credit as any of the more formulaic changes.
Three years ago, P.S. 307, sandwiched between the starkly forbidding Farragut Houses and the Manhattan Bridge, suffered from a weak principal, dissension among the teachers, a disorganized curriculum, unruly students and low test scores. The school of 480 students had been demoralized by going through three principals in six years. The last straw came in 1998 as it was put on the failing list. Spurred by the state, Lester Young, the District 13 superintendent, assigned Nancy Velez as principal in September 1999. She, in turn, set about changing the school from a place that accepted failure to one that demanded success, allowing teachers like Ms. Brown and Ms. Diop to thrive.
Her can-do attitude, Ms. Velez said, came from the top. "When I needed something," she said, "Dr. Young would say, 'Consider it done.' "
But if there is another lesson to be learned from P.S. 307, it is not just that bad schools can, with effort and caring, get better, but that the pace of improvement is often grindingly incremental and easily reversed. Scores at P.S. 307 are still alarmingly low -- only one out of four students meets state standards in English, and one out of three in math. Citywide, there is evidence that former SURR schools are as deceptive as former drug addicts, as some schools begin to cycle back onto the failure list, four this year alone.
Some experts suggest that what is being called improvement may represent no more than random spikes in test scores. Others say the schools that have slipped back into failure show how hard it is to sustain the qualities that matter most: committed leadership, good curriculum and teachers who know their subject inside and out.
"We do have a concern about districts' taking away what made these schools successful and not continuing to support them," Ira Schwartz, the state's senior coordinator for policy and administration, said this week.
Much though not all of the improvement at P.S. 307 also cost money. Reducing classes to 24 students from 32 in the fourth, fifth and sixth grades and to 20 students from 28 in the lower grades meant hiring more teachers, though Mr. Young said he had been able to shift some money to teaching by reducing the number of paraprofessionals in the district. Smaller classes, he said, are more effective than paraprofessionals.
The extra instruction given to students from 8 a.m. to 8:40 a.m. three mornings a week came as a result of a 1999 agreement with the teachers' union to pay teachers 15 percent more for more work. That agreement is about to expire, and could be renegotiated as part of the teachers' contract -- something Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, envisioned from the start -- or abandoned.
Although P.S. 307 has improved, the superintendent, Dr. Young, does not like what he calls "the concept of perform or perish." It is a system that Congress and President Bush are now institutionalizing across the nation, using test scores as a way to judge schools, penalizing those that do badly, rewarding those that do well.
But it is the state's program to identify failing schools that has helped put teachers like Ms. Brown in the classroom. Starting in September 2001, the state decreed that SURR schools could hire only certified teachers.
Ms. Brown is three years out of the University of Connecticut, where she earned a bachelor's degree in history and economics, not teaching. She spent a year as a paralegal, thinking she would go on to law school, but hated it. She got summer training and certification through the Teaching Fellows, a fast-track teaching program set up to attract people into teaching who might not otherwise try it.
In her first year of teaching, she went to bed at 7 every night because of the mental strain. She credits Ms. Diop, a more experienced teacher, with helping her succeed by giving her advice on classroom management and how to write lesson plans. They met at Ms. Diop's house on Friday and Saturday nights to plan the coming week.
Last Monday, Ms. Brown's class chanted along as she quickly added up a row of numbers she had written on the board. "Ten plus 5 is 15 plus 10 is 25 plus 15 is 40," she said. Only about two voices triumphantly exclaimed "40" when she did, amid a motley chorus of wrong answers.
One of the voices that got the right answer belonged to a small, shy boy who is performing at grade level in math but far below in reading, and who came to Ms. Brown's class with little confidence in his ability.
He was one of the few students who were able to explain in writing that they had divided an irregular polygon, meant to be a garden, into regular rectangles as a way of calculating the length of the side that added up to 40. But his explanation was written in the invented spelling typical of a first grader.
"Fist I add around but I did not add the gate," the boy wrote. "Then when I got my anwher I add 80 plus 40. Filly I got then anwer 120. I got the 40 by add the Ritegl."
Although Ms. Brown has no formal educational degree, she has seen enough students like him in her year and a half of teaching to be sure that educational fads rather than lack of ability are to blame for the boy's writing problems.
"He was taught with the whole language approach," she said. "Children can learn that way if they have a better base from home. But he is struggling with sight words. He needs phonics."
The boy, she said, is getting remedial instruction to compensate for the failure of his early teaching.
Ms. Brown said she was not discouraged. "I wouldn't want to leave these kids for anything," she said. "This is where I can do the most good."

HEADLINE: Georgia Finds Itself in Jobless Benefits Bind 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Like many other states, Georgia once thought it could have it all. Three years ago, when its economy was humming and jobs were plentiful, the Legislature suspended the unemployment insurance tax for thousands of businesses with few effects on the needy.
 But today, with tens of thousands of unemployed Georgians making do with $230 in average weekly jobless benefits and two-thirds of the state's 170,000 unemployed people not even qualifying for benefits, legislators may have to choose between restoring the tax and making the benefits even smaller. 
 The situation is particularly dramatic because Georgia lost more jobs than any other state from November 2000 to November 2001, the most recent month for which the Labor Department has published data. 
The debate here is echoing across the country. 
In the last 20 years, the average level of benefits and the portion of unemployed workers who receive them has dropped, as the work force has changed and some states have adopted stricter eligibility rules. Forty percent of unemployed Americans receive benefits, down from 55 percent in the 1950's.
Under pressure from business and having unemployment insurance trust funds filled with cash, many states reduced the corporate taxes that pay for the benefits, and they are now reluctant to raise them.
"In the 1990's, thanks to the good economy, states could cut taxes and still survive," Wayne Vroman, an economist at the Urban Institute in Washington, said. "Now there are going to be some really nasty disagreements between labor and employers."
Changes in the welfare system have given the disputes added importance, because many more low-wage Americans now rely on jobs or the unemployment benefits associated with them for their income.
Since the economy took a new turn for the worse after Sept. 11, California has raised its unemployment benefits by as much as $100 a week. The maximum benefit is to rise an additional $120, to $450, by 2005. Virginia and the District of Columbia have temporarily increased their weekly payments. 
Most states have held the line, with officials arguing that unemployment insurance is intended just to help people with a small amount of money in their job searches. Raising jobless benefits, executives add, could deplete the trust funds and force higher payroll taxes.
"Employers would be hit at a time they could least afford a new tax burden," Roy Bowen, president of Georgia's textile-manufacturing association, said. "Employers are strapped as it is, trying to pay wages and keep doors open."
Jobless workers and their advocates counter that even a short spell of unemployment can cause extreme hardship, given the level of benefit payments and the large number of people who do not qualify for them. 
"We're fundamentally backing away from a social contract," said Nan Orrock, a Democratic state representative in Georgia who has cosponsored a bill to expand jobless benefits. "We're seeing the purpose of the system -- which is to provide a buffer against hard times, to be a bridge over troubled water -- undermined." 
The unemployment insurance system, which dates from 1935, has two chief aims under the law: helping struggling families and lifting the economy by distributing money to people who are likely to spend it quickly.
But as the work force has changed, unemployment insurance largely has not. As a result, many people out of a job, including part-time workers and recently hired low-wage workers, do not qualify for benefits.
The amount of those benefits has not kept up with average wages, either. In the first half of this year, a typical benefit payment was equal to 35 percent of average wages across the country, down from 37 percent at the start of the 90's.
Georgia's relatively tough eligibility rules allow one-third of unemployed workers to receive benefits, leaving the state ranked 39th by that measure, according to the National Employment Law Project, which represents unemployed workers. Weekly benefits have increased $12 a year in each of the last two years and, at $230, or $12,000 a year, are roughly average for the nation.
Georgia's unemployment trust fund, now at $1.4 billion, lost more than 26 percent of its value in the last year. But it is still one of the healthiest in the nation, relative to the state's size and unemployment history, according to the federal Labor Department. 
Labor Commissioner Michael L. Thurmond said that he hoped to make changes in the system -- for instance, covering women who quit jobs because of domestic abuse -- but that an overhaul of the system seemed unlikely.
Unemployment insurance, Mr. Thurmond said, "is not there to replace lost income, but to provide temporary support while somebody finds another job."
Many of the unemployed say it fails to do even that.
Here and across the country, they have responded by taking on more credit-card debt and dipping into retirement savings, among other steps, economics experts said. That reaction to a job loss is troubling, economists say, because it can snowball into years of financial difficulties.
Laura D. Sellers, 52, started using her credit cards when she was laid off in September from her job as a dispatcher at a Kmart distribution center in the Atlanta suburbs. 
"When I got my first check," Ms. Sellers recalled, "I thought: 'I'm supposed to survive on this? I'm supposed to pay bills with this?' "
Her weekly benefit is $194.
Deborah A. Williams has been receiving a benefit check each week for $228, $300 less than her salary at a sock factory in Greensboro that laid her off in October. 
Her husband also lost his job, at a pipe manufacturer. Instead of almost $1,000 a week in combined salary, they now receive a total of $340 in benefits. Mrs. Williams recently finished a six-week "basic hospitality class" at a new hotel that she hopes will hire her.
To pay bills while taking the class, she spent $22,000 of her $34,000 in 401(k) retirement money. Lacking health insurance, she is postponing surgery to remove a stomach tumor. 
"We just can't afford to make it off of unemployment," Ms. Williams, 43, said. "All I can do is hope and pray that something comes along real soon."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Univision bets on a new Spanish-language network, TeleFutura.

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
WITH the advertising business slumping so badly, it hardly seems the moment to start selling commercial time on a new television network.
 Or does it? 
 Enter TeleFutura, a Spanish-language network of Univision Communications of Los Angeles that made its debut on Monday. TeleFutura can be seen on 42 stations and hundreds of cable systems nationwide, making it accessible to about 80 percent of the Hispanic population of the country, Univision said.
TeleFutura will generate $100 million in revenue and break even in its first year, Univision officials say, with only minor cannibalization of the existing audience for the parent network, the top Spanish-language broadcaster in the United States. 
As the last census made clear, the nation's Hispanic population is exploding, and now totals more than 35.3 million people, or nearly 13 percent of the population. And with revenue last year of $550 million to $575 million, Univision's existing operations, which also include the Galavision cable network, already dominate the Spanish-language television market, regularly drawing about 80 percent of its audience. The rest goes to the much smaller Telemundo network, which was recently acquired for $1.98 billion by NBC, a unit of General Electric.
Even so, there is potential for more growth, said Ray Rodriguez, president of Univision's networks division, which operates out of Miami.
"A huge percentage of potential viewers still aren't watching us," he said -- referring to people who live in Spanish-speaking households but who nevertheless prefer English-language television. Indeed, despite the wide availability of its programs and those of Telemundo, Univision estimates that 40 to 45 percent of the viewing time of Spanish-dominant households is still devoted to shows in English.
That is because many people do not like the prime-time programming mix of Spanish-language television, Mr. Rodriguez said. Both Univision and Telemundo lean on shows like telenovelas, or soap operas, and therefore attract older and female viewers. By comparison, TeleFutura plans to use counterprogramming to attract a younger and larger male component. Univision predicts that only 25 percent of TeleFutura watchers will be Univision defectors, with the rest coming from Telemundo or English-language channels.
The network's initial program schedule is certainly proof of its strategy. For example, though it will show telenovelas, they have been relegated to daytime instead of prime time. Evening hours will be devoted almost exclusively to films, many of them action-oriented movies like "Tango and Cash" and "Missing in Action," both of which are scheduled for later this week. There will also be boxing on Friday nights; a nightly sports news show, "Contacto Deportivo"; extensive soccer coverage and a contemporary-music top hits show on weekend afternoons.
That music show, "La Cartelera Pepsi" ("The Pepsi Chart") is sponsored and produced by the Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo. Along with companies like Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, Wendy's International, Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser, Ford Motor and Toyota Motor, Pepsi is a charter advertiser on TeleFutura, Mr. Rodriguez said, meaning that the company "came in early" and "cut good deals."
Except for saying that TeleFutura's rates are "much lower" than those for Univision, Mr. Rodriguez would not elaborate. Nor would network officials disclose the sizes of the audiences they are promising to those who run commercials on TeleFutura.
Advertisers were similarly silent; for example, Giuseppe D'Alessandro, director of urban marketing for Pepsi-Cola, would not disclose the amount his company is spending on "La Cartelera Pepsi." But he did say that all of PepsiCo's advertising on TeleFutura would be in addition to its spending on Univision's main network. And he noted that PepsiCo's soft drink, Frito-Lay snack and Tropicana juice divisions would be doubling their combined television and radio spending in the nation's Hispanic market this year, an increase of "over $10 million."
That, of course, is the kind of talk that is music to the ears of people like Mr. Rodriguez, who sell time to advertisers on Hispanic stations. But those who follow the industry for securities firms remain a bit skeptical, especially given the national economic climate.
Despite Univision's rosy prediction that TeleFutura will break even, Paul T. Sweeney, a broadcast analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said, "We think that TeleFutura will lose between $15 million and $20 million this year."
That "might or might not be a big deal," Mr. Sweeney said, depending on whether the new network's viewers come primarily from Telemundo or English-language stations, as predicted, or whether they come instead from Univision itself.
"That's our big question," he said. "And we're taking a wait-and-see approach until we know."

HEADLINE: Troopers' Case Ends, But the Talk Goes On 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
In a Trenton courtroom, the case that got the nation talking about racial profiling ended Monday as two state troopers pleaded guilty to reduced charges in the shooting of three unarmed men on the New Jersey Turnpike four years ago. But here in the streets and stores of North Jersey, the talk rolled on today -- a mix of anger, resignation and cynicism about the plea deal, and only meager signs of hope that profiling will cease.
 "You're damn right justice is blind, because they sure didn't see this one," said Lamont Gentry, who is black, 28 and unemployed. 
 Like many of the nearly two dozen people interviewed, he objected to the plea agreement, which cost the troopers their jobs but spared them jail or probation. "I would like to have seen them get some jail time, probation even," Mr. Gentry said. "It's just not right to just say, 'O.K., you can go away now.' " 
The two troopers, John Hogan and James Kenna, who are white, were allowed to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges of obstructing the investigation. Both were originally charged with aggravated assault, and Mr. Kenna had been charged with attempted murder. In the April 1998 incident, the two officers stopped a van carrying three black and Latino men, then opened fire on the vehicle after they said it started to back toward them. Two of the occupants were wounded in the incident, which shined a spotlight on allegations of widespread racial profiling by the state police.
Under the pleas entered Monday, the troopers will each pay a $280 fine and be barred from ever serving as New Jersey state troopers. 
Today, white and minority people alike seemed to agree that the charges and sentences were too light, though they differed in the intensity of those feelings. Some whites saw the plea bargain as an understandable consequence of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Some profiling is now generally seen as acceptable, they said, and juries may be more likely to see the police as heroes rather than criminals.
"This sentence doesn't appear to be right," said Bill Ryan, 38, a compliance analyst with Prudential who is white and lives in Monmouth Beach, as he ate lunch today at the Commerce Food Court here. "But a prosecutor might think that people would give a policeman more leeway after Sept. 11."
Patricia Smith, 49, who was recently laid off as a human resources specialist, had no patience with such explanations as she walked across the parking lot of a Pathmark supermarket in West Orange. Ms. Smith, who is black and lives in Irvington, said the police were no more heroic than "the secretary at her desk and the janitor cleaning the bathroom" in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.
"It has nothing to do with Sept. 11," she said. "Profiling is profiling, and it's wrong and these guys wouldn't be heroes if they went out today and shot someone. This is a big crime."
But Cynthia Lynn, 40, who is black and works as an Essex County corrections officer, did not think that all profiling was wrong, and said that "under certain specific circumstances" it was a reasonable practice. Racial profiling, she added, was a "systemwide practice," and the two troopers should not have had to bear the burden for that.
"They were singled out, and it's not fair," she said, echoing the contention of the troopers' lawyers, who blamed the officers' superiors for the practices that led to the shooting incident. "They didn't sit in some bar and decide that they were going to go out and do this. They were doing what they were told, and they have suffered enough."
James Toscano, 34, the owner of City Beans Coffee in the Gateway office complex here, said the investigation into the turnpike shooting had not implicated all those it should have. He said he feared that with the combination of the plea deal -- which he said "was not a good thing" -- and the aftermath of the terror attacks, people would move on and not address the problem of profiling.
"There is a very dark view out there across the board after Sept. 11 and a feeling that everybody is no good," said Mr. Toscano, who is white. "When something huge like that happens, people put other things on the back burner."
George Philbert, a 55-year-old real estate salesman, scoffed at the suggestion of some that the barring of the two men from ever serving as New Jersey state troopers was a serious punishment.
"They are white and they will be gainfully employed no matter what," said Mr. Philbert, who is black, as he left a Kmart in West Orange. "Ultimately, this plea and sentence shows an indifference to profiling and to black people's lives, and it sends no signal to anyone that profiling is wrong."
Stephen Pascual, 25, who is Hispanic and works at a Staples in West Orange, said the pleas and sentences left a "bad taste in my mouth," similar to the feelings he had after the many times he had been stopped by police because of what he considered racial profiling.
"There are a lot of rotten apples in the police department and I work hard and try to better myself, but they still only see what is on the outside and the color of my skin," he said. "You hope and you hope that things will change, but hope can die, too."

HEADLINE: Navigating New Jersey's Future 

 BODY:
New Jersey's new governor, James McGreevey, was sworn into office yesterday and delivered an inaugural address about austerity and recovery. It was a speech notably spare of new programs and promises, urging New Jerseyans to "tighten our belts -- not harden our hearts, but tighten our belts and live within our means." 
 Americans will be hearing a lot of that kind of talk from state capitals this year. New Jersey is far from alone in having slashed taxes during the financial boom only to find that there was not enough money to make ends meet when the economy turned sour. But the effects of Sept. 11 and the interest on debt piled up by former Gov. Christie Whitman makes Mr. McGreevey's challenge particularly difficult. He is faced with a budget gap that may be as large as $2.8 billion. To close it he will have to prune spending ruthlessly, slashing not only wasteful programs but desirable ones as well. 
 The new governor did recognize that some crucial needs could not be deferred. Encouragingly, he declared his top priority to be closing the achievement gap in early childhood education between affluent suburban districts and the troubled inner-city schools that the state is already under court order to improve. 
Two other exceptions need to be made from the overall budget-cutting. The state needs to find innovative ways to promote redevelopment in the struggling cities of Newark and Camden and rebuild the environmental enforcement programs gutted during the past eight years of Republican rule. Mr. McGreevey also needs to address several other policy issues that do not come with a big price tag, like rebuilding a more cooperative relationship with New York on regional development issues and eliminating the ugly culture of racial profiling among New Jersey's state police. 
Most of the new governor's first appointments have been encouraging, easing fears that he might use them to pay political debts to the Democratic Party bosses and labor unions that helped him to his easy election victory over the conservative Republican Bret Schundler last November. Instead Mr. McGreevey named a tough-minded outsider, Joseph Santiago, to run the state police, and recruited a nationally respected environmentalist, Bradley Campbell, to run the Department of Environmental Protection. He has also followed through on his campaign pledge to re-create the office of public advocate as an independent monitor of governmental performance.
Mr. McGreevey is undoubtedly conscious of what happened to New Jersey's last Democratic governor, Jim Florio, who also took office during an inherited fiscal emergency. To minimize spending cuts, Mr. Florio pushed through a large and unpopular increase in the state income tax. He never recovered from the ensuing backlash and was driven from office after a single term with most of his reform agenda unachieved. That sobering history has made New Jersey tax hikes virtually unthinkable. However, there has been no comparable test to see how the state's voters would react to deep cuts in critical services. Chances are they would respond with equal levels of hostility.
Mr. McGreevey is walking a narrow path between two political chasms, and he is going to have to figure out how to bring the state back to fiscal health without falling off on either side. So far, his appointments and priorities suggest he is starting on the right track.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE REPAIR BILL; 
Kabul Needs $15 Billion, Official Says

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
The interim government of Afghanistan needs an immediate infusion of money to keep operating, the head of the United Nations Development Program said today, adding that over the next 10 years, about $15 billion will be required to reconstruct the country.
 The figures outlining the financial needs for Afghanistan were prepared jointly by the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. They were presented at a news conference today by the administrator of the development program, Mark Malloch Brown, as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other foreign ministers prepared to attend a donors' conference next week in Tokyo to discuss Afghanistan's financial needs. 
 Responding to the plea for financial help, Secretary Powell said today that the United States should be able to help free up this week more than $200 million in frozen funds that could be used to pay government expenses.
On his way to a peacemaking mission in South Asia, a visit to the Afghan capital of Kabul and the conference in Tokyo, Secretary Powell told reporters aboard his plane that, "We're hard at work, and I hope I'll be able to give them some good news," when he meets later this week with the provisional Afghan leader, Hamid Karzai.
According to the financial report, Afghanistan will require $5 billion over the next two and a half years, another $5 billion in the following five years, and a total of $15 billion over 10 years. The high initial sum, Mr. Brown said, reflected the costs of providing security for the country, and the bankruptcy of the country.
"This government has quite literally empty coffers," Mr. Brown said. "There are central bank vaults which are quite empty, which are echo chambers."
Secretary Powell agreed, noting that the short-term money was "really just the beginning, though; they're going to need a lot of help."
"The simplest things are needed," he said, "in order to get this country up and running," from phone systems to security and other infrastructure. All of that is to be addressed at the international conference in Tokyo that will be attended by the United States, the European Union, Saudi Arabia and Japan.
United Nations officials have warned that the Afghan government faces possible collapse if it is unable in the coming days to pay more than 200,000 civil servants and police officers the salaries and back pay they are owed. Those immediate costs are separate from the country's long-term reconstruction needs.
Mr. Brown said it was "enormously important conceptually" for the new coalition administration to start delivering vital services quickly. An entire generation of Afghans, he said, had grown up with no memory of any government delivering any services, so that quickly rebuilding a basic social contract between the government and people was crucial for the long-term stability of the Afghan state.
For its part, the United States is expected to unfreeze $221 million in Afghan government assets frozen after the terror bombings of the American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya.

HEADLINE: Misdirected Defense Dollars 

 BODY:
It's axiomatic that military budgets grow in wartime, and this year will be no exception. The Bush administration's planned $350 billion Pentagon budget for the next fiscal year is some $20 billion higher than current spending and a 6 percent increase over the rate of inflation. Events since Sept. 11 have clearly demonstrated the need for a highly flexible military force, adequately paid and housed, maintained in a high state of readiness and equipped with the appropriate high-tech tools of 21st-century warfare. 
 Unfortunately, the budget prepared by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld shortchanges the Bush administration's earlier promises of a boldly transformed military. While some of the new budget money will go toward improved pay and modernization, the Pentagon is still spending too much on costly weapons systems designed for an earlier era, squandering funds that should be going to more rapid modernization. 
 Future phases of the war on terrorism, whether in the Middle East, Africa or Southeast Asia, are likely to bear a closer resemblance to the conflict in Afghanistan than to the cold-war clashes for which the latest generation of weapons systems were designed. Afghanistan highlighted the need for pilotless aircraft and long-range bombers that did not depend on the availability of nearby American air bases. It underscored the importance of light, mobile ground forces, special operations teams and Navy surface ships and submarines that can launch planes and cruise missiles.
Military planners must be ready to fight other kinds of wars as well, but the Pentagon ought to discard obsolete assumptions about the most likely enemies or battlefields. The Air Force, for example, remains committed to the F-22, a short-range tactical fighter designed for cold-war dogfights. America's existing fighter fleet of F-15's, F-16's and the newly approved Joint Strike Fighter already assure aerial supremacy over any conceivable foe for the next generation. Air Force dollars should go to unmanned reconnaissance and attack craft like the Predator, long-range bombers and the troop transport planes that are in chronic short supply. 
The Army should not be building its future around heavy weapons like the 70-ton Crusader howitzer system. The Crusader has many impressive battlefield features, but the Army's bulky equipment and lack of mobility have limited the service's role in Afghanistan and would have made many Army units unsuitable for action in Kosovo had allied ground troops been needed there.
The Navy and Marine Corps have been doing better at modernization, converting submarines to launch cruise missiles instead of nuclear missiles and delaying production of large and expensive stealth destroyers. Still, there is little justification for the Navy to build a new generation of attack submarines.
The Bush administration is right to press ahead with efforts to improve military pay, housing and health care. Those are dollars well spent. Another useful initiative was thwarted by Congress late last year. Secretary Rumsfeld tried to free more money for modernization through another round of base closings. Although about 25 percent of current bases are militarily obsolete, lawmakers postponed action until 2005. 
With the public in a mood to spend more on defense and the conflict in Afghanistan emphasizing the importance of military modernization, this year's budget offered an extraordinary opportunity for Mr. Rumsfeld to call on the various services to update their spending priorities. Instead, he largely bowed to the momentum of familiar weapons programs. It will now be up to Congress to press for more forward-looking budgeting.

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
Deficit Cloud on Horizon Grows to Ominous Size

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
HE got here by winning over every important Democratic constituency group and alienating none, by smiling and stroking and ingratiating his way across the state and up the ladder of politics.
 Now, New Jersey's new governor, James E. McGreevey, has the enviable title and the unenviable task -- the "joyful burden," he called it, like a priest describing his calling -- of closing a $2.8 billion budgetary hole, with no time to spare and but a single obvious tool at his disposal: the ax. 
 In his inaugural yesterday, Governor McGreevey suggested that restoring the state to fiscal health would take the kind of shared sacrifice seen after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. But whom will he ask first? Where will the blade land? How joyful will the reaction be of those who feel its cut? 
The $2.8 billion number keeps haunting New Jersey's leaders, like snake eyes. Over Mr. McGreevey's right shoulder was Jim Florio, who raised taxes by that amount in his first months as governor in 1990, hoping to fix the state's failing public schools in needy urban districts. Instead, he managed only to demonstrate convincingly that big tax increases are a sure-fire route to a single term.
Nowhere to be seen at the festivities was Christie Whitman, who borrowed $2.8 billion in 1997 in a complicated gamble that her Treasury could recover its costs, and more, by investing in the stock market. That looked prescient as long as the stock market was rising. Now it just looks like a load of debt.
During his campaign last fall, Mr. McGreevey tied his own hands, promising he would neither resort to borrowing nor increases in the sales or income tax. Yesterday, he reaffirmed, "The days of irresponsible borrowing and runaway spending are over."
But the financial challenge he expected during the campaign is now taking on the dimensions of a mushroom cloud. In early December, the departing Republican treasurer put the shortfall in revenues at $700 million. In the space of a month, he revised it to $1.4 billion, then again to $2.4 billion. And that does not include the $400 million in spending added by Republican lawmakers on their way out the door. Next year, officials say, the gap could reach $5 billion.
Mr. McGreevey did not talk much about the ax yesterday. His advisers sound as if they are still holding out hope that a pile of money, or potential savings, will turn up once they get the keys to all the rooms in the State House's steam tunnels and sub-basements.
"We campaigned on eliminating waste and mismanagement," said Steve DeMicco, a media consultant, hinting of big news to come, "but we had no idea."
HIS day-old administration talks about other painless options. The state's Unemployment Insurance Fund, for example, is sitting on nearly $4 billion it didn't have to pay to people who didn't need it because they had jobs. But lawmakers balk, saying using that money to close a budget hole means it won't be there when it is needed by people once employed by Lucent or Ford or whichever company next announces layoffs.
What is more, the labor unions that were joined to Mr. McGreevey's hip throughout his campaign -- the governor thanked John Sweeney, president of the national A.F.L.-C.I.O., for showing up yesterday -- want that unemployment insurance money to be used for paid family leave. No state has such a program, Republicans say, and New Jersey can't afford it. Does Mr. Sweeney agree?
Sales and income taxes are still way, way off the table. But some taxes will rise. One ploy Mr. McGreevey is considering is cutting the property tax rebate known as New Jersey Saver. And the days of cheap gasoline may be numbered: every extra penny a gallon in tax brings in $50 million a year.
Spending will continue to climb, meanwhile, in many areas largely beyond Mr. McGreevey's control, like Medicaid benefits, prescription drug assistance for the elderly, and school aid tied to enrollment.
The schools in New Jersey's cities are still failing, by the way, despite Mr. Florio's efforts a decade ago. Waiting for Mr. McGreevey to show up for a Web chat with fourth graders yesterday, Dashawn Furqan, 9, of Trenton, said he thought that governor were in charge of "school supplies."
Mr. McGreevey had just promised to ensure that every third grader can read. Doing so will mean finding more money for school supplies like more and better teachers.
For the foreseeable future, freeing up that money will only lead the new governor back to the ax.

HEADLINE: Parents Vote Not to Reopen Public School Shut Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
An overwhelming majority of parents from Public School 89, which was shuttered after the World Trade Center attack, voted last night against a Board of Education plan to reopen the school building on Feb. 4.
 Although Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said last month that the school building, on Warren Street near West Street, was safe, and some parents are eager for their children to return, many parents have expressed skepticism, citing potential health issues and psychological harm. 
 "We don't send our children to school to rebuild downtown," said Jodi Carse, whose 6-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter attend the school. "We send them there to educate them." 
The school has already moved twice since the attack: first to a wing of P.S. 3 in Greenwich Village, and then, in October, to a building on the Lower East Side, where the students share a building owned by the Board of Education with a small alternative school. P.S. 89's enrollment has dwindled by almost half since Sept. 11, to 218 from 415.
Sharon Srague, co-chairwoman of the parent-teacher association, , fears that a third relocation in half a year would further depress enrollment. The students and teachers have adapted well to the Lower East Side building, she said, and it would be "inopportune" to disrupt their daily patterns yet again.
Catie Marshall, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said tests conducted daily by a board contractor at Stuyvesant High School, which is also close to the trade center site, had showed no signs of asbestos since the beginning of December. The opening date for P.S. 89, along with two other schools in the neighborhood, Public Schools 234 and 150, is not negotiable, she said.
"We would not dream of opening any school anywhere if there is any hazard there," Ms. Marshall said. "Some parents want to return in March, some want to return in May, some want to return in September. No matter what we do, some parents are not going to be happy." 
Some members of the parent-teacher association said they would seek legal recourse if Mr. Levy refuses to negotiate. "If he doesn't want to do it, we will get a judge to tell him to do it," Ms. Carse said.

Intel Reports That Earnings For Quarter Beat Estimates

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
Ending its worst year on an upbeat note, the Intel Corporation reported fourth-quarter earnings today that exceeded most expectations.
 Although unwilling to call an end to the chip industry's slump, Intel said its sales had jumped 7 percent from the third quarter to the fourth. The company, the world's largest chip maker, attributed the improvement to strong sales of its new flagship product, the Pentium 4 microprocessor for personal computers. 
 Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., became the latest high-technology bellwether to suggest that the troubles facing the industry last year abated somewhat toward the end of the year. Analysts and manufacturers like Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard had predicted dreary holiday sales of personal computers, but said recently that consumers had bought more PC's and other electronic devices than expected. 
"A year that began with economic decline ended on a note of stability," Andy D. Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts.
But in a troubling sign for manufacturers of chip-making equipment, Intel cut its spending budget for 2002 by 25 percent, to $5.5 billion from $7.3 billion, a much sharper decline than the 15 percent cut expected by analysts. Mr. Bryant said Intel invested heavily last year in machines that make chips more efficiently, so the company would be able to meet demand for its products this year without spending as much. The news sent the price of shares in equipment makers like Applied Materials tumbling in after-hours trading.
Shares of Intel fell 16 cents, to $34.68, in regular trading, then fell further, to as low as $33.71 in after-hours trading.
For the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 29, Intel reported earnings of $504 million, or 7 cents a share. The numbers declined sharply from the comparable period in 2000, when Intel turned a profit of $2.2 billion, or 32 cents a share.
After setting aside charges related to acquisitions, Intel earned $998 million, or 15 cents a share, beating estimates by 4 cents a share. Wall Street had expected earnings of 11 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
"There are not a lot of bad things to say here," said Jonathan J. Joseph, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "These guys are doing great."
Intel's smaller businesses continued to struggle, however. The networking division lost $129 million, and the division that makes chips for wireless devices broke even.
Over all, sales were $7 billion, higher than Intel's latest forecast of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion but down from $8.7 billion in the fourth quarter the previous year.
For the current quarter, Intel predicted sales of $6.4 billion to $7 billion, following the usual pattern of flat or slightly lower revenue from the fourth quarter to the first.
"We haven't seen any evidence of an economic recovery," Mr. Bryant said. "What we have seen is a return to normal seasonal patterns off of a newer economic level."
After a record year in 2000, the bottom fell out of the chip market in the first quarter of 2001. As consumers and large corporations reduced spending on computers, PC makers stopped placing such large orders for chips. Intel and a rival, Advanced Micro Devices, cut prices throughout the year as demand waned.
But the two chip makers have had a small resurgence in demand in the fourth quarter. "There was a surprise upside in Q4 that I don't think anyone, including Intel, expected," said Dean McCarron, a principal analyst with Mercury Research. 
During its fourth-quarter conference call Wednesday, Advanced Micro is expected to post a narrower loss than was expected a few months ago and to say that it is finally able to raise prices on its chips after a year of falling demand.
Intel said today that its average selling prices declined, largely because Microsoft bought so many of Intel's older and less expensive microprocessor, the Pentium III, to power its new Xbox video-game console, which has sold 1.5 million units since its release in November. If not for the purchases by Microsoft, Intel said, its average prices would have been roughly flat.
Despite the declining prices, Intel said it profited from a low-double-digit increase in unit sales of microprocessors, as well as a 16 percent cut in operating expenses from the fourth quarter of 2000. The company said it reduced its work force last year by 7,000 employees, to 83,000, without major layoffs.
Intel said it would spend about half of its $5.5 billion capital expense budget on manufacturing equipment. Research and development costs are expected to increase to $4.1 billion, from $3.8 billion.

HEADLINE: McGREEVEY PLEADS FOR TRENTON UNITY 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan 15 

 BODY:
Declaring that the "days of irresponsible borrowing and runaway spending are over," James E. McGreevey was sworn in as New Jersey's 51st governor today and challenged state residents to help him improve their educational system and deter terrorism even while facing a spiraling fiscal crisis. 
 In an inaugural address notable for its absence of specific program proposals, Mr. McGreevey, 44, assured residents that budget problems need not dampen their ambitions, and must not prevent the state from fulfilling its obligation to provide children with a good education. Pointing to the outpouring of good will after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. McGreevey said that New Jersey could emerge from the recession even stronger if state residents sought to sustain that sense of unity. 
 "So this is my call to action," he said. "In the days ahead, each citizen of New Jersey should demand more of me. That is your right. But you also must ask more of yourselves. That is your responsibility." 
When he took the oath of office at 12:20 p.m. -- flanked by his parents, his wife, Dina Matos, and their infant daughter, Jacqueline -- Mr. McGreevey completed a long and unlikely political journey. As the little-known mayor of Woodbridge, he nearly unseated Gov. Christie Whitman in 1997, and never really stopped campaigning afterward. After putting down several challenges within the party, he easily won victory in November, and his inauguration helped restore Democrats to power 10 years after voters banished them for enacting a $2.8 billion tax increase.
Despite their triumph, however, many Democrats seemed to be bracing for difficult decisions in the months to come as they wrestle with a $2.8 billion budget gap. The new governor and Democratic legislative leaders have vowed not to raise taxes, and Mr. McGreevey's inaugural reference to "irresponsible borrowing," which echoed his criticism of Republicans during the campaign, leaves few options other than deep program cuts or possibly laying off state workers. 
Whatever challenges might await him, Mr. McGreevey seemed determined to relish his day. After a morning prayer service in Princeton, he was greeted by rousing cheers at the War Memorial in Trenton, and took his place at the front of a stage crowded with his friends, family, state legislators, labor leaders, members of the New Jersey Congressional delegation and the former Democratic governors Jim Florio and Brendan T. Byrne. Mrs. Whitman, who stepped down last year to become administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, did not attend, but the three men who served as acting governor in her absence were seated on stage. 
Mr. McGreevey appeared so buoyant as he waited to take his oath that when the American Boys Choir performed the "Hallelujah" Chorus, he could be seen mouthing the words. 
During a 20-minute address that referred to John F. Kennedy, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. McGreevey also quoted from a speech Abraham Lincoln made to the New Jersey Senate in 1861, en route to his own inauguration. Lincoln, he said,marveled at the enormous hardships the Continental Army had endured to defeat the British in the Battle of Trenton in 1776. Lincoln remarked that they must have been inspired by the promise of a new nation.
"Together we must recapture that spirit of Trenton which Lincoln observed," the governor said. "If we can do that, no terrorists will prevail against us. No challenge will discourage us. No legitimate disagreement will cause us to be disagreeable. And no citizen, however humble, will be ignored." 
Virtually the only detailed policy goal Mr. McGreevey stated was a pledge to improve reading levels in grade schools. In some schools 30 percent of third graders read below grade level. Rather than presenting a list of initiatives, Mr. McGreevey instead offered a new approach to problem-solving and said he would reach out to New Jersey residents and institutions that had been excluded from the political process. 
"We need to change the way we think about our problems and change the way we solve them," he said. "We need universities actively engaged in the priorities of the state. We need public-private partnerships that transcend old barriers. We need cooperation between labor and business, Republicans and Democrats, between cities and suburbs." 
Some civil rights leaders were disappointed that the new governor did not mention racial profiling, which has dominated the state's politics since troopers shot three unarmed men during an April 1998 traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike. On Monday, the troopers were allowed to plea guilty to reduced charges that spared them jail time and probation, a move that angered many black and Latino New Jerseyans. 
"The governor mentioned Martin Luther King today because it's his birthday," said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey. "But Martin Luther King also said that peace isn't just the absence of tension; it's the presence of justice. And African-Americans are tired of being denied justice."
But most of the audience praised Mr. McGreevey for offering optimism without bogging down in detail. Mr. Byrne said Mr. McGreevey's address showed strong leadership because he did not duck tough issues. United States Senator Jon S. Corzine, a fellow Democrat, said he was encouraged that Mr. McGreevey had insisted that fiscal responsibility would be his top priority.
State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., Republican state chairman, said that while Mr. McGreevey's criticism of the state's increased debt during the Whitman administration was language better left to the campaign trail, he thought the speech was effective.
"He did a good job of laying out his priorities, setting his tone," Mr. Kyrillos said. "We've all got to work together because there are some serious issues ahead."
Even as Mr. McGreevey and legislators spoke of bipartisanship and unity, however, there were signs of difficult political battles to come. While Democrats now control the General Assembly, and the State Senate is split 20-20, the McGreevey administration has already spoken to one Republican senator, John Mattheussen, about possibly joining the administration as the commissioner of transportation.
Senator Mattheussen said he had not been formally offered the position and he was not certain he would accept. If he were to join the administration, however, his departure would grant Democrats control of both houses of the Legislature.
And while the inaugural parade was still marching past the State House, the State Senate Judiciary Committee released a letter requesting more information before it would consider confirming Mr. McGreevey's nominee for state police superintendent. The nominee, Joseph Santiago, Newark's police chief, was twice convicted for disorderly conduct, although one conviction was later overturned.
Mr. McGreevey's spokesman, Paul Aronsohn, said the new governor was aware of the incidents and was still convinced that Mr. Santiago was the best candidate.
As he prepared for his inaugural ball, however, Mr. McGreevey spent the day basking in congratulations rather than mapping political strategy. At 4 p.m., when 30 people threw an impromptu rally on the steps of the State House, he invited the entire crowd into his new office.
Mr. McGreevey, to applause, then made his first entrance into the State House as governor.
At the inaugural ball about 9 last night, at the Raritan Center in Edison, Mr. McGreevey gave warm thanks to all who had supported him, and a word of advice to his staff: "All cabinet members, tomorrow morning, governor's office, 8 a.m. Now go and get some sleep."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 19, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the inauguration of James E. McGreevey as governor of New Jersey misstated the name of a choir that performed. It is the American Boychoir, not Boys Choir.
An article about the celebratory mood among Trenton Democrats misstated the uniqueness of Mr. McGreevey's inaugural parade. It was the state's first inaugural parade since Gov. Jim Florio's, in 1990, not the first ever.

A Clinton Loyalist Puts Faith in a Fortified Harlem

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
CLYDE WILLIAMS, the domestic policy adviser to Bill Clinton, is heading to a bakery down Lenox Avenue in Harlem, a few blocks from Mr. Clinton's new penthouse office. But it's not just any bakery. He opens the door of an elegant new establishment, Settepani, owned by an Eritrean woman who greets him warmly.
 "They got empowerment zone money," points out Mr. Williams, slipping his lean frame behind an Italian marble table for a pot of tea. "And who created the empowerment zones? Clinton. He's had an impact in helping to improve the community already." 
 Mr. Williams, a 39-year-old Washington transplant, has this way of embedding nuggets about his boss's accomplishments during a long chat. He's the loyal lieutenant.
Mr. Williams arrived in Harlem last summer to work for the former president at 55 West 125th Street. Wearing a gray Hugo Boss suit on a recent morning, he reminds you of one of those high-powered types on "The West Wing," the TV show about a fictional White House. He's smart and amiable, yet careful about what he says. His mind seems to work overtime imagining how things will be spun.
So what exactly does a domestic policy adviser do for a former president? Funny that you should ask. Basically, anything the ex-president wants.
For the moment, Mr. Williams's job description extends to the international. He's helping to organize a Jan. 24 conference that Mr. Clinton is sponsoring at New York University, called "Islam and America in a Global World." Mr. Williams says Mr. Clinton wants to keep a dialogue going about religious reconciliation and racial diversity.
But Mr. Williams says they're keeping a close eye on Harlem, too.
"Harlem is the president's home," says Mr. Williams, leaning back. A crisp shirt sleeve reveals silver cuff links shaped like trumpets. (He's a big jazz fan and bought them when Miles Davis died.) "If we can make things work here, we will attempt to replicate them in other places." 
Mr. Williams says his office is developing partnerships to deliver after-school programs and economic education in the public schools, and to provide technical assistance to small Harlem businesses. "He wants to do things to empower underserved communities," he says.
Earlier that morning, back at Mr. Clinton's headquarters, Mr. Williams allows a peek into Mr. Clinton's post-presidential sanctuary. He takes a shortcut through a window-lined conference room, pushing open a hidden door in a wood-paneled wall.
"The president comes out of here and it trips people out," Mr. Williams says with a boyish grin. "They think it's a wall."
Mr. Williams doesn't turn on the lights in the large, oblong office. It's tastefully appointed with paintings by famous black artists like Jacob Lawrence and Romare Bearden. There are family pictures, a photograph of Gandhi; books are everywhere. Mr. Clinton's desk is tidy, with a lone letter awaiting his attention. Mr. Williams steers a visitor away from a quick gander.
So where is the former leader of the free world? Mr. Williams says his boss is coming in later that day. He was in Mexico earlier in the week.
STANDING at the window, Mr. Williams comments on the panoramic view. You can see Central Park and beyond the Triborough Bridge. He's asked if he thinks this view beats the one at Carnegie Hall Tower. Mr. Clinton had considered moving there but abandoned the idea after a barrage of criticism about the high Midtown rent. Mr. Williams says he never set foot in the place.
Next question.
A Howard University graduate, Mr. Williams worked in the Clinton administration as deputy chief of staff for Daniel R. Glickman, the secretary of agriculture. Before that, he was deputy director of presidential scheduling in the White House.
Born and bred in Washington, Mr. Williams is the son of a public school teacher, now retired, in the District of Columbia. His father died of a heart attack when he was 3. He got interested in politics as a teenager because a friend's father, Harry Thomas Sr., was a City Council member. 
"People naturally gravitate toward things they find interesting; I'm a doer," he says.
When he talks about his hometown, he sounds a bit wistful. He says it defined him. "It's such a political city." He's also a newlywed. His wife, Mona Sutphen, the vice president of a consulting company run by the former national security adviser Sandy Berger, still lives there. He rents a small Harlem apartment.
For the last few months, Mr. Williams has been ushering a steady stream of Harlem leaders and residents into his office to get the lay of the land. In Mr. Clinton's office of 13 staff members, Mr. Williams answers only to Maggie Williams, the chief of staff, who is no relation, and the president.
Some Harlem insiders do not envy Mr. Williams his task of managing the expectations of a community that has embraced Mr. Clinton, and quite frankly hopes for something in return. Lloyd Williams, president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, says he, for one, is impatient with Mr. Clinton's pace.
But Clyde Williams is upbeat, saying that he sees only challenges. "The challenges are trying to get things done with a lot less," he says. "When President Clinton was president, it was a lot easier to implement things. You had the resources of the federal government. Now, it's not as easy. Yet I think he will find a way to get things done that are important to him."

HEADLINE: A Moment to Seize in Kashmir 

BYLINE:  By Ayesha Siddiqa-Agha; Ayesha Siddiqa-Agha, author of "Pakistan's Arms Procurement and Military Buildup, 1979-99," is former director of naval research for the Pakistan Navy and a defense analyst.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
The national address by President Pervez Musharraf on Saturday has been praised both in Pakistan and internationally, but it has also generated debate on the real intent behind it. While setting a new agenda of arresting Islamic militants in de-escalating the immediate tension with India, the speech fell short of announcing any major changes in Pakistan's support for Kashmir's struggle to become part of Pakistan. The Indian government appeared less impressed than the international press precisely because the speech did not indicate any fundamental policy change. In fact General Musharraf reiterated that the Kashmir issue "runs in our Pakistani blood."
 Yet in Islamabad the discussion is whether it was entirely India's belligerence that motivated General Musharraf's stronger antiterrorist measures. Most people here view his objective as staving off an attack from India or, more pragmatically, making possible the demobilization of Pakistani forces on the Indian border, which would reduce the burden on Pakistan's military, currently also mobilized on the Afghan border. 
 Many analysts in Pakistan were also worried about the security of its nuclear assets. The fear was that any escalation of the conflict might lead the United States to use special forces to eliminate Islamabad's nuclear arsenal, perhaps in joint action with the Indians, to avoid the risk of a nuclear war. This fear helped justify the decision by General Musharraf to announce measures that would appease Washington and New Delhi.
A general perception in Pakistan is that both the escalation of tension and now its de-escalation came out of increased American involvement in the region. The view is that Washington used New Delhi to put pressure on Pakistan to rein in the militants who were operating on multiple fronts in Afghanistan and Kashmir -- and that without America's tacit support, India would not have resorted to this kind of mobilization of forces. At the same time, many also remain certain that Washington would have worked to avoid an actual outbreak of conflict. Interestingly, a segment of Islamabad's policy makers believe that a prolonged American presence in the region can be an effective deterrent against the outbreak of hostilities. They also welcome American presence as an opportunity for future economic development.
A reversal of Islamabad's policy on Kashmiri militancy benefits Washington's interests and New Delhi's -- and in the long term, Islamabad's interests as well. None of this would be possible without the new American strategic interest and presence in the region.
From the American standpoint, curbing Pakistani militancy is part of addressing the greater problem of eliminating international terrorist networks. From the Indian perspective, reining in the militants would reduce the violent struggle inside Indian-occupied Kashmir and provide an indirect advantage to Indian forces in that area. Even a temporary weakening of Islamabad's policy on Kashmiri militancy would help in breaking the momentum that the struggle to break from India had gained inside the Kashmir valley.
These changes are not easily embraced by Islamabad. But they become more acceptable if they open the door to finding a solution to this territorial dispute, ideally through multilateral means. Pakistan has always been interested in having a third party, preferably America, involved in negotiating a resolution. General Musharraf hinted at allowing the Kashmiris to choose a third option -- an independent Kashmir -- as a possible solution.
India should take advantage of General Musharraf's conciliatory measures in controlling the militants. The fact is that his team of senior generals will not simply allow the Kashmir issue to die down. That is why India needs to see this moment as an opportunity -- made possible by international pressures on Pakistan -- to solve the Kashmir question permanently.
Still, much will depend on Washington's taking an active role. Before the attack on the Indian Parliament in December, the American ambassador in Pakistan had been discussing the possibility of turning the line of control between India and Pakistan in Kashmir into an international boundary. Such a change would give legitimacy to both countries' control of their parts of Kashmir. The Musharraf regime, in risking domestic opposition by its crackdown on Islamic militants, would want a better solution than this.
The question is whether the United States can persuade India to accept a different type of deal. A solution may not be found in the next six months. But the present moment offers the South Asian rivals a chance to establish the terms of negotiations that might lead to a solution in the next two to three years.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Citigroup Names New President Amid Talk of More Acquisitions

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
Citigroup filled the long-vacant job of president yesterday amid talk that its chief executive, Sanford I. Weill, is preparing to go on the acquisition trail yet again.
 Robert B. Willumstad, who has overseen the company's vast and highly profitable consumer business, becomes president, a position unfilled since the departure of James Dimon in November 1998. 
 Analysts said yesterday that the appointment appeared to place Mr. Willumstad, 56, as the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Weill, 68, and reinforces the importance of the consumer operation, which accounts for half of Citigroup's profits. "We think it's a great business," Mr. Weill said in an interview yesterday. 
Some bankers and investors expect Mr. Weill to make further acquisitions in consumer banking after receiving an estimated $5 billion in proceeds later this year from the spinoff of the property and casualty insurance business. A likely target, these bankers and investors say, is FleetBoston Financial, the Boston-based company that is confronting large losses from its banking business in Argentina.
Mr. Weill met with Terrence Murray, the chairman of Fleet, last summer, according to executives close to the conversation. Mr. Murray stepped down as chief executive at the end of the year and was replaced by Charles K. Gifford, previously president of the bank and before that chief executive of BankBoston, which merged with Fleet in October 1999.
The meeting was social, an executive close to the conversation said. At least three executives said the topic of a merger was broached. While nothing came of the conversation, the investment bankers and investors said the two banks would fit well together. "He sold his bank once before," one banker said of Mr. Gifford, referring to the merger of Bank of Boston and Fleet. "He will make the decision that is right for shareholders."
The question is whether Mr. Gifford will want to sell now. Fleet's stock has fallen 15 percent over the last year, partly because of its business in recession-plagued Argentina, as well as poor performance in its corporate banking and venture capital businesses.
James Mahoney, a spokesman for Fleet, denied that a merger was in the works. "Chad has just taken the reins," Mr. Mahoney said. "The strategy is in place to grow the franchise, and we're optimistic about 2002." Mr. Weill declined to specifically discuss Fleet or comment at all about how he anticipated using the proceeds from the spinoff. "We don't even have that money yet," he said. 
Though a partnership might have to wait for Fleet's stock to recover some, analysts said a pairing could make sense.
"Citigroup is the biggest financial services conglomerate in the country, but in terms of retail banking deposits, they aren't the largest," said Thomas Goggins, manager of the John Hancock Financial Industries Fund. "Certainly having a bigger footprint in the United States may not be a bad idea."
The consumer deposit business is strong right now, as investors burned by the stock market over the last two years seek the safe haven of bank accounts. Citigroup acquired European-American Bank last year for $1.6 billion.
Citigroup ranks sixth in terms of United States retail deposits, according to SNL Securities, a data concern focused on the banking industry. Citigroup had $121 billion in United States deposits as of Sept. 30, compared with $314 billion for the leader, Bank of America. 
Citigroup and Fleet overlap in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Florida, according to SNL, but Citigroup has no presence in several New England states where Fleet is a dominant presence, including Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.
A purchase of Fleet would also win Citigroup an expanded presence in Latin America, where Citigroup has been expanding. Citigroup acquired Mexico's second largest bank, Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, in August. Although Fleet's Argentina business does not look too attractive now, the company also has a presence in Brazil. Latin America accounted for 3 percent of Fleet's earnings last year; the region accounted for about 12 percent of Citigroup's profits in the third quarter, stock analysts said.
"The rumor about Citigroup and Fleet has been around for a long time," said Ronald Mandle, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. A retail banking acquisition could make sense, he said, but Citigroup might prefer a bank with branches in faster growing states, like Florida, California or Texas.
Citigroup's consumer business, which includes credit cards, consumer deposits and loans, has been quite profitable. The third quarter was a tough one for Citigroup and other banks because of the economic disruption of the September terrorist attacks, but the company's global consumer business reported a 26 percent increase in earnings before nonrecurring charges.
The performance helped Mr. Willumstad get the nod from Mr. Weill, who has worked with him since 1987. That year, Mr. Willumstad joined Commercial Credit, a finance company Mr. Weill then ran and a predecessor to Citigroup. He went on to run the consumer lending businesses as Mr. Weill's empire expanded. He will continue to run Citigroup's consumer group, as well as oversee the company's financial and human resource functions, the company said.
"I have had the opportunity to see the company grow, and I have seen Sandy's management style and attention to detail," Mr. Willumstad said.
"He and Sandy go way back," said Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, about Mr. Willumstad. "Like Sandy, Bob is focused on the bottom line and on expense controls."
The appointment may also ease investors' fears about the lack of a successor for Mr. Weill. There has been uncertainty on the matter ever since the departure of Mr. Dimon, now the chief executive of Bank One Corporation. Mr. Dimon was fired abruptly after rumors that Mr. Weill was unhappy with the way Mr. Dimon had treated Mr. Weill's daughter, who earlier had run the mutual fund business of Salomon Smith Barney.
"Succession has been on a lot of investors' minds," said Henry Dickson, a stock analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Still, analysts and Mr. Weill noted that he had no plans to leave soon and could still anoint someone else. "This is not about that," Mr. Weill said. "I'm a pretty straightforward person, and if that's what I wanted to signal, that's what I would have said. At the time it's appropriate for Citigroup to name a successor, we will name a successor."

HEADLINE: Excess State Spending 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Our Wretched States," by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 11): 
 Tax cuts did not cause the current fiscal crisis in the states. 
A report we recently released found that states spent two of every three surplus dollars on new government programs.
Mr. Krugman acknowledges that states spent a lot of money in the past decade but dismisses this by suggesting that state spending was at "about" the same level, as a percentage of gross domestic product, at the end of the decade as it was at the beginning. That state spending remained constant as a share of G.D.P. in a growing economy proves that the state governments were growing too big and too fat.
Higher state spending always means higher taxes, and the faster our state policy makers understand this, the faster our economy will resume its upward course.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE ART; 
'Cheese!' To 'Print,' In One Step

BYLINE:  By David Pogue 

 BODY:
THE digital age has done wonders for photography. Once you had to take your film to the mall for developing. But today you can eliminate all that expensive hassle with little more than a $600 digital camera, a $300 printer and a $1,000 computer. Just connect the camera to the computer with a U.S.B. cable; copy your multimegabyte JPEG files to the hard drive; open the photos in an image-processing program; rotate and crop each one, adjusting the color; calculate the pixel density and desired output dimensions -- and then click on Print. What could be simpler?
 If you're among the millions of Americans who don't have a computer -- and even if you're not -- the answer may well be "Almost anything." 
 But times are changing. Canon, Hewlett-Packard and Epson have recently hit upon a clever invention that vastly simplifies the route from camera to paper: direct-print photo printers. 
In most regards, these machines look and work just as other color inkjets do. If you have a Macintosh or a PC, you can use them for everyday printing. But if not, you can insert a digital camera's memory card. At the press of a button, you get photos printed straight from the card, 100 percent computer-free. 
If your digital camera has enough resolution (use a two-megapixel camera for 4-by-6-inch prints, three or four megapixels for 8-by-10's), and if you print on premium, glossy photo paper (typically $20 for 25 8-by-10-inch sheets), the printouts are generally indistinguishable from film prints developed at drugstores. The colors are bright, saturated and even-toned, free of the pixel patterns that once gave away inkjet prints. 
Cutting the PC out of the loop, however, also means sacrificing its screen. The biggest problem the printer makers had to solve, then, was this: How do you indicate which photos you want to print?
Three options await. The best, and the most expensive, is to pay an extra $100 (or $200, in HP's case) to have your printer equipped with a compact two-inch screen of its own. This little display shows precisely what you'll get when you press Print -- a preview that's especially useful when you start getting fancy with your photo layouts, printing three or four pictures per page, for example.
The second, more economical method is to choose your pictures while they're still in the camera. Most modern digicams offer a feature called DPOF (digital print order format), a system of flagging pictures on the camera's screen. Then, when you transfer the memory card to the printer, you'll get just the shots you requested.
Finally, each printer can print out an index page filled with numbered, stamp-size miniatures of the photos on the memory card. After examining this gallery, you can use the printer's front panel to tap in the desired picture numbers.
If it's simplicity you crave, consider HP's PhotoSmart 1315 ($400), which offers a long list of exclusive, thoughtful touches. For starters, you don't have to specify what kind of paper you've inserted (plain, glossy or whatever), because a sensor determines the answer automatically. You won't have to fiddle with a card adapter to accommodate your camera's memory card, either, as you must on rival printers. The PhotoSmart has two card slots. Between them, almost any kind of card is covered: CompactFlash, Smart Media, I.B.M. Microdrive, Memory Stick and so on. 
Then there's the PhotoSmart 1315's built-in screen, which makes it simple to choose the pictures you want to print. (Its sibling the 1115 lacks the screen but costs $200 less.) If you're willing to push a couple of buttons, you can also use the screen to rotate, enlarge or crop your photos before you print -- another feature missing from the Canon and Epson models. And in times of trouble, the screen displays prose that could win the Pulitzer Prize for high-tech clarity: "Memory card in backwards. The front label should face you." (This printer should teach a master class in error-message writing to the programmers of Microsoft Windows.)
In fact, the PhotoSmart is so superbly designed and filled with pleasant surprises that it seems almost ungrateful to bring up its sole weakness: printing photos. 
The problem is HP's cartridge, which has only four colors of ink. This limited palette simply can't compete with the range and subtlety offered by the six-color cartridges from Canon and Epson. Worse, looking closely at the PhotoSmart's prints reveals, in spots, the tiny telltale patterns of an inkjet nozzle. The pictures are still very good, but don't expect them to pass the Neighbor Test, in which droppers-by mistake them for photo-lab prints.
Canon's S820D, available next month, and Epson's Stylus Photo 785EPX are more similar than they are different. Their six-color cartridges produce amazing-looking photos that if printed on premium paper and mounted under glass, the companies say, will remain colorfast for 25 years. (The inks don't run when wet, either -- good news for shutterbugs on the high seas.) 
Each company offers its own color-boosting technology that at your option makes colors brighter and slightly more saturated than they were in nature. (According to printer-company research, Americans tend to prefer this look in their photos.) And both machines can print all the way to the edge of the paper, making borderless photos that look exactly like photo-lab prints -- a feat that must leave HP's printer red, green and blue with envy.
These printers have only a single card slot each, which requires an appropriately shaped adapter for most camera cards. A CompactFlash adapter comes in the box. (If your camera uses some other format, Epson lets you trade in the included adapter for the one you need. With the Canon, buying a different adapter is left to you.)
But there's one big difference between these otherwise similar printers. At $400 (without screen), the Canon costs twice as much as the Epson. 
Canon explains the differential by pointing out some of the S820D's exclusive features. First, you can replace the printer's ink cartridges independently. On the Epson and HP machines, you have to throw out the entire color cartridge whenever one color runs out -- a distressing experience for anyone not in Oprah Winfrey's tax bracket. (Cartridges are expensive. Canon's color cartridges are $12 each and last for about 500 pages. Epson's is $18, good for 220 pages. HP's is $35, good for 450 pages. Note that these statistics are based on 15 percent coverage of each page. For photo printing, that percentage is a bit optimistic unless you do most of your shooting on an all-white glacier.) 
Canon also points out that you can connect its printer directly to a Canon PowerShot S30 or S40 camera, eliminating that transferring-the-memory-card ritual. The Canon is quieter and faster than the Epson, too, though even its speeds are nothing to write home about: 4.5 minutes per borderless 4-by-6-inch print versus 7.5 minutes on the Epson. (These are direct-from-card times. Printing from a computer is much faster.) 
Above all, Canon claims superior print quality, including finer resolution when printing from a memory card (1,200 dots per inch, like the HP, compared with Epson's 720). And sure enough, in my expanded, somewhat institutionalized version of the Neighbor Test, a panel of guest eyeballs rated most Canon prints marginally superior to Epson prints. 
But few said they saw $200 worth of difference. The Canon is the best direct-connect inkjet printer money can buy; it's just too bad you need so much money to buy it. At $200 (plus $100 for the screen, if you like), the Epson is a spectacular value. 
Both printers bring digital photography a quantum leap closer to Fotomat simplicity. With a digital camera and one of these printers, you may still occasionally want to visit the mall -- but it won't be to drop off film. It will be to spend the $1,000 you saved by not buying a computer. 

GRAPHIC: Photos: HP PHOTOSMART 1315 -- Versatile card slots and a built-in screen for cropping.; CANON S820D -- Sharp print quality; connectable to two Canon cameras.; EPSON STYLUS PHOTO 785EPX -- Similar to the Canon, but $200 cheaper. (pg. G9) Drawing (Stuart Goldenberg)

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "The Possibilities of Lincoln Center" (editorial, Jan. 13): 
 The performing companies of Lincoln Center are far from "reeling" from the effects of Sept. 11 and the recession. 
Yes, subscriptions are down, box office is off and the fund-raising climate is tough. We're all struggling to achieve balanced budgets, but no one doubts that we will go on. 
Your reference to "protracted wrangling" of the resident companies as we consider the visionary changes for the public spaces does not describe our experience. We have engaged in passionate discussions about how best to accomplish the goals of making our buildings and the 16 acres on which they sit more inviting, inclusionary and functional. The process has brought us into a close and exhilarating collaboration unknown in the first 40 years of Lincoln Center.
Lincoln Center will renew and rebuild itself.

HEADLINE: Prices You Just Can't Believe 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

 BODY:
JVC'S Web site is extensive and easy to navigate. Descriptions of the company's merchandise are more than adequate; pictures are large and clear; each product is clearly linked to similar JVC devices for comparison.
 Only one thing is baffling: the manufacturer's suggested retail price often bears no relationship to what you would be charged by a retailer. 
 Take, for instance, the GR-DVL815U, a mini-digital video camcorder that doubles as a digital still camera. It has a color viewfinder, a special gadget that brightens the picture in low light, a U.S.B. terminal and a serial port. JVC suggests a retail price of $1,099.95. But this week Circuit City was selling it for $799.99. So, give or take a few cents, were BestBuy and CDW.com. At Amazon.com, it was $699.99. 
"And I assume you could get similar prices most anywhere else, too," said a JVC spokesman who said he wished to remain unidentified for fear of angering his bosses, his competitors and the big retailers. "The only thing I can say is that the list price, or M.S.R.P., or whatever you want to call it, is the highest-value price we give. It's a guideline for retailers, but we can't tell them what to charge. Pricing is about strategy, and we assume everyone has one." 
Compared with that of other consumer items, from clothing to cars to furniture to toothbrushes, the gap between the prices routinely quoted by manufacturer and retailer is large in consumer electronics. Manufacturers are reluctant to discuss why this is so, but analysts say the gap is likely to continue for a number of reasons. 
"The simplest thing to say is that we have trained the consumer electronics buyer to think he is getting 20 or 30 or 40 percent off," said Robert Atkins, a vice president at Mercer Management Consulting in Lexington, Mass. "What does that mean, anyway? Forty percent off what? Some unrealistic price? But once you get something like this going, it stays around." 
But if no one is going to pay the $1,100 that JVC says the GR-DVL815U is worth, why bother putting that price on a Web site? "I do find it amusing," said David Heim, managing editor of Consumer Reports. "It seems to take unmitigated gall for a company to put out a suggested retail price when there are these places like mySimon or CNET" -- comparison Web sites -- "where you can find what everyone is selling it for. But I think it comes back to our tradition that there has to be some benchmark. You can't have a discount until there is a price to discount it from." 
David J. Reibstein, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said that it would be a bit too harsh to describe manufacturers' list prices as a ruse.
"There is no question the intent of mentioning the M.S.R.P. from which a discount is offered is indeed to give the consumer the sense that they are getting a bargain," he said. "The retailers do want the manufacturers to specify a suggested price for them to discount from. If they are willing to take a lower margin than what the manufacturer is pushing, they at least would like the consumer to know it."
"Without the articulation of the M.S.R.P.," he said, "the consumer would not know there is any 'discounting' going on." 
Perhaps that accounts for the pricing of RCA's P61310, a 61-inch two-tuner picture-in-picture television set. The manufacturer suggests a price of $3,999, but RCA.com itself is selling the model for $3,499.
Sally Smith Clemens, product manager for the electronics manufacturer Olympus America, acknowledges that the official price is a moving target.
"Really, it is just a reference, a debarkation point, if you will, sort of the maximum value a consumer or retailer could place on an item," she said. "Sure, it is a psychological thing, too, so that people can see they are getting something of value for less than its top price. The consumer will feel much better about that. Still, we feel as manufacturers that it is important to establish some benchmark, if only to start talking about price." 
(An Olympus representative recently told Circuits that the "correct price" for one of its cameras was $899, although the list price was $100 higher. Because many products described in Circuits are just reaching stores and a prevailing retail price has not been established, list prices are generally cited as a benchmark.) 
Although every retailer from Bloomingdale's to Filene's Basement to the local luxury car dealership advertises sales, Robert Schindler, an associate professor of marketing at Rutgers University, said that consumer electronics items have a different kind of shelf space.
"Because consumer electronics are easily comparable products, it is simpler for a buyer to price-shop," Professor Schindler said. "Model 72C for a large-screen brand-name TV is the same whatever store you go to and pretty comparable to some other brand-name TV of similar size. In clothing, well, the fit may be different and you might like red or stripes or whatever." 
Electronics retailers say they decline to reveal their pricing strategies to avoid alerting competitors but that the list price is hardly something to which they pay attention. 
"When it comes to pricing, we have our own way of doing things," said Jim Babb, a marketing spokesman for Circuit City. "Manufacturers can put whatever price they want down, but we do what we think is best for our business." 
Lately, though, the discrepancy between list price and the prevailing retail price, or street price, seems even greater than usual. David Huether, the chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said that inventories of consumer electronics were unusually high over the last year and that both manufacturers and retailers had been successfully whittling them down through price breaks. In addition, he said, the strong dollar has made imported parts cheaper, giving the manufacturers wiggle room in wholesale prices, with the savings then passed on to consumers. 
And new products, or at least moderately different models, are coming out all the time. Mr. Huether said the product cycle for consumer electronics had accelerated in recent years. This winter's six-CD changer becomes the spring's seven-CD changer, so the old one is rapidly put on sale, though its list price remains the same. 
In any case, Professor Schindler said, to the extent that anyone refers to the list price, everyone winds up happy. 
"No one on the selling side is sad about this, I don't think," he said. "The manufacturer gets sales. The retailer gets the buyer to think he is getting a bargain. And the buyer gets the item he wants at a price he thinks is good." 
In the end, indeed, it all seems to come down to expectations. "Surveys have shown that when people are asked about the last expensive item they bought -- furniture or a big TV or whatever -- whether they bought it on sale, 75 percent say yes," Professor Schindler said. "But think about that. If 75 percent is bought on sale, then what is the real price and what is the sale price anyway?"

HEADLINE: TURF; 
Buyers Are at The Door Again

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
THE winter apartment-hunting season in Manhattan, which began around Thanksgiving -- normally the deadest of times for co-op and condo sales -- is bursting with activity.
 Brokers say this traditionally moribund period has come alive with wheeling and dealing. Open houses, which allow apartment shoppers to browse without tying themselves down to one company or agent, have become a weekend pastime. Hundreds of New Yorkers, starved for a real estate fix after the bleak weeks in September and October, are swarming through studios and multiroom maisonettes alike. 
 And a significant number are buying. Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a large Manhattan appraisal company, said that 174 clients signed contracts for cooperative apartments or condominiums between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15, an increase of 7.4 percent over the same period a year ago. Diane N. Ramirez, president of Halstead Property, said her company had 21 offers accepted by sellers the first two weeks in November, and 37 the first two weeks of this month. 
"There is definitely a pickup in the number of sales in the last two months," Mr. Miller said. "But the most noticeable thing is how busy the agents are. People are buying, but it takes many more showings. A year ago, it might take 35 or 40 showings before someone would purchase. Now it's 75 or 80." 
Prices, on average, are down about 10 percent from the heights they reached in March 2000, but deals are being made at a pace that agents call surprising: they were braced for a real estate recession, with plummeting prices and nobody showing up, even to look.
A smattering of serious buyers who were scared away after Sept. 11 -- some of whom dropped out of deals that they and the sellers had agreed upon -- have resumed bidding. One woman backed out of a deal for a $1.1 million co-op on East 75th Street, but when she tried to get back in, for $970,000 this time, she was too late. Another bidder got there first, paying the lower figure.
Her experience characterizes the current market, said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates. He said that, for New Yorkers, not shopping for co-ops has become unbearable. "People's gratification can only be delayed so long," he said.
Mr. Peters and other agents find a combination of reasons for the return of the real estate shopper: a willingness by sellers to set more realistic prices, the fall in interest rates and the belief that, barring another catastrophe, "the sky hasn't fallen in," said Barbara S. Fox, president of the Fox Residential Group.
Brokers had predicted that after the attacks, apartment owners would panic and rush to put their places on the market, creating a glut and causing prices to plummet. While almost 2,000 new listings did appear, brokers say that the market has not been flooded. Ms. Fox said steady buying is absorbing the post-Sept. 11 surplus. "The buyers now are certainly more wary, and afraid of overspending, but people are really stepping up to the plate to buy," she said.
Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, said many of her buyers had liquidated their stock portfolios and put the money into real estate. She said that since Sept. 11, an increasing number of customers had used cash, rather than mortgages, to cover 60 percent or more of the prices for co-ops and condos. (Co-ops in Manhattan require 25 percent cash, on average.)
"The floodgates have opened," she said. She also said that in the last six or seven weeks, she had seen more buyers from overseas. "We had a big billion-dollar international media campaign talking about how warm and cozy New York is, and what heroes we've got -- and it worked."
Although current activity won't be reflected in citywide statistics until quarterly reports are compiled by the real estate industry at the end of March, brokers say that more people are out there kicking baseboards and slamming doors. Mr. Peters said he had 27 accepted offers between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as against about 15 in the same period a year earlier. Not every company has had an increase, but brokers say the market has gathered momentum in the last month.
Lawrence Sicular, chief real estate analyst for Brown Harris Stevens, said prices remain surprisingly stable and may even be slightly higher than at summer's end, except at the highest levels. In the multimillion-dollar market, he said prices were "softening." (As has been reported, Manhattan rents are also softening: they have dropped by 10 to 30 percent since the attacks, agents say, partly because more people are turning away from renting and are buying instead.)
Agents are not so sanguine about sales downtown, the area that suffered most after the attacks. Deborah B. Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade group, said that although the market appears healthy, she is awaiting statistics on that area. "We won't see those for another two months," she said.
But elsewhere in Manhattan, agents who were urging both buyers and sellers not to panic a month ago are now warning sellers against irrational exuberance.
"It would be irresponsible to paint a totally happy picture, as if 9/11 had never happened," said Paul Purcell, president of Insignia Douglas Elliman, the largest real estate company in the city. "Could real estate really be the only business that is going up? I don't think so." The number of accepted offers at his company is still down 10 to 15 percent from a year ago, he said.
Nevertheless, he is encouraged by the number of people out shopping. A year ago, in the midst of a hot market, a good turnout at an open house would have been 8 to 25, depending on the property.
Toni D. Haber, an agent at Douglas Elliman, reported that the weekend before last, 65 people showed up at 250 West 89th Street for an open house at a two-bedroom, two-bathroom "condop" (which has shares, like a co-op, but less restrictive rules, like a condominium). Two bidders are now competing for the apartment, which was listed at $680,000, Ms. Haber said. Another open house that weekend drew 100 sightseers, though no offers have been made yet.
Last weekend, a studio at 67 East 11th Street, listed at $214,000, had 43 visitors and two offers. (That number of visitors is rare for a studio, especially at such a high price.) 
An advertisement for an open house at a one-bedroom co-op at 311 West 82nd Street drew two offers, Mr. Purcell said, even though it gave an incorrect telephone number for the broker and misstated the price. (It did get the address right.)
"It feels like we have a horse race again," he said.
Ms. Ramirez, of Halstead, agreed. "The open houses are a phenomenon," she said. "My brokers are telling me 50 people came to this one, 60 to that."
The bounce-back in Manhattan's sales market is turning brokers into psychiatrists, Ms. Ramirez said. "We're all trying to figure out why it's happening." She said she thinks people are pouring into open houses because they are "still not ready to commit to a broker." For some, open houses provide a certain distance: they can look and shop without being interrogated by a broker about their income or intentions. Working with a broker is like going steady, while cruising open houses is more like dating around.
"Now they've got a taste of freedom after being squeezed by the ridiculously high prices" of 1999 and 2000, Ms. Ramirez said. "They do want to buy, but they don't want to feel they're being put in a corner."
When the price is right, buyers are not averse to engaging in bidding wars. "The sellers were pushing for the escalation of prices," Ms. Ramirez said. "They just didn't get that the market was leveling off, even before Sept. 11. But they're starting to get it, and they're either reducing their prices or putting their places on the market for reasonable amounts.
"We thought during December, things would be dead in the water, but our brokers were out there pounding the pavement Christmas week."

HEADLINE: Argentine Peso Sinks to New Lows as CrisisContinues 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
The Argentine peso plunged to new lows today as the Argentine central bank tried for a second time to stabilize its value by selling dollars. 
 In four days of official trading since the official peg of the peso at parity to the dollar was broken, the Argentine currency has lost nearly half its value. It closed today at 1.85 to the dollar, with some trades at 2.2 to the dollar reported before the central bank's intervention. 
 Demonstrations and rioting continued across the country over the economic crisis and over continuing restrictions on Argentines' access to their bank accounts. But the embattled new government of Eduardo Duhalde won a bit of breathing space today when the International Monetary Fund announced in Washington that it would postpone for a year a debt of $993 million that Argentina was due to pay it on Thursday. 
Still, economists say the peso will go on sliding until the government puts in place credible fiscal and monetary policies that can begin to rebuild confidence in the country's sputtering economy.
"They probably have a couple of weeks to create these policies," said Daniel Artana, chief economist at the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research. "The economic indicators are very bad, and companies are being squeezed. We are already starting to see complications."
New currency and banking regulations are being announced and revised every day. Confusion and mistrust are rampant, and each new rumor sends people running to exchange houses.
The central bank did not say how many dollars it injected into the market today. On Tuesday it sold $8.8 million of its dwindling foreign reserves to currency exchange houses when the peso slipped below the psychologically important level of 2 to 1. One-quarter of the nation's foreign-currency reserves have leaked away in the last three months as bank depositors, fearful of devaluation, put their savings under the mattress or sent them abroad; about $14.8 billion is reportedly left.
Restrictions imposed last month to head off a run on the nation's banks were tightened last week when the government ordered all checking accounts with balances of more than $10,000 and all savings accounts of more than $3,000 converted into certificates of deposit that cannot be redeemed until various dates next year. More than one-third of Argentines' $67 billion in savings were frozen. The government had already put limits on cash withdrawals from all accounts, and on various kinds of transfers, and the banks and exchange houses were closed for days.
The freezing of the banking system also means that securities trades cannot be cleared, so the stock market remains closed.
The restrictions have dragged the already stumbling economy to a halt, complicating the government's attempts to balance its budget. The government said today that it would send a finished budget to Congress next week. Mr. Duhalde promised to ease the banking freeze this week, but he has several times put off an announcement for further study.
Economists inside and outside the government say the rules have put the government in a bind. Depositors, they say, are sure to react to any easing by withdrawing as much money as they can and racing to turn it into dollars, causing the peso to plummet. Or they might spend it, perhaps igniting hyperinflation.
But the government fears that keeping the restrictions in place -- or converting all deposits to pesos, as the banks favor -- would inflame social unrest beyond what the authorities can contain.
Only with international backing, analysts said, can sweeping changes be made that will rebuild public confidence in the financial system and in basic property rights.
"The only thing that can create a big change in expectations sufficient for people to start going on with their normal lives, consuming and investing and so on," said Miguel Braun, director of fiscal policy at a local public policy research group, Cippec, "is if they see that from now on Argentina is going to be a different place from what it has been in the past few months."
The president of the central bank in neighboring Brazil, Arminio Fraga, who successfully restored confidence after that country's currency devaluation in 1999, has been in Buenos Aires for the last two days sharing his experiences with Argentina's central bankers.

HEADLINE: The Twain You'll Meet 

BYLINE:  By Roy Blount Jr.; Roy Blount Jr.'s most recent book is "Am I Pig Enough for You Yet?"

DATELINE: MILL RIVER, Mass. 

 BODY:
In Mark Twain's first best seller, "Innocents Abroad," a rhapsodic Italian guide exposes him and his traveling companions to a bust of "Christopher Columbo." The Americans drive the guide to distraction by refusing to be impressed -- by professing, in fact, never to have heard of the gentleman. "Which is the bust and which is the pedestal?" they ask (a distinction that needs clarifying with regard to so many works of art), and "Is -- is he dead?"
 Mark Twain himself has been dead now, in the narrowest sense, for 97 years. He is, if anything, more solidly empedestaled than Columbus. Somehow, though, he is alive and kicking. Having become, this week, a Ken Burns television series, Mark Twain stands preserved beside the Civil War, baseball and jazz. Among these institutions, he was least in need of mixed-media restoration. He is still fresh. 
 "I think we never become really and genuinely our entire and honest selves," he said, "until we are dead -- and then not until we have been dead years and years. People ought to start dead and then they would be honest so much earlier."
Ralph Waldo Emerson seemed determined to produce an aphorism in every sentence, and today his sentences are beaded with sweat. Twain's float. Like the best-turned bits of Scripture, his observations (including many that he never in fact made) are quotable by most everyone to most any purpose.
He also survives visually, as a distinct white-suited image on the sentimental cultural retina. A great self-marketer he was, and still is. His characters and some of his novels are irresistibly, if seldom satisfactorily, adaptable to the screen. His life and his place in history -- he discovered a great deal more of America than Columbus did -- continue to energize scholars and popular biographers.
But you could strip him down to his words on the page, and he would still be "full of animation," like the aforementioned Italian guide, who "fidgeted about as if he had swallowed a spring mattress." In part this is because Mark Twain was so meticulous in his choice of words. Long before Ezra Pound described poetic language as "the precision that creates movement," Mark Twain wrote that the "intensely right word" has an effect that is "physical as well as spiritual, and electrically prompt."
Prompt -- electrically prompt: The phrase itself is the effect it describes. "My usual style of ciphering out the merits of poetry," Mark Twain wrote, ". . . is to read a line or two near the top, a verse near the bottom and then strike an average."
But how many passages of even good poetry can match the pith and savor of Mark Twain's best flights of prose? "Probably there is nothing in the world so suggestive of serene contentment and perfect bliss as the spectacle of a calf chewing a dishrag, but the nearest approach to it is your reedy tenor, standing apart, in sickly attitude, with head thrown back and eyes uplifted to the moon, piping his distressing solo." Nothing, yet everything, reedy and distressing in that.
In his day Mark Twain made Sigmund Freud, Ulysses S. Grant and Rudyard Kipling laugh, and presumably, because he was friendly with them, Frederick Douglass, Helen Keller and the president of Standard Oil. His jokes still make both highly and lowly literate people chuckle and whoop. And ponder. And protest. His micro-jokes are impeccable, his macro-jokes enduringly strange, conducive to consternation, open to argument. The prime example is "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," which will not settle down. It continues to be denounced as racist and sanctified as antiracist.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin," by Mark Twain's postbellum neighbor in Hartford, Harriet Beecher Stowe (who in her dotage would slip up behind him and let out a "war whoop"), provided an incisive analysis of the economics and horrors of slavery at a time when that peculiar institution was still legal. Stowe, the New England abolitionist, had the thing all figured out unimpeachably in then-radical terms, and there her now-archaic contribution sits.
Twain grew up in slave society and never got its taint, or the influence of African-American culture, out of his system. The rich, bitter joke of bondage in the land of the free, of palpable asymmetrical affection and heartlessness, persists in "Huckleberry Finn" to be read differently by each reader in every generation so far.
Who, in Mark Twain's works, is the innocent and who the culprit, who the trickster and who the tricked, who the enslaved and who (if anyone) the master? The culture-resistant Americans abroad, or the Europeans they subject to put-ons; the Connecticut Yankee, or King Arthur's Court? Conscience is a villain, young Satan is a hero, the Almighty is irresponsible, the funniest storytellers are the least humorous people, labor-saving devices are albatrosses, wealth is a boon that leaves its recipients spent.
Mark Twain's involvement in the national and international life of his time was both ebullient and ambivalent. He was often outspokenly in love with the prospect of easeful death. He seethed and erupted in work that danced and work that plodded, in celebration of what delighted him and to stave off bankruptcy and muddled personal despair. His corpus remains volatile, vulnerable, provocatively unstable -- jokes within jokes, which the author himself is not securely in on. The jokes are not entirely gettable, but readers keep trying to get at the heart of them. That heart is a pump that keeps juice going and coming around.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 18, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed article yesterday incorrectly said Mark Twain has been dead for 97 years. He died in 1910.

HEADLINE: At Stuyvesant, Kudos for Scientific Creativity in the Shadow of Ruin 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
For a week after Nikita Rozenblyum witnessed the jet hurtling into the World Trade Center, he could not concentrate on his schoolwork, let alone the math research project he intended to submit for the Intel Science Talent Search.
 His classmate Philip Ernst, by contrast, deflected the world that had gone surreal with a dose of teenage bravado. He focused more single-mindedly on the computer science research paper he was submitting. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Rozenblyum and Mr. Ernst, both 17-year-old seniors at Stuyvesant High School, and 13 fellow Stuyvesant students found out that they were among 300 semifinalists in the annual Intel contest. 
Stuyvesant always does well in the competition, often leading the nation in the number of semifinalists and in the number of winners (40 will be chosen, and their names will be announced in two weeks).
But this round of competition is like no other. When the twin towers crumbled five blocks from Stuyvesant High, students were starting another intense semester, and the school's Intel competitors were entering the final months of a fierce race. When their school first closed for 10 school days and then reopened in classrooms borrowed from Brooklyn Technical High School, many students doubted that they could produce papers of quality on their research projects, some of which had begun a year earlier.
"It was a difficult time for my research because I couldn't get my surveys out," said Jukay Hsu, 17, another semifinalist, whose project on behavioral economics was based on his student surveys. 
The success of the Stuyvesant competitors this year is a testament not only to their grit but also to that of their adult mentors. 
For instance, Daniel Choy Boyar, 17, lived with his New York University mentor, a neuroscientist, for days when he was unable to return to his downtown apartment. Michael Zamansky, a science teacher at Stuyvesant, returned to the high school only days after the Sept. 11 attack to turn on the computer server so that the students could continue writing. Several mentors kept alive the students' cultures and biological specimens when they could not get to their labs.
The Intel competition has been the nation's most prestigious science research contest for high school students since its birth under the Westinghouse name in 1941. Five winners have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. 
More than 1,500 students entered the 2001 competition. Two other perennial high performers in the city, Bronx Science and Midwood High School in Brooklyn, had six semifinalists apiece, while in the competitive suburbs, Byram Hills High School in Armonk, N.Y., and Ward Melville High School in East Setauket, on Long Island, each claimed eight. Nationally, the school with the most semifinalists was Montgomery Blair High School in Maryland, with 17, followed by Stuyvesant, with 15. 
At Stuyvesant yesterday, students stressed that their mentors and teachers had helped them through. Daniel Turnbull, a professor of radiology and pathology at N.Y.U., welcomed Mr. Ernst to his lab every day that Stuyvesant was shut. 
Most of the Stuyvesant semifinalists are immigrants or children of immigrants. "Often, it is the immigrant children who have the drive and determination to complete the projects," said Anne de Sostoa Manwell, the coordinator of the independent research program at Stuyvesant.
Mr. Rozenblyum, who immigrated with his parents, a mathematician and a physician, from Belarus in 1992, could not stop beaming. "My parents came here so me and my brother could have a better future," he said, "and they are very proud today."

PERSON: Michael A. Bilandic 

HEADLINE: Michael Bilandic, Daley Successor in Chicago, Dies at 78 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Michael A. Bilandic, who became mayor of Chicago after the death of Richard J. Daley, his mentor, only to see the Daley political machine sputter to a stop under his leadership, died on Tuesday in Chicago. He was 78.
 The cause was a heart rupture, said Dr. Dan Fintel of Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Mr. Bilandic was admitted after a heart attack on Friday and was scheduled for triple bypass surgery yesterday, but he died after the rupture. 
 When Mayor Daley died in his sixth term in 1976, his machine selected Mr. Bilandic as a temporary successor, and the new mayor immediately promised not to run in the election six months later to fill the remaining two years of Mr. Daley's term.
His deference reflected the careful personality of the corporate lawyer he had been for 28 years. Mike Royko, a columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, labeled him Mayor Bland.
But Mayor Bilandic quickly found himself in the rough and tumble of Chicago politics. Within months of taking office, he negotiated labor agreements involving gravediggers, butchers and members of the Chicago Lyric Opera orchestra. He brought together warring factions to end a 15-year impasse on building a crosstown expressway, releasing $1.5 billion in federal money.
His romance with Heather Morgan, the director of the Chicago Council on Fine Arts, added a dash of warmth to his image. They married shortly after he was elected mayor. He is survived by his wife and their son, Michael. 
He changed his mind about not running, explaining that he was responding to a groundswell of support. He emphasized his closeness to Mr. Daley, saying the mayor had given him the kind of education "you cannot get at Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard or Stanford." He went so far as to imitate Mr. Daley's speech patterns, with a distinctive grammar and syntax and a seeming preference for commas over periods in his orations. 
The result was victory in the Democratic primary in a city where that was tantamount to victory in the general election. Several months later, he delightedly quoted the remark of a child at an elementary school in the Bridgeport neighborhood, where Mr. Bilandic, like the four mayors before him, lived.
Someone had asked the child if he knew who the visiting Mayor Bilandic was.
"Yes, that's the new Mayor Daley," the boy chirped.
But Mr. Bilandic demonstrated that he lacked the iron control of Mr. Daley. First, Jane M. Byrne, his commissioner of consumer sales, accused him of being in cahoots with the city's taxi companies to raise their fares. Though he fired her, their highly visible fight -- both passed lie detector tests -- differed markedly from the discipline of the Daley City Hall.
Second, it snowed, more than seven feet, the most ever recorded in a season Chicago. The city's snow removal was so terrible that people guessed Mayor Daley must have taken the snowplows with him; a former deputy mayor was found to have received a $90,000 consultant's contract for snow removal.
A joke circulated. First man to second: "If Mayor Daley was alive, all this wouldn't have happened."
Second to first: "If Mayor Bilandic was alive, it wouldn't have, either."
The result was that in March 1979, Ms. Byrne, at first viewed as a quixotic candidate for mayor, beat Mr. Bilandic, ending 48 years of machine domination of city politics.
Michael Anthony Bilandic, the son of Croatian immigrants, was born on Feb. 13, 1923, in Bridgeport, on Chicago's southwest side. It is called Back of the Yards because of its proximity to the stockyards that were once the economic backbone of the area.
Like Mayor Daley, he attended De La Salle High School, graduated from De Paul University Law School and got into politics by hanging around the 11th Ward Democratic Headquarters.
He served for four years in the Marine Corps in the South Pacific and then earned his undergraduate degree from Notre Dame University. He began as a $25-a-week law clerk at the Chicago firm of Anixter, Delaney, Bilandic & Piggott, and worked his way to senior partner.
He resumed his political activity, canvassing the 11th Ward for Mr. Daley, a neighbor, during his first race for mayor in 1955. For the next decade he was an active, if inconspicuous, figure in ward politics.
At Mayor Daley's invitation, he ran for City Council in 1969, and the next year was named to its powerful finance committee. In 1974, after the indictment of the committee's chairman on fraud charges, he was named chairman.
In 1972, Mr. Bilandic stood in for Mayor Daley at the Democratic National Convention in denouncing the seating of anti-Daley delegates led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
After his defeat, Mr. Bilandic returned to private practice, then started a new career as judge. He was elected to the First District Appellate Court in 1984 and, six years later, to the Illinois Supreme Court, the highest in the state. He was chief justice for the last three years of his 10-year term.
Last September, he was chosen to break the tie on a committee redrawing Congressional and state legislative districts. His name was drawn from a replica of a stovepipe hat owned by Abraham Lincoln. The state Constitution calls for such a random selection when the eight-member body, split evenly between parties, cannot agree.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Love and a Special Stroller Are All This Girl Needs

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Desiree Torres reclined in her wheelchair, on top of one rag doll and next to another, all of them under a pink blanket with bunnies on it. A cast covered Desiree's right leg, a result of an operation in November to correct the structure of her hip.
 Desiree, 11, has severe cerebral palsy, and, said her social worker, Katie Fredericks, was placed in the foster care system shortly after birth by her mother, who could not manage her severe medical needs. She has been cared for by her adoptive mother, Nelly Torres, since she was 3 months old. 
 "I love the baby," Ms. Torres said, cupping her hand on Desiree's face and making her smile. "She needs a place to live."
Desiree lives with Ms. Torres, who is unemployed, in the Bronx River Houses public housing project. But since November, she has been staying at St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Bayside, Queens, recovering from her hip surgery.
"She was born premature and has had multiple operations," said Desiree's nurse, Lois Weston. "Now she's in a cast. All of that has been very difficult for her."
Ms. Torres, 58, has plenty of love for Desiree, but not much money. She depends on her 37-year-old daughter, Carmen Argueta, who lives in Manhattan, to pay her rent and bills.
Ms. Torres used to receive welfare, but earlier this year she withdrew from it when she was asked to work in a welfare employment program.
"They were sending me to work," Ms. Torres said. "I couldn't go to work because I had to stay home to be with Desiree."
As a result of her limited income, Ms. Torres, who also cares for an active 9-year-old foster daughter named Luisa, could not afford a stroller that she needed to transport Desiree, who cannot walk on her own because of cerebral palsy.
Last summer, Ms. Torres saw that a friend traveled easily by putting the disabled child she cared for in a stroller. Ms. Torres told Ms. Fredericks, who helps her take care of Desiree, that she wanted a similar one to replace the unwieldy wheelchair she had been using.
Ms. Fredericks, who works for New Alternatives for Children, a nonprofit agency that helps parents care for chronically ill and disabled children, helped Ms. Torres pick out the stroller from a catalog.
She paid for it with $2,200 from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund after receiving a 10 percent discount from the manufacturer. New Alternatives is a member of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven local charities supported by the Neediest Cases Fund.
The stroller, a pink Convaid Cruiser, has various attachments, like foot rests and straps to keep the head and torso upright. "It improves her quality of life because it enables Nelly to take her outside," Ms. Fredericks said.
"They can go more places easier, they can do more things together as a family. In the past it was harder, because the wheelchair was much harder to manipulate and the other child would be running off to play."
Desiree is 4 feet 3 inches tall and weighs about 45 pounds. Her mother said she had responded well to the special stroller, and was looking forward to the day she can go home and begin using it again. 
Ms. Fredericks said that the design of the stroller is flexible enough so that Desiree, who is not expected to grow much more, could use it into adulthood.
That is exactly how long Ms. Torres plans on caring for Desiree. The only limit on the length of their relationship, she said, would be the length of her own life. "I'm still in good shape myself," Ms. Torres said with a smile. "I'm going to keep my daughter for good."
Though Desiree cannot speak, she understands English and Spanish, her mother said. Ms. Torres said she had always known what Desiree needed.
Desiree rarely cries, Ms. Torres said, and only does so when the two must part company. As Ms. Torres said this, in a common room at St. Mary's Hospital on Tuesday, Desiree began to shed two small tears, one out of each eye, as if she thought that Ms. Torres was leaving at that very moment.
A few minutes later, at noon, it was time for Desiree to go to lunch. She began to cry, not with short sniffles but with long, slow wails and quick gasps for air. Eating could come later. For now, Desiree just wanted to spend more time with her mother, who stroked her cheeks, trying with limited success to comfort her.
"You can tell when a child has been in a loving home environment just by how they interact," Ms. Weston, the nurse, said shortly after. "You can tell she's been well cared for and loved by her family."

Contributions Set a Record
The total contributed to the Neediest Cases Fund as of Tuesday was $8,197,366.01, a record, which exceeds the total in the 2000-2001 campaign, $8,033,582.22, also a record.

HEADLINE: Welfare Rolls Grew in City Late Last Year 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
For the first time in six years, New York City's welfare rolls began to rise by several thousand people in the late fall, adding to growing concerns among government officials nationwide that the country's revamped welfare system may be caught short in the recession. 
 A new study, to be issued today by the Independent Budget Office, shows that the number of people receiving welfare was up by a total of 5,000, or about 1 percent, in October and November, to 469,000 -- the first time since 1995 that the rolls increased two months in a row. 
 Moreover, thousands of families who were cut from the rolls in December, as they neared their five-year federal time limits, could be back within months on state-financed Safety Net Assistance, the analysis cautioned. The study also projects that unemployment could drive the number of public assistance recipients up 14 percent by next fall. 
With tax revenue declining because of the faltering economy and unemployment rates rising, Gov. George E. Pataki has joined governors from around the country in seeking increased federal aid for welfare assistance. The governors are planning to ask Congress to provide emergency financing, in addition to the block grants now awarded, to states with high unemployment. 
Nationally, the situation is shaping up as a test of the welfare program that Congress created in 1996, when it ended the decades-old federal guarantee of coverage for the poor and no longer tied the amount of money spent on welfare to the number of people on the rolls. The governors are timing their request as Congress considers reauthorization of that law, which comes up this year. 
The governors are likely to meet resistance in Washington, where lawmakers are warning that the arrival of budget deficits will make it nearly impossible for them to meet the broad array of needs nationally, from health care to domestic security.
The National Governors' Association points to some troubling signs already: Thirty-three states reported caseload increases between March and September, including Connecticut (1.5 percent), Massachusetts (5.7 percent), Arizona (11 percent), Indiana (16 percent) and Nevada (24 percent).
In New York City, where a 60 percent decline in the welfare rolls since 1995 was one of the hallmarks of the Giuliani administration, the caseload increases in October and November were followed by a drop to 462,595 in December.
But the Independent Budget Office notes that thousands of eligible families lost aid temporarily that month during a switch to state-financed aid, and adds that "despite the ostensible drop, the December welfare numbers indicate that the underlying caseload trend continues upward."
Under the nation's 1996 welfare overhaul, the federal government provides each state a fixed sum to run its own welfare program. But the overhaul was passed when the nation was enjoying a prosperity that created an abundance of entry-level jobs.
Now, the governors are worried that states might be shortchanged under the block-grant approach, given that public-assistance rolls are climbing for the first time in years.
"When we took the block grant, we took the economic risk in all this," the executive director of the governors' association, Raymond C. Scheppach, said. "What we're saying now is that we are still willing to do that, except when there is huge economic disruption."
John Madden, a spokesman for the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, echoed that sentiment. "The states took the risk with the block grant premise and we shouldn't be left holding the bag when the national economy slows and people need help," he said.
In New York City alone, today's report projects, the caseload can be expected to rise by 66,000 by September, reaching 530,000 and leaving the current budget for grants short by $40 million. 
The projection assumes that the city, which suffered a net loss of nearly 100,000 jobs in October and November, will lose a total of 130,000 jobs before its economy picks up again in the summer.
For every 10 jobs lost in the city, the analysis calculates, 5 people, including children, will be added to the rolls -- a rate chosen to reflect today's increased hurdles to receiving public assistance. The rate was actually higher in the city's last recession, between 1989 and 1993, when the welfare rolls grew by 8 recipients for every 10 jobs lost.
The welfare overhaul of 1996 did create a contingency fund to hedge against an economic downturn. But state officials and the governors' association contend that the fund is too small and, more important, virtually impossible to tap because of requirements established by the 1996 law.
The governors may also ask Congress to approve an increase in block grant money states receive -- a total of roughly $16 billion -- if only to help them keep pace with inflation.
Some champions of the overhaul are more optimistic about its sticking power under pressure. A study released in July by the conservative Manhattan Institute, for example, predicted that even a downturn that increased unemployment to 1993 levels -- 6.9 percent in the nation and 10.4 percent in the city -- would increase the welfare participation rate of single mothers by no more than 5 percent. 
No one is arguing that the welfare rolls will swell to the levels of six years ago, when there were 12.9 million recipients nationwide, 7.5 million more than there are now, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
But states say they will have difficulty coping with surging caseloads, particularly now that large portions of their welfare grants pay for the kind of welfare-to-work antipoverty programs envisioned by the framers of 1996 welfare overhaul.
Those programs -- intended to help welfare recipients land jobs and keep them -- range from job placement and child care to intensified case management.
A welfare policy analyst for the governors' association, Gretchen Odegard, said the federal government must make emergency funds available if states are going to continue to run the new programs while addressing the needs of the newly unemployed.
"There's pressure to meet an increasing demand for cash assistance," she said. "There needs to be a mechanism in place for states to turn to the federal government in times of economic hardship."
New York's situation illustrates the degree to which states have reordered spending priorities and focused on antipoverty programs instead of simply providing cash aid.
In 1997, about 20 percent of the state's welfare dollars were spent on such programs, with most of the rest going to traditional cash benefits. Today, that situation is almost reversed, according to state social service officials. Nearly 70 percent of the state's welfare dollars is spent on antipoverty programs.
"The challenge today is not just getting people off the welfare rolls," Mr. Madden said. "It's helping them even after they get a job. That's why we need a commitment from the federal government to support us when the economy falters like this and people turn to the states for help."
The states argue that Washington itself is partly to blame for the bind they are facing, pointing out that Congress made it harder for states to accumulate welfare surpluses to use in an economic downturn.
When many states tried to carry over unspent portions of their welfare grants from one year to the next, to set up so-called rainy day funds, lawmakers in Washington responded with a stern use-it-or-lose-it warning, according to Douglas E. Howard, director of Michigan's Family Independence Agency, as well as other state officials.
Mr. Howard urged Congress not to make that mistake again. "Congress should create incentives for states to save funds so that they are better equipped to deal with economic downturns," he said.
The large surpluses of welfare dollars that states were reporting a few years ago -- before Congress cracked down -- have dwindled. The governors' association reported that the states have less than 10 percent of the roughly $80 billion the federal government has provided over the last five years.
Reports from the field are deepening state officials' concerns. The governors' association provided figures showing caseload increases between March and September of last year in, among other states, Mississippi (11 percent), South Carolina (10 percent), Florida (4 percent), Georgia (5 percent), Kansas (6 percent) and Michigan (3 percent).
In New York State, the rolls declined 6.5 percent during that period, before a reversal in October. In the city, which lost thousands of jobs in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the shift has been abrupt. 
"It is not clear whether the city's policies, designed to reduce the welfare caseload and cut city expenditures on public assistance, can succeed during an economic downturn," the Independent Budget Office report said. "But we are about to find out."

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Inflation Falls In Region 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 A steep drop in energy prices helped reduce the regional inflation rate to 1.7 percent last year, from 3.1 percent in 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said yesterday. 
The rate measures inflation in New York City and its northern suburbs, Long Island, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. Gasoline prices have dropped by about a third since peaking in June, the bureau reported. But owner-occupied housing costs rose by 6.6 percent, far more than the 2.4 percent increase in 2000. Rental costs rose only slightly, to 4.1 percent. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

Owners Give Approval To Sale of the Red Sox

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
With the threat of another legal headache behind them, Major League Baseball owners approved the $660 million sale of the Boston Red Sox today to a group led by John Henry. But they passed up the opportunity to execute an unprecedented triple play involving teams in three cities and two countries.
 The owners had also been expected to approve two other transactions, but they put off those actions until later this month. 
 Henry, who has owned the Florida Marlins the past three years, will sell that team for $158 million to Jeffrey Loria, who has been the managing partner of the Montreal Expos the past two years, and Major League Baseball will pay Loria $120 million and operate the Expos, one of the teams Commissioner Bud Selig wants to eliminate in the owners' stalled contraction plan. 
Those transactions did not come up for a vote, David Samson, executive vice president of the Expos, said, because the Marlins, the seller, did not present the deal to the executive council, which met before the owners did at the Arizona Biltmore. "We haven't worked out all of the details," said Lucinda Treat, Henry's lawyer.
Until the Marlins' sale is approved, Henry, a commodities trader and hedge fund manager in Florida, will own pieces of three teams. That status certainly is unprecedented for the major leagues. Besides the Marlins and the Red Sox, Henry owns 1 percent of the Yankees, a share he is in the process of selling to Al Neuharth, founder of USA Today.
The Yankees were the only one of 30 clubs that did not vote in favor of the Red Sox sale. The Yankees abstained, a person who attended the meeting said, because Henry has not sold his 1 percent. One view is that Henry has held up the sale because he wants Neuharth, a close friend of George Steinbrenner's, to pay more for it than he has offered. Another is that Neuharth wants a foundation he is involved in to be the buyer, an idea Steinbrenner opposes.
When Henry was asked at a news conference about owning pieces of three teams, Selig jumped in and said, "I've told these gentlemen -- and it involves San Diego, the New York Yankees, Florida and obviously Boston -- that all these deals are to be completed before the closing date of the Red Sox. They've all said that is not a problem."
Selig said he expected the closing to be in the latter half of next month.
Henry, meanwhile, is not expected to make any trades with himself in the 10 days or two weeks he will be viewed as the owner of the Marlins and the Red Sox. Technically, his group will not take control of the Red Sox until the closing.
The owners' vote on the Red Sox sale came only a couple of hours after the Massachusetts attorney general, Thomas Reilly, reached agreement with John Harrington, the Red Sox chief executive officer, and the Henry group on changes Reilly had requested involving the Jean R. Yawkey Trust.
The owners would very likely have approved the sale without Reilly's blessing, but they have had enough problems with lawsuits and were not looking for another one. In this instance, Reilly wasn't either.
"In the end we had to make a decision," Reilly said by telephone from Boston. "We looked at two years of litigation. Whenever you're in litigation you don't know how it's going to turn out. Two years of litigation would have turned this franchise upside down and may never have resulted in additional benefits to the charities."
In the end, Reilly added, he became convinced that "nothing had changed on the Major League Baseball level" regarding the higher bids from Charles F. Dolan ($750 million), chairman of Cablevision, and a group headed by Miles Prentice ($755 million), a New York lawyer. "There were going to be serious difficulties either for Prentice or Dolan."
But Reilly did not concede easily to the obvious desire of the owners to have the Henry group owning the Red Sox. This afternoon he sent a letter via fax to Selig asking him to delay approval of the sale until his issues were resolved or direct the Red Sox to reopen the bidding process. An hour or less later, Harrington and the Henry group agreed to Reilly's terms.
Under that agreement, the Henry group will establish another charitable foundation with $20 million, the Red Sox limited partners will give $10 million of the $250 million they will get from the new owners to the Yawkey trust, and Harrington agreed to add five people to the four-person board of the trust, whose $36 million base will grow by more than 11 times with $420 million from the Henry group and the departing limited partners. "The foundation now has the potential to do good for generations, well into the next century," Reilly said.
Dolan, for one, was not happy with the outcome. "We are deeply disappointed by today's events," he said in a statement. "We agree with the previous statement of the attorney general of Massachusetts that the bidding process for the Boston Red Sox was fatally flawed. All of those associated with the process clearly know that to be the case."
Dolan's offer would have given the Yawkey trust $490 million compared with the $420 million it will receive under the approved deal. Dolan, who has tried unsuccessfully to buy other teams, including the Yankees and the Mets, was particularly interested in the New England Sports Network, 80 percent of which the Red Sox own. The sale also included Fenway Park. 
Although the $660 million sale price included those other lucrative elements, no one has ever paid even half that much for a baseball team. The record price for a team until now was the $323 million that Larry Dolan, Charles's brother, paid for the Cleveland Indians two years ago. 
Among those joining Henry in the ownership are Tom Werner, former managing partner of the San Diego Padres; Larry Lucchino, former president of the Baltimore Orioles and the Padres; George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader, who served on Selig's blue ribbon panel on baseball's economics; and The New York Times Company, owner of The Boston Globe as well as The Times.

HEADLINE: Enron And the Gramms 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When Senator Phil Gramm and his wife Wendy danced, it was most often to Enron's tune.
 Mr. Gramm, a Texas Republican, is one of the top recipients of Enron largess in the Senate. And he is a demon for deregulation. In December 2000 Mr. Gramm was one of the ringleaders who engineered the stealthlike approval of a bill that exempted energy commodity trading from government regulation and public disclosure. It was a gift tied with a bright ribbon for Enron. 
 Wendy Gramm has been influential in her own right. She, too, is a demon for deregulation. She headed the presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief in the Reagan administration. And she was chairwoman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 1988 until 1993.
In her final days with the commission she helped push through a ruling that exempted many energy futures contracts from regulation, a move that had been sought by Enron. Five weeks later, after resigning from the commission, Wendy Gramm was appointed to Enron's board of directors. 
According to a report by Public Citizen, a watchdog group in Washington, "Enron paid her between $915,000 and $1.85 million in salary, attendance fees, stock options and dividends from 1993 to 2001."
As a board member, Ms. Gramm has served on Enron's audit committee, but her eyesight wasn't any better than that of the folks at Arthur Andersen. The one thing Enron did not pay big bucks for was vigilance.
There's a lot more you can say about the Gramms and Enron, and not much of it good. But Phil and Wendy Gramm are just convenient symptoms of the problem that has contributed so mightily to the Enron debacle and other major scandals of our time, from the savings and loan disaster to the Firestone tires fiasco. That problem is the obsession with deregulation that has had such a hold on the Republican Party and corporate America. 
An article in yesterday's Times noted the extensive links between Enron and the powerful Texas congressman Tom DeLay. Mr. DeLay became unhappy when Enron wooed a Democrat -- a senior treasury official in the Clinton administration -- to run its Washington office. "Still," the article said, "whatever the tensions last year, Mr. DeLay and Enron had a natural alliance. In his days in the Texas Capitol, Mr. DeLay was called Dereg by some because of his support of business. And in Congress he has been a longtime proponent of energy deregulation, an issue dear to Enron."
Enron exploited the deregulation mania to the max, and the result has been economic ruin for thousands upon thousands of hard-working families. As Public Citizen put it, "Enron developed mutually beneficial relationships with federal regulators and lawmakers to support policies that significantly curtailed government oversight of its operations." 
The kind of madness that went on at Enron could only have flourished in the dark. Arthur Andersen was supposed to have been looking at the books, but the vast shadows cast by the ideology of deregulation allowed that company to escape effective scrutiny as well. So you have revolving-door abuses and pernicious financial arrangements between companies like Enron and auditors like Andersen that are similar to those between private companies and government agencies.
Who's left to look out for the small fry?
If the deregulation zealots had their way, we'd be left with tainted food, unsafe cars, bridges collapsing into rivers, children's pajamas bursting into flames and a host of corporations far more rapacious and unscrupulous than they are now.
Enron manipulated the energy markets and cooked its own books in ways that would not have been possible if its operations had had a reasonable degree of transparency. But Enron operated in what has been widely characterized as a "black hole" that left competitors and others asking such basic questions as how the company made its money.
How long will it take? How many decades and how many scandals have to come and go before we catch on? We're human. We're self-interested. And when left to our own devices, some of us will do the wrong thing. 
Some perspective is needed. Unchecked deregulation is an express route to chaos and tragedy. Where the public interest is involved, a certain amount of oversight -- effective oversight -- is essential.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW; 
AUDITOR RECEIVED WARNING ON ENRON FIVE MONTHS AGO

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Enron's auditors knew in mid-August of a senior Enron employee's concerns about improprieties in the energy company's accounting practices, Congressional investigators studying Enron's collapse said today.
 Officials of the auditing company, Arthur Andersen, sought guidance from their lawyers then about how to respond, according to the investigators. The disclosure raised fresh questions about Andersen's decision to stand by Enron's financial reports until early November, when the accountants forced the company -- by then under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- to restate five years of results and erase almost $600 million in reported profits. 
 Also, a February 2001 Andersen e-mail message obtained by Congressional investigators indicates that some senior Andersen officials discussed dropping Enron as a client nearly one year ago because of concerns about Enron's accounting, the investigators said. An Andersen spokesman tonight declined to comment on the message. 
In Washington today, the White House disclosed that Lawrence B. Lindsey, who is President Bush's top economic adviser and head of the National Economic Council, had overseen a study in mid-October of how a collapse of Enron would affect the economy.
According to Congressional investigators, the Enron employee, Sherron S. Watkins, called a former colleague at Andersen on Aug. 20 and told him of her concerns about the energy company's accounting. About the same time, Ms. Watkins also laid out her doubts in a letter to Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, disclosed earlier this week by a Congressional committee, that warned that the company might be revealed as an "elaborate accounting hoax."
Ms. Watkins's letter pointed to new questions about Enron's web of partnerships and raised the possibility that the company might have to reduce past earnings by $1.3 billion more than it already has. Business Day, Page C1. 
In an internal Andersen memorandum obtained by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Ms. Watkins's former colleague at Andersen wrote that "based on our discussion I told her she appeared to have some good questions."
On the next day, Aug. 21, four Andersen officials met to discuss Ms. Watkins's concerns, investigators said. They included David B. Duncan, the lead partner on the Enron account, whom Andersen fired this week after saying he ordered the destruction of Enron documents while the company's accounting was under investigation by the S.E.C. 
The officials then "agreed to consult with our firm's legal adviser about what actions to take in response to Sherron's discussion of potential accounting and disclosure issues," according to the memo.
Investigators say Andersen began the destruction of Enron documents in September and that an e-mail message from an Andersen lawyer on Oct. 12 re-emphasized Andersen's policy on destroying documents and encouraged the activity in the firm's Houston office.
Mr. Duncan, who is cooperating with authorities, spent hours in Washington today with government officials who are investigating the failure of Enron, the Houston company that pioneered energy deregulation and grew to be the nation's seventh-largest company before seeking bankruptcy protection last fall. 
He met for the second time this week with officials from the Justice Department, which is conducting a criminal investigation of Enron's collapse. On Monday -- the day before Andersen fired him -- Mr. Duncan met with Justice Department officials as well as staff members from the S.E.C. and agents from the F.B.I., according to people close to the inquiries.
This afternoon, he spent more than four hours answering questions from eight investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, one of several panels in Congress reviewing Enron's demise. Flanked by his lawyers, Mr. Duncan was not sworn, but he was warned not to give false statements to Congress. There was no discussion of giving him immunity for his testimony, investigators said.
"He answered our questions and provided us with some valuable information, which we are pursuing," said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican and chairman of the committee. Mr. Johnson declined to comment in detail about the interview but said that Andersen's shredding of documents and handling of the Enron account were discussed.
Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing Mr. Duncan, released a statement that said he was "continuing to cooperate with all investigations of this matter, and he looks forward to full disclosure of the truth."
Laura Sheehan, the spokeswoman for the energy panel's Democratic members, said that investigators had hoped to learn more from Mr. Duncan. "Our investigators were disappointed by the limited nature of Mr. Duncan's memory," she said. "We expect documents and other witnesses to fill in the blanks."
Mr. Johnson said that the Andersen memo about Ms. Watkins's concerns suggested that the firm was well aware that Enron's accounting was suspect long before the company had disclosed its problems. 
"It's clear now to us that key players at both Enron and Andersen knew of the problems months before the company imploded," Mr. Johnson said.
Representative James C. Greenwood, a Republican from Pennsylvania who heads the committee's oversight and investigation subcommittee, said the internal Andersen memo "raises additional concerns about Andersen's knowledge of potential accounting irregularities and the subsequent destruction of Enron-related documents."
A spokesman for Andersen, Charlie Leonard, said he did not know who was contacted at Andersen, which is based in Chicago, by officials in the firm's Houston office after their meeting about Ms. Watkins's concerns. He said the firm had contacted Mr. Lay and Enron's general counsel, James Derrick, about the matter. Andersen was told that Vinson & Elkins, a Houston law firm that represents Enron, was being brought in to review Ms. Watkins's concerns. 
The law firm, in reporting its findings to Enron, noted that it had been directed by the company to avoid "second-guessing the accounting advice and treatment" provided by Andersen. A lawyer for Enron said this week that the direction was meant to produce a quicker examination by Vinson & Elkins of Ms. Watkins's concerns.
Mr. Leonard said he did not know who at Andersen, other than Mr. Duncan, had participated in the Aug. 21 meeting. In addition to firing Mr. Duncan, Andersen this week placed on leave three other partners who worked on the Enron account, and the firm took away management responsibilities from four other partners in the Houston office. 
According to a person close to the case, Mr. Duncan told investigators that he disposed of documents in keeping with the Oct. 12 e-mail message from an Andersen lawyer in Chicago and that the destruction stopped when the lawyer left a voice mail message at the Houston office on Nov. 9. 
Andersen said on Tuesday that Mr. Duncan had ordered "an expedited effort to destroy documents" on Oct. 23, the day after Enron disclosed that the S.E.C. had begun its inquiry. The firm said the destruction apparently did not end until Mr. Duncan's assistant sent an e-mail message to other secretaries on Nov. 9 that said "stop the shredding."
Much of Mr. Duncan's discussion with investigators focused on the documents that were destroyed and on Enron's restatement of earnings in early November, the person close to the case said.
Also today, a senior Treasury Department official said that the nation's accounting and corporate disclosure rules needed to be strengthened. Speaking to a gathering of the American Council of Life Insurers in Boca Raton, Fla., Peter R. Fisher, the Treasury under secretary for domestic finance, alluded to Enron's collapse and cited "the failure of our financial accounting and disclosure practices to keep pace with the rapid evolution of our capital markets and corporate finance."
The Treasury Department disclosed last week that Enron's president repeatedly called Mr. Fisher in late October and early November seeking his help arranging bank loans as Enron scrambled to avoid collapse. Mr. Fisher -- who also was called by Robert E. Rubin, a former Treasury secretary whose current company, Citigroup, was one of Enron's lead bankers -- has said that he took no action on the company's behalf.
Two senior Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest at the Justice Department in the Enron investigation.
Representative John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, suggested that Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson -- who is ultimately in charge of the criminal investigation -- could have a conflict because his former law firm, King & Spalding, had represented Enron. 
Also, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, questioned whether a conflict existed because Andersen was also working on an F.B.I. reorganization.
Mr. Thompson told reporters that while his old firm had done work for Enron, he never had. He also said the Andersen unit doing the F.B.I. review was separate from Andersen's accounting business. Last week, Attorney General John Ashcroft, who received campaign contributions from Enron while serving in the Senate, recused himself from the case.
New details also emerged today concerning Enron workers' losses in their 401(k) plans. A lawyer for employees suing over the 401(k) losses released two internal Enron e-mail messages detailing the timing of a "lockdown" during October and November, during which employees could not sell Enron shares in their accounts.
Enron has maintained that the lockdown did not begin until Oct. 29 and lasted only 10 trading days -- a period in which the stock fell $3.83. Enron has also said that employees were notified of these dates in an Oct. 4 mailing to their homes.
But the e-mail messages released by Eli Gottesdiener, a lawyer in Washington, who represents some employees, include a Sept. 27 message to all employees that the lockdown would begin on Oct. 19 and last about a month. A second message, dated Oct. 25, said that the lockdown would last from Oct. 26 to Nov. 20 and acknowledged employees' fears about the company's deteriorating condition. 
Mr. Gottesdiener argued that the e-mail also showed that many employees were misled to believe the lockdown started a week before it actually did -- leading them not to sell shares in a week in which the stock fell $10.65. Enron shares, which were above $90 in August 2000, are now worth less than $1.
On average, Enron employees had more than 60 percent of their 401(k) plans invested in Enron stock, and many have lost their savings in the wake of the company's collapse. Several lawmakers say the company improperly forced workers to hold their stock as the company faltered and have proposed legislative changes to restrict such lockdowns. 
Meanwhile, Joe Dunn, a Democratic California state senator leading an investigation of possible electricity-price manipulation during the state's energy crisis last year said some documents destroyed by Andersen were possibly subject to a subpoena issued last summer by his legislative committee. Tonight, Andersen said the firm had no reason to believe that anything related to the California subpoena was destroyed.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DRUGS; 
Afghanistan Issues Order Taking Hard Line on Opium Production

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
Afghanistan's interim leader issued a decree yesterday banning the cultivation of opium poppies, reviving a struggle previously waged by the Taliban against Afghanistan's most lucrative crop, United Nations officials reported.
 "All countrymen, especially peasants and farmers, are informed that from now on, the cultivation, manufacturing, processing, impermissible use, smuggle and trafficking of opium poppy and all its derivatives is declared illegal," said the order issued by Hamid Karzai, the chairman of the interim administration in Kabul. "Violators will be dealt with severely." 
 Without an army or police force, it was unlikely that Mr. Karzai would be able to enforce the decree in a serious way. But the order came just days before donor countries were to gather in Tokyo to pledge reconstruction aid to Afghanistan, which may amount to $15 billion over the next decade. There, Mr. Karzai is expected to seek help for crop-substitution programs to encourage farmers to abandon poppies. 
During the war with the Soviet Union in the 1980's, and in the first years under the Taliban, with little governmental control over independent warlords and farmers, Afghanistan developed into the world's largest producer of opium, producing a record 4,950 tons in 1999. 
In 2000, the Taliban cracked down hard on the growers, and production plummeted. But Bernard Frahi, who represents the United Nations International Drug Control Program in Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the Taliban never took steps to destroy opium stockpiles or laboratories that produced heroin from the opium.
With the collapse of the stern fundamentalist regime, production and exports rapidly resumed, much of it heading north across the porous borders with Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and south into Pakistan. Mr. Frahi said much of this represented efforts by traffickers to move stocks to more secure places in other countries..
In recent weeks, Pakistan has announced the interception of several huge shipments of drugs. Last week, the Pakistani police said they seized 1,390 pounds of heroin in southwestern Pakistan.

PERSON: Edwin McCammon Martin 

HEADLINE: Edwin Martin, 93, a Voice In 60's Latin America Policy 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Edwin McCammon Martin, who was assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs during the Cuban missile crisis in late 1962, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 93.
 The cause was pneumonia, his family said. 
 Mr. Martin was a career diplomat who attained the rank of career ambassador.
An expert on economics, he was appointed to the inter-American affairs post in March 1962. In choosing him, the Kennedy administration was seen as moving to reinforce the Alliance for Progress, a United States aid program for Latin America. 
But by late April 1962, the indications were that he had become the closest thing to an overall "boss" of Latin American policy that the Kennedy administration had had.
Before the missile crisis began, he coordinated American endeavors to cut Cuba off from other Western Hemisphere governments.
In addition, he said in an interview in August 1962: "We want to get rid of Castro and the Soviet Communist influence in Cuba -- not just Castro. I think the Soviet Communist influence is more serious than Castro."
In the summer of 1962, Nikita Khrushchev made a secret decision to put Soviet ballistic missiles in Cuba. Then American aerial reconnaissance showed that missile-launching sites were being secretly built on the island.
After President John F. Kennedy learned about the missiles, he formed a special group of advisers, including Mr. Martin, which came to be called the Executive Committee of the National Security Council, or ExCom. The group's mission, as Mr. Kennedy put it, was "to make a prompt and intensive survey of the dangers and all possible courses of action."
On Oct. 22, he publicly announced an American naval and air "quarantine" -- a blockade -- on the shipping of offensive military equipment to Cuba. He contended that the Soviet Union, breaking past promises, was building offensive missile bases and also bomber bases capable of nuclear attacks in a radius of up to 2,000 miles.
He also warned that the launching of a missile from Cuba would justify the United States mounting a large-scale attack against the Soviet Union in retaliation.
Besides helping advise Mr. Kennedy during the crisis, with negotiations going on about the Soviets' removing the missiles, Mr. Martin worked toward, and has been credited with bringing about, a pro-United States vote by the Organization of American States. The vote, which was unanimous, condemned the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba and approved the American blockade.
On Oct. 24, Soviet vessels transporting additional missiles to Cuba reversed their courses. On Oct. 28, Khrushchev gave his acquiescence to pulling the missiles out of Cuba and disassembling the missile sites.
On Nov. 4, Mr. Martin said on television that reconnaissance had shown that the dismantling activity on the Soviet missile sites "looks good." He added that on-site inspection would be needed to verify removal of the offensive weapons, including the Soviet bombers.
On Nov. 20, the American blockade ceased. By New Year's Day, the missiles and the bombers were gone from Cuban soil.
Mr. Martin's next post was ambassador to Argentina, from 1964 to 1968. 
Born in Dayton, Ohio, he received a bachelor's degree in 1929 from Northwestern University and did graduate work there. He joined the State Department in 1945 and had assignments in Washington, with NATO and in London before 1962.
Surviving are his wife, the former Margaret Milburn; a son, Edwin Jr. of Potomac, Md.; a daughter, Patricia Martin Sanjuan of Mount Vernon, N.Y.; nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Bush Declares Free Markets Are Essential For Americas 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
President Bush invited Central American nations tonight to strike a separate trade accord with the United States and cautioned Argentina against using the country's economic crisis as an excuse to backtrack on free-market reforms or return to an era of protectionism.
 Mr. Bush's speech at the headquarters here of the Organization of American States was intended, his aides said, to demonstrate that despite making counterterrorism the new focus of his foreign policy, he has not turned back on the central foreign policy commitment he made last year: A new focus on the Western Hemisphere. 
 But Mr. Bush used the occasion to send a strong message to the new president of Argentina, Eduardo Duhalde, who more than once in the past two weeks has suggested that the American led "model" of economic development -- particularly rapid market openings and deregulation -- contributed to Argentina's economic crisis. 
Without naming Mr. Duhalde, save for a brief word of praise for the new president, Mr. Bush said that "Argentina -- and nationals throughout our hemisphere -- need to strengthen our commitment to market-based reform, not weaken it."
"Shortcuts to reform only lead to more trouble," he said. "Half-measures will not halve the pain, only prolong it."
Mr. Bush's economic and security advisers would not say this evening what "half-measures" he was referring to, but it seemed obvious.
While Argentina has abandoned pegging its currency to the dollar, a policy that kept inflation in check but badly hurt the competitiveness of Argentina's products -- Mr. Duhalde has created a two-tiered exchange rate that is designed to inflict pain on major banks and investors, not the public. It is unclear whether that is sustainable.
He has also declared a moratorium on the repayment of public debt, which is bound to scare away any investors who did not flee when the country was sinking deeper into trouble.
And while Mr. Duhalde has talked about the need for fiscal discipline, he has not yet said how he will deal with a huge budget deficit. Cutting government spending is likely to reignite rioting that has already been rampant through the crisis.
The International Monetary Fund agreed today to delay, for one year, a loan repayment of $933 million, due for repayment on Thursday. While the United States voted for the delay, and touted that as a sign of support for the country, the reality was that Argentina is in no position to pay the money, and has already defaulted on other loans.
When Mr. Bush met with Latin American leaders in Canada early last year, at one of the first big summit meetings of his presidency, there was little public questioning of the value of American-style economic reform measures. But tonight Mr. Bush felt that the pendulum had swung far enough that he had to note that "some are questioning the path to prosperity. Some wonder whether free market reforms are too painful to continue. Some question the fairness of free and open trade, holding out the false comfort of protectionism." 
But he argued that countries that "stay on the hard road of reform are rewarded," ticking off Chile's success in cutting poverty, and Mexico's recovery from the 1995 economic crisis. He noted that the United States had "made a mistaken and failed experiment with wage and price controls" in the 1970's, without mentioning that the plans had been devised by Republican presidents.
Mr. Bush also said that he would seek a free trade accord with the countries of Central America -- Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Because these are the smaller nations in the region, administration officials believe that they will be the easiest negotiating partners for an accord -- and that any regional agreement will prompt Argentina and Brazil, both much larger economies, to follow suit.
A new "Free Trade Area of the Americas" is scheduled to be negotiated by 2005, and if it is successful it would essentially extend NAFTA throughout the hemisphere.
But meeting that ambitious schedule may depend on Argentina's recovery. So far, Argentinian and Brazilian officials have said in recent weeks that they see relatively little potential benefit for their countries in a hemispheric accord.

Thanks, CNN, Mr. Pretzel And Jennifer

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
NEVER doubt the resilience of the American public. In some ways we will never be the same. But in other ways, it seems, we will never be different. The evidence is mounting that we have indeed returned to what passed for normal before the events of September, and have done so with the gusto of a lapsed dieter.
 This is, in its way, most comforting. 
 You question this rash judgment? Just look at the kinds of things that again preoccupy or at least distract us.
We worry about Jennifer Aniston's car accident in Hollywood. (Relax: the "beautiful blonde," the "stunner," as The New York Post called her in an article that required two bylines, one from each coast, escaped serious injury.) We anguish about portraits hanging in a borough hall, and about a statue honoring firefighters killed at the World Trade Center. We wonder if Larry King of CNN is earning as much as Katie Couric of NBC. We question whether labeling a television newswoman "a little sexy" undermines her professionalism -- a burning issue that has generated debate between those who object to the entire phrase versus those who find the qualifier demeaning. This is not a joke. To some.
What has become a joke is the matter of the presidential pretzels, a gift to comedians all, who were being painstakingly careful about our commander in chief for longer than his own advisers probably thought wise for his down-home image.
Then came the pretzel plop and by Monday night, David Letterman was nibbling on his own pretzel supply, thereby demonstrating not only his esophageal superiority, but the happy fact that, since he's teasing George Bush again, it must be all right to poke fun at anyone, must be all right for everyone to rag and disagree with everyone else.
They always did to some degree. But now it seems to be more the way it used to be, doesn't it?
The tussle over municipal art proves that. Should the statue of firefighters be symbolic or representational? The clay model of what is to be a bronze statue depicts one black, one Hispanic and one white firefighter raising the American flag at the World Trade Center site. In reality, three white men raised that flag. Hence the dispute. Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta, a man of peace, says he is hoping to find a compromise. 
The other artistic tiff is centered in Brooklyn. The borough's new president, Marty Markowitz, says the portraits hanging in Brooklyn's Borough Hall do not represent the diversity of his borough, so he has decided to move some, to make room for others. He said the portraits were of "old white men," one of whom happens to be George Washington, the father of our country.
A portrait of Washington still hangs in the entry gallery of Brooklyn Borough Hall, but Mr. Markowitz moved a similar painting from his private office to a second floor parlor, to the great disquiet of some New Yorkers, including the mayor. "I thought it was wrong, walking away from our history," Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday. Especially, he went on, a founding father. And this one led his troops to their first battle as Americans in August 1776, in Brooklyn, in the "Battle of Brooklyn" (sometimes called the Battle of Long Island).
BY yesterday, Mr. Markowitz was almost crying in frustration.
"This has gotten out of hand," he said. "I love our founding father, our first president. He will always be on prominent display in this building. I just want to try to make Borough Hall relevant to people who live in Brooklyn today, that's all. Was my choice of words poor? Perhaps. I don't know." He sighed. "For 20 years I was a state senator, nobody paid any attention to me."
Maybe nobody would have paid any attention a month ago. But now we somehow have time, and patience, for the frivolous and semi-serious.
We can, without apology, analyze the prospects of Julia Louis-Dreyfus's new television series. Will she succeed or fail, as did two other "Seinfeld" alumni? We can ask if CNN and Fox News will ever deliver more news than they make these days, as they steal each other's anchors and furiously self-promote.
And whither Regis?
The serious remains just as grave as ever. The city budget is out of balance. Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature approved a costly deal that gives munificent benefits to the large hospitals union and its powerful leader, Dennis Rivera. The recession continues, people struggle, mourning goes on.
But the leavening has begun. Some of it is downright silly. All of it is welcome.

HEADLINE: Kennedy Wants to Delay Tax Cuts to Pay for Programs 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Saying what many Democrats think but make a point of not saying, Senator Edward M. Kennedy called today for postponing $300 billion worth of last year's tax cuts so the nation could afford a prescription drug program and better early childhood education and health care.
 While Republicans uniformly disagreed with his plan, some gleefully heaped praise on Mr. Kennedy. They said the senator, a Massachusetts Democrat, showed "courage" or "guts" in saying what others like Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, have not. 
 Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said, "Senator Kennedy has set the stage for an honest debate between those of us who oppose tax hikes and those who support Daschle-nomics." 
The White House said Mr. Kennedy's call showed that the Democratic leadership "in all times, good and bad, looks to raise taxes on the American people."
Mr. Daschle issued a statement giving no direct comment on Mr. Kennedy's suggestion, but recalling that his own recent speech on the economy "did not call for either the suspension or the delay of the tax cut passed last spring."
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Democrat who heads the Finance Committee and who faces a stiff race for re-election this year, said through a spokesman that it was inappropriate to "revisit the tax cut in the midst of a recession."
Mr. Kennedy proposed putting off some of the $1.35 billion in tax cuts enacted last year and scheduled to take effect in 2004, which he said would be "long after the economy emerges from the downturn." He said those cuts, including reductions in the estate tax, helped the rich.
"Whatever the merits or demerits of last year's tax bill, it was enacted in what now seems a very different and distant time," he said at the National Press Club. "We must think anew, and act responsibly.
"Future additional tax breaks for the wealthy do not deserve higher priority than strengthening education or covering prescription drugs under health care or meeting other urgent national priorities." 
Specifically, Mr. Kennedy called for delaying cuts in the tax rates of one percentage point scheduled for 2004 and 2006 for taxpayers with joint incomes of more than $130,000 a year. That would save $190 billion through 2011, he said. 
The estate tax, he added, should not be repealed, but the minimum subject to tax should be raised, to $1 million immediately and to $4 million by 2010. That would save $110 billion, he said, while subjecting less than 1 percent of estates to taxation. 
Other scheduled cuts, including those for people with incomes less than $130,000 and increases in the child tax credit and elimination of the so-called marriage penalty, would not be altered. 
Anticipating the Republican argument that he was calling for tax increases, Mr. Kennedy said, "No taxpayers would pay a higher tax rate than they pay now."
Most Democrats have avoided the issue of postponing or repealing tax cuts, although Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York said last month on "Meet the Press" on NBC News, "Given where we are now with the recession, with the war on terrorism, I just don't think it's in our best interest to go forward with the tax cuts."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE VULNERABLE; 
AGrowing Number of Potential Targets for Lawsuits

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
With each new report of possible misdeeds by professionals who worked for or with the Enron Corporation, the list of deep-pocketed potential targets of civil and criminal lawsuits resulting from the company's spectacular collapse grows longer. A variety of major companies might just end up paying damages to help compensate victims of Enron's implosion.
 Shareholders have already sued Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chief executive; Jeffrey K. Skilling, its former chief executive; and members of the board, accusing them of selling stock on the basis of inside information while the company misled investors about the state of its financial health. 
 The recent revelations about Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, have added it to the list. 
Possibly Enron's lawyers and perhaps even its bankers and consultants could also be vulnerable, legal experts say -- on top of any possible criminal liability under investigation by Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.
"The closer you are to what the main problems here are going to be -- misleading investors, misleading employees, destroying evidence -- the more likely you are to be in the gunsights," said Michael J. Shepard, former chief of the special prosecutions division in the United States attorney's office in Chicago and now a partner at Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe in San Francisco.
If someone knew that Enron executives were breaking the law -- which has not been shown, Mr. Shepard emphasized -- that person could be criminally liable for helping them, even if everything that person did was perfectly legal. Even the financial advisers who helped Enron set up the partnerships that were used to keep debt off its books could possibly be liable, he said.
"If it turns out that these little partnerships are not actually compliant with whatever accounting rules there are, and they've been set up to hide Enron's losses," Mr. Shepard said, "and the investment bankers knew that, then it could all be part of a fraud."
There has been no proof of wrongdoing by any of these individuals or companies, of course. But this week's release of a letter that Sherron S. Watkins, an Enron executive, sent to Mr. Lay in August suggests that he knew its accounting procedures were questionable long before the company restated results in October. Any such lack of prompt disclosure will very likely subject Mr. Lay to additional suits, lawyers say.
Andersen's announcement on Tuesday that it had fired the lead partner responsible for the Enron account because, the firm said, he organized the destruction of documents and e-mail messages hands a great opportunity to shareholders angry over their big losses when Enron's stock price plunged.
"Proof of document destruction can lead to a court denying a defendant the right to even contest allegations" by the other side, said Melvyn I. Weiss of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, a law firm that has already sued Andersen on behalf of shareholders. 
The St. Paul Companies, which provides liability coverage for Enron's directors and officers, could also be on the line -- for at most $19 million, the company says. But if fraud is proved, insurers may have to pay nothing, said Robert Hartwig, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute in New York. "In general, material misrepresentation is grounds for nonpayment or at least dispute of a claim for payment," he said. 
Congressional investigators have disclosed that Enron's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, looked into Ms. Watkins's questions and concluded that Enron's practices did not merit further examination. After all, the law firm wrote, Andersen had reviewed Enron's accounting methods. Now the law firm may be subject to a suit, Mr. Weiss said.
Normally it is difficult to pull lawyers, accountants and other professionals into securities suits, said Michael Young, a lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher in New York who has defended accounting firms in such suits. "The plaintiffs, whoever they are, have to prove that individuals deliberately falsified numbers reported to shareholders" or that they were reckless in releasing numbers, he said. "That's usually the major stumbling block."
But this case is not typical, other lawyers pointed out, with new information coming to light daily that might help a plaintiff argue that accountants, lawyers and others should pay for Enron's collapse. "All the facts that you know now are just the tip of the iceberg," said one lawyer involved in the company's bankruptcy.
Some of Enron's creditors are just beginning to consider suing Andersen and possibly others. The Samson Investment Company, a Tulsa oil and natural gas explorer and now an Enron creditor, sued Andersen yesterday, saying it relied on Andersen's audits in doing business with Enron. 
But with many details unknown, it is too early to know all the creditors' legal options, said one member of the creditors' committee in Enron's bankruptcy proceedings. 
"Everyone will gather all this information," he said, "and then there'll be a slew of claims."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Apple's Retail Stores Show Positive Data on Customers

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Apple Computer said yesterday that 40 percent of the people who bought computers at the 27 retail stores it has opened in recent months were first-time users of Macintosh machines. The figure, analysts say, is an encouraging sign for the company's strategy of trying to lure newcomers to Macintosh, whose users are loyal but less than 5 percent of all personal computer buyers.
 The optimistic signal came as Apple reported quarterly results that underlined the challenge the company faces. Apple reported earnings that were in line with Wall Street's consensus estimates, but its sales results were somewhat below analysts' expectations. 
 Given the recession and the steep fall in technology buying, Apple held up reasonably well. "Apple delivered a solid quarter and is one of the few companies making a profit in personal computers during these challenging times," said Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple.
Mr. Jobs has sought to make Apple the product and design innovator in the personal computer industry. As evidence, he pointed to the introduction in late October of its iPod, a white, pocket-sized device that plays digital music. In two months, more than 125,000 of the iPod devices have been sold, priced at $400 each.
For the three months ended in December, Apple's fiscal first quarter, the company reported a net profit of $38 million, or 11 cents a share, matching the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. In the comparable quarter a year earlier, when it took big charges to reduce inventories after its cube-shaped computer sold poorly, Apple recorded a loss of $195 million.
Apple's revenues for the most recent quarter were $1.38 billion. That represented an increase of 37 percent from the depressed quarter a year ago, but it fell below revenue estimates of $1.43 billion.
The revenue shortfall in the quarter, said Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer, was attributable to weak sales of the company's iMac consumer desktop line. The iMac, introduced in 1998, was an aging model and personal computer sales were soft in the quarter.
In addition, potential buyers were holding off because of widespread speculation in the Apple community that the company was going to introduce a striking new model, which Mr. Jobs did last week at the Macworld conference in San Francisco.
The new iMac line features a flat-panel screen attached by a strut to a compact half-dome shaped computer. In the current quarter, Mr. Anderson said that Apple expected revenues to rise to $1.5 billion but that earnings would be essentially the same as the December quarter.
A key reason for the expectation of flat earnings is that Apple will air freight the machines from East Asia to the United States during the current quarter to try to meet the sizable backlog of orders. "It's an investment in our customers." Mr. Jobs said. "They have a right to expect products." There are 6 million current iMac owners, and 100,000 of the new model iMacs were ordered during the first week.
The Apple retail stores, which were opening rapidly in the December quarter, lost $8 million when all administrative and store-opening costs were included. But Mr. Anderson said that with the stores up and running -- more will be opened this year, but the company would not say how many -- the retail division should move to profitability.
The stores are crucial to Apple's future. Mr. Jobs is trying to position the Macintosh as the preferred computer for handling all kinds of digital media -- music, photos and video. Showing off Apple's special software to do all those things is essential to attracting first-time computer users or winning converts from the dominant standard, Microsoft's Windows.

HEADLINE: New Mayor, New Focus 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Just two weeks into his mayoralty, with most of his administration in place, Michael R. Bloomberg is now offering significant clues about where his policy priorities may differ from Rudolph W. Giuliani's, on such issues as services to the poor, human rights abuses and public health.
 While Mr. Bloomberg's many goals will inevitably be hampered by budget constraints, observers of municipal government already see an ideological shift at City Hall. "There is a coherence in what he is doing," said Douglas Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College. "The guy is a social liberal and he makes no bones about it. His conception of quality of life is broader and more liberal in terms of the role of the state, because it includes more stakeholders in the game." 
 Mayor Bloomberg has expressed an interest in reinvigorating areas of government that were dormant under the Giuliani administration, like the city's Human Rights Commission, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting discrimination cases. And the mayor is expected to try to give broader authority to the Health Department, involving it in issues from children's health to insurance to lobbying the state for public health needs in the city. 
And even in pursuing Mr. Giuliani's goal of clamping down on quality-of-life crimes, Mr. Bloomberg has broadened the definition and the approaches of that enforcement, insisting, for instance that while the homeless may not sleep on the streets, the shelters they are diverted to must have more beds, have additional services and be safe. 
"What you're seeing is that Mayor Bloomberg is acting on the areas he has felt strongly about in the past," said William Cunningham, a key adviser to the mayor. "I think most city residents see in their cities part of themselves. In his case, that means making sure resources are employed for the benefit of the citizens that need it the most."
Further, while Mr. Bloomberg's appointees have yet to make any major decisions, a great many of the officials are Democrats, raising the hackles of the city's conservatives, as have the early signs of Mr. Bloomberg's policy proclivities.
"I was certainly concerned about his statement that he would not litigate as much," said Heather MacDonald, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, referring to a position Mr. Bloomberg took right after being elected. "When the city is litigating, it is usually when they are a defendant in suits brought by advocates who want to preserve the status quo." 
In naming his new chairwoman of the Human Rights Commission, Patricia L. Gatling, a prosecutor in the Brooklyn district attorney's office, Mr. Bloomberg signaled that he would substantially raise the profile of the agency, which investigates and prosecutes cases of discrimination in housing, employment and public places. He called the appointment one of his most important. 
In 1991, the city's human rights laws were amended, giving authority to the commission to investigate patterns of discrimination in various areas of city life. Under the revisions, the city's Law Department was also authorized to start investigations and was given subpoena power. However, the Law Department never took a claim to court between 1998 and 2001, according to a report by the City Bar Association's Committee on Civil Rights. 
Mr. Giuliani, who said when he was first elected that he would like to see the commission abolished, opted instead to reduce its staff to 37 employees from 152. The agency took five cases to trial between 1998 and 2001, and its backlog of complaints grew. 
Under the Bloomberg administration, the new mayor's advisers say, this will change. "We are going to make this is a real law enforcement agency," Ms. Gatling said in an interview. "We will investigate, and we will be in the litigation posture."
Ms. Gatling's appointment has drawn the attention of policy and legal experts. "It is interesting that he appointed someone from the law enforcement side of things," said Craig Gurian, who co-wrote the 1991 revision in the civil rights laws. "There had been this terrific double standard in the previous administration, which found law enforcement very important, except civil rights law enforcement."
Another area of public policy that is expected to get a great deal of the mayor's attention is health. His interest in public health is longstanding -- because of his leadership and largesse, the school of public health at his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, is named after him -- and he outlined several plans to improve public health, many of them taken from the playbook of the city's advocates for children, the uninsured and the poor, during the campaign. 
Among his goals are building on the number of children enrolled in Child Health Plus, the state's insurance program for poor children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, and making sure that they stay enrolled. According to people in his administration, he would like to see the Health Department take a lead on keeping tabs on a variety of children's health issues, from primary care to asthma to insurance, things usually left to the state or nonprofit groups.
Mr. Giuliani became interested in the uninsured toward the end of his term but did not involve the Health Department, nor was he particularly interested in primary care and other clinical issues, outside of cancer research.
Mr. Bloomberg, who appointed Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a medical officer for the World Health Organization, as the next health commissioner, plans to seek to give the department broader authority, using $1.6 million in federal money earmarked to guard against bioterrorism to beef up the agency's infrastructure, officials said. 
Mr. Bloomberg may fold the mayor's Office of Health Insurance Access, which was created during the Giuliani years to work with the state to enroll people in health care programs, into the Health Department. Doing so, officials said, would allow the department to have a central role in lobbying the state for changes to Medicaid laws. 
In some cases, Mr. Bloomberg is simply extending Mayor Giuliani's policy initiatives, with a twist, as in adding homeless shelter safety to his list of quality-of-life reforms. "I do not want anybody to say I don't want to go to a shelter because it is full, I don't want to go to a shelter because it's not safe," he said recently.
In many ways, the remark was as politically shrewd as anything else. "He is a very practical person," said Mr. Cunningham, the mayoral adviser. "If there is a perception or a reality that there is a crime spike in shelters, that is where you put resources. Then no one can make the bogus argument that people can't go to shelters because they are not safe." 
Given his focus on public safety, education and his promise not to raise taxes, Mr. Bloomberg may avoid the perception among Republicans, whose party he only recently joined, that he is too liberal, or fears among a broader swath of New Yorkers that he is moving the city back to a place where most do not want it to go. "His policies on the economic front are very heartening," said Ms. MacDonald, echoing other conservatives. "Maybe he can go beyond Mayor Giuliani, who I don't think had as strong a record on budgetary reform and radical tax cutting that the city needs. Or maybe that is just wishful thinking."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE REVIEW; 
White House Says Economics Adviser Saw Little Risk on Enron

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
The White House said today that President Bush's top economic adviser, who had served as a paid consultant to the Enron Corporation before joining the administration, had directed a review of the broad economic effects of a potential collapse of the company but concluded it posed little risk to the American economy.
 The adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, who heads the National Economic Council, has said recently that unlike Treasury officials, he never received phone calls from Enron executives seeking help. Mr. Lindsey was paid $50,000 in 2000 for work on an Enron advisory board. 
 The White House said Mr. Lindsey began his review of the potential impact of Enron's troubles in mid-October, based on news reports of the company's troubles. White House officials said the review began two weeks before the chairman of Enron, Kenneth L. Lay, called Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, and Donald L. Evans, the secretary of commerce, suggesting that any Enron collapse might ripple through the American and global economies. 
"The government did exactly what the government should do," the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said tonight in a statement after being questioned about Mr. Lindsey's role at his afternoon news briefing.
Ordinarily, any official who served as a consultant or lawyer for a company observes a period of a year or more once entering the government during which he or she avoids making decisions involving the company. 
Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Lindsey's examination of Enron posed no conflict of interest. Until Mr. Fleischer's statements, however, the White House had given no indication it had conducted any review of Enron's troubles or the potential impact.
After Mr. Lay called Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans in late October, Treasury officials conducted a study, and it appears to have overlapped the review the White House says Mr. Lindsey had already begun. The Treasury study focused on whether an Enron collapse might create a global market upheaval like the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund, did in 1998.
Government ethics rules state that members of the executive branch are obligated to recuse themselves from a matter if they "determine that a reasonable person would question their impartiality."
Democratic strategists, who have criticized Mr. Lay's calls to Mr. Evans and Mr. O'Neill, pounced on the news, saying that Mr. Lindsey should not have conducted the inquiry so soon after working for Enron.
"This is very troubling," said Jennifer Palmieri, a Democratic National Committee spokeswoman. "It is a significant conflict of interest for the former Enron economic adviser to be doing an analysis about Enron as the president's economic adviser.
"Most importantly, it shows once again that the administration did a lot of thinking about the fact that the company was going to collapse but they did absolutely nothing to make sure that 50,000 Enron employees would not lose their life savings."
Tonight, Mr. Fleischer said that Mr. Lindsey and his aides at the National Economic Council focused on whether "natural gas disruptions could occur or the national economy could be harmed."
"They also looked at currency markets, equity markets, bond markets and other financial indicators to determine if there were indications of a shortage of liquidity that might signal a more widespread problem," Mr. Fleischer said in his statement.
At some point, Mr. Lindsey's office coordinated its work with the Treasury's study. But it was not clear whether Treasury officials told Mr. Lindsey that Mr. Lay had raised the prospect of a broader meltdown.
In his news briefing, Mr. Fleischer asked: "About whether Enron's collapse has implications for the economy, I think if the administration didn't look at that, you would be asking 'Why wouldn't you?' " 
Indeed, some Congressional Democrats have criticized the administration for inaction, arguing that Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans had an obligation to alert the public of Enron's situation once they learned of it.
Mr. Lindsey is one of several Bush administration and Republican officials with ties to Enron. Among others, Robert Zoellick, the United States trade representative, served on an Enron advisory board in 2000; Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's senior White House political strategist, held more than 1,000 Enron shares before selling them in June; and Marc Racicot, the former Montana governor whom Mr. Bush picked to run the Republican National Committee, worked as an Enron lobbyist last year.
Paul Krugman, an editorial columnist for The New York Times, said he was also paid $50,000 to serve on an Enron advisory board in 1999. He disclosed his connection in a Jan. 24, 2001, column about Enron.
"This was an advisory panel that had no function that I was aware of," Mr. Krugman said today. "My later interpretation is that it was all part of the way they built an image. All in all, I was just another brick in the wall."

Old Masters In Their Prime
 Collectors, dealers and auction house experts have been grumbling for years about the scarcity of exceptional old master paintings and drawings. In these tough times, when the economy is shaky and fewer collectors are traveling to New York for the big auctions, there seems to be less top-quality work than ever to offer hungry collectors. But experts are keeping an eye on two interesting works going on sale next Friday. 
 Christie's is selling "Sheerness as Seen From the Nore," an early Turner that would never have been included in an old master painting sale years ago, but would probably have found its way into an auction of British paintings. Now it may become either the season's highest-priced painting or its biggest casualty. When it was first exhibited in London in 1808, this painting and another Turner view of the Thames were called "the finest sea pieces ever painted by a British artist." 
Some think the painting, which depicts ships on a turbulent sea, is overpriced: it is estimated to sell for $6 million to $8 million. It is less fashionable than Turner's late work, yet some experts say "Sheerness as Seen From the Nore" is a precursor to his mature style.
"Turner's fascination with light and atmosphere shows his admiration of Dutch 17th-century seascape painters and the work of Claude Lorrain," said Anthony Crichton-Stuart, head of Christie's old master paintings department in New York.
Turner sold the painting to Samuel Dobree, one of his early patrons, who sold it at Christie's in 1842. It then found its way into the Barings banking family, which sold it in 1848 to William Wells, an important collector of Dutch old master and contemporary British painters. He, in turn, sold it for what would be $547,314 today to Robert Lloyd Lindsay, the first Lord Wantage, a major paintings collector. It stayed in that family until it was sold in 1991 to an unidentified Japanese collector, who bought it through Julian Agnew, the London dealer, for nearly twice its current low estimate.
Another work that has received much attention is Rembrandt's "Buildings by the Diemerdijk," being auctioned at Sotheby's. The seller is A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's, who was convicted last month of conspiring with his counterpart at Christie's to fix fees charged to sellers. Mr. Taubman has been quietly selling portions of his art collection, both at Sotheby's and privately.
This Rembrandt drawing, which depicts some farm buildings by the dyke at Diemen, near Amsterdam, where the artist regularly walked, comes with a pristine provenance. In 1723 it was bought by the Duke of Devonshire for Chatsworth, his Derbyshire home, along with a group of other Rembrandt drawings, after the death of Nicolaes Anthonie Flinck, the son of Rembrandt's pupil Govaert Flinck and a director of the Dutch East India Company in Rotterdam.
The drawing, which became part of the celebrated Chatsworth collection, was sold at Christie's in 1984 and again at Sotheby's in 1989, when Mr. Taubman bought it. Sotheby's estimates it will sell for $1.8 million to $2.4 million. As always, Mr. Taubman is selling the drawing without being named in the catalog.

Deeply Dutch
While the name Anton C. R. Dreesmann probably won't mean much to collectors here, ask almost any European, who will instantly spout the name of Vroom & Dreesmann, the Netherlands' largest department store.
Dreesmann, who died two years ago at 77, was a member of the department store family. A passionate collector, he bought everything from Impressionist paintings and old master drawings to Chinese export porcelain and gold boxes. In April, Christie's will offer what it calls "the largest Dutch collection ever to come to auction" in a series of sales in London and Amsterdam. The collection is estimated at $20 million.
"The sheer number of fields he bought in is something you just don't see anymore," said Noel Annesley, deputy chairman of Christie's and worldwide head of its old master paintings and drawings department. "People will be especially intrigued by the range of drawings."
For sale are drawings by van Gogh, Degas and Monet, as well as old masters like Goya, Goltzius and Watteau. Highlights of the collection will be on view at Christie's Rockefeller Center headquarters from Feb. 1 to 5.

Brazil Beat Goes On
"Brazil: Body and Soul," which opened at the Guggenheim Museum in October, was to close on Jan. 27. But this week the museum announced that the show, which focuses on several important periods of artistic production in Brazil, has been extended through May 29.
Completing the installation was difficult after Sept. 11, said Lisa Dennison, the Guggenheim's chief curator and a deputy director. "Because attendance is down, we decided to slow our programming," she added. "That means less overall programming costs, and it gives more people a chance to see the exhibition."
A Matthew Barney retrospective was to open at the museum in early February but has been postponed for a year. Rather than opening first in New York and then traveling to Europe, the show is keeping its original European schedule, opening at the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany, on May 31 and then at the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville in Paris on Oct. 10 before coming to New York.

At the Armory Again
Two more art and antiques shows are back in the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue, at 67th Street.
When the armories in Manhattan were closed to nonmilitary use after Sept. 11, the Art Dealers Association of America planned to move its Art Show to the Jacob Javits Convention Center, but eight dealers were so upset about the location that they dropped out. Now the show is back at the armory, from Feb. 21 to 25.
The Wendy's Antiques Show, Feb. 6 to 10, will also be at the armory.

HEADLINE: The Chip On China's Shoulder 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
As soon as the two planes hit the World Trade Center, Chinese Internet users logged into online chat rooms to discuss the terror attacks.
 "Just one word: cool!" says the first of 6,000 comments on the attacks in a chat room on Sina.com, a leading Chinese-language portal. "Now the day has come for the American dogs." 
 "Why not the White House?" asks another a moment later. The gleeful declarations continue in a rush: 
"Excellent!!!!!!!! But the hijacked planes didn't carry a nuclear bomb."
"Just great. Really fantastic. Serves 'em right."
"So cool to see America bombed. Guys, let's use the Internet to wage war on 'em as well. This is the perfect moment for it."
"I'm waiting for the third plane, the fourth plane, the fifth plane, the sixth plane. Ha, ha!"
Not until the 44th message is there a reproach: "Do you people here have no shame?" someone writes. "Do you have no morality?"
The messages are still sitting there in cyberspace on the Sina.com site. A few days ago, I logged on using a Chinese-language computer here in Beijing and read through these messages. To anyone who deeply loves China, as I do, it is devastating to see how the deaths of thousands of Americans left many people here chortling.
I asked Chinese friends whether these online comments were representative of public opinion. Not entirely, they said, but the stories they told left me pained.
One friend who runs a business financed with American money found on Sept. 12 that the company's e-mail message system was full of jokes about the attacks. Another recounted how at the Communist Party School (where officials stayed up late to watch satellite television feeds of the destruction and showed unseemly good cheer), a luncheon for more than 80 top officials echoed with positive comments about the terror attacks. 
All this has to be put in perspective. Most Chinese I talked to were appalled by the attacks, and the United States Embassy in Beijing was showered with messages of sympathy from ordinary Chinese and with cash donations for the victims. Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders drafted an immediate message of condolence that they sent to Washington. 
Even in the chat rooms, the initial tone of xing zai le huo (gloating at the pain of others) faded as the death toll grew. 
Yet there is something going on here, something more complex -- and, to me, far more worrying -- than simply schadenfreude at seeing America humbled. It is a rapidly increasing Chinese nationalism.
This nationalism has deep roots in China and results in part from the battering that the country suffered at foreign hands over the last 200 years. But the latest surge in nationalism is the result in particular of "patriotic" campaigns planned by President Jiang since 1990 as a way of knitting together the country, of providing a new "glue" for China to replace the discredited ideology of Communism.
I spent a couple of days at Beijing University talking freely to the nation's best and brightest. This in itself, along with the relatively free debate in Internet chat rooms, is a sign of real political progress in China. 
When I lived here in the late 1980's and early 1990's, there was no outlet like the Internet to express one's views, and I could talk to university students only after escaping the goons who routinely tailed me. This time I had no tails to shake.
Yet what I found heartbreaking is that this new openness and political maturity in China is accompanied by a dangerous sign of political immaturity: this booming, aggrieved, chip-on-the-shoulder nationalism among many ordinary people, much more so than even a decade ago.
Why is this a risk? Think of Japan, where nationalism combined with an economic boom to help lead to the Asian half of World War II. Or of Germany, where a similar combination helped cause World War I. Or even -- this is an example Americans tend not to recall -- the way nationalism and new-found strength in the United States led Washington to provoke the Spanish-American War. 
Elsewhere in the world, we were far too late in recognizing the way movements in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan arose to preach intolerance and hatred. In China it is still early enough to reshape this nationalist tide.

HEADLINE: An Enron Legacy: Lower Reported Profits 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
"FAIRLY" is the forgotten word of American accounting. But the Enron debacle threatens to make it a very contentious word as scared auditors suddenly decide that they should rein in corporations.
 The auditor's letter in every annual report certifies that the statements therein "present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position" of the company, "in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America." 
 Enron was not the only company to push the rules, to be "aggressive in its transaction structuring," as an Arthur Andersen partner put it in one memo. Many auditors have been willing to sign off on anything that could be shoehorned into the letter of the rules, whatever their spirit, and have been willing to overlook rule violations if the amounts involved could be deemed immaterial.
There is a historical pattern in such things, one that was recognized by the economist Charles P. Kindleberger in his classic 1978 book "Manias, Panics and Crashes." "The propensities to swindle and be swindled run parallel to the propensity to speculate during a boom," he wrote. After the revelation of the fraud, and the collapse of the boom, he added, "the curtain rises on revulsion."
There is no proof of fraud at Enron, but the revulsion is clear. "All the accountants with the Big Five will be tougher," Mr. Kindleberger forecast in a telephone interview yesterday. "There is a lot of turmoil going to occur in financial accounting."
"I would," he added, "love to be young enough to write a chapter on Enron. But I am slowing down." He is 91.
Just as the 1929 crash led to the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the current S.E.C. chairman, Harvey L. Pitt, vows to come up with a new body to discipline accountants. His proposal yesterday sounds promising. 
But in one way, it does not matter. Talk about sending accountants and executives to prison -- people who no doubt view themselves as upright, law-abiding citizens -- is concentrating attention among their peers.
"The ease with which an accountant, or a Wall Street analyst, will allow you to be creative is likely to change ahead of legal changes and industry governance changes, simply because they don't want to be in anything similar" to Enron, said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company.
The issue is not just fraud. In recent decades, operating earnings, as reported by companies, have consistently risen much more rapidly than net income, as losses were treated as extraordinary. And net income rose faster than corporate profits as reported in the government's national income accounts. Creative accounting by one company was quickly imitated by others.
If that changes enough, the overall growth of reported earnings could fall. Auditors will probably make lots of little decisions that, together, will force corporate America to report lower profits than it would have without the reaction to this scandal. Rules will become tougher as loopholes abused by Enron are closed. Even when companies are allowed to report dubious profits, they may be forced to disclose what they did. Investors will react.
Cynics will rightly say that there have been other accounting scandals and that nothing of the kind happened. But this one has shaken accountants more than any other. Change is coming, and the result is likely to be more conservative financial reporting. When accountants use the word "fairly," they may really mean it.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Shoots Up In December 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York City shot up last month to 7.4 percent from 6.9 percent as more than 10,000 jobs disappeared from the city's battered economy, government officials said yesterday.
 The December decline brought the job losses since the attack on the World Trade Center to more than 100,000 -- a record-breaking drop for a three-month period that surpassed even the steep decline that began in November of 1990, according to William C. Thompson Jr., the New York City comptroller. 
 Even so, economists generally breathed a sigh of relief when the data was released yesterday. "The numbers aren't good, but they could have been a lot worse," said Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist at The New York Stat, a newsletter. 
Some forecasters had worried that the pace of job losses might not slow after November, when about 20,000 jobs disappeared from the city. In October, the first month in which the data reflected the effects of Sept. 11, roughly 69,000 jobs were lost in the city, although some of them were simply moved across the river to Jersey City.
"While there are still declines in the city, it is certainly a moderation of what we had seen in the previous couple of months," said James A. Parrott, chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research organization. 
But he suggested that the unemployment rate, which has jumped by more than one percentage point since September, may well continue to rise; about a third more people applied for unemployment benefits in the last month than in the same period last year.
Getting a grip on exactly how many jobs have been lost in any month, or even since September, is hard, because of what economists call seasonal factors (for example, stores usually hire extra sales help in the months before Christmas). Private economists and city officials use various methods to adjust for these factors, while the New York State Department of Labor does not make any seasonal adjustments to jobs data except on a statewide level.
On an unadjusted basis, New York City actually gained more than 7,000 jobs in December, typically a banner month for tourism and retail-related employment. But in December 2000, the city gained more than 22,000 jobs.
After adjusting for seasonal factors -- which means trying to figure out what kind of hiring should have happened in more normal circumstances -- the number of jobs in the city fell in December. Several private economists estimated the drop at about 11,000, while Mr. Thompson's office put it at 13,500.
But there were bright spots, or at least brightish spots. James P. Brown, the Labor Department's specialist in the New York City economy, said he was pleased that there were signs that stores, bars, restaurants and hotels had hired some people in December. The upturn "was quite subdued by our usual standards, but it was there," he said. "I'm pleased to see any gain."
Airline-related employment, which has fallen by more than 21 percent in the last 12 months, continued to decline.
Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that the December job declines in the city were more in line with those that occurred nationally than in the previous months, which suggests that the worst of the economic aftermath of the trade center disaster may be over. Of course, the national economy is in recession, but the biggest problems are still in manufacturing, which makes up only a small portion of the city's economic and employment base.
In fact, a report released on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve Board found that economic activity "showed further signs of rebounding" in the New York region, while things continued to go downhill in areas like Dallas and San Francisco.
One negative sign in New York City was a continued decline in employment on Wall Street, which over the last year has shed almost 22,000 jobs, many of them in the last three months. High-paid Wall Street workers pay a lot of taxes, spend a lot of money in stores and restaurants, and keep a lot of other people employed, whether they are computer consultants or golf pros or taxi drivers.
And while the number of jobs in the securities industry fell by slightly more than a thousand in December, the real decline was probably larger, because some Wall Street workers returned to Lower Manhattan last month from New Jersey, Mr. Brown said.

HEADLINE: Japan Slows Down, but Not Its Road Builders 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SHIMIZU, Japan 

 BODY:
With massive white concrete pylons rising from a small farming valley, the New Tomei Expressway is emerging as Japan's answer to Germany's autobahn. Engineers are attacking mountains, straightening curves, smoothing inclines, and placing 60 percent of the highway on bridges or in tunnels, all in an effort to allow drivers to speed along at nearly 90 miles an hour. 
 The problem is, in 21st-century Japan, building new highways has the air of looking at the world through a rear-view mirror. 
 With Florida-style demographics and a European-type rail network, it is unlikely that hordes of aging Japanese are going to jump behind the wheel for a high-speed cruise. Since 1990, vehicle sales here have dropped by nearly a quarter. 
"It is absolutely, 100 percent unnecessary," said Hideki Kato, president of Japan Initiative, a Tokyo research agency. 
So as construction advances at a cost of $1 million for every six yards, this six-lane luxury highway may stand as a monument to Japan's late-20th-century addiction to concrete. 
Highway construction here once enjoyed wide popular support as a way to spread Tokyo's wealth and to reduce rural isolation and poverty in this California-sized nation. But in recent years, road construction projects have taken on the air of government make-work programs, intended to disguise Japan's growing unemployment. 
In fact, Japan has spent trillions of dollars in the 1990's in an effort to build its way back to economic growth. But instead it finds itself today deep in recession and saddled with daunting construction bills -- the world's largest government debt and an annual deficit that increased fivefold in the last decade. 
In Japan's new budget, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has succeeded in cutting highway spending, using money saved to seed future growth -- computers in schools, job training for laid-off workers, health care for the elderly, and child care to allow women who are now at home to join the paid work force.
A recent Nihon Keizai Shimbun poll showed that 77 percent of Japanese citizens, tired of the "construction state," supported the prime minister's effort to privatize the Japan Highway Public Corporation, the nation's major road builder.
"Those who are asking the government to build expressways are limited to the heads of local governments and presidents of construction companies," Nobuteru Ishihara, minister for administrative and regulatory reforms, said to applause at one of 50 government-sponsored town meetings held across Japan last fall. 
Still, those are powerful government bureaucracies and private lobbyists, whose voices, along with rural constituents, have carried clout with the governing Liberal Democrats throughout their half-century in power. 
One conspicuous no-show at the town meetings was Chikage Ogi, Japan's construction minister. At her ministry, employees still sing the Utopia Song, an agency anthem that rhapsodizes about "asphalt blanketing the mountains and valleys."
Pro-construction politicians, known as the "road tribe," have been resisting the budget cuts. All three research councils of the Liberal Democratic Party want to keep in place a plan to spend $160 billion over the coming years to increase Japan's 4,321-mile expressway network by two-thirds. 
This is so even though truck traffic along the old Tomei expressway has actually declined since 1995, with the erosion of Japan's manufacturing base. The New Tomei would double the number of lanes along the same route. 
"In all the prefectures, all of the Diet members and all the governors are very enthusiastically supporting construction of the second Tomei," said Tadatsune Kajimoto, director of a new industrial park, where noted that companies, in anticipation of the new roadway, had already moved in. "If the government doesn't keep its promises, it is very irresponsible." 
Ryotaro Nishigaya, an orange grower here, agreed, saying, "Talk about freezing construction is outrageous." The father of four adult children, he predicted that driving would increase in Japan, saying, "Each household could have three to five cars."
Others said traffic would increase if the government cut tolls, currently $30 for drive of 80 or so miles from here to Tokyo's western suburbs. 
Still, critics say, Japan is littered with public works projects built with little concern about profitability. From heroes of development, construction company presidents have became villains of economic stagnation, and are accused today of building bridges and bullet trains to nowhere.
"We are starting to look like medieval Spain, wasting our money on useless things," grumbled Hideaki Mizuno, an investment banker in Tokyo. "We need to use market mechanisms to allocate money."
That would be a change from the recent past. During the 1990's, construction employment increased by 17 percent, while construction investment fell by 12.5 percent, according to a study by the Research Institute of Construction and Economy, a private Tokyo research group. 
Alex Kerr, author of "Dogs and Demons, Tales from the Dark Side of Japan" (Hill and Wang 2001), writes that Japan will spend "three to four times more than what the United States, with 20 times the land area and more than double the population, will spend on public construction in the same period." 
He cited statistics indicating that Japan lays about 30 times as much concrete per square foot as the United States.
The explanation is relatively simple for Taro Kono, a member of Parliament whose suburban district west of Tokyo is crossed by the existing Tomei expressway: "There are politicians who need the construction industry, for money and votes."
Mr. Kono said he was one of only two Liberal Democratic members opposed to the New Tomei. Of 243 party members in the lower house, he said, the only other opponent "is the prime minister." 
Despite the public support he enjoys, Prime Minister Koizumi managed only mixed results in his recent showdown with Parliament over highway spending.
In the 2002 budget, he succeeded in abolishing the government's annual direct payment to the Highway Corporation, $2.3 billion last year, and cutting public works spending by 10.7 percent, as part of a plan to reduce it by one-quarter over the next five years.
But the prime minister did not win backing for a 30-year limit on repaying the Highway Corporation's debt, which would have ended much new highway construction, including the New Tomei. Estimates of the corporation's debt range from $150 billion to $220 billion. 
A panel is to be appointed to set a deadline and a method for privatizing the corporation and three other public road-building corporations.
Skeptics call this a defeat for Mr. Koizumi. Others say this was the path taken 15 years ago with the successful privatization of Japan National Railways.

HEADLINE: In Famously Tolerant City, Impatience With Homeless 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
After three hours of begging for change in a chilly, wind-swept fog, all Tricia T. could show for it was a pair of stiff hands, purple and gnarled from the cold, and 75 cents.
 Bad luck and worse health -- colon cancer -- have left her, at 58, completely broke, having lost her job as a telemarketer eight months ago and her apartment not long afterward. After her clothes and shoes were repeatedly stolen in a city shelter, she began panhandling on a street median to raise money for a $40-a-night hotel room. 
 Ms. T. (who said she did not want her last name in the newspaper out of humiliation at her condition), said the spare change that drivers handed her was the only public assistance she received. 
"I don't know what I'd do," she said, her eyes tearing up behind thick glasses, "if I didn't have this option." 
She may soon find out.
A proposed ordinance designed to curb panhandling would ban loitering on median strips, with violators subject to a $500 fine and six months in jail.
The proposal is one of many that legislators in this city known for its tolerance have recently introduced that point to a growing impatience with San Francisco's highly visible population of people living on the streets. 
Other proposals would create a special telephone line for people to report quality-of-life infractions like loitering, and an ordinance that would ban sleeping in public. 
"I'm walking past people who are sick in the streets," said Tony Hall, a city supervisor who suggested the ban on sleeping and relieving oneself in public (which require that the city double its shelter beds, to 3,500, and open about 100 public toilets). "It's getting to me and it's getting to other people."
Mr. Hall's sentiment resounds in cities across the country. But advocates for homeless people say that at a time when a bad economy and a tight housing market are creating record levels of homelessness, more and more cities are responding by cracking down on the consequences of homelessness -- the sleeping, urinating and shopping-cart-hauling habits of homeless people -- rather than by addressing the causes.
"Nationally, a big reason driving the phenomenon of the criminalization of homelessness is concern about the visibility of that population, especially with respect to how they affect businesses and tourism," said Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, an advocacy organization based in Washington.
The law center, in conjunction with the National Coalition for the Homeless, released a report on Tuesday declaring San Francisco, New York and Atlanta as the "top three meanest cities," when it comes to treatment of homeless people. 
The cities on the list all have ordinances that make the everyday activities of many homeless people subject to a jail term, Ms. Foscarinis said.
"There are legitimate concerns about having large numbers of people living in public," she said. "What we take issue with is what you do about it. Do you respond with passing laws or do you respond by providing an alternative to people living in public?"
In San Francisco, the most expensive city in the country, homeless people lugging trash bags with everything they own haunt downtown doorways and alleys, and the issue of homelessness generates daily headlines and unending debate. At least three successive mayors (in 16 years) have vowed to clear the streets of homeless people. None have promised to solve homelessness; the current mayor, Willie L. Brown Jr., has called it "intractable." 
The city has consistently made the advocacy organizations' "meanest cities" list, as one of the first to outlaw aggressive panhandling and soliciting money near A.T.M.'s, and to sweep people from the streets despite having few other options to offer them. But George Smith, director of the Mayor's Office on Homelessness, said the city had never driven homeless people away, as other cities have done.
"There are places that give homeless people one-way tickets out of town," Mr. Smith said. "So I don't know what they mean by 'mean.' All I know is that we've struggled in San Francisco about how to serve people who need help."
Certainly, everyone agrees, there are at least as many homeless people on the streets as ever. The city counts more than 7,300 people living in the streets or in emergency housing, but doubles that number when including those people who live in transitional housing and other impermanent housing, the definition used by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
In 1999, the city issued more than 42,000 citations to homeless people for infractions like sleeping in a park after hours or camping in public, according to the national report. Even so, calls for the city to do more have grown louder, with local television news shows and newspapers issuing special reports on the problems of street people.
In response, three months ago the city stepped up its practice of rousing sleeping people from doorways. The Department of Public Works now sends crews fanning through the streets, waking homeless people and scrubbing down their sidewalk sleeping place with disinfectant, so they have no choice but to move.
Gavin Newsom, a supervisor widely expected to run for mayor next year, recently offered several proposals that he said were designed to solve a problem that had "become out of control."
They include a new department of homelessness to replace the city's current hodgepodge system, a centralized method of processing single homeless people who enter the city's social service system, modeled after New York City's, and a database for tracking them, as well as ordinances banning loitering on street medians or in public garages.
"It's time for tough love, accountability and outcomes," said Mr. Newsom, who received favorable editorials and scores of approving e-mail messages after floating his ideas a few weeks ago.
Mr. Smith said a remedy he had seen in Chicago and New York that he might seek to use here involved centers that address specific areas of need.
The idea recognizes that there are different categories of homeless people, with different needs and capabilities, he said. So a mother and her children would be served differently than a single drug abuser, for example.
Such an ambitious idea is a long way from execution. And advocates for homeless people here say San Francisco should be wary of using New York, where a record high 29,400 homeless people live in city shelters and hotel rooms, as a model for ending homelessness.
"I don't see New York having solved homelessness," said Paul Boden, executive director of the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness.
Mr. Boden has consistently found himself locking horns with the mayor and other politicians over their push to outlaw behavior associated with homeless people.
"A lot of stuff that's really frustrating," he said of the latest proposed ordinances, "is that we've seen all of this stuff before. We're enacting legislation that's used for media bites, as opposed to legislation that addresses the problem. It turns the debate around homelessness into this nasty debate about urinating and defecating and shooting up in the streets instead of 'How can we help the problem?' "
Harry Skinner, a 51-year-old Vietnam veteran who panhandles on a busy median strip, said he was surprised at all the recent attention given to people like himself.
"I sit here 12 hours and most people look right through me," Mr. Skinner said. "I've been thinking that maybe I'm really invisible."

HEADLINE: McGreevey Administration Hints at Tax Rebate Cuts 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Faced with a steep budget deficit, the administration of New Jersey's new governor, James E. McGreevey, is considering whether to repeal or reduce a property tax rebate program that paid the average homeowner $500 last year, state officials said today.
 Mr. McGreevey, who said during his election campaign that he did not intend to raise taxes, took office two days ago and immediately began searching for ways to close the $2.8 billion shortfall the state faces in the fiscal year that ends June 30. Today he announced that he had formed a commission of business leaders to search for ways to trim the budget. 
 But even the layoff of thousands of state workers and deep program cuts will not be enough to balance the state's books, and Mr. McGreevey today left open the possibility that some taxes could be increased.
"Literally every option is on the table with the exception of increasing sales and income taxes," he said. "Our first charge is reducing the size of government and changing the way New Jersey does business."
Mr. McGreevey was reluctant to discuss specific measures being considered. But possibilities include raising corporate taxes and scaling back the New Jersey Saver program, which offers property tax rebates and is scheduled to cost the state $1 billion this year. 
Anthony R. Coscia, who was named chairman of the Budget Efficiency Savings Team Commission, also avoided discussing any detailed numbers. But when pressed about the property tax rebate, he said "at $1 billion, it is obviously a target."
Taxes are a volatile issue and Republicans were quick to pounce on it. They accused Mr. McGreevey of reversing his campaign promise and compared him to former Gov. Jim Florio, another Democrat, who was run out of office after pushing a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature in 1990. 
Throughout the campaign, Mr. McGreevey resisted a challenge from his Republican opponent, Bret D. Schundler, to sign a no-new-taxes pledge. In its final weeks, however, Mr. McGreevey said repeatedly that he would not increase taxes, though he stopped short of making the kind of blanket antitax pledge Mr. Schundler had sought.
John O. Bennett, the Republican co-president of the Senate, said he was "deeply concerned" that the governor appeared to be backing away from his pledge not to raise taxes. "We know now why Governor McGreevey failed to mention property taxes in his inaugural address," Mr. Bennett said. "He plans to slash property tax relief for working families throughout New Jersey." 
Mr. McGreevey and his staff now say that he was referring to the income and sales taxes. His spokesman, Paul Aronsohn, insisted that today's statements did not contradict the governor's campaign promises.
But Republicans characterized the statement as an about-face.
"We have learned the hard way that increasing taxes during an economic downturn is a recipe for disaster," Mr. Bennett said.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Are Lower 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
The number of new claims for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly last week to the lowest level in more than five months, the Labor Department said today, a sign the economy might be pulling out of recession. A separate report by the Commerce Department showed a drop in the construction of homes and apartments in December. 
 "The worst of the layoffs and the labor market weakness is behind us," said Tim McGee, chief strategist at UFJ Bank in New York. "There was an overreaction after Sept. 11, and businesses need to start going in the other direction." 
 Initial jobless claims decreased 14,000 in the week ended Saturday, to a seasonally adjusted 384,000. The number of applications has not been as low since the last week of July.
A Labor Department spokesman said seasonal adjustments had anticipated a larger increase in applications last week. Because the increase was 140,000 instead of the 160,000 expected, there was a decline in the claims reported. And the total number of unadjusted claims was 776,035, the highest in 11 years.
The four-week moving average of jobless claims, a less volatile indicator, ebbed to 411,000 from 411,250 a week earlier.
Housing starts fell 3.4 percent last month, to 1.57 million units at an annual pace, as builders undertook fewer new apartments. Economists had expected a 2.1 percent decline. The number of building permits increased 3.6 percent, to a 1.653 million annual pace. Work on single-family houses increased 3.6 percent. A total of 1.603 million homes were started last year, up 2.2 percent from 2000.
Also today, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index of manufacturing rose to 14.7 this month, the first positive reading since November 2000.

HEADLINE: 3 Airlines Post Weaker Results 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Southwest Airlines posted a decrease in fourth-quarter profit today, while Northwest Airlines and the US Airways Group reported wider losses as the recession and Sept. 11 attacks kept travelers off planes.
 Southwest, the largest low-fare carrier, said profit fell 59 percent, to $63.5 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with $154.7 million, or 19 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
Northwest said its loss widened to $216 million, or $2.55 a share, from $69 million, or 84 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The loss at US Airways grew to a record $1.01 billion, or $14.89 a share, from $101 million, or $1.50 a share. 
 Southwest was the only major United States airline not to cut jobs or flights after the attacks.
"Southwest is probably going to pick up passengers and routes over the next 12 months while everybody else is going to be bleeding and shutting down routes," said Nick Redfield, an analyst for Banc One Investment Advisors. 
Sales at Southwest fell 16 percent, to $1.24 billion, while Northwest's slid 27 percent, to $1.99 billion. US Airways' sales declined 34 percent, to $1.57 billion.
Shares of Southwest rose 39 cents, to $17.90, while Northwest dropped 25 cents, to $23.05, and US Airways lost 41 cents, to $5.20. 
Southwest, which is based in Dallas, received government aid of $67 million before taxes. The airline lowered its average fare 8.4 percent, to $79.99, to win back passengers, and its fourth-quarter traffic slipped 0.5 percent from a year earlier.
Southwest's capacity rose 6.4 percent as other carriers scaled back as much as 26 percent. Yield, or average fare per mile, fell 15 percent. Costs per available seat mile fell 7.2 percent on lower jet fuel prices and travel agent commissions.

HEADLINE: A Bird That's on a Lot of Hit Lists 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: CEDARVILLE, Mich., Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Rob Burger wants to stomp the eggs under his feet. Brian Harrison would like to round up 300 hunters and pump shotgun shells into the nests. Mark Clymer is ready to bypass the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and call in the Department of Defense.
 "I'd pull troops and carriers out of Afghanistan and napalm the rookeries," declared Mr. Clymer, 47, whose business card identifies him as a "problem solver" for computer and environmental systems. "For years, they've done fighter runs over the Great Lakes to practice bombing. Why not the real thing?" 
 The enemy in this tourist-dependent town in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is the double-crested cormorant, a gamefish-gobbling bird the residents blame for decimating the perch population and, along with it, the local economy. Since the cormorant became a protected species in 1972, the number of the birds in the Great Lakes has exploded, to more than 100,000 mating pairs from fewer than 100 pairs, overtaking geese as the birds fishermen love to hate. 
As for the perch caught, surveys by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources show that the number dropped to 20,000 last year from 145,000 in 1986.
After years of complaints from communities like this one on Lake Huron -- and from others from upstate New York to Southern California to the fish farms along the Mississippi River -- the federal government is offering to allow states and Indian tribes help reduce the cormorant population across the country by about 10 percent. But many here deride the proposal, contained in a draft environmental impact statement expected to be completed by the summer, as too little, too late. They suggest instead that 10 percent be the portion that survives.
Some say the fish and wildlife agency must take responsibility for, and finance, a coordinated national effort to control the birds they call vermin. Others want an open season on the bird (killing one now is punishable by jail time and a hefty fine). 
"I look at wildlife management as a way of manipulating population to benefit something that's valuable to people," said Gaylord Alexander, a fishery biologist who retired after 40 years with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. "Rather than raising a million cormorants to sit out on these islands and annoy people, you could produce about 20 million more pounds of desirable game fish."
Ridiculed in the Old Testament as unfit for eating, likened to the Devil in Milton's "Paradise Lost," the cormorant has been hated throughout history. A 14th-century painting shows archers in Venice trying to shoot the birds in the back. 
The black, ducklike foragers, numbering about two million in North America, swallows about 1.5 pounds of fish each day and live for several years after they begin mating at age 3. Critics say their feces contaminate water and leave parasites that cause swimmer's itch. Their nesting grounds, including several of the 36 Les Cheneaux Islands that dot Lake Huron, deteriorate into fetid graveyards of skeletal conifers. 
Even the cormorant's defenders have a hard time sounding enthusiastic.
"They're kind of sinister looking," admitted Shauna Hanisch, the fish and wildlife agency's project manager on the environmental impact statement, which is open for public comments until Feb. 28. "A lot of people would say they have no use."
But Bette Stallman, a wildlife scientist at the Humane Society of America, said cormorants had simply become scapegoats for more complicated problems plaguing the nation's waters, including overfishing and pollution. Ms. Stallman noted, "Nature isn't always beautiful." 
Here in Cedarville, a town with one flashing-red stoplight, there is no doubt about the cormorant's guilt. They are blamed for reducing the number of fishing resorts here to 15 today from 56 in 1960. The only upside people see to the cormorants is dropping golf handicaps as old-time fishermen reluctantly switch hobbies.
Mr. Harrison, owner of the Great Outdoors sporting goods store, said his bait supplier once sold 30,000 wigglers a week in town. Now the order is down to 1,000, he said, and there are plenty of leftovers.
The cash register was quiet at the store this morning, but regulars sipped coffee in worn armchairs, as they do each day. The men here argue over everything -- from whose wife treats him best to the benefits of collectivism versus individualism. The group keeps a foot-thick Webster's on hand to settle disputes like last week's conundrum of whether "unthaw" is a word (yes, according to the 1957 unabridged).
The one thing they agree on is cormorants: killing them, as many as possible, as soon as possible.
"I'm not a hunter," said Mr. Burger, 34, a chef and contractor. "I tend to be a kind person -- this is the only thing that stirs me like this." 
"I thought this would be my dream residence," said Mr. Burger, who spent summers here as a boy and moved up full time several years ago, in part to share his beloved perch with his young sons. "I built a big house. Now I have to drive five hours to catch a fish."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Donations Continue to Rise as Another Record Falls

BYLINE:  KARI HASKELL 

 BODY:
After a dramatic upswing in donations, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund set a record on Tuesday, surpassing the $8.03 million collected in last year's campaign, also a record. By Wednesday, contributions reached an even higher record -- $8,309,809.99.
 "We are genuinely gratified that readers are so attentive to the growing needs of people in distress," said Jack Rosenthal, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund. The total number of gifts given to the fund has also risen, to 10,655 from 10,108 at this point last year. 
 A remarkable change in the 2001-2002 campaign is the number of online contributions made this year, Mr. Rosenthal said.
Tuesday's total included $250,000 given in December through CharityWave.com, an online donation service. With just a click of the mouse and a credit card, 1,215 people used the service to give to the fund, 157 percent more than the number of people who had used it at the same point last year.
The 2000-2001 campaign was the first time contributions could be made online; previously they were made only through the mail or on the phone. For this year's campaign, CharityWave.com raised its $500 contribution limit to $5,000. No transaction fee is charged for donations under $500, said Cristine Cronin, the director of CharityWave.
"There was a seismic shift of people turning to the Internet after 9/11," Ms. Cronin said. "People overcame their fears about the giving through the Internet by putting aside their security and privacy issues -- people just made a leap of faith." Donations in memory or in honor of loved ones have been popular, because CharityWave sends e-mails notifying the identified party, Ms. Cronin said.
Regardless of which method was used, contributions over the past few weeks have pushed the fund's giving record past last year's.
Beverly and David Hannon of Anamosa, Iowa, sent $20 to the Neediest Cases Fund. Ms. Hannon, a mother of six, said that instead of holiday presents, each family member requested a contribution to a charity. She made a total of 20 contributions to different charities in their names.
"After 9/11, Bush asked for people to spend," Ms. Hannon said. "Give to those who really need it, and their spending will stimulate the economy."
Ms. Hannon read about the fund on The New York Times Web site, nytimes.com. "The Neediest covers a lot of groups," said Ms. Hannon, referring to the seven organizations that fund supports. "It really appealed to me."
Andrea Norris, an art director at the University of Kansas, sent in $100. She said that the articles published about the city's poor in The New York Times each year were the key reason she gave to the fund.
"When I think of New York, it is my idea of the center of the country," Ms. Norris said.
"I grew up with The New York Times," said Ms. Norris, who added that she has never lived in the city. "When I saw that the Neediest was under, I decided to send a check."
Catherine Watson gave $200 this year, her first time gift to the fund.
"I primarily give to animal and environmental charities," said Ms. Watson, a writer for The Star Tribune of Minneapolis. "Like many people, I felt more connected to New York after 9/11."
Martin Friedlander, a native New Yorker who now lives in California, agreed. He donated $500. "I wanted to give to an organization, and where it was needed," he said. "New York is a great city with a lot of people in great need of help."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: PC Sales Fell In 2001 

BYLINE:  By Chris Gaither (NYT) (Compiled by Alan Krauss) 

 BODY:
 In spite of unexpectedly strong personal computers purchases during the holidays, the worldwide and American PC markets declined in 2001 for only the second time, according to two market researchers. Gartner Dataquest said computer vendors sold 128 million PC's worldwide last year, a 4.6 percent decline from 2000, and 44 million units in the United States, an 11.1 percent drop, because of the poor economy and a saturated market. 
In the fourth quarter, PC shipments fell 6.7 percent from the period in 2000, but rose 16.9 percent from the dreary third quarter, according to the International Data Corporation. Businesses continued to delay computer upgrades, but improving confidence in the economy and price cuts prompted consumers to buy more PC's than anticipated last quarter. Unit sales declined by double digits last year for every PC vendor expect Dell Computer, whose sales rose 18.3 percent, enabling it to take over the worldwide lead from Compaq Computer early in 2001.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Japan: Gloomy Economic Assessment 

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 The Japanese central bank said yesterday that the economy was "broadly worsening," the same wording that it used to describe conditions a month ago. Despite the glum assessment, the report for January represented the first time in seven months that the bank did not downgrade its view of the economy. 
Personal consumption, exports and business investments were all weakening, it said. In another report, the Finance Ministry said Japan's current account surplus, a crucial indicator of the nation's trade, rose 19.4 percent in November, compared with the month in the previous year, for the third consecutive increase. When releasing the figures yesterday, the ministry said the surplus in the current account rose to 1.1 trillion yen ($8.3 billion) in November. The ministry cautioned that the surplus could shrink in coming months, especially if the United States economy deteriorated and demand for Japanese goods fell.

HEADLINE: Airbus Plans $530 Million In Cost Cuts 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Feeling the pinch of weakening demand for aircraft after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Airbus Industrie said today that it would cut costs by $530 million this year through early retirement of about 1,200 employees and other measures. Executives said that by eliminating overtime and part-time work, the company would reduce its labor costs the equivalent of 4,800 more full-time jobs without resorting to layoffs. 
 Airbus's approach contrasts sharply with that of its American rival Boeing, which has announced 30,000 layoffs in its commercial aircraft business. Noel Forgeard, president and chief executive of Airbus, said the company expected orders to pick up again in 2003, but "if the volume goes further down, we could consider layoffs." 
 Airbus and Boeing are locked in ever more bitter competition as they confront a cyclical plunge in the market that Mr. Forgeard says is "not unprecedented, even if the cause of the crisis is new and especially worrying for our industry." Like Boeing, he said, Airbus will aggressively seek military contracts, waters that the company has hardly tested before now, to offset the plunge in civilian sales.
John J. Leahy, senior vice president for sales at Airbus, said he expected airlines to order a total of only 300 to 350 large civilian airliners from Airbus and Boeing this year, down from 546 in 2001. 
Mr. Forgeard said he and Mr. Leahy would visit major airline customers in the spring to size up the effect of the plunge in air travel on their aircraft purchasing plans. Even if orders come in at the bottom of the forecast range, Mr. Forgeard said, Airbus will deliver 300 new aircraft in 2002 that were ordered in earlier years. 
Airbus and Boeing are the only remaining Western makers of jetliners, and Boeing remains larger, with 68,000 employees after its announced cutbacks; Airbus expects to employ 44,500 people at the end of 2002, according to Gustav Humbert, its chief operating officer. 
Boeing delivered 527 planes last year, 62 percent of the total, but its leadership is clearly threatened. Airbus said it booked more new orders, for a greater dollar value, than Boeing did in 2001. Its backlog of 1,575 orders is 218 more than Boeing has reported.
"This means that in future $2 out of $3 spent to take large commercial aircraft will go to Airbus," Mr. Forgeard said.
Mr. Forgeard said that customers canceled orders for 101 aircraft last year, but that 90 percent of the cancellations came from three defunct or troubled carriers -- T.W.A., Swissair and Sabena. 
Taking account of those cancellations, Airbus said it booked a net 374 new orders last year, worth $37.3 billion, or 62 percent of the total market by value. It delivered 325 aircraft worth $20.5 billion, up from 311 in 2000.
Airbus began life as a loose consortium of European aerospace contractors, but it gelled last year into a unified company, 80 percent owned by the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company and 20 percent by BAE Systems of Britain. Shares in both companies rose on today's news.
Mr. Leahy said airlines could not expect substantial price cuts on jets because prices are linked to production costs. But Mr. Forgeard said that Airbus relied at times on aircraft leasing companies, which account for up to 30 percent of Airbus sales, to provide financing to potential customers. Airbus reduced its debt by $300 million in 2001, he said, giving it more scope to negotiate financing packages.
Airbus's first major military contract is for construction of a new transport, the A400M, to replace aging models like the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Mr. Forgeard sees potential markets for Airbus-built military refueling tankers, electronic warfare and maritime patrol craft. But he said the company would be up against fierce competition from Boeing, which he said was able to make subsidized military sales abroad because of generous treatment by the Pentagon.
He cited a recent decision by Congress to allow the Air Force to replace aging tankers by leasing 100 Boeing 767's for 10 years at $20 million a year each. Airbus, which had no chance to bid for the contract, Mr. Forgeard said, could have beaten that price by 40 percent. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 31, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on Jan. 18 about cost-cutting at Airbus Industrie misstated the number of orders for new jets the company received in 2001, after taking cancellations into account. It was 274, not 374.

HEADLINE: A System Corrupted 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Clearly, Larry Lindsey shouldn't have described the Enron affair as a "tribute to American capitalism," and Paul O'Neill shouldn't have declared: "Companies come and go. It's part of the genius of capitalism." Both the top White House economist and the Treasury secretary have been excoriated for their callousness. But did they have a point? 
 Yes, they did -- but their remarks suggest that they still don't understand what happened. The Enron debacle is not just the story of a company that failed; it is the story of a system that failed. And the system didn't fail through carelessness or laziness; it was corrupted. 
 Mr. Lindsey and Mr. O'Neill were, in effect, patting themselves on the back for allowing Enron to fail. Indeed, that is one redeeming feature of the saga. It turns out that you can be too well connected; Enron was so enmeshed with the Bush administration that any bailout would have been politically disastrous.
 But it's missing the point to focus on Enron's eventual failure. The real issue is what Enron executives got away with during the good times.
 We usually take the viability of the modern corporation, in which professional managers look after the interests of shareholders, for granted. But as economists since Adam Smith have warned, a separation between ownership and management opens the possibility of insider abuse. Indeed, Smith thought that such a separation was a bad idea, except in a handful of businesses.
 But you can't run a modern economy with family-owned companies and partnerships. So capitalism as we know it depends on a set of institutions -- many of them provided by the government -- that limit the potential for insider abuse. These institutions include modern accounting rules, independent auditors, securities and financial market regulation, and prohibitions against insider trading. 
 The Enron affair shows that these institutions have been corrupted. None of the checks and balances that were supposed to prevent insider abuses worked; the supposedly independent players were compromised.
 Enron's byzantine network of 3,000 subsidiaries and partnerships -- one for every seven employees -- made a mockery both of accounting rules and of rules against insider trading. Not incidentally, the network also allowed the company to evade taxes in four of the last five years. And Enron executives knew what they were doing. A letter last August from an Enron vice president to the chairman, Kenneth Lay, described how shell companies with names like Condor and Raptor were used to create fictitious profits, and quoted one manager as saying, "We are such a crooked company." 
 The accounting firm of Arthur Andersen was told of these concerns. Yet it gave Enron a free pass, and shredded documents when questions arose. The regulators were nowhere to be seen, partly because politicians with personal ties to Enron, like Senator Phil Gramm, took care to exempt Enron from regulation. 
Mr. Lindsey and Mr. O'Neill would have us believe that all's well that ended badly; because Enron was allowed to fail, justice was done and the system worked. But Enron isn't a person; the evildoers here were Enron executives, who collectively walked off with at least $1.1 billion. 
 It's not just a matter of the utter unfairness of it all -- employees lose their life savings while crooked executives walk away rich. It's also a matter of what it takes to make capitalism work. Investors must be reasonably sure that reported profits are real, that executives won't use their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of stockholders and employees, that when insiders do abuse their positions their actions will be discovered and punished. 
 Now we have seen a graphic demonstration that the system that was supposed to provide those assurances doesn't work. And nobody I know in the financial community thinks Enron was an isolated case.
 Yet all the evidence suggests that the Bush administration doesn't get it. On the contrary, until the latest revelations it was moving in the wrong direction. Harvey Pitt, the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, made his reputation as a lawyer who represented accounting firms -- including Andersen -- in struggles to maintain auditor independence. Now we've seen what Andersen did with that independence. 
 The truth is that key institutions that underpin our economic system have been corrupted. The only question that remains is how far and how high the corruption extends.

HEADLINE: Ford Lost $5.4 Billion in 2001 After Charge for Revamping 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Ford Motor reported a $5.45 billion net loss for 2001 today, its first annual loss since 1992 and a long way from its $3.47 billion net profit in 2000.
 The huge loss was expected after Ford announced a turnaround plan last week that included job cuts of 35,000 workers and five plant closings by the middle of the decade. 
 The bulk of Ford's loss came from a $4.11 billion charge in the fourth quarter for revamping, including write-downs for the plants, the buyout packages and $1 billion for a bad bet the company made on the price of precious metals, including palladium, which is used in catalytic converters. A recent technological breakthrough reduces the need for those metals. 
For the fourth quarter, Ford reported a net loss of $5.07 billion, or $2.81 a share, in contrast to a net profit of $1.08 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2000.
I. Martin Inglis, Ford's chief financial officer, said: "Everybody recognizes Ford is going through a difficult period. Certainly the management and the workers recognize that; 2002 will be a year of transition."
There were further signs of profit erosion in the auto industry today when Delphi Automotive Systems, the supply company spun off from General Motors in 1998, reported a net loss for 2001 of $370 million, in contrast to a net profit of $1.06 billion a year earlier. Delphi said its sales had been hampered by G.M.'s production cuts. It is cutting 11,500 people from its work force of 195,000.
Beyond the tens of thousands of job cuts the recession has brought to the auto industry, most of the major domestic auto companies have sharply reduced benefits. G.M. has reduced matching contributions to its workers' 401(k) plans, while Ford, Delphi and Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, have suspended matching contributions entirely. Bonus checks and profit sharing plans have largely disappeared. 
Ford's goal this year is simply to break even. But the company received further bad news on Wednesday when Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating again, and that of its financing unit, Ford Credit, and its rental car unit, Hertz.
Shares of Ford fell 25 cents, to $14.70.
Ford officials have acknowledged that the company lost focus in the bull market by straying into numerous businesses that were not directly related to making cars and trucks, including e-commerce initiatives, auto repair shops and direct ownership of some dealerships. The company promised to pay more attention to building better cars and trucks.
"Overwhelming everything else is that we didn't execute well on the basics," Nicholas V. Scheele, Ford's new chief operating officer, said in a speech this week. 
Other pressing concerns include the health of the company's financial arm, Ford Credit, whose earnings analysts expect to be greatly diminished this year, and the company's cash position, which has dwindled considerably since the late 1990's.
Wall Street has given the turnaround plan mixed reviews. Saul Rubin, an analyst at UBS Warburg, said the cost-cutting did not go far enough and the shares could fall below $14 by the end of the year. But John A. Casesa, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said in a report that Ford's plan was "exactly what it needed in the circumstances."
On a positive note for Delphi, executives said they expected revenue to grow in the first quarter because G.M. planned to increase production after its interest-free financing deals reduced inventory. If sales do increase, it would be the first quarter of revenue growth for Delphi in a year and a half. Shares of Delphi were unchanged at $13 today.

HEADLINE: GROUND ZERO: THE BUSINESSES; 
Facing a Door He Can't Open

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Seth Pehr knows he was lucky that he did not lose his life in the disaster at the World Trade Center, where he worked as a locksmith for 26 years. But he lost a lot of other things.
 He lost some of his friends. He lost most of his customers. He lost all of his business. He lost a piece of hard-fought family history. 
 And now, four months later, he is losing his faith that any government agency or private charity is ever going to give him much help. Because even after making countless phone calls and filling out countless forms and asking for aid for the first time in his life, Mr. Pehr has got just $4,100 in official assistance (plus a used laptop computer and some telephone calling cards). 
"Basically, I've just been told, 'No, no, no, no, no," ' Mr. Pehr said, describing himself as humiliated and demoralized. 
And he is not unique. Meyer Feig, who had a five-man computer consulting and staffing concern in the trade center, said he had been organized, aggressive, "really nudgey." Even so, he has got a less-than-whopping $11,000 in aid. And he hears similar stories from the dozen or so small businesses in the trade center that he is trying to organize into a tenants' association. 
Indeed, the tales of woe among small businesses in and around ground zero are so wrenching that lawyers who have been giving them free legal advice are now trying to help them create a group to make their voices heard, modeled on groups started by those who lost family members in the trade center attack.
"There's frustration that there seems to be so much money out there, but not a lot of it is reaching these people," said Kevin J. Curnin, a lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.
Despite everyone's good intentions, red tape, complicated and competing eligibility rules, the quirky nature of entrepreneurs and the deep shock still being suffered by people who witnessed the trade center collapse all seem to have stymied efforts to help the small-business people who need it most.
And increasingly, they resent it. "How can the Brooklyn Philharmonic be eligible for money and I'm not?" Mr. Pehr asked. "How can Broadway? How can travel agents?"
Business owners are confused by the number of agencies and organizations they must deal with and frustrated by the time it takes to get help, said Bernadette Nation, who runs the emergency response unit of the city's Business Assistance Program, which tries to guide business owners through the maze. People like Mr. Pehr, who were actually in the trade center, "are really caught between a rock and a brick," she said.
State officials concede that early efforts at assistance, which were heavily focused on loans, were not very successful. Borrowing money is not attractive to "people who have no idea what the future will be," said Kevin S. Corbett, chief operating officer of the Empire State Development Corporation. And while grant money has been limited because of state and city budget problems, he said, that should change in the next few weeks when $700 million of federal aid becomes available.
That could not happen soon enough for Mr. Pehr, whose life has been intertwined with the trade center since he was a small boy (he is now 45). More than 50 years ago, his father, Daniel Pehr, opened a locksmith shop on what used to be known as Radio Row -- and is now ground zero.
When the Port Authority took over that area to build the trade center, the senior Mr. Pehr got a promise that he would be relocated and then allow to reopen his shop inside the new buildings. And when, in 1971, he felt officials were not keeping their word, he mounted a one-man picket line at the corner of Dey and Church Streets. He got his space in the trade center.
Though he studied psychobiology at New York University, the younger Mr. Pehr loved being a locksmith, especially at the trade center. People would come in needing keys to foreign-made locks, or bring in century-old locks to be repaired. If, say, a person lost the key to a 60-year-old outboard motor, Mr. Pehr could make a replacement without knowing anything more than the serial number. The Pehrs did engraving, and cut keys for many of the 100,000 people who came through the complex every day.
On Sept. 11, Mr. Pehr was inside the trade center, on his way to his shop, when the first plane hit. He ran and grabbed his keys and went to help in the search and rescue, he said. But then the second plane hit, and a Port Authority official he knew told him that it was too dangerous and he should leave. "He didn't take his own advice," Mr. Pehr said. "He was killed helping others."
About a month after the disaster, Mr. Pehr and his wife, Fran, who keeps the books, were able to get back into the shop, briefly. All the money he left in the cash drawer was missing, and so were some tools. They grabbed what they could in what Mr. Pehr describes as "a cross between 'Supermarket Sweepstakes' and 'Survivor.' "
Mr. Pehr is doing some occasional work for old clients like the Port Authority, but to reopen his business will cost about a quarter of a million dollars, which is about equal to his shop's annual revenue, Mr. Pehr said. He recently got $25,000 from his insurance company, and hopes eventually to get about $75,000 more, though he cannot seem to make himself sit down and try to list all the inventory the business had accumulated in its 54 years.
Friends and colleagues from around the world have also donated about $4,000 to the Pehrs. Mr. Pehr is particularly grateful to the software company Intuit, which gave him $1,000 to get his business back up and running, based simply on the fact that he was a customer with a trade center ZIP code. And he got $3,100 from Empire State Development and $1,000 from the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce, he said.
But meeting the requirements of other grant programs has been more difficult. Once Mr. Pehr spent days filling out a grant application, only to discover that the program he was applying for did not cover retail businesses. Another group rejected his application because, since his premises were destroyed, he is no longer a downtown businessman.
Charities told him he was not eligible for help because he had not been killed or injured, or were open only to city workers. He got unemployment benefits for a short while, but they stopped after he told officials that he was trying to rebuild his business rather than looking for a job.
Mr. Pehr has hopes of a $25,000 grant from a group called Seedco, but worried about the strings that are attached. He would have to reopen his business downtown, and while emotionally he seems to want to do it, practically he fears there will not be enough foot traffic to keep his business afloat.
"I want to come back, O.K.?" he said. "But right now, it's not prudent for me to do it. I'm in a depressed economy, with 85 percent of my customer base lost or relocated. And with a minimum of double the rent. Why would I open up back there again?"

HEADLINE: GROUND ZERO: THE SITE; 
Contractors at Ground Zero Denied Insurance for Cleanup

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
By everyone's account, the contracting companies excavating the tons of broken steel and smoking debris at ground zero have worked with energy and devotion. But there is one thing they have worked without -- insurance.
 In one of the quiet subplots of the cleanup, the giant contractors that run the cranes and trucks and work crews at the World Trade Center site have been denied the basic liability coverage against injury and property damage that builders typically carry on every project, even on a single-family house. 
 Insurance companies, it turns out, have simply declined to provide the extensive coverage needed, believing that the cleanup project is too big and the risk too hard to measure. The companies, while providing one tiny policy, have also denied the city the broad insurance it sought to protect itself against potential lawsuits from people who believe they were sickened or injured by the mess at ground zero in Lower Manhattan. 
And so for four months, a work site that has been called the most dangerous in the nation has been worked, quite incongruously, with virtually no insurance protection and thus some anxiously crossed fingers.
Even efforts by Aon Corporation and Marsh & McLennan, the two large insurance brokers whose offices were devastated by the attack, have failed to find insurance companies willing to provide coverage to the contractors and the city.
Now, the building contractors, after more than 120 days of round-the-clock work without a fatality, have turned to Congress to provide them with the coverage that the insurance industry has balked at. The contractors, who say that they will be making only meager profits, are worried that they will be pushed into bankruptcy by a wave of lawsuits expected over the asbestos, mercury and other toxic agents released into the air by the Sept. 11 terrorist attack and the subsequent excavation and cleanup.
"It's crazy: you're doing heroic work and in the end you might be putting yourself out of business," said John Cavanagh, vice chairman of AMEC Construction Management Services, one of the four main contractors at the site. "We're concerned that for any future emergency, when someone tries to be the good Samaritan and then realizes that I'm going to put myself out of business, you're going to have a hard time finding people to step in and help."
Two major insurance companies that were approached by the city and the contractors -- Liberty Mutual and American International Group -- would not comment about the inability to find coverage. Generally, builders need a new insurance policy for every sizable job. But officials with the city and the contractors said various insurers told them that the risks appeared too great and too hard to measure. Several insurers also said they were hobbled by the billions of dollars they are already paying out in compensation for the destruction of the trade center.
"I can't blame business for acting in a businesslike way," said Lawrence Martin, special insurance counsel for the New York City Law Department. "I can't force them to step up. But the city and the contractors need someone to step up."
The four main contractors at ground zero -- Bovis, Tully, Turner and AMEC -- each expect to earn a few million dollars in profit for their labor. But those contractors and the city fear that plaintiffs looking for defendants with deep pockets will look to them because Congress has already passed legislation limiting Sept. 11-related liability for New York State, the airlines, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Larry Silverstein, the new leaseholder for the trade center.
"This could be economically devastating to companies whose response to this terrorist attack has been heroic," said Kenneth Holden, New York City's commissioner of design and construction and the official in charge of the cleanup.
Executives with the contractors said they normally would never undertake a project, especially a $1 billion job like the World Trade Center cleanup, without basic liability coverage. They fear that lawsuits from nearby companies will claim that the cleanup damaged their buildings -- perhaps by eroding a building foundation. They also fear that city residents may sue, claiming that the cleanup, the cranes and the trucks stirred asbestos and other debris that polluted the air and caused health problems. While workers at the site have workers' compensation and health insurance to cover injuries, they still could sue companies other than their employers over issues like asbestos poisoning.
The contractors said they plunged into the rescue and recovery efforts just hours after the terrorist attack, even though they did not have insurance coverage. At the time, the city told them it was confident it would eventually obtain an umbrella insurance policy covering all of them.
"There's really just one reason why these contractors are down there -- patriotically it's the right thing to do," said Steven Charney, general counsel for the Building Trades Employers Association of New York. 
At the moment, the city and the contractors, together, have about $75 million in general liability coverage, which they say may cover basic accidents, but not a flood of lawsuits over asbestos pollution. And that $75 million is less than a fifth of what builders have for a typical, far smaller building project in Manhattan. They say that a project on the order of the ground zero cleanup should have at least $2 billion in insurance.
The city has asked Aon, Marsh & McLennan and another broker, Willis, to scour the world for insurers for coverage. A few insurers proposed a policy that would last two or three years, but the contractors and city called that woefully inadequate, saying they feared that people would sue for asbestos poisoning and other problems 10 and 20 years from now.
Executives from the four main contractors and from the 200 subcontractors at ground zero say they fear that the potential liability could prevent them from moving ahead on other building projects across they nation. They say the huge financial risks they have assumed in the cleanup will make it hard for them to get bonded for other construction projects because real estate developers might view their balance sheets as too risky.
Representative John E. Sweeney, a Republican from upstate New York, said the New York delegation was pressing Congress to indemnify the city and the contractors for any lawsuits stemming from the cleanup. 
"Contractors throughout the state and city have really answered the call, donating equipment, personnel and expertise," he said. "Unless we fashion a way to provide liability protection to these contractors, we're committing a wrong."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE POWER COUPLE; 
Senate Bill Showed Complexities Of Power Couple's Ties to Enron

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Wendy and Phil Gramm, one of the capital's power couples, would seem to have been some of Enron's more reliable supporters in Washington.
 Senator Gramm, Republican of Texas, espouses a free-market philosophy that meshed nicely with views and political interests of Enron, one of his state's biggest employers and a generous campaign contributor. Dr. Gramm, the former chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is a member of the company's board of directors. 
 But in the latter months of 2000, both Gramms were frustrating the company's Washington lobbyists. Senator Gramm, for reasons unrelated to Enron, was single-handedly blocking a futures trading bill the company had dearly prized. And Dr. Gramm had complicated the bill's prospects with a scathing critique of some rules being prepared by her former agency. 
The issue was eventually resolved in the company's favor; Senator Gramm lifted his objections to the bill after calls from Clinton administration officials and industry executives, including Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chief executive, according to company officials and people involved in the bill. Once the bill became law the rules that Dr. Gramm opposed became unnecessary and were dropped.
The Gramms' dealings on the issue -- how to regulate complicated financial instruments, including the energy trades on which the company was building its business -- illustrate the complicated crosscurrents of Enron's powerful friendships in the capital, where it cultivated influential Republicans and Democrats.
Dr. Gramm, who left government in 1993, was chosen for the Enron board shortly after the commodities commission approved rules that she helped design that exempted energy trades from government regulation. The exemption was vital to Enron because energy trading was at the heart of the company's burgeoning commodities trading business and the company did not want obstacles from Washington.
After Dr. Gramm joined its board as a paid adviser, Enron officials said they were reluctant to approach Phil Gramm for favors.
But the company appears to have overcome that inhibition in late 2000, when a bill containing a provision that would turn the commission rules into law was stalled in the Congress by Senator Gramm. (Senate rules allow any member to put a "hold" on legislation, effectively killing it.)
Larry Neal, Mr. Gramm's press secretary, said there was nothing untoward in the senator's decision to release the bill in 2000. Senator Gramm, he said, acted after the Treasury Department addressed his concerns, which involved banking matters. The senator's backing of the bill had nothing to do with helping Enron, Mr. Neal said. The bill then cleared Congress and became law.
Mr. Gramm did not "recall a conversation with Ken Lay," Mr. Neal said. "It seems likely that he was among a large number of C.E.O.'s and heads of government agencies who pleaded with us to remove our hold" on the bill, the press secretary added. A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, had no comment on the company's lobbying.
Dr. Gramm said she never discussed the issue with her husband while he was dealing with the bill that contained that exemption, an obscure provision sought by Enron and other energy trading companies.
"We have more important things to talk about than work or issues -- like our children and Aggie football," she said in a statement replying to questions.
Dr. Gramm, who holds a Ph.D. in economics, now heads a regulatory studies center at George Mason University, which has been in the forefront of the push for deregulation in Washington. Enron has been one of the center's many financial supporters. As a government official and as a scholar, Dr. Gramm has also championed deregulation.
She said in her statement that "my views are my own and the organizations on whose board I serve, or where I work, for that matter, recognize that."
Even so, she raised hackles among some Enron officials and other supporters of the bill when she offered her views of futures trading regulation (but not the energy exemption) being prepared by the commodities commission in August 2000. The agency's rules largely mirrored the efforts in Congress. So her critique -- that they were not sufficiently deregulatory -- seemed to pose another obstacle for Enron and other supporters of the bill, lobbyists said.
Some of them raised their concerns directly with Dr. Gramm, the officials said. Dr. Gramm said she remembered some of the disagreement, but thought she managed to "avoid conflicts by expressing independent views while fulfilling her responsibilities to the different organizations I am involved with."
She sold all her Enron stock in 1998. Since then she has put her deferred compensation from the company into a mutual fund. It was worth $250,000 to $500,000 at the end of 2000, one of her biggest assets.
The Gramms keep some of their assets separate, financial records show. And their views as well, according to Dr. Gramm.
"My husband has his own views, and his views are not necessarily mine, and conversely so," she said.
Mr. Neal said today that Mr. Gramm would decide whether and how to participate in an Enron inquiry by the Banking Committee, where he is now the ranking Republican.
An Enron official recalled the appearance problem created for the company in Washington when Dr. Gramm joined the board in 1993.
"Because of the perception created by Wendy Gramm being on the board there was discussion in the company about trying not to put Senator Gramm in a position to make it look like he was doing anything for the company," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Enron and its officials have contributed $97,350 to Mr. Gramm's political campaigns since 1989, a little less than they gave to the other Republican senator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison. 
The commodity commission's energy exemption in 1993 became more important to Enron after 1999, when it opened Enron Online, an Internet-based trading platform. Enron, and other companies, wanted the trading exemption put in a law, which would provide more legal certainty to their operations than a regulatory rule.
At the same time, the Clinton administration and Congress were working on a plan to update the statutes governing the commission to take account of developments in the financial markets, especially involving futures, options and over-the-counter financial derivatives.
The broader legislative effort went forward in the House with wide support, though the energy exemption prompted some concerns.
William J. Rainier, the commission chairman, told House members in September 2000 that he was "deeply concerned" about exempting energy trades from regulation because those dealers had no one else regulating them, whereas dealers in financial derivatives -- which were also freed of commission regulation by the bill -- were still subject to other "federal financial regulation."
But a few weeks later, when the House passed the bill, the Clinton administration voiced no concerns about the energy exemption.
On. Sept. 14, 2000, before the House vote, Mr. Lay wrote to important House members, including Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, urging enactment of the bill. Mr. Lay's letter told lawmakers that "this important legislation provides critical legal certainty for a range of transactions that are a central part of Enron's risk management and commodity trading business."
Enron's interest was twofold, officials said. One was ensuring regulatory freedom for Enron Online, a so-called bilateral platform, in which Enron was the other party at the end of every transaction. Enron also wanted minimal oversight over another trading form that could become part of its future business, multilateral platforms, where many parties traded. In the end, the bill totally exempted bilateral platforms and partially exempted multilateral platforms, a compromise Mr. Lay supported in his letter.
Meanwhile, on a parallel track, the commission was proposing its own rules for modernizing regulation of complex financial products. The rules were abandoned once the law passed, but the bill's fate was still uncertain in August 2000 when Dr. Gramm sent in her comments.
They included a report card for the commission's new regulatory framework: one A, one B, two D's and three F's. Supporters of the legislation, including officials at Enron, felt Dr. Gramm's comments were not helpful, but the effort in the House was moving forward and the overall bill, including the energy exemption, easily passed.
But in the Senate, the bill faced a formidable roadblock in Mr. Gramm. The Banking Committee, of which Mr. Gramm was chairman, was one of the panels with jurisdiction over the bill, but the Agriculture Committee handled the section containing the energy exemption. When Congress went into recess in October for the elections, the bill's supporters thought it was dead.
"Gramm's hold was everything," said one person involved in drafting the bill.
Mr. Neal, Mr. Gramm's press secretary, said, "Senator Gramm held the bill from September through Dec. 13, when an agreement with Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was reached on the banking issues" that had prompted the hold. One of Mr. Gramm's concerns was a clear line of jurisdiction between bank regulators and the commission over financial products that could be developed by banks and other financial institutions.
As for the energy provision, Senator Gramm "did not write, negotiate or modify" it, Mr. Neal said. On the question of Mr. Lay's concerns about the bill, Mr. Neal said Senator Gramm was aware of Mr. Lay's letter to Mr. Hastert.
On Dec. 21, President Bill Clinton signed his last bill, an omnibus spending measure, which contained the futures bill and its exemption for energy trading.

HEADLINE: Lloyd's of London Weighs a New Path to Profitability 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Four months after suffering heavy losses in the terrorist attacks in the United States, Lloyd's of London, one of the oldest and best-known names in insurance, proposed sweeping changes yesterday intended to make itself more competitive.
 Without referring to the attacks, which cost it $:1.9 billion ($2.7 billion), more than any other insurer, Lloyd's said it hoped to adopt modern accounting procedures and to phase out its more than 2,000 individual investors, or names, as they are called, in favor of corporate investors, which now provide the bulk of the organization's capital. 
 "Our aims are profitability, modernity and transparency," said Sax Riley, the chairman of Lloyd's. Lloyd's investors will be asked to approve the changes in a vote expected to be taken late this year.
The announcement came as state insurance regulators called industry experts together in Washington to encourage Congress to provide a federal backstop for the industry against losses from any further terrorist attacks. 
The attacks shook the industry, with losses estimated at about $50 billion. Prices have soared as the industry has tried to recover. The insurers have also cut back sharply on coverage.
The insurers told Congress after the attacks that they could not provide coverage against terrorism because the risk was so unpredictable and potentially costly. And along with big property owners and bankers, they warned that a lack of terrorism insurance would bring a halt to lending and construction. 
But Congress, mired in a variety of proposals, adjourned in late December without taking action.
The predicted crisis has not developed, and many regulators and insurers fear that Congress is losing interest.
The Bush administration, an early supporter of the insurers, still favors assisting them. In a conference call with dozens of industry executives on Jan. 7, White House officials asked for evidence of specific economic disruptions that could be presented to Congress.
At the hearing yesterday, Chris Treanor, an executive of Marsh Inc., the largest insurance broker, said that price increases for property insurance for major corporate customers had been averaging 70 percent to 80 percent across the country with some corporations paying as much as four times what they did last year. He said that while some coverage against terrorism was available, most major corporations were unable to get full coverage.
As a counterpoint to the proposals that have been presented to Congress so far, E. W. Blanch Jr., the former chief executive of a commercial insurance brokerage firm founded by his father and now known as Benfield Blanch, suggested that state regulators help create a pool of perhaps $25 billion to $50 billion in private money to demonstrate industry commitment. 
The privately financed pool would immediately begin writing coverage for terrorism, Mr. Blanch said, with the hope that Congress would agree to take responsibility for losses that exceeded the fund's capital. 
The proposal contrasted with earlier ones in that it would be run by a consortium of the states and private industry, rather than by a newly created federal insurance mechanism, which Congress has resisted. And it would make insurers and investors responsible for much greater losses than other plans.
The industry and the Bush administration had proposed that insurers take responsibility for the first $10 billion in losses, and several senators voiced support for that concept.
The industry has been critical of a House-approved bill that provides for federal loans to help the insurers pay terrorism losses.
John W. Oxendine, the insurance commissioner of Georgia, who called the hearing, and some other state regulators said they thought Mr. Blanch's plan might form a framework that could gain support in Congress.
"It's a starting point," Mr. Oxendine said in an interview during a break in the hearing. "I think the people in Congress are good, intelligent people. But they're not used to dealing with insurance. Maybe we need to put something together and wrap it up in a package and present it to them."
Late last year, at the recommendation of Mr. Oxendine, the organization of state regulators ordered an investigation by the Arthur Andersen accounting firm into Lloyd's finances. Earlier, the regulators had permitted Lloyd's to put a reduced amount into a fund intended to guarantee the payment of the British insurance organization's World Trade Center claims.
The insurer insisted that it would have no trouble in covering its claims. Investors, including several American insurance companies, have been increasing their stakes in Lloyd's, which Lloyd's executives interpret as a show of confidence.

HEADLINE: A New Oil Game, With New Winners 

BYLINE:  By Richard Butler; Richard Butler is diplomat in residence at the Council on Foreign Relations and has recently published "Fatal Choice: Nuclear Weapons and the Illusion of Missile Defense."

 BODY:
In "The Great Game," published just as the Cold War ended, Peter Hopkirk chronicled the struggle, throughout the 19th century and into the 20th, between Britain and Russia for influence, control and profit in Central Asia. The jewel in the crown was the Indian subcontinent; but the pathway to it ran through Afghanistan. Now the prize is oil -- getting it and transporting it -- and Afghanistan is again contested territory. The difference is that, this time around, it is the United States that will be playing the game with Russia.
 When the Soviet Union collapsed, it lost its southern provinces -- Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan. These states have oil and gas deposits that, taken together, are thought to be equal to the remaining reserves of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, America's two leading Middle Eastern suppliers of oil. 
 The main feature of post-Soviet transition was the immediate establishment of oligarchies and criminality. When Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency two years ago, he moved quickly to break up the oligarchies and political fiefdoms within Russia.
Crucially, he also addressed the other deep loss felt by ordinary Russians -- that of their seat at the top table as an equal with the United States. Mr. Putin courted the Germans and the French. He signed a friendship pact with China. But just as important, if less spectacular, was his decision to market Russian oil outside the dictates of the Arab-dominated Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Sept. 11 was a godsend to Mr. Putin. By deciding to join the United States in the war on terror, he could achieve at least two major objectives: Russia returned to the top table with the United States; and American criticism of Russian actions in Chechnya evaporated.
But again, in some ways oil politics may prove to be the most important field for Russia's evolving relationship with the West. Russia's independent oil-pricing policies have succeeded in stabilizing the Russian economy over the past two years. Oil prices generally have been high, and Russian growth in 2000 hit about 8 percent. For 2001 it may come down to less than 5 percent. But these are still the first two years of real growth in decades, and much of it is owed to oil production and export.
At the same time, Russia under Mr. Putin has at last learned to negotiate credibly and responsibly with American oil companies -- and to work with its former southern provinces in a way that is respectful and productive. One result of this evolution is the 980-mile pipeline from Kazakhstan's Caspian Sea oil fields across Kazakh and Russian territory to the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, which opened late last year. It was pushed hard politically by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, and construction began in 1999. But Mr. Putin has kept the project going against significant resistance by local politicians.
The pipeline is the largest single American investment in the region. The pipeline's partners include Russia, Kazakhstan and several oil companies; its main client is Tengizchevroil, half of which is owned by Chevron and a quarter by Exxon-Mobil, with Russian and Kazakh partners. Kazakhstan's economy is itself expected to have grown last year by nearly 13 percent, mainly because of the oil industry.
In short, Mr. Putin seems to have found a way to make oil and politics mix rather well. Oil prices are expected to continue downward for a while, but the long-term picture remains clear: the Central Asian oilfields will be exploited, and Russia will have a large share in the profits. American oil companies will be heavily involved. The question now is whether the United States can turn this to American advantage.
The war in Afghanistan is most relevant in two respects. First, it has made the construction of a pipeline across Afghanistan and Pakistan politically possible for the first time since Unocal and the Argentinian company Bridas competed for the Afghan rights in the mid-1990's.
Second, the war has led many Americans to feel that Saudi Arabia is not the best of allies. The Saudi regime -- undemocratic, an exporter of fundamentalism that is also hated by some of its own fundmentalists, like Osama bin Laden -- is important to the West because of its oil. Accordingly, to lessen Western dependence on Saudi (not to mention Iraqi) oil can only be to the good. The route to greater independence may well lead through Afghanistan.
This is not necessarily the Great Game, Part 2. The incentives for American cooperation with Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and the other regional powers far outweigh the incentives for confrontation. A great deal of 20th century Mideast conflict can be explained by American-Soviet rivalry -- another great game that brought much misery. There is no need to repeat that in Central Asia and every reason not to. To move away from gamesmanship and toward cooperation, Russia might begin by reconsidering its close relations with its regional customers, Saddam Hussein and the Iranian military. And the United States should use great discretion in establishing its bases in Central Asian nations like Kyrgyzstan. Better to build more joint pipelines and fewer military bases.

HEADLINE: A.F.L.-C.I.O. to Invest $750 Million to Promote Development 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Eager to help New York City after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. yesterday announced a program in which unions would invest $750 million of their pension funds for housing and commercial development.
 John J. Sweeney, the federation's president, joined Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in Manhattan to announce the investment fund, which is expected to finance 5,000 housing units for low-income and middle-income families. 
 "After the devastation of Sept. 11, we want to do something tangible for the economic recovery by putting workers' pension dollars to work for this great city," Mr. Sweeney said. 
Part of the money will be used for mortgages for moderate-income union members, and part will be used for equity investments in housing and commercial buildings. Union officials are working to develop a no-down-payment mortgage plan for firefighters, police officers and other moderate-income union members seeking to buy housing. 
The investments will meet two of labor's primary concerns, creating unionized construction jobs at a time the city's economy has stumbled, and providing housing affordable to moderate-income families of union members.
Mr. Bloomberg praised the program, saying: "In the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, labor's pension fund investment helped New York through some of its darkest hours. Today, with the city facing financial hardship once again, our friends in the house of labor have come through."
Mr. Bloomberg appeared alongside Mr. Sweeney at the new headquarters of the New York City Central Labor Council, the umbrella organization representing more than one million union members. They joined Brian M. McLaughlin, the labor council's president, for a ribbon cutting at the new headquarters, at 31 West 15th Street.
Mr. Bloomberg, who has reached out repeatedly to labor in his two weeks as mayor, received a warm reception from the 100 union leaders who attended the news conference.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall surprised the audience by announcing that the state would invest $100 million in union pension funds to help rebuild the city. Labor leaders said they hoped individual unions would pledge additional pension money to the rebuilding efforts, so that the fund could top $1 billion.
The $750 million will come from the labor federation's Housing Investment Trust and its Building Investment Trust.
Stephen F. Coyle, chief executive of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s housing and building trusts, said the $750 million could produce more than $2 billion in construction when coupled with loans and investments from other investors.
Seeking to reassure retired workers, labor leaders said the money would earn a solid return for the pension funds.
Under the federation's effort, $250 million will be used to build or rehabilitate rental housing in New York, with an emphasis on Manhattan north of 96th Street and the other four boroughs.
Another $250 million will be directed to commercial real estate opportunities, and another $250 million will go to mortgage loans for municipal employees and other union members. 
"This initiative is a double win for New York City," Mr. Bloomberg said. "Not only does it provide crucial post-Sept. 11 investment, but it will also build much-needed affordable housing."
The labor fund recently agreed to finance a 259-unit housing project at 37th Street and Ninth Avenue.

HEADLINE: The Damaged Spirit of the Sept. 11 Fund 

BYLINE:  By Fred Price and Mitch Kleinman; Fred Price is the chief operating officer of Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Mitch Kleinman is general counsel of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Both companies are financial firms.

 BODY:
When World Trade Center families and others agreed to express their concerns together last night at an armory on Park Avenue, they were motivated by a deadline. Only days remain to submit comments on the proposed rules and regulations of the fund set up by the federal government to compensate those whose lives and livelihoods were devastated on Sept. 11. The rules are flawed, and we urge the White House, the Justice Department and Congress to act now to change them. 
 On Sept. 11, 133 of our employees woke up and went to work, never to return home. Each of our companies was located in Two World Trade Center -- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods on the 88th and 89th floors and Sandler O'Neill on the 104th floor. Our firms were among a group of companies with offices in the World Trade Center whose rosters of employees read like a Who's Who of the financial sector of the economy. They were exactly the kind of people Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda wanted to target. Their families are now dealing with both grief and enormous financial challenges. 
 Congress quickly passed laws intended to protect the airline industry and limit the liability of other potential defendants while giving the victims' families proper compensation for their losses. The intent was to eliminate the need for costly, uncertain and time-consuming lawsuits. But the rules and regulations announced on Dec. 20 by Kenneth Feinberg, special master in the case, not only are unfair, but directly conflict with that intent. They do not present an adequate alternative to litigation.
To calculate the compensation awards, Mr. Feinberg uses national economic statistics and data derived from the public sector, while most victims worked in the private sector and in the high cost-of-living regions of New York and Washington. Many victims were in their 20's and 30's, in the early stages of promising careers, and their potential is not adequately taken into account. Also, the rules essentially create a ceiling on the awards available to many families, assuming they have other resources. Economic loss, not need, should be the determinant of compensation. And the regulations deduct certain benefits, like life insurance and pensions, from compensation awards. Such limitations on awards have never been found in our American legal system.
The proposed rules turn the Congressional legislation on its head, unbalancing it by reducing likely awards to levels far below the economic losses suffered by victims and their families while protecting airlines and others that might be sued.
The decision to file a claim requires a family to make a leap of faith and place its trust in Mr. Feinberg. By submitting a claim, families are waiving their right to litigation. They have no appeal if the system does not treat them fairly.
As representatives of companies directly and tragically affected by the terrorist attacks, we are proud and grateful for the sympathetic and concerned response to the victims from the White House, Congress and elected officials at all levels, both at home and abroad. However, we are deeply concerned that the implementation of the Victims Compensation Fund is entirely inconsistent with this response.

HEADLINE: City to Appeal Court Order Over Homeless at Church 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
The city has decided to appeal a recent federal court decision, which allowed homeless people to sleep on the steps of a Manhattan church, after failing to negotiate a settlement, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday. 
 The move comes as Mr. Bloomberg has emphasized that making the city's shelters safer and minimizing litigation are priorities of his administration. 
 "It is the city's position that letting people sleep outside, even on the steps, is just not a humane thing to do," Mr. Bloomberg said. "That does not qualify or should not qualify as a shelter and we will try to convince the court to that effect." 
The mayor made the statement after an event announcing a new program by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to build housing in the city for low-income and middle-income families. 
The conflict arose in the final weeks of the administration of Rudolph W. Giuliani as police officers rousted homeless people from the steps of Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church and adjacent land several times, which prompted a lawsuit by the church in the middle of December. 
Judge Lawrence M. McKenna of Federal District Court in Manhattan issued a temporary restraining order on Dec. 20 barring the ejections, and then ruled on Jan. 4 that the homeless could sleep on the steps, but not on the sidewalk next to the church. 
Yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg said that the administration agreed with the court's ruling allowing the police to remove the homeless from the sidewalk, but added, "We don't think that people on the steps of the church, however, are getting the kind of protection and services that society should be providing." 
Christopher Dunn, a senior lawyer at the New York Civil Liberties Union who is representing the church, said that the parties had reached an agreement last week, but that the city had backed away from it. Michael A. Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel, disputed that assertion, saying, "We had discussions but we could not reach an agreement." 
In addition, leaders of the church plan to meet today to decide whether they should appeal the judge's ruling permitting the police to arrest homeless people on the sidewalk, said Jonathan R. Nelson, another lawyer representing the church. 
Still, the church's senior pastor, the Rev. Dr. Thomas K. Tewell, said he was disappointed and surprised, because he thought the negotiations with the city had been going well. He said that he had had several conversations with the mayor and his advisers about the situation, but that he had not heard from the mayor since the mayor called to inform him of the ruling on Jan. 4. 
"We still take the position that we have our First Amendment rights to continue our ministry" -- which, the pastor noted, the court affirmed -- "and we want to continue our ministry on our property." He added that he was not in favor of people being permanently on the streets. "We're going to continue our work with the homeless," he said. "It's a lot more than the 10 or 11 people on our steps." 
Mr. Dunn said that he was surprised by the city's decision to appeal, "given the mayor's statements about concern for the homeless, that the city's policy now is to pursue its rights through an appeal to arrest the homeless who are sleeping on the steps." 
Mr. Bloomberg also expressed concern yesterday that the number of people on welfare had increased toward the end of last year, which he said was linked to the overall softening of the national economy.
"A lot of people are losing their jobs," he said. "So the first thing is, how do you get jobs to come to the city so people can take care of themselves." 
The mayor added that if they could not, "we are, as a compassionate society, I think, obliged to help people. And we want to do that in the most humane way, but we also want to do it in the most economic way."

HEADLINE: GROUND ZERO: COMPENSATION; 
Families of Victims Rally for Higher Federal Awards

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH 

 BODY:
In the first major rally held to protest the proposed rules for compensating relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, more than 500 relatives crowded into the Park Avenue Armory last night to show their support for more generous compensation.
 Several city and state officials spoke at the rally, including Gov. George E. Pataki, who told relatives that he shared their outrage at what he called the limited scope of the compensation plan. 
 Reading from a petition that was being circulated at the rally, Marian Fontana, the wife of a firefighter who died in the attack on the World Trade Center, said, "The regulations as written are a betrayal and double-victimization of our families." 
Anthony Gardner, the chairman of the World Trade Center United Family Group, said, "The misinformation on this compensation program is staggering." He said it was contributing to a public sense that the families are asking for too much.
The speakers addressed family members while police officers, firefighters and others listened.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spoke briefly, offering his sympathy and saying that his administration would submit comments on the regulations next week. The monthlong comment period on the federal guidelines ends on Tuesday.
A number of other elected officials have also echoed the families' calls for higher caps on lost earnings and larger awards for noneconomic losses like pain and suffering. They have also criticized the legislation that created the fund, which states that benefits like life insurance should be deducted from the awards.
Yesterday, four Democratic senators -- Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, both of New York; Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont; and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts -- urged Kenneth R. Feinberg, who is overseeing the federal compensation fund, not to limit noneconomic damages to the amounts outlined in his formula. They also called for changes in the calculation of economic losses and argued that families should not be required to show "extraordinary circumstances" to win higher awards, as the draft regulations require. 
But another point of view seems to have emerged in comments submitted to Mr. Feinberg and posted on the fund's Web site. "I am very bothered by what I perceive as greedy people when it comes to the distribution of funds to the victims of Sept. 11," one person wrote. "I am sick to death of hearing about these poor souls," wrote another. "What about the victims of Oklahoma City, the U.S.S. Cole and the embassies in Africa?" wrote a third.
In interviews and in meetings with families, lawyers and other groups, Mr. Feinberg has already promised that every eligible family will get something from the fund, even if Congressionally required deductions for life insurance and other death benefits would otherwise reduce the family's award to zero. He has also said that there will be no cap on fund awards and that high-income families can seek awards higher than those shown in calculations that accompanied the draft regulations.
But he has so far refused to budge on the controversial formula for calculating noneconomic losses, like pain and suffering. The draft regulations -- which Mr. Feinberg said were worked out in negotiations with the Justice Department, the Office of Management and Budget and the White House -- provide $250,000 for each victim, plus an additional $50,000 for a surviving spouse and for each surviving dependent.
Mr. Feinberg does not have the power to change the provision deducting benefits from the victim awards, which is part of the legislation passed by Congress in September to create the victims' fund.
The speakers at last night's rally also included John Ward, one of several academic economists who reviewed the formulas used to determine the plan's compensation. He said the economists had agreed that the rules were "inappropriate in most cases, incorrect in several areas, and fundamentally unfair to potential claimants."
Mr. Ward said the rules rely on two-decades-old federal data that underestimates the earnings of women and minority members.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DIPLOMACY; 
In Shattered Kabul, Powell Vows Long-Term Support for Afghans

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM and MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
In a whirlwind visit to this war-ravaged capital, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell announced today that the United States had restored its crumbling, long-shuttered embassy to full diplomatic status, and he assured Afghanistan's interim leader, "We will be with you in this current crisis and for the future."
 Under heavy security, Secretary Powell swept into Kabul from the nearby Bagram air base this morning in a low-flying Army Chinook helicopter with machine gunners at front and rear, becoming not only the most senior American official to arrive here since the fall of the Taliban government but also the first secretary of state to visit since Henry A. Kissinger in 1976. 
 "We are committed to doing everything we can to assist you in this time of transition to a new Afghanistan, an Afghanistan where people will be able to live in peace and security," Secretary Powell told the country's interim leader, Hamid Karzai, as the two men prepared to meet again this weekend in Tokyo at an international conference on rebuilding the Afghan economy.
But in one tiny sign of the terrible challenges Afghans face, television lights failed just as a news conference with the two men was beginning in the onetime Afghan royal palace where Mr. Karzai has his office. "They did it deliberately to show that we need help," Mr. Karzai declared, to laughter. 
During Secretary Powell's six hours here, he caught far grimmer glimpses of a shattered land, where some 270,000 Afghan civil servants are without pay, armed men still roam the main roads, and a faded color photograph of former Secretary of State George P. Shultz still hangs frozen in time in the United States Embassy, which was evacuated in 1989 as the Soviet withdrawal left the country in chaos. The embassy reopened last month.
Mr. Karzai, struggling to impose order in the face of rival warlords and skepticism about his six-month interim administration, greeted Secretary Powell effusively as "a distinguished world personality, a very top soldier and top diplomat, and an excellent human being."
But he also gently reminded Secretary Powell that many Afghans wondered whether Washington would abandon the country again once the hunt for the Taliban and Al Qaeda leadership was over.
"In all our meetings with the Afghan people, they ask us -- 'Is the United States committed? Will they stay with us?' " said Mr. Karzai, who wore a bright green robe and a Persian lamb hat. "Now I can tell them, 'Yes, the U.S. will stay with us.' "
For his part, Secretary Powell promised that the United States would make "a significant contribution" to the estimated $15 billion cost over 10 years of rebuilding Afghan infrastructure and institutions from education to health care, and would continue the hunt for Al Qaeda and Taliban elements.
"We don't want to leave any contamination behind," Secretary Powell said. "That is in the interests of the Afghan people and certainly the mission we came here to perform."
But with the United States having borne the $90 million monthly cost of conducting the war, Secretary Powell also once more made it clear that the Bush administration expected other nations to contribute the bulk of the reconstruction costs as well as the troops needed for peacekeeping operations. The United States is expected to pledge about $250 million at Tokyo toward the first year of reconstruction, aid officials in Washington said today.
"Ultimate security will come from the creation of an Afghan national army committed to the new Afghanistan, and the creation of police units that are also committed to the new Afghanistan," Secretary Powell said. "That is the area that we really have to focus our attention, training Afghans to take care of themselves and not depending on foreign forces to do so."
A spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry, Omar Samad, said the interim government was encouraged that Secretary Powell promised to help speed payment of $20 million in start-up funds pledged by foreign donors.
"The Americans are pushing and trying to help in collecting the money for this fund," Mr. Samad said in an interview. Putting the United States on the trail of this money was a top goal of Afghan officials in meeting with Secretary Powell. Mr. Samad noted that the government's physical infrastructure -- offices, electricity, telephones -- was a shambles.
Ahmad Fawzi, the spokesman for the United Nations special envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, said that the United Nations was encouraged that Secretary Powell reaffirmed American support for the interim administration. But Mr. Fawzi noted that Secretary Powell did not attach a dollar figure to his words of encouragement.
"Reassurance is good," Mr. Fawzi said. "Cash is better."
A senior administration official said Secretary Powell had warned Mr. Karzai that lawmakers in Washington would demand assurances that money appropriated for Afghanistan would not go to waste.
In a brief but moving ceremony outside the American Embassy, Secretary Powell honored the cadre of loyal Afghan employees who had continued to help maintain the embassy complex and motor pool even after the embassy was closed nearly 13 years ago, often suffering severe punishment by Soviet or Taliban authorities. One of them, Gholam Sakhi Ahmadzai, 58, spent 10 years in a Soviet prison for having worked for the Americans, and today accepted a plaque from Secretary Powell on behalf of his colleagues.
"This is a very good beginning, and we hope that this will continue giving the interim government a little bit of power," said Mr. Ahmadzai, whose family of nine received his salary during his imprisonment.
The embassy's top-ranking officer, Ryan Crocker, the charge d'affaires, declared, "We're back in business and we're going to stay that way." But even now, embassy workers live in an underground bunker and share a single bathroom, and Mr. Crocker acknowledged, "We have a very long and challenging road ahead of us in the campaign against terror."
Later, in another sign that Afghans remain wary of Western ways, senior American officials said that wives of the local embassy employees had ultimately decided not to attend the ceremony out of lingering concerns about appearing in public, but a row of their smiling children greeted the American visitors.
Secretary Powell flew into Afghanistan on a C-17 Globemaster transport plane on his way from Pakistan to India on a mission to help defuse tensions in those countries' monthlong border standoff over a deadly attack on the Indian Parliament that India blamed on Pakistani extremist groups. The same type of plane was used last week to transport Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Today, it offered the secretary and his traveling party breathtaking glimpses of the Hindu Kush mountains.
Pentagon officials reported no significant military action in Afghanistan today. But on the flight out of the country, a pair of F-14 Tomcat fighter jets flew just off the wingtips of the secretary's plane in protective escort, and even a veteran military man like Secretary Powell could not resist an admiring gaze at the precision spectacle.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's visit to Afghanistan misstated the cost of conducting the war there. While estimates vary, the monthly cost to the United States has far exceeded $90 million.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE APPOINTEES; 
Several Administration Officials Held Enron Shares

BYLINE:  By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
While much has been made of the huge sums the Enron Corporation invested in the political campaigns of President Bush, some senior members of the Bush administration were also heavily invested in the company's stock.
 Neither President Bush nor Vice President Dick Cheney owned Enron stock when they took office. But at least 30 senior administration officials and ambassadors entered government service last year with personal holdings in Enron stock ranging from several thousand dollars to as much as $50 million, according to a comprehensive review of financial disclosure forms. 
 Many of those officials sold their shares before Enron collapsed, in most cases because they were required to do so under federal conflict of interest rules.
The mandated sales were made in the first months of 2001 while the stock was still trading at $60 to $70 a share; the timing helped at least 20 administration officials, including Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's political strategist, avoid losing tens of thousands of dollars. 
But a handful of administration officials who were not required to sell chose to hold their Enron shares through most of last year and presumably sold at a substantial loss after the stock price collapsed. 
A few officials still hold Enron shares, which last traded at 67 cents before the company's stock was dropped from the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
John S. Wolf, assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, lost approximately $50,000 on his Enron investment last year. Thomas E. White, who was vice chairman of Enron's energy services division, became secretary of the Army last summer owning $25 million to $50 million of Enron shares and another $25 million to $50 million of Enron stock options.
When he left Enron, Mr. White was paid $1 million and a $13 million "phantom stock award," which is a promise to pay a future bonus in appreciated stock or its cash equivalent. A Pentagon spokesman said he believed that Mr. White abided by his agreement with the Senate Armed Services Committee to sell all his Enron holdings within 90 days of joining the government.
The investment in Enron by top administration officials "shows just how close Enron and the Bush administration were," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington research group.
Mr. Lewis said that among the questions raised by these holdings were whether any administration officials had special knowledge that affected their Enron trading decisions or whether their Enron holdings posed any conflict of interest.
"I am not suggesting there is evidence of insider trading," he said. "But a healthy number of them owned Enron, and it is not an unreasonable question to ask how much they owned, when they sold it and why."
Paul C. Light, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research group, said, "The first question is whether any of these individuals who had a personal interest in Enron's success were involved in any policy making."
Mr. Rove sold 1,350 shares of Enron stock on June 7, after waiting several months for an opinion from the White House counsel's office on the ethics of his wide array of investments. The delay cost Mr. Rove money; had he sold his holdings when he joined the administration, he would have received a far higher price.
On Jan. 20, Enron stock traded at about $80 a share. On June 7, the share price closed at $55.
Mr. Rove declined to comment. But Anne Womack, a White House aide, said: "He had an account with a broker. He purchased stock through the account, just like anyone else who would buy stock. It was purchased over a number of years." She declined to say when Mr. Rove had bought his Enron shares or what he paid.
New appointees to any administration are required by federal law to file a financial disclosure statement, which is reviewed by executive branch lawyers, or Congress in the case of positions requiring confirmation. The date when the statement must be filed varies according to when the person is nominated.
Based on these statements, questions of potential conflicts of interest can be reviewed by the White House, the executive branch's Office of Government Ethics, specific agencies as well as by Congress, depending on the post.
"Concern about any stock or financial interests would be based on the work the nominee would be doing," said Thomas F. Zorn, chief of financial disclosure at the ethics office. "Whether this is a conflict would vary from agency to agency. Enron shares might be a problem at one agency, but not at another."
Some administration officials who were not required to sell held their Enron shares through most of 2001 and did not sell until the price dropped to less than $10 a share late last fall.
"I'm a victim," said Mr. Wolf, the State Department official who lost roughly $50,000. He bought Enron shares three times between April and June 2001, when the stock traded between $55 and $65 a share. By the time he sold in late October, the price had fallen to about $10 a share.
Also selling Enron at a loss was Thomas Dorr, under secretary of agriculture for rural development. Mr. Dorr, owner of Dorr's Pine Grove Farm in Iowa, came into the administration with stocks in 115 companies valued at as much as $4 million. Among them were Enron shares valued at as much as $30,000. 
Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman at the Agriculture Department, said Mr. Dorr divested all his Enron shares in November. "They were all sold at a loss," she said, adding that the shares had been in Mr. Dorr's individual retirement account.
One of the wealthier Bush administration officials, Charlotte Beers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, owned as much as $250,000 in Enron shares in a portfolio of 150 stocks and investments valued at $38 million. Ms. Beers, a former advertising executive now in charge of the administration's campaign of public diplomacy in the war on terrorism, sold her Enron stake after the company collapsed.
"Her shares were sold in December 2001 as part of normal portfolio management," said Nicholas Griffith, a State Department spokesman. "Enron was sold with a number of other shares and it all took place in December 2001."
At the Commerce Department, Grant Aldonis, the under secretary for international trade, sold his Enron shares last spring as part of his ethics agreement. Mr. Aldonis, a lawyer and former trade counsel for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, took office with a portfolio valued at as much as $3.3 million, with stock in more than 100 corporations.
His Enron holdings, then valued between $15,000 and $50,000, were sold before his confirmation last spring. At that time, Enron was trading at around $60 a share. 
The other main holder of Enron shares at the Commerce Department was Kathleen B. Cooper, under secretary for economic affairs. Ms. Cooper, former chief economist at the Exxon Mobil Corporation, had most of her portfolio, which was valued at as much as $6.5 million, invested in Exxon shares.
Her Enron holdings were sold in June 2001, when the stock traded at around $50 a share, said James Dyke, a spokesman for the Commerce Department. Mr. Dyke added that the sale was not required under her ethics agreement.
As Enron scrambled last fall to prevent a collapse, Enron executives repeatedly called Peter R. Fisher, the under secretary of treasury for domestic finance, for help -- to no avail. Mr. Fisher spoke six to eight times in October and November with Greg Whalley, Enron's president. 
Mr. Fisher, a former vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had a portfolio of 66 stocks and mutual funds. Through a trust that will come to him upon the death of his parents, he indirectly held Enron shares that had been valued at $1,000 to $15,000 but are now virtually worthless.
Other big holders of Enron shares in the Bush administration are ambassadors, most of whom were businessmen before Mr. Bush appointed them to their foreign postings. 
Heading the ambassadors' list of Enron shareholders is Richard J. Egan, the United States ambassador to Ireland and the founder and chairman emeritus of the EMC Corporation, a data storage company. Mr. Egan sold all his shares by June on the advice of his money manager. He had reported to regulators that when he joined the administration he owned Enron stock valued at $250,000 to $500,000, and that he had capital gains of more than $100,000 on the sale of those shares.
Two other White House officials held Enron shares ranging in value from $1,000 to $15,000: I. Lewis Libby, Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, and Nicholas Calio, the assistant to the president for legislative affairs. Mr. Libby sold his Enron shares on Feb. 25 last year, and he made a profit of $14, a White House spokeswoman said. Mr. Calio sold his 15 shares of Enron stock last August, she said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Up in January 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence rose in January to the highest level in 12 months, a survey showed today, signaling that the economy may pull out of recession by the middle of the year.
 The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index registered 94.2 for this month, a number last exceeded in January 2001, after jumping to 88.8 in December. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 90. 
 "Consumers are convinced that the economy will turn around soon," said Steve Stanley, an economist at Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn.
Other reports this month suggest the economy is climbing out of the first recession in a decade. Companies have slowed the pace of job cutting as factory orders increase. 
As the economy starts to rebound, demand for imported goods will probably rise, and that is likely to cause the trade deficit to widen. With demand weak in November, the trade gap narrowed, a separate report showed today.
The trade deficit shrank to $27.89 billion as oil prices fell and the manufacturing slowdown reduced the volume of petroleum imported. Total imports fell for the seventh time in eight months.
Exports rose less in November than in October, and the lack of improvement may weaken gross domestic product in the fourth quarter. These numbers will be "a drag on economic growth," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y.
The drop in imports in the trade report reflected a decline in overseas shipments of crude oil and cheaper prices. The value of United States oil imports fell in November to $4.8 billion from $6.2 billion in October.
The November price of oil was $17.13 a barrel, the lowest since July 1999, compared with $19.94 in October. The United States imported 280.6 million barrels of crude oil in November, compared with 311.3 million a month earlier.
"Economic weakness worldwide has choked demand for oil, reducing prices, and this cut our imports sharply in November," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services Inc. in Boston.

HEADLINE: Slump in Technology Spending Pushes Sun Deeply Into the Red 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems Inc., which makes data-serving computers and networking software, reported a steep quarterly loss today as it continued to struggle with frugal corporate spending on technology. 
 Sun, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said it had lost $431 million, or 13 cents a share, in its second fiscal quarter, ended Dec. 30. The loss edged past Wall Street analysts' estimates, but widened from the first quarter and stood in stark contrast to the profit of $423 million, or 13 cents, reported in the period the previous year. 
 Excluding one-time items, Sun lost $99 million, or 3 cents a share. Analysts had been expecting a loss of 4 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. The one-time items included a $511 million revamping charge and a $39 million loss on investments, partly offset by a $218 million decrease in taxes. 
Michael E. Lehman, the chief financial officer, said he still expected Sun to turn a profit in the June quarter. He said in an interview that he felt better about "activity levels" among some customers, adding that the company has completed three-quarters of the 3,900 job cuts announced in October. 
Sun said it had made progress during the quarter. It said orders stabilized, it worked off $200 million in inventory, and introduced servers and the first stages of Sun One, its Web services initiative that will compete with Microsoft's .Net. 
Hurt by its exposure to dot-coms, financial services companies and telecommunications providers, Sun said it was working to win more customers in more stable markets like health care, education and government. 
"We're just doing the best that we can in a difficult environment," Mr. Lehman said. 
Sun declined to issue a specific revenue forecast for the current quarter, saying only that it expected a slight improvement from sales of $3.11 billion in the second quarter, a 9 percent increase from the first quarter. Sales were down 39 percent, however, from $5.12 billion in the second quarter of 2000.
Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company, said Sun had a "fairly reasonable" chance of returning to profitability by June because of some positive economic indicators and the company's cost-saving efforts. 
"I think they've put together enough of the ingredients to do it," she said. "What could sideswipe them is if the economy doesn't give them any sort of help whatsoever, but that would sideswipe a lot of companies." 
Shares of Sun fell 25 cents yesterday, to close at $12.12.

HEADLINE: A Blasphemy Spreads: Debts Are O.K.; 
Can the Bible, Shakespeare and Ben Franklin All Be Wrong? Maybe So

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
There are not many issues on which the Bible, William Shakespeare, Benjamin Franklin and the modern mass media offer nearly identical social criticism. On the matter of saving money and going into debt, however, they speak in one voice.
 The New Testament advises readers to "owe no man anything," and Polonius famously said in "Hamlet," "Neither a borrower nor a lender be." Should people fail to heed these admonitions, as they often do, they risk both their morality and their independence, becoming "a slave to the lender," Franklin said, paraphrasing Proverbs. When entire societies ignore the warnings, they forfeit future prosperity for conspicuous consumption. 
 This is the essence of the most widespread worry about the American economy today. After having taken on ever higher levels of credit-card and mortgage debt to finance arguably the highest material standard of living the world has ever known, Americans will eventually have to cut back, many economists and writers have argued. The economy will suffer for years as people save more and spend less. 
In recent months, however, a growing group of economists have begun to challenge these conventional worries. To them, Americans' spending habits threaten the nation's economic fabric no more today than they threatened the moral fabric in Ben Franklin's time. Debt is a natural part of economic life, these economists say, and its level is not high when compared to the population's wealth.
This view has won new followers in academia and on Wall Street over the last year, which brought precisely the kinds of events that might spook people about their finances. But despite a recession, the worst terrorist attacks in the country's history and a war of undetermined length, consumers have continued to increase their spending levels, although modestly.
A spate of research has helped the argument as well, chiefly by putting current debt and savings levels in the context of wealth rather than income. Prodded by Alan Greenspan, two economists at the Federal Reserve recently discovered that the much-discussed decline in the personal savings rate in the 1990's occurred almost exclusively among the richest 20 percent of Americans, who also registered large gains in stock holdings and home values.
Another economist, Jonathan Skinner at Dartmouth, likes to show people a chart that plots people's net worth -- assets minus debts -- relative to their income. The graph suggests that no group of Americans is worse off than they were a decade ago, once their homes, mutual funds and retirement accounts are taken into account. In 1998 households with the median income were worth about twice their annual salary, up slightly from 1989.
And a handful of Wall Street economists, picking up on other research from the Fed, have begun arguing that the decline in the official savings rate -- from 8 percent 10 years ago to roughly zero now -- is more of an accounting fiction than an actual trend. Last year Lehman Brothers tweaked the worriers by titling one report, "Are U.S. Households Saving Too Much?" One section was called "Forget Ben Franklin."
"If the stock market collapses, then you have a real problem for the consumer, but if it doesn't collapse, then forget about the low savings rate," Ethan S. Harris, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers, said. "It's not an issue."
This soothing argument has received a helping hand from another discipline, too. In 1999 Lendol Calder, a cultural historian at Augustana College in Rock Island, Ill., published "Financing the American Dream" (Princeton University Press). Mr. Calder said he had set out to trace the troublesome history of consumer debt but had ended up finding much more concern about debt than harm caused by it. In addition to the Bible's and Ben Franklin's warnings, he came across headlines like "Never Have So Many Owed So Much" (U.S. News & World Report, 1959) and "Debt Threatens Democracy" (Harper's, 1940). In fact, he said, debt's main role has been allowing people to buy items they could otherwise not afford.
The upshot was a book in which he tried to debunk what he called "the myth of lost economic virtue": the mistaken notion that previous generations had wisely practiced frugality while the current one was spending its way toward trouble.
"We don't need to be alarmed by Chicken Littles running around saying, 'The sky is falling, the sky is falling,' " Mr. Calder said. "The sky hasn't ever fallen."
Of course, debt really is a larger part of the economy today than it was in the past. People pay for everything from groceries to college tuition with their credit cards. Banks have used risk-management computer programs to expand the portion of the population to which they are willing to issue credit. The number of Americans owning a home, and therefore having a mortgage, and the size of the average mortgage have both soared.
Even the anti-Chicken Little crowd acknowledges that at some point debt can become unmanageable for a society. "There is a limit," Mr. Calder said, "but we don't know what that limit is."
The idea that the current debt level poses few if any risks remains a minority view. To many economists, Americans are already overextended. From 1991 to 2001, household liabilities more than doubled, from $3.9 trillion to $7.9 trillion, according to Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa. Despite the rise in unemployment, people have continued to take out new loans in the last year, thanks largely to low-interest rates and interest-free auto loans.
Payments on those debts will come due no matter what, even if the stock market collapses or home values and incomes fail to rise. People making less money are especially vulnerable because a single problem, like a layoff or Enron-like collapse of retirement savings, can cause them to fall badly behind on mortgage and credit-card bills.
As soon as debt stops increasing at its recent rapid pace, the more pessimistic economists say, the brisk economic growth of the late 90's will be impossible.
"In some sense, what drives an economy forward is a willingness to extend credit and a willingness to take on a debt," said James K. Galbraith, a economist at the University of Texas. "But one needs to distinguish between a general aversion to debt and the issue of whether the pace that debt is being accumulated can be sustained."
"My view is that debt is at the point that households are likely to retrench for a substantial period of time," Mr. Galbraith said, voicing a concern of many economists.
The optimists' response begins with the government's official savings rate. It measures the amount of every dollar of income that people put away instead of spending, and it has fallen from almost 12 percent in the early 80's to 8 percent a decade ago and to about zero now.
But the figure excludes gains on assets like land and stocks, which have been plentiful in recent years. At the same time, it subtracts the taxes people pay on such gains from their income, effectively lowering their savings rate. So if a person buys a stock for $10, sells it for $100 and pays $20 in tax on her $90 gain, she appears in the government accounts to have lowered her savings by $20 when she has actually raised it by $70 as far as she is concerned.
The increased popularity of 401(k) plans instead of pensions and the decline in the number of companies paying dividends to their shareholders also skews the savings data, Mr. Harris of Lehman Brothers said.
The research that has gotten the most attention was done by Dean M. Maki and Michael G. Palumbo, who were both economists at the Fed when Mr. Greenspan suggested they combine two data sets to break down the savings rate by income group. They concluded that the rate fell sharply in the 90's for the 20 percent of Americans with the largest salaries, fell slightly for the next fifth but did not fall for the rest.
The explanation, they said, is the long bull market, which allowed affluent people to increase their spending by dipping into their stock portfolios. "The wealth effect is the story behind the decline in the savings rate," Mr. Maki said.
There are valid methodological reasons for the Commerce Department to tabulate the data the way it does, economists say, but one result is that the savings rate makes households' balance sheets look worse than they are. "The steep drop in the U.S. personal savings rate over the last decade has fueled speculation that Americans are spending recklessly," a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded a year ago. "These fears are not well founded."
With joblessness likely to continue rising, the coming year will provide a good test. Recessions have a way of resolving debates like this one.

PERSON: Harding L. Lawrence 

HEADLINE: Harding L. Lawrence, 81, Airline Chief, Dies 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Harding L. Lawrence, an airline executive whose innovations transformed Braniff International Airways, died on Wednesday at his residence in Mustique, St. Vincent, West Indies. He was 81 and maintained another residence in London.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Catherine Lebow, a family friend. 
 In 1965, after a decade at Continental Airlines, Mr. Lawrence was lured away to run Braniff, which was a small, stodgy, poorly run regional airline. In his first three months on the job, Mr. Lawrence decided to revamp Braniff, said C. Edward Acker, who in the mid-1960's was Braniff's executive vice president.
"Not only did Harding change the image, but a significant amount of the management," he said.
In large part, the transformation was conceived and carried out by a young advertising executive, Mary Wells, who would later become Mr. Harding's second wife. Braniff was the first client of Wells, Rich, Greene Inc., the advertising agency Ms. Wells started in 1965.
Ms. Wells's concept, the "End of the Plain Plane," led Braniff to paint its planes in bright colors and dress its flight attendants in Pucci-designed uniforms. One DC-8 jetliner on the airline's Latin American routes was painted in playful wavy patterns by Alexander Calder. 
"More people will see this painting by a famous artist in a shorter time than perhaps any other in history," Mr. Lawrence said in 1973. Braniff paid the artist $100,000. 
"There are a number of ways to change the image of an airline, and most of them are conventional," Mr. Acker said. The moves at Braniff were "an extreme departure, and it was a very difficult decision." 
In addition to approving a change in the airline's image, Mr. Lawrence also oversaw a rapid expansion in the size and scope of the airline's operations after the industry was deregulated in the late 1970's.
In his tenure, Braniff's fleet grew to 110 aircraft and revenue rose to more than $1.5 billion from $100 million. It became the eighth-largest airline in North America and the largest in South America. 
But expansion came at a price. 
Braniff incurred huge expenses buying aircraft and starting dozens of routes in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
In 1980, hit by higher fuel prices, a recession and declining passenger loads, Braniff began to founder. On Dec. 30 of that year, Mr. Lawrence, then 60, stepped down as chairman and chief executive, apparently at the request of creditors. Braniff filed for bankruptcy in May 1982.
A big psychological setback for Mr. Lawrence during his Braniff career was the payment in 1976 of a civil penalty of $300,000, then a record. It resulted from the airline's failure to report an illegal $40,000 contribution to the 1972 re-election campaign of President Richard M. Nixon and from disclosures that Braniff had given rebates and excessive commissions to travel agents. 
Harding Lawrence was born on July 15, 1920, in Perkins, Okla. 
After two years of active duty with the Army Air Forces in World War II, Mr. Lawrence began his career in commercial aviation in 1946, when he joined Essair, later Pioneer Airlines, as assistant to the vice president for operations. Pioneer merged with Continental Airlines in 1955 and Mr. Lawrence was named vice president for traffic and sales. 
For several years after he left Braniff, Mr. Lawrence worked in New York with his wife at Wells, Rich, Greene. It was a change because for many of his years at Braniff, the couple, who were called "America's corporate sweethearts," had a commuter marriage. 
"Mary lived in New York and Harding lived in Dallas," said Jere Cox, Braniff's vice president for public relations in the 1960's and 1970's. But they also had homes in exotic locations, including La Fiorentina, a villa built into the mountainside overlooking the Mediterranean in St.-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, France; a home in Acapulco, Mexico; a ranch in southern Arizona; and their residence in Mustique.
Mrs. Lawrence sold her business in 1990. Her memoir, "A Big Life," is to be published by Alfred A. Knopf later this year. 
In addition to his wife, Mr. Lawrence is survived by two sons, James B. of New York City and State R. Lawrence of Greenwich, Conn.; three daughters, Deborah M. Lawrence of New York City, Kathryn L. Bryan of Red Bank, N.J., and Pamela Lombard of Geneva, Switzerland; and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Says Zimbabwe Is Deaf to Calls for Fair Elections 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
After three days of meetings in Zimbabwe, the State Department's top human rights official said today that he had made no progress in persuading the government of President Robert Mugabe to improve conditions for elections and halt intimidation of the opposition.
 In an interview here after his trip, Lorne Craner, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, said Zimbabwe was gripped with fear as the presidential election, scheduled for March 9 and 10, approached. 
 "The electoral environment is very bad," Mr. Craner said. "People fear for their personal safety, even people who are not active in civil society, ordinary people." 
Political violence has been intensifying in advance of the electoral showdown between President Mugabe, who has run the country since blacks won majority rule in 1980, and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
Once a stable and largely self-sufficient country, Zimbabwe is now struggling, and the opposition party has tapped anger over the country's economic slide and the government's increasingly autocratic rule to mount the most serious challenge Mr. Mugabe has ever faced. 
The United States has threatened limited economic sanctions against Mr. Mugabe's government, like freezing the assets of the president and his associates and restricting their travel in the United States. The outcome of Mr. Craner's mission appeared to make such measures more likely. "I conveyed to them that time is just about out," said Mr. Craner, who met with the speaker of the Parliament, Emmerson Mnangagwa, and senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Mr. Craner said the Mugabe government appeared determined to maintain its current policy course. "The language I heard was something out of the 1950's or 1960's, about how a shrinking economy is okay, how it doesn't matter if they are isolated even from their neighbors," he said. 
Mr. Craner said he would meet with State Department officials to consider what steps the Bush administration should take. 
The European Union has been contemplating sanctions as well, and after today may be a step closer to imposing them. At a meeting last week in Brussels, the European Union gave Zimbabwe a week to sign a pledge to allow foreign journalists and election observers into the country. But according to news reports from Brussels, no pledge has arrived.
Jonathan Moyo, Zimbabwe's minister of information, and George Charamba, the permanent secretary for information, did not respond to telephone calls tonight.
The prospect of American and European action follows several days of diplomatic initiatives aimed at easing the crisis in Zimbabwe, which has aroused deep concern in neighboring countries. 
Leaders of the 14-nation Southern African Development Community assembled in Malawi this week for an emergency meeting on the region's biggest crises, including Zimbabwe.
At the meeting, President Mugabe promised to allow international journalists and election observers into the country, and to order investigations of political violence. 
A day later, Zimbabwe's Parliament delayed passage of a bill that would have imposed new limits on the country's press and effectively barred foreign correspondents. But the legislation is scheduled to go before Parliament again next week, and the outcome of the vote remains uncertain.
Today, militants of Mr. Mugabe's party seemed to deepen tensions when they stormed white-owned farms in northern Zimbabwe, and youths in government uniforms set up roadblocks to seal off several districts, The Associated Press reported.

HEADLINE: Dell Raises Profit Forecast, Saying Holiday Sales Were Strong 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
Increasing its lead over competitors in the sputtering personal computer business, the Dell Computer Corporation raised its sales and profit forecasts yesterday for the current quarter.
 Dell, the world's largest manufacturer of PC's, said it was headed for stronger-than-expected sales across its product line. Strong holiday sales in particular were expected to bolster the company's revenue to about $8 billion -- down from $8.7 billion in the period the previous year but better than the $7.6 billion it had initially projected. 
 As a result, Dell increased its per-share earnings forecast by a penny, to 17 cents, for its fourth quarter, which ends Feb. 1. The company is to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 14. 
Dell said that its consumer business, which generally contributes 15 to 20 percent of its revenue, would sell 50 percent more units than it did in the third quarter. Revenue is expected to increase 40 percent. 
The announcement of unexpectedly robust consumer sales echoed similar comments earlier this week by market researchers and a rival PC maker, Compaq Computer, which reported fourth-quarter earnings that far exceeded most analysts' projections. 
Shares of Dell fell 85 cents, to $28.10, in Nasdaq trading.
While PC sales over all are still down sharply from a year ago, many analysts say that the industry has reached the bottom of its decline and is poised for a rebound when the economy recovers.
"The PC market is slowly but surely pulling its way out of what was an extremely tough 2001," said Gillian Munson, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
For only the second time, PC sales declined in the United States and across the globe last year. Many consumers and corporations found that their computers were adequate; many of those who wanted new PC's delayed their purchases as the economy slowed.
PC manufacturers sold 4.6 percent fewer units worldwide and 11.1 percent fewer in the United States, according to Gartner Dataquest, a market research firm.
But while unit sales at Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway declined by double-digit percentages, Dell's PC business grew 18.3 percent, increasing global market share to 13.1 percent, two points better than No. 2 Compaq.
With a 24.5 percent share in the United States market, Dell sold more personal computers than Compaq and Hewlett-Packard combined. Hewlett-Packard has cited a need to improve its money-losing PC business as one reason for its proposed $24 billion acquisition of Compaq.
Dell, based in Austin, Tex., has used its direct-sales business model to pass the savings from tumbling PC component prices along to customers. Ms. Munson, the analyst, noted that Dell's market share had grown steadily since 1996, while those of its competitors had risen and fallen.
But Charles Smulders, an analyst with Gartner Dataquest, said that the direct-sales model, while a strong point in the American and Western European markets, might hurt Dell in smaller, growing markets like Central Europe and Africa.
"The Dell model doesn't necessarily play as well there because people don't really want to buy direct," he said. "It's a different competitive environment."
Mr. Smulders also cautioned that the effects of the Sept. 11 attacks may have inflated the industry's fourth-quarter PC sales. Economic fears after the attacks persuaded many customers to delay computer purchases by a few weeks, he said, pushing some third-quarter sales into the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DRUG TRADE; 
Poppy Ban Pleases Dealers In Opium

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Ali Muhammad, a gregarious opium trader in a flowing brown robe and wrinkled black turban, was delighted by the news on Wednesday that his country's interim government had vowed to ban poppy cultivation, renewing a prohibition imposed under the ousted Taliban government that cut opium production by about 95 percent last year.
 "We'll be rich," he said, sitting on an electric-blue carpet in one of the dozens of stalls that line this city's bustling opium market. 
 A crowd of other traders agreed. Since the Taliban fell from power, farmers have been planting more poppies, and middlemen have been dumping opium stocks into the market, sending prices plunging by half. The falling market has hurt merchants like Mr. Ali. 
One of the traders pulled a fist-size chunk of raw opium out of a plastic bag and explained that a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of the black resin fetched 40,000 Pakistani rupees in August, or about $650 at current exchange rates. But it is worth only 20,000 rupees a kilogram today.
If farmers continue to grow opium unimpeded, the trader said, the price could fall back to 2,000 rupees a kilogram, the level before the Taliban's ban, when opium was the biggest cash crop in the country and Afghanistan the largest opium producer in the world.
But Mr. Ali and his friends probably should not calculate their profits before the opium is sold. Many people question whether the loose alliance of warlords who have pledged allegiance to the interim government in Kabul have the political will to carry out the cultivation ban. Opium has long been the currency of power in this arid land.
"The people with guns will keep growing it, and big businessmen will benefit the most," predicted Hajji Abdul Rahman, an older trader in a white turban and beard. With a sharp tongue and dismissive flicks of his hands, he delivered a lecture on market economics to his younger colleagues, explaining that the gains from the ban for small traders like themselves would be short-lived, while higher prices would only make it more difficult for them to finance their businesses.
More significant than the cultivation ban, Mr. Rahman said, was the news that the new government might outlaw trading in the drug.
Even the Taliban allowed trading to continue while cultivation was banned, a move that many people suggested was a ploy to drive the value of the country's opium stocks higher while the government reaped the benefit of foreign aid tied to slowing opium production.
Hamid Karzai, the head of the Kabul government, may be playing a similar game. His announcement of the ban came just days before donor nations are to meet in Tokyo to discuss aid to his battered country. Most of Afghanistan's opium is smuggled across its borders and refined into heroin for sale in Europe. 
Here in Kandahar, Muhammad Akram, the chief of police for four provinces that produce more than half of Afghanistan's opium, said he had heard that the ban would be put into effect in stages, a few provinces at a time. He has received no word that the ban yet extends to his region, but said he was ready to carry it out it if called upon to do so.
"We have talked to the farmers and said, 'If we help you, will you stop?' And they have said yes," Mr. Akram said, speaking in the dim light of a gas lamp during one of the city's frequent power outages.
Basher Muhammad, a wizened man squatting in a field of germinating opium just outside this town, conceded reluctantly that he would destroy his lucrative crop if forced to.
"But the farmers will gather and go to the governor's house and demand compensation," he said.
He said he had spent about $4,000 on his opium fields, including a year's rental for the land, which he planted with opium in November after the Taliban lost Kabul. He expects to scrape about 50 kilograms of raw opium from the capsules of the ripe poppies in April, enough to bring him nearly $17,000 at current prices.
But even if prices continue to fall, the opium will bring him far more than the radishes, spinach and okra that he grew when opium was banned. Those crops sell for pennies a kilogram in the local market.
"If we don't grow opium, we can't live," he said.

HEADLINE: Brash Reporter Turned Lawmaker Says She's Ready to Run Dallas 

BYLINE:  By ROSS E. MILLOY 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
For more than 70 years, citizens here have almost invariably chosen a mayor backed by this city's buttoned-down business establishment. But as the voters head to the polls on Saturday to select new leadership for the nation's ninth largest city, the insurgent candidacy of a tough-talking former newspaper columnist may just overturn that tradition.
 The former journalist, Laura Miller, is leading in the polls by nearly 10 percentage points. 
 Her main opponents, Tom Dunning, former chairman of the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and Domingo Garcia, a state legislator and former City Council member trying to forge a coalition of black and Hispanic voters, question whether she is too confrontational. 
Ms. Miller's supporters say that is what they like about her.
"She will just not back down," said one such supporter, Dawn Howard-Jones, 37. "She butts heads with the mayor, the council, and just keeps on coming. She's tough. She's like a gunfighter at the O.K. Corral."
Cal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University, said the dynamics of the nonpartisan contest are unusual.
"Dallas is a city that has always been oriented towards business, with the voters looking for stability and things like low taxes and small government," Mr. Jillson said. "But this is an uncommon year, and issues like those are not central to the mayor's race. This year, the battle is all about personality and temperament."
Ms. Miller said she almost did not enter the race. "My husband said that if I were to run for the mayor's office I would have to do it as a single mother," said Ms. Miller, who has three children and whose husband is a state legislator. "There's been a lot of coalition-building around my house in the last few months."
Ms. Miller, whose politics run toward the populist, seemed to be tweaking her opponents, who have criticized her inexperience in building coalitions. Both Mr. Dunning's and Mr. Garcia's campaigns emphasize their successes in working effectively with others on important business and civic projects. Ms. Miller, 43, who once covered City Hall as a columnist for The Dallas Observer, an alternative weekly, seems eager to paint herself as a political outsider -- an image formed during the three and a half years she was resident gadfly on the Dallas City Council, until she resigned to run for mayor.
Yet a poll published this week in The Dallas Morning News shows Ms. Miller in front, with 37 percent of likely voters, followed by 29 percent for Mr. Dunning and 14 percent for Mr. Garcia, which could point to a runoff. There are two other candidates in the race, and 18 percent of the likely voters were undecided. The poll had a margin of error of four percentage points.
Mr. Dunning, an insurance executive, says he believes that attracting new jobs and economic development should be the city's first priority. 
"I have a 30-year record in business and job creation," Mr. Dunning said recently. "Dallas' mayor must be the city's No. 1 advocate, not No. 1 critic, on economic issues." 
And Mr. Garcia has proposed a $1 billion bond package for infrastructure and economic revitalization.
Ms. Miller counters that the city has simpler needs. "We need to take care of the people who are already here," she said, "and that means returning to basics: fixing potholes, building great parks and improving the police department."
But leadership style has been as prominent an issue as any other in the campaign.
Mr. Garcia, also 43, said of Ms. Miller: "She's an 'aginner.' She's against bringing the Olympics here, against building the American Airlines sports center, against almost everything." 
Mr. Dunning, who frequently jokes self-deprecatingly about being "charisma-impaired," has highlighted Ms. Miller's sometimes brash style in his speeches and advertising. 
Former Mayor Ron Kirk, who set the stage for the special election when he resigned in November to run for the United States Senate, is supporting Mr. Dunning, as are dozens of local business organizations and the powerful Dallas Citizens Council.
For her part, Ms. Miller points to a successful campaign to rewrite the city's ethics code, first opposed by a majority of the City Council but later passed overwhelmingly, as an example of her ability to lead toward consensus. And the first step in building an attractive business climate, she says, is concentrating on basic services.
"The business community will be thrilled to have me if I win," she said.

HEADLINE: McGreevey Makes Shift In Opposing More Taxes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
As Election Day 2001 drew near and his Republican opponent persisted in challenging him to sign a no-new-taxes pledge, James E. McGreevey gave in during the final debate on Oct. 26. He looked into the television cameras and made a promise.
 "We're not going to raise taxes," he said. "I'm committed to not raising taxes." 
 On Nov. 8, the day after he won his landslide victory, he made a more sweeping declaration: "I've ruled out a tax increase."
What Mr. McGreevey did not say was which taxes he was talking about. The income tax? The sales tax? The solid-waste-disposal tax? Or all of the dozens of different taxes and more than 50 user fees that New Jersey imposes on residents and businesses.
Those unspoken words moved to the center of the state's budget debate this week, when Mr. McGreevey said that the state's $2.8 billion deficit was so dire that he would consider any option except increases in the sales and income taxes. One of his economic advisers further fanned the flames when he mentioned that a property tax rebate plan which was scheduled to cost $1 billion this year might be "a target" for budget cutters.
Mr. McGreevey's shifting opposition to tax increases drew immediate fire from Republicans, who accused him of flip-flopping on a tax pledge that they, and voters, understood to be unequivocal.
"Certainly when you say no new taxes, then you start redefining what you mean by taxes, that certainly appears to be a change," said John O. Bennett, the Senate's Republican co-president. "I'm anxious to hear what his proposals are, but I'm concerned that we don't do anything that will harm the property tax payers in this state."
But Mr. McGreevey said today that his statements did not signal any change in his plans to avoid a tax increase, and he urged everyone not to read too much into his words. The governor said that his comments, made as he announced the formation of a commission on budget efficiency, were intended merely to underline the gravity of the problem and to encourage commission members to think expansively about possible solutions.
"The objective is clear: namely, not to raise taxes, and I expect to achieve that end, particularly for the duration of fiscal year 02."
Many political experts and budget analysts say that the size of the budget gap makes some tax increases appear likely, and that if the governor were to approve a tax hike, he would then be forced to choose how to explain his decision to the public.
In 1990, when President George Bush reneged on the infamous "Read my lips, no new taxes" promise, he told voters that economic conditions had changed too drastically to forestall an increase. Tom Kean, the former New Jersey governor, used a similar strategy in 1982, when he faced a shutdown of the state government and literally held his nose as he signed a budget that increased taxes.
But Mr. Bush waited two years before abandoning his tax pledge; Mr. Kean's about-face came after several months in office. Mr. McGreevey's statements were made two days after his inauguration.
"Usually politicians wait a decent interval before turning their backs on the people who elected them on a no-tax promise," said Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union. "The speed of this reversal, if it is indeed a reversal, would be stunning even in these cynical times."
The governor's carefully crafted words also offer him the option of employing another possible explanation: telling voters that when he said no tax increases, he did not mean every tax. But Gerald Pomper, who teaches political science at Rutgers, said that that strategy could backfire and seriously damage the perception of both Mr. McGreevey and the Democratic Party.
In 1989, the last time the state elected a Democratic governor -- Jim Florio -- Mr. Florio pushed a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature, inciting such anger in voters that the party was thrown from power for a decade.
"If you start parsing words like that, people get angry," Mr. Pomper said. "And the Democrats are still trying to restore their credibility on the issue."
One advantage the McGreevey administration has as it prepares the budget is that the New Jersey public seems braced for a tax increase. Polls taken during the closing days of the campaign showed that most New Jersey voters believed a tax increase was imminent regardless of who was elected. Even people who backed Mr. McGreevey's opponent, Bret D. Schundler, doubted he would keep his promise to cut taxes.
"Compared to the last recession, this one is linked with the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks, even though it started in the state last February," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "September 11th ensured that we were going to have a serious recession, and people understand that the cause of a large part of the problem we couldn't do anything about it."
Of course if Mr. McGreevey succeeds in avoiding a tax increase, those expectations will only magnify his achievement and help erase the stigma that has haunted Democrats for more than a decade. Republicans say they hope he makes good on his promise, but they are preparing for anything.
"We're going to wait and see what proposals he has to offer," Mr. Bennett said. "And we're going to be there to stand up for the taxpayers."

With Thanks Comes a Call For Restraint

BYLINE:  By Clyde Haberman 

 BODY:
A GROUP of Broadway performers left for the hinterlands yesterday to deliver New York City's thanks to America. Correction: to the rest of America. Sorry about the slip. This post-Sept. 11 business of Americans accepting New York as truly part of the United States still takes getting used to.
 Starting with Miami today, the Broadway troupe will whisk through 14 cities over the next two weeks, singing show tunes and talking up New York as a tourist attraction -- but also, more to the point, saying thank you for the support that people around the country have given the city since the attack on the World Trade Center. 
 "This is not a familiar position for New York," said Jed Bernstein, president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, the chief sponsor of the tour.
"New York is perhaps used to being admired but not necessarily loved," Mr. Bernstein said at a kickoff ceremony held at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square. He added, "It's time to give back," and what better way than with a touch of Broadway, "perhaps New York's most exportable commodity"?
Actually, with the closing of the Fresh Kills landfill except as a temporary repository for debris from ground zero, New York's most exportable commodity is something else entirely. But why be a stickler for details? The Broadway gesture is sweet. Besides, expressing gratitude is good manners, not something that New Yorkers are often accused of having in abundance. (You got a problem with that?)
OTHELLO may have had a point, though, with his lament about loving not wisely but too well. Not every display of affection for the city has been a thrill. One that could nastily boomerang on us is the World Economic Forum, which will be held at the Waldorf-Astoria starting at the end of the month.
The international forum is an exercise in bloviation by political, business and academic leaders, who gather every year to inform one another that the world needs healthy economies. Normally, the conference takes place among the yodelers in Davos, Switzerland. But the organizers chose to grace New York this time as a show of solidarity.
Wilkommen, bienvenue, welcome. In addition to bringing moral support, they should be good for business, filling hotel rooms that have been empty for months and eating in pricey restaurants.
The problem is that no major economic conference is complete these days without thousands of protesters: warriors against the evils of globalization or anti-Starbucks wackos, depending on your politics. Either way, they are known less for their deep thinking than for their demonstrated willingness to trash cities that play host to these gatherings. Ask the mayors of Genoa, Italy; Salzburg, Austria; Melbourne, Australia; and, of course, Seattle, the Starbucks mother ship.
The Police Department promises to be ready for any kind of trouble. On Thursday, antiriot officers showed their stuff in a drill at Shea Stadium.
Even so, some would say that New York needs this about as much as it needs another airplane attack. Hasn't the strain on the city's uniformed forces been bad enough? Also, police overtime could run into the millions of dollars, this at a time of serious budget problems. Who will pay the bill? The Police Department did not respond to a question about whether the city would have to absorb the entire cost, or get help from outside sources.
This seems as good a time as any to revive an idea put forth in this space last year, namely to relocate the United Nations on abandoned Governors Island, the former military base in New York Harbor. There is no reason that the island couldn't also be used for threatened events like the economic forum.
Obviously, security is on everyone's mind more than ever. "An island that could be sealed off might be even more valuable for such conferences," said Lawrence Littlefield, an economist who suggested moving the United Nations to Governors Island when he worked, until a year ago, for the Department of City Planning.
His idea went nowhere, and more than likely it remains a nonstarter.
That being the case, the antiglobalization types may want to think about something that the actor Peter Gallagher said at the kickoff for the Broadway tour. "I always knew that in hard times New Yorkers would come through," he said. "I just didn't know that people from elsewhere in the country would be there for us."
The demonstrators could be there for us, too -- by behaving.

Enron Chief Went Online To Urge Stock Purchase
More than a month after an Enron vice president warned that the company might be an "elaborate accounting hoax," chairman Kenneth L. Lay used an online chat to urge employees to buy Enron shares, a transcript of the session shows.
 Mr. Lay, who apparently disposed of some Enron stock himself within days of receiving the warning, assured employees in the chat session that executives were convinced that Enron's finances were legal and appropriate. But he did not mention the issues raised by the company vice president, who warned of serious accounting problems. Page A1. 

The accounting industry was able to defeat an earlier push for tougher regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that reflected the growing political influence of those firms in Washington. While there is talk of changes in enforcement, Congressional aides and some experts say it will not happen, at least not without changes in campaign finance regulations. A1.

Talk Magazine Goes Silent
Miramax and the Hearst Corporation have suspended their financial support for Talk Magazine, the two-year-old magazine founded by Tina Brown, the former editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. Talk sought to capture a general interest audience at a time when other magazines, faced with declining readership, had begun steering toward niche audiences. The suspension could end a grand experiment started by some of the media's most visible players. A1.

Dell Computer Raises Forecast
Increasing its lead over its competitors in the personal computer business, Dell Computer has raised its sales and profit forecasts for the quarter. The company said that strong holiday sales to consumers are expected to bolster its revenue. C2.

Sun Reports $431 Million Loss
Sun Microsystems reported a $431 million loss in its second quarter as it continued to struggle with frugal corporate spending on technology. The company said it expected to report a profit in its June quarter. C15.

Dutch Insurer Sells Mexican Assets
The Dutch insurer Aegon has sold the assets of its Mexican life insurance and pension funds to Citigroup for $1.24 billion. Part of the proceeds from the sale will used to offset additions to Aegon's loan reserves. The insurer has about $300 million in loans to Enron. C2.

Newmont Mining Wins Bidding
The five-month battle over Normandy Mining of Australia went to the final bell before Newmont Mining of Denver was declared the winner. Newmont's $2.3 billion takeover of Normandy is expected to close next month. C2.

Markets Down for the Week
Cautious outlooks from Microsoft and I.B.M. sent technology stocks tumbling as investors worried that an economic recovery might be further delayed. The technology-driven Nasdaq composite index closed out its worst week since Sept. 11. C3.

Debt Concerns End Korean Deal
A $833 million foreign investment in three financial service firms of a South Korean conglomerate fell apart this week over fears of hidden debt in the companies. The American International Group pulled out of the talks with the Hyundai Group after Korean regulators refused to protect it against any debts. C2.

Increase in Consumer Confidence
Consumer confidence rose in January to the highest level in 12 months, a survey showed, signaling that the economy may pull out of recession by the middle of the year. A separate report showed that the trade deficit in November narrowed to $27.89 billion. C15.

HEADLINE: Another Top 100 List: This Time, Intellectuals 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
Things are not looking good for Isaac Rosenfeld. As a piece of intellectual property, Rosenfeld, one of the smaller lights of modern Jewish literature and cultural criticism, has always tended to fluctuate in value from footnote to fat paragraph. But investors holding large quantities of Rosenfeld stock may want to unload. As table 5.1 in Richard A. Posner's "Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline" (Harvard University Press, 2001) shows, Rosenfeld's name turns up only 89 times when entered on Google, a popular Internet search engine. A search of the Lexis-Nexis database, which covers journals and newspapers, elicits a mere eight mentions. 
 That leaves only one performance category, scholarly citations. The numbers are dismaying. While robust performers like the French philosopher Michel Foucault showed more than 13,000 scholarly citations this quarter, Rosenfeld could manage only two, putting him, as a public intellectual, in the same league as stocks like Enron and Lucent. 
 Many readers have protested that the value of thinkers like Isaac Rosenfeld cannot be quantified. But they are wrong, and stupid, too, according to Mr. Posner, just like most of the public intellectuals discussed in the 400-plus pages of his book. The marketplace in ideas is no mere phrase to Mr. Posner, an alarmingly prolific federal judge, author and scholar who has decided that the traffic in opinions can be usefully described in economic terms, with numerical values assigned to dozens of opinion-mongers who offer their wares in the great media bazaar.
The book has been catnip to journalists and intellectual scorekeepers, who have been bickering over the standings for weeks. The ups and downs of American intellectuals, especially the New York variety, fascinates the more bookish part of the population in the same way that college football rankings or Baseball Hall of Fame elections mesmerize sports fans. Was Lionel Trilling overrated? Did Robert Worshaw, a brilliant interpreter of American film, ever get his due? Is Lester Thurow past his prime? Can Dinesh D'Souza and Francis Fukuyama stage a rally and prove they are more than one-shot wonders? 
Those are the questions that furrow high brows, especially in the current media-saturated era, when a horde of public intellectuals bark on talkfests from "Crossfire" to "Hardball" to "Larry King Live" to "Charlie Rose." America has entered the expansion-league phase of public intellectualism. The Internet and cable television now offer no end of forums for the exchange of opinions. As a result, intellectual-watchers must now keep up with dozens, if not hundreds, of new talking heads, experts, frustrated academics and think-tank fish.
Anyone who expresses himself or herself in an accessible way on matters of general public concern meets Mr. Posner's definition of a public intellectual. That's a potentially enormous pool, and as he sees it, a complete lack of quality control almost guarantees that anyone who wants to be a public intellectual can be. It's probably a good thing that Irving Howe did not live to see the day.
Mr. Posner defines "public intellectual" and explains the workings of the intellectual marketplace, complete with a discussion of supply and demand as it applies to ideas and predictions. But the only section of the book that really interests most people -- and the one that is causing all the fuss -- is a thin, succulent layer of lists and tables that allow readers to see who's up and who's down in the public-intellectual stock market.
Mr. Posner, in an attempt to quantify the market penetration of intellectuals both living and dead, fed a large assortment of names into his computer, using Google to enumerate Web-page hits, Lexis-Nexis to search popular journals and newspapers, and Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index and Arts and Humanities Citation Index to sift through scholarly publications.
His findings, an intellectual's list of who's in and who's out, has been keeping the natterati busy -- especially the already notorious Table 5.3, a list of the top 100 public intellectuals, ranked by media mentions. Henry A. Kissinger leads the list, with 12,570 mentions from 1995 to 2000. No. 100 is George J. Stigler (a Nobel winner in economic science, just in case you didn't know). Mr. Posner himself checks in at a very respectable No. 70. 
He recognizes the conceptual problems with the tables. For one thing, a political figure like Mr. Kissinger is often mentioned in connection with his political career, not his pronouncements on foreign policy. Similarly, it cannot be possible that Bernard Shaw ranks 17th on the list by virtue of his opinions on economics and politics.
Many readers will also scratch their heads over the bizarre sight of Sidney Blumenthal's name in the top 10, between the economist Robert B. Reich and the legal scholar Arthur R. Miller. When did Mr. Blumenthal transmigrate from journalist and White House aide to public intellectual? The answer probably lies in the Monica Lewinsky affair, which kept him in the papers day after day. 
Turn to table 5.1, and many oddities leap off the page. William Shawn a public intellectual? This editor of The New Yorker, famously reclusive, published only one article in his lifetime. He made fewer public statements than Garbo. Timothy Leary seems a little unusual, to say the least, as a candidate for the list. Was it simply to humiliate John Gray, the writer on liberalism, that his name was fed into the computer? It turned up precisely zero Web hits. Almost anyone can generate one hit, simply by virtue of being in the telephone book or having a pulse.
My own perplexity at the list starts with the concept of mention. Not all mentions are created equal. To return to the hapless Isaac Rosenfeld, a Google search turns up the following, in no particular order: a reader who wants to know how Saul Bellow and Rosenfeld came up with a Yiddish translation of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"; a news release from the University of Oregon about a forthcoming lecture on Jewish literature in the 20th century; an advertisement for a recording of Rosenfeld's short story "King Solomon," read by William Shatner; and a Web page devoted to "great quotes to inspire, empower and motivate you to live the life of your dreams and become the person you always wanted to be."
The only thing missing was an offer to "Create for you, ISAAC ROSENFELD, your own family coat of arms!" As an experiment designed to give a sense of proportion to the debate, I fed two names into Google. Nostradamus accounted for 220,000 mentions on the Web. And Mortimer Snerd generated a healthy 18,200.
Some of the numbers require further study. How can it be that the economist Gary Becker generates a mere 494 media mentions, but 5,329 Web hits? Similarly, James Baldwin shows up 2,019 times in the media but 22,592 times on the Web. How is it possible that Rachel Carson generates twice the number of Web hits as Jacques Derrida? And what can account for the phenomenal staying power of Albert Camus, a titan with 32,370 Web appearances? I think I know why Andre Malraux and Ivan Illich fare so poorly. In the book, their names are spelled Malreaux and Ilych. 
But the numbers, in the end, do not matter much anyway. As Mr. Posner takes great pains to demonstrate, the intellectual marketplace may involve heavy trading, but it often offers very little value. Just like your Uncle Max, public intellectuals often have the bad habit of spouting off on subjects they know little about; cannot stop themselves from offering erroneous predictions; lack the fundamental reasoning skills to construct or understand an argument; and have little or no influence on events or even public opinion.
Mr. Posner offers no solution to the problems he sets forth. But one model for economic intervention does suggest itself, a kind of farm-subsidy program that might encourage opinion workers to cut back their output and generate a higher-quality product. When a George Will -- No. 3 -- feels the need to opine, he could call a toll-free number and receive credit at the nearest bar, redeemable for a period of 24 hours. Then, as most Americans do, he could sit down, order a beer and complain all night about baseball's shrinking strike zone. This may not be the solution, but it's a start.

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
 Mortgage rates, helped by some comments from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, fell this week, with 30-year mortgages again slipping below 7 percent. 
 The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined to 6.83 percent, from 7.06 percent last week, according to a survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac. Fifteen-year mortgages fell to 6.31 percent from 6.55 percent. The initial rate on one-year adjustable mortgages was 5.08 percent, down from 5.26 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS; 
Shares Slump as Investors Fear Recovery May Be Delayed

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Cautious outlooks from Microsoft and I.B.M. sent technology stocks tumbling yesterday as investors worried that an economic recovery might be further delayed.
 The technology-driven Nasdaq composite index closed out its worst week since the terror attacks last September. Analysts said the drop was to be expected after the buying late last year when investors expected business to quickly turn around in 2002. 
 The technology sector took the brunt of the selling; the Nasdaq index fell 55.48, or 2.8 percent, to 1,930.34 and ended the week down 92.12, or 4.6 percent. The last time the Nasdaq had a bigger weekly percentage decline was Sept. 21 to 28, when it dropped 16 percent after the terrorist attacks.
The market's other major indexes also posted declines. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 78.19, or 0.8 percent, to 9,771.85, with I.B.M. and Microsoft its weakest components. For the week, the Dow fell 215.68 points, or 2.2 percent. 
The Standard & Poor's 500 index stumbled 11.30, or 1.0 percent, yesterday to 1,127.58. It ended the week down 18.02, or 1.6 percent.
The downturn reflected the market's disappointment with statements from I.B.M. and Microsoft saying they did not know if a recovery had started. Although the two technology bellwethers beat earnings expectations, that was not enough for Wall Street, which had been buying on the assumption that the companies would confirm a turnaround in progress.
I.B.M. fell $5.65, to $114.25, while Microsoft tumbled $3.76, to $66.10. The selling spread to other technology issues, including Intel, which fell $1.05, to $33.48.
"I don't think people were expecting lots of positive comments about an economic recovery, but they were hoping for some glimmer of hope, and so far management has not provided that," said John Forelli, portfolio manager for the John Hancock Core Value Fund. "So people are taking profits instead of buying stocks." 
A positive report from Sun Microsystems failed to entice any buying. Sun fell 25 cents, to $12.12, despite posting a smaller-than-expected loss for its fiscal second quarter and raising its revenue expectations for the third quarter to $3.2 billion from $3.1 billion.
Fears that the struggling retailer Kmart would file for bankruptcy protection also weighed on investors. Kmart, trading near a 40-year low, rose 18 cents, to $1.74. --------------------

Treasuries Mostly Rise
By Reuters
 Treasury securities erased early losses and turned mostly higher yesterday as softer stocks prompted investors to cover short positions before the holiday weekend.
The rally reversed early weakness prompted by the University of Michigan's January consumer sentiment index, which jumped to its highest level in a year, and stimulated debate on whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at month's end.
But the selling tapered off as traders covered short positions in preparation for the long weekend. The bond market closed early yesterday and will remain closed on Monday in observance of the Martin Luther King's Birthday. 
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 10/32, to a price of 100 28/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.88 percent from 4.93 percent on Thursday. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 21/32, to a price of 100 9/32. Its yield fell to 5.36 percent from 5.40 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Founders Say the Idea For Talk Was Sound 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
In the spring of 1998, Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Disney's Miramax films, pitched a bold idea to Tina Brown, then editor of The New Yorker magazine. He offered to back her in a new magazine of her own, partly as a source of new material for Miramax movies and books, and she jumped at the chance, as she later recalled..
 Yesterday, Ms. Brown admitted defeat and said Talk magazine was suspending publication. But she insisted the magazine and its premise were still sound. 
 "It was a very great, great idea to start a new general interest magazine like this," Ms. Brown said. "The book company has been very, very successful and I am very proud of that, too," she said, noting that Talk/Miramax books has had four best sellers. She said the magazine had helped the film company in less obvious ways. "There are all kinds of ways, in bringing in talent and ideas that they didn't have before -- the talent pool is refreshed by the connection."
Yesterday, however, others in the magazine industry wondered if the venture was doomed from the start. Some wondered whether a film company could ever find enough material to outweigh the heavy losses of a start-up magazine and, for that matter, whether there was room on newsstands for a new general interest publication at all.
Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at UBS Warburg, said that he still accepted the premise that a magazine might be a source of book and movie ideas, giving publishers and producers a first look. But he said the problem was that Talk magazine never managed to captivate readers.
"What went wrong was that the magazine never gained the kind of traction that Tina was able to get at either Vanity Fair or at The New Yorker," Mr. Dixon said. "Why am I going to make a movie about something nobody is interested in?"
The cost has been significant. The trade publication Advertising Age put Talk's losses to date at about $50 million. Ronald A. Galotti, Talk's publisher, would not confirm the figure but said, "No one went into this thing without thinking that it was going to take a substantial amount of investment."
Cooperation with Miramax proved a burden as well as a boon. When Talk ran photos or profiles of Miramax stars, many saw Mr. Weinstein's fingerprints and questioned the magazine's independence. Journalists counted Talk's articles about Miramax stars and contended that Talk covered the studio disproportionately. Talk's executives said Mr. Weinstein did not interfere unduly.
Many in the industry said the timing was wrong even before last year --and long before the advertising market darkened after Sept. 11 -- for both business and cultural reasons. 
Kurt Andersen, a novelist and former editor of Spy and New York magazines, said: "Editorially I thought they had found their stride lately. But starting a new general interest monthly magazine may be impossible. Vanity Fair was grandfathered in and is going to be around for a long time, but in a larger sense this isn't the right time to do that."
There are too many competing forms of media, from radio to the Internet to cable television, several analysts said.
Others in the magazine business said that Talk also faced more concrete obstacles. 
Mr. Galotti initially billed Talk as a magazine that would sell well on the newsstand, pledging to reach 247,000 newsstand sales a month; he never reached half that goal.
Over the last decade, newsstands had grown overcrowded, as the number of consumer magazines doubled and the amount of newsstand space stayed the same, said Dan Capell, the editor of Capell's Circulation Report. And newsstand sales must also compete with direct-mail offers of subscriptions at deep discounts to the price charged at the newsstand. 
"Their assumption was that they could dominate on the newsstand," Mr. Capell said. "I am sure they made the assumption that Tina could design covers that would appeal to consumers. It was going to be a celebrity-driven magazine, like People, one of the newsstand leaders."
Virtually the only new magazines to succeed at newsstand sales in the last decade were the men's magazine Maxim and People magazine's spinoff InStyle. . 
The consolidation of distributors in the last few years only worsened that problem by making it more expensive for magazine companies to pay for prime placement.
Without strong newsstand sales, Talk was forced to turn to the costly process of mailing offers directly to subscribers. 
Mr. Capell said paying to court subscribers through the mail made more sense during the advertising boom, when advertisers would pay heavily for each reader. But when the boom ended and each reader was worth less, other subscription-based magazines like Mademoiselle started closing, as well.
Both Ms. Brown and Mr. Galotti emphasized the accelerating advertising downturn as the reason for Talk's demise.
"It was unquestionably precipitated by 9/11," Mr. Galotti said. "The advertising recession was clearly the albatross that was too tough to carry going into this economy. If you were to point to one single factor this was it." 
Talk ended last year up 6 percent in advertising pages and up substantially in revenue, bucking the industry trend, Mr. Gallotti said. 
"But when it came to the December issue," he said, "it was dramatically impacted by Sept. 11. There wasn't, and doesn't seem to be, a light at the end of the tunnel."

HEADLINE: The United States of Enron 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"Wasn't that the best?" said a laughing Ann Richards this week, when I asked her reaction to President Bush's effort to hide behind her skirt when questioned about Enron. "It was so silly. Why didn't he just say Ken Lay was a strong supporter and gave him a half-million dollars and is a good friend, and he's really sorry Ken's in these terrible circumstances?"
 Good question. As the world knows now, George W. Bush told two lies when first asked about his ties to the top guy in what may prove the largest corporate flimflam in history. The president said (1) that he only "got to know" Mr. Lay in 1994, when in fact their relationship goes back at least to 1992; and (2) that Mr. Lay "was a supporter" of Governor Richards, when in fact Mr. Lay told TV's "Frontline" last year that he "did support" Mr. Bush over Ms. Richards in their Texas race. 
 This is the president who promised to usher America into "a new era of personal responsibility"? 
What makes the dissembling so strange is that there is no evidence of any administration illegality in the Enron affair. And yet each day brings a new half-truth or seeming cover-up. Appearing on CNN last Saturday, Lawrence Lindsey, the top Bush economic adviser and a former Enron consultant, seconded the president's effort to pin Ken Lay on Ann Richards, but somehow forgot to say what would become public four days later -- that he had overseen an administration study of the impact of Enron's travails in October. Earlier, Mary Matalin had visited the Imus show to defend her boss, Dick Cheney, but instead of vowing to open the books on the secret meetings between Enron and the vice president's clandestine energy task force, she asserted that Enron got "not one thing" from the administration's energy plan (actually it got plenty) and tried desperately to dismiss the entire ruckus as lacking an intern's "blue dress." 
Hard as it is to believe, it was only 10 days ago that Ari Fleischer declared, "I'm not aware of anybody in the White House who discussed Enron's financial situation." Now we're painfully aware that the only White House inhabitants who may not have discussed it are the president, Barney and Spot -- or so we must believe until future investigators turn up a smoking pretzel.
Washington, meanwhile, is busy debating whether Enron the Scandal is as hot as Whitewater. This should be a no-brainer. While The Wall Street Journal published an encyclopedic series of tomes to parse a low-rent Arkansas land scam to a public that never did quite understand it, everyone instantly gets an epic fraud in which arrogant high-fliers stacked the deck to fleece thousands of peons to the tune of zillions. 
For a quick cultural index of this story's allure, check out the hundreds of hotly contested Enron lots on Ebay, where the bankrupt company's stock certificates have gone for north of $200 -- a multiple of 300 times the last known value of a share of the stock itself. And, Ms. Matalin notwithstanding, this scandal is not sex-free. Not only did Enron approach Penthouse and Playboy to try to enter the porn business, as The Times has reported, but we learn in Fortune that "rumors of sexual high jinks" in Enron's executive suites "ran rampant." A nation that doted on the soap operatics of "Dallas" may have at long last found a worthy sequel in "Houston." Once the "sexual high jinks" kick in, it could play 24/7 on cable, with or without Paula Zahn. 
The Washington wisdom that Enron has no legs -- that it's not a political scandal, merely a financial one -- is based on the premise that the Bush administration didn't ride to Ken Lay's rescue once disaster struck. But what about the favors performed for Enron before the meltdown? That's as political as you can get, particularly since, unlike Whitewater, this scandal implicates both parties and the corrupt campaign finance system that makes them look like interchangeable vending machines for their often overlapping patrons.
Though the Bush administration has been in office only a year, Enron's oily fingerprints are all over its actions as well as its resumes and stock portfolios. Mr. Lay helped hand-pick the head of the government agency in charge of regulating his own business and stood to gain a $254 million corporate tax rebate in the administration-blessed stimulus bill (despite the fact that Enron used almost 900 offshore "subsidiaries" to avoid paying any income taxes at all in four of the last five years). The Enron old-boy network may even have played a backdoor role in the life-and-death matter of stem cell policy. When President Bush announced his stem cell "compromise" in August, many top researchers criticized it as an obstacle to medical progress. But miraculously the administration was able to produce an instant endorsement from John Mendelsohn of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston -- who we now know is an Enron board member whose institution received $600,000 in Enron lucre.
The Clinton Democrats had eight years of Enron exposure, and while never receiving remotely the sums that the Republicans did, nonetheless had their own contacts (and presidential golf outing) with Mr. Lay. We already know, thanks to a 1997 article in Time, that Bill Clinton nudged Mack McLarty to lend the administration's weight to an Enron bid on a $3 billion power-plant project in India, and that the Democrats received $100,000 from Enron just four days before the Indian government came through. Will Joe Lieberman, who (like two-thirds of his committee) took Enron money, revisit his own party's Enron history as well as that of the G.O.P.? According to a 1995 report in The Nation, Robert Rubin's association with Enron didn't start last year at Citigroup but dates back to his pre-Treasury career at Goldman, Sachs. Enron's Washington office is currently headed by another former Clinton Treasury appointee.
Then again, who in either party hasn't cashed an Enron check? No fewer than 71 senators and 188 congressmen have been on the Enron gravy train. All but 5 of the 56 members of another investigative committee, House Energy and Commerce, got Enron or Arthur Andersen dough. The country's chief law enforcement officer, John Ashcroft, has recused himself from the case because he too received Enron cash -- though even that ethical gesture looks suspicious, given his failure to stay out of Justice matters involving such other contributors as the N.R.A. and Microsoft. Another Congressional investigator, Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, was the single biggest House recipient of Arthur Andersen campaign money. Phil Gramm, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, and his wife, Wendy (a former federal regulator now on Enron's board), could pass for one of Enron's wholly owned Cayman Island subsidiaries. 
Harvey Pitt, the Bush administration's chief at the S.E.C., was actually an Arthur Andersen lawyer. After this week's revelation that top Andersen executives knew of funny business at Enron as early as February 2001, you have to wonder whether Mr. Pitt should be a witness in an S.E.C. investigation rather than its overlord. Was he representing Andersen at the time it first detected Enron's misbehavior? Was he in the loop? The stonewalling may have already begun, since neither the S.E.C. nor Andersen, when queried late this week, could say just when Mr. Pitt was in the accounting firm's employ. 
Whom can the country turn to for an honest investigation? Democrats and Republicans alike are so beholden to accounting-industry money that they scuttled an attempt by Arthur Levitt, the former S.E.C. head, to regulate conflicts of interest in companies like Andersen two years ago. "If ever there was a case for a special counsel, this is it," says Governor Richards, but that idea certainly has no takers in Mr. Ashcroft's Justice Department or among grandstanding Democrats. "We haven't come anywhere close to that point yet," said Mr. Lieberman, never one to surrender a spotlight without a struggle.
A top aide to Henry Waxman, another Democratic inquisitor, has called the Enron scandal "the perfect storm," and a storm this perfect is certain to muddy Democrats as well. Enron has arisen like the ghost of over-the-top Christmases past, as a jolting throwback to the untethered America of the dot-com bubble. The greed of its perpetrators, and of the enabling politicians of both parties who took their cut before the wipeout, looks even uglier against the stark backdrop of those less well-connected Americans who are fighting our war.

HEADLINE: Bush Adviser Suggests War as Campaign Theme 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Karl Rove, President Bush's chief political adviser, sought today to turn the war into partisan advantage, telling Republicans gathered here that the administration's handling of terrorism could be an important theme for the party to trumpet in the November midterm elections.
 "Americans trust the Republicans to do a better job of keeping our communities and our families safe," Mr. Rove said in a luncheon speech at the winter meeting of the Republican National Committee. "We can also go to the country on this issue because they trust the Republican Party to do a better job of protecting and strengthening America's military might and thereby protecting America." 
 Mr. Rove's comments came shortly after the party elected Marc Racicot, the former governor of Montana, as chairman. Mr. Racicot, who was selected in December by Mr. Bush to replace former Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, today dismissed criticism of an arrangement in which he will be paid by a law firm that has done lobbying for Enron.
Mr. Rove's remarks were striking given that Mr. Bush has repeatedly said the war and the fight against terrorism were not partisan endeavors -- and had no place in the political discourse. At a town hall meeting on Jan. 14 in Ontario, Calif., Mr. Bush said, "It's time to take the spirit of unity that has been prevalent when it comes to fighting the war and bring it to Washington, D.C."
In fact, Mr. Rove said in a recent interview that the president had instructed his aides: "Politics has no role in this. Don't talk to me about politics for a while."
Mr. Rove is the first administration official to speak publicly about how Republicans could capitalize on the war, and Democrats seized the comments, accusing him of using the war for partisan gain.
"If the White House is politicizing the war, that's nothing short of despicable," Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic Party chairman, said. "For Karl Rove to politicize the issue is an affront to the integrity of the entire United States military."
In an interview, Mr. Racicot said he did not interpret Mr. Rove as saying that the war has elevated Mr. Bush's political standing or could help the party.
"I didn't perceive him saying the war helps the president," he said. "I think that an unfortunate circumstance has revealed an extraordinary person who leads in a very capable way with a clarity of vision that we have rarely seen in our lifetimes." 
Mr. Rove left no doubt in his speech that he saw the war and handling of terrorism as a winning issue for Republicans. He said, "We should be proud of the record of our party" in ensuring the safety of Americans.
Mr. Rove's speech overshadowed the takeover of Mr. Racicot, 53, a soft-spoken politician. The former governor, who said last week that he would cease lobbying for his firm, Bracewell & Patterson, asserted today that he did not see anything inappropriate in drawing a salary by continuing to do other work for the firm. But he said he and the firm -- as well as the White House -- could re-evaluate the arrangement in 11 months, the time he has remaining to complete the term of Mr. Gilmore.
In the interview shortly after his election by a unanimous voice vote, Mr. Racicot lamented that his debut had been marred a bit by questions about his ethics. He said he was unprepared for what Washington demanded of its politicians.
"I don't know if I was naive," he said, "but where I come from, you presume the best in people. I think I was underexposed to those dynamics a little bit."
Mr. Racicot, who is close to the president, said neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Rove raised questions about the payment arrangement. "He never said anything about it," Mr. Racicot said. "Neither did Karl -- or anybody."
In his debut speech, Mr. Racicot said nothing about his relationship with the law firm. Instead, he heaped praise on Mr. Bush and fired some partisan shots by portraying Democrats as obstructionists.
Mr. Racicot called on his Democratic counterpart, Mr. McAuliffe, "to help stop the politics of obstruction."
And he had a message for Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader who has become a popular target of Republicans: "Have no fear, Senator Daschle. Let's get on with business."
He accused Mr. Daschle and Democrats of stalling on Mr. Bush's economic stimulus plan.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW; 
DESPITE WARNING, ENRON CHIEF URGED BUYING OF SHARES

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
More than a month after an Enron vice president warned that the company might be an "elaborate accounting hoax," Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman, used an online chat to urge employees to buy Enron shares, a transcript of the session shows.
 Mr. Lay, who apparently disposed of some Enron stock himself within days of receiving the warning, assured employees in the chat session that the company's leaders "were convinced both by all of our internal officers as well as our external auditor and counsel" that its finances were legal and appropriate. 
 In his comments to workers on Sept. 26, Mr. Lay made no reference to the issues raised in a letter he received in mid-August from Sherron S. Watkins, the vice president, warning him of serious accounting problems at Enron. Nor did Mr. Lay mention that he had asked Enron's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, to review the letter's claims. 
Ultimately, Enron restated nearly $600 million in profits over four years, largely because of the issues that Ms. Watkins had brought to Mr. Lay's attention. The earnings restatement in November, and other negative financial disclosures, put the company on the path to filing for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2. 
In Washington, the White House confirmed today that Vice President Dick Cheney met with a top Indian politician in June "about the status" of an Indian power plant project owned primarily by Enron, whose executives have been major campaign contributors to President Bush. The meeting was part of a broader administration effort to aid the troubled project by putting pressure on the Indian government.
Mr. Cheney discussed the Dabhol power plant with Sonia Gandhi, president of the opposition Congress Party in India. The plant has been an albatross for Enron as the company has fought a long-running battle with Indian politicians over the fate of the project. The discussions were first reported Friday by The Daily News in New York.
Last year, the Maharashtra state utility in India, which had agreed to buy all of the plant's output, objected that the price was too high and stopped paying its power bills. The plant was partly financed with more than $600 million in loans and risk insurance obtained from the federal Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the United States Export-Import Bank.
Today, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Cheney intervened because the administration was "looking out to protect America's jobs and taxpayers' money." He noted that Clinton administration officials had also been advocates on behalf of Enron in India.
Mr. Lay met with the vice president during the preparation of the administration's energy policy blueprint last year. The energy report reflected some, but not all, of the policy prescriptions favored by Enron.
Mr. Fleischer said that administration officials considered having Mr. Bush raise the issue during a meeting Nov. 9 with the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, but that they opted not to do so because the subject "did not rise to the president's level" and because Mr. Cheney had already intervened. The timing of that meeting would also have made it awkward for Mr. Bush to mention Enron, as it came one day after the company's huge profit restatement.
Enron and its executives have been Mr. Bush's largest campaign contributors since his first run for Texas governor in 1994, donating more than $600,000. But today, in a briefing with reporters, Mr. Fleischer brushed aside the notion that Mr. Bush decided against bringing up Dabhol because of "the appearance of impropriety."
He did, though, acknowledge that White House lawyers told Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's chief economic adviser, that Mr. Lindsey should have "no direct involvement in the Dabhol plant" because of his prior work for Enron. Mr. Lindsey, who heads the National Economic Council, was paid $50,000 in 2000 for work on an Enron advisory board.
Earlier this week, the White House said that Mr. Lindsey directed a review of the effect Enron's collapse could have on the nation's economy, concluding that it would be minimal. Mr. Fleischer said there was no reason for Mr. Lindsey to recuse himself from that study. 
"It's apples and oranges," he said. "One was a more direct involvement. The other was reviewing broader implications having nothing to do with the specifics of Enron's financing."
Later in the news briefing, Mr. Fleischer added that President Bush was "very concerned" that "the leaders of Enron took advantage of the people of Enron."
Thousands of Enron employees lost a large part of their life savings as Enron shares plunged last year. Lawyers suing the company have calculated that senior Enron executives and directors sold more than $1 billion in company stock in the last three years.
Today, investigators from the House Energy and Commerce Committee interviewed Enron officials in Houston, including Richard A. Causey, the chief accounting officer. Investigators in New York interviewed Michael C. Odom, one of several executives of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm in Houston who were relieved of management duties this week. The firm said that widespread destruction of Enron-related documents took place in October, after auditors learned that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Enron.
In the transcript of Mr. Lay's online chat, which was released today by a lawyer for Enron workers suing the company, Mr. Lay was explicit about the endorsements he said the company had received from Arthur Andersen for its complex financial transactions.
"In many cases, not only has the local Arthur Andersen office approved these vehicles, but they have also been approved at Arthur Andersen's headquarters office from some of the world's leading experts on these types of financing," Mr. Lay said. 
An Andersen spokesman said tonight that on the most significant of the deals at issue, Enron failed to provide the accountants with critical information.
Documents released this week by the House committee laid out a timeline that indicates that within days of receiving Ms. Watkins's warning about Enron's finances, Mr. Lay was disposing of some Enron shares.
But in the chat session, Mr. Lay argued that the stock was a good buy, and he suggested that employees "talk up the stock and talk positively about Enron to your family and friends."
He also told employees that the third-quarter financial results were "looking great." Three weeks later, Enron disclosed that it lost $618 million in the quarter and that it was writing down $1.2 billion of its net worth partly to reflect the reversing of some of its complex deals.
Eli Gottesdiener, the lawyer who released the transcript today, criticized Mr. Lay's comments as misleading and damaging to employees at Enron who still trusted Mr. Lay.
"This is more than a full month after Watkins is basically blowing the whistle," Mr. Gottesdiener said. "Despite all that he knows, he is not only telling people to stay put, but he has the nerve to tell people this is a buying opportunity."
This evening, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, referred questions about Mr. Lay's chat session to Earl J. Silbert, Mr. Lay's Washington lawyer. Mr. Silbert did not return a phone call.
One portion of Enron took a step toward getting a fresh start tonight when a bankruptcy court in New York approved the sale of the company's flagship energy trading business to UBS Warburg.
Under the deal, Enron will get one-third of the profits from the trading operations that UBS Warburg is taking over through a licensing agreement. UBS Warburg will pay nothing upfront for the acquisition of the trading business, which was once responsible for about 90 percent of Enron's revenue. 
In Texas, meanwhile, a former Enron executive, Max Yzaguirre, resigned as chairman of the state's public utility commission, a casualty of Enron's collapse. For weeks, Texas Democrats have blasted Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, who accepted a $25,000 campaign contribution from Mr. Lay one day after he appointed Mr. Yzaguirre in June. As chairman of the utility commission, Mr. Yzaguirre had considerable influence over policies involving electricity deregulation.

C5)Photo: An unidentified investigator with the House Energy and Commerce Committee at the Enron headquarters in Houston yesterday. (Associated Press)(pg. C5) Chart: "Reassuring Words"Following are excerpts from a Sept. 26 online question and answer session involving Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, and employees. Enron shares, which closed at $25.15 that day, would rebound to nearly $37 over the next two weeks before the company began its slide into bankruptcy court. QUESTION -- Why is there not a present initiative to have our management encouraged (with muscle) to buy Enron stock? MR. LAY -- I have strongly encouraged our 16B officers who are required to make public disclosures of their stock trades to buy additional Enron stock. Some, including myself, have done so over the last couple of months and others will probably do so in the future. But, I'm sure you can understand that many of our senior management, as well as many of our employees, have been badly damaged financially by the drop in Enron's stock price as well as the overall stock market, and have certain limitations as to how many of each stock they can purchase at this time. My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have. QUESTION -- Mr. Lay -- Enron has been aggressive in the use of SPV's special purpose vehicles collateralizing future cash flows for the sake of present earnings. I couldn't help but notice our auditor, Arthur Andersen of Houston, recently admitted guilt and paid the largest fine ever for criminal falsifications related to SPV's on behalf of another large Houston corporation. You are a man of integrity, so my question is a chance for you to so reassure us we have no such problems here at Enron. MR. LAY -- To begin with, I can assure you that I or the Board of Directors, would not approve the use of any SPV's or other type of financial vehicles unless we were convinced both by all of our internal officers as well as our external auditor and counsel, that they were legal and totally appropriate. That is the standard that we have used for as long as I have been with Enron, and we will continue to use. In many cases, not only has the local Arthur Andersen office approved these vehicles, but they have also been approved at Arthur Andersen's headquarter office from some of the world's leading experts in these types of financing. In addition to both approval internally and externally, certainly I or the Board also apply the concept of what appears to be right, using a great deal of experience and common sense. And I believe overall, this has led to both creative transactions, which are beneficial for the company and its shareholders, as well as an abundance of safeguards that what is done is totally appropriate and acceptable. QUESTION -- In addition to working hard at our jobs in order to make Enron more successful, what can we, as employees of Enron, do to help increase our stock price? MR. LAY -- In addition to what I said to an earlier, similar question, I believe that the other thing employees can do is talk up the stock and talk positively about Enron to your family and friends. In part, because there have been so many short sellers of the stock over the last several months, there have been all kinds of reckless and unfounded rumors about Enron and the financial condition of Enron. To the extent that our employees begin repeating those rumors and spreading those rumors to other employees as well as family members and friends outside the company, it gives them a level of credibility that they do not deserve.

QUESTION -- How's the third quarter looking? MR. LAY -- The third quarter is looking great. We will hit our numbers. We are continuing to have strong growth in our business, and at this time I think we're well positioned for a very strong fourth quarter. (pg. C5)

3M PLANS TO ELIMINATE 2,500 MORE JOBS

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which cut 6,000 jobs last year, said yesterday that it would cut 2,500 more jobs in the next year. "These are tough and unusual times, and I don't see the negative global economic situation abating any time soon," 3M's chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said. 
The company, which is based in Minneapolis, announced the job cuts as it reported that its profit for its fourth quarter fell to $387 million, or 98 cents a share, from $447 million, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier. The results included a $103 million pretax charge related to job cuts and accelerated depreciation and a $73 million pretax gain related to the company's successful appeal in an antitrust case.

Volume Three:
Fighting for Freedom, 1937-1946.
By Robert Skidelsky.
Illustrated. 580 pp. New York:
Viking. $34.95.
 WINSTON CHURCHILL, Britain's last lion, paid scant attention to how the war against Hitler would be financed, and even less to postwar economic arrangements. That was the bailiwick of John Maynard Keynes, the most influential economist since Adam Smith and Churchill's de facto chancellor of the exchequer in World War II. When Keynes wrote his impassioned outburst against the Versailles Treaty in 1919, he warned that "vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp" if the victors insisted on impoverishing the vanquished. After he was tragically proved right, Keynes's "one overriding aim" was for the Allies "to do better than last time."
They did, and did so in no small measure because of Keynes's genius for persuasion. Like Churchill, Keynes was one of the century's great communicators. "Does he belong to our species?" asked one enchanted listener. "There is something mythic and fabulous about him. I sense in him something massive and sphinxlike, and yet also a hint of wings. One of the later and more elegant Greek sphinxes, then, it must be."
As it happens, the sphinx earned only a couple of brief references in the lion's six-volume memoir. "Fighting for Freedom, 1937-1946," the third and final installment of Robert Skidelsky's magisterial biography of Keynes, brilliantly rounds out the historical record by digging far deeper than earlier biographies into treasury and diplomatic archives. In depicting Keynes's last decade, from the publication of his revolutionary "General Theory" in 1936 to his death four months after the Bretton Woods conference in 1946, Skidelsky shows how the onetime Bloomsbury aesthete, Cambridge don, intellectual enfant terrible, art patron and stock speculator gave his all in Britain's struggle for survival, and in the process left the world a better place. "This is a story, above all else," Skidelsky writes, "about Keynes's patriotism."
In the opening scene of this compelling drama about the power of fearless cerebration, the famous author of a book warning that invalidism is the normal state of modern economies is himself an invalid. Suffering from incurable heart disease, the 55-year-old Keynes has seemingly settled into early retirement at his country estate, Tilton (where, incidentally his biographer now lives). Cared for by his charmingly eccentric wife, the Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova -- a "fairy princess who acquired the solid qualities of a nurse" -- Keynes plays the landed squire. He watches his sheep being sheared, frets about his dogs, spends hours in bed browsing rare book catalogs and firing off letters to newspaper editors and instructions to his broker ("Don't hang on to the maize"). 
Amazingly, a German miracle drug and Churchill's call to arms gave Keynes a new lease on life just two years later. While he shared his generation's horror of war and was once called "the 'spiritual father' of appeasement," Keynes never, in fact, entertained the delusion that the "brigand powers" could be pacified. As Skidelsky shows, "he loathed the Nazi regime, never visited Germany after 1933 and never drew attention to the success of Hitler's economic policies." Before long, the rejuvenated Keynes was working 12-+ and 14-hour days without pay or portfolio in a room at the treasury and, with Lydia on his arm, practicing shuttle diplomacy via steamship as Britain's chief negotiator in Washington. 
Keynes's first challenge was figuring out how to finance the war without eviscerating Britain's market economy. Those who associate Keynesianism with the stagflation of the 1970's will be surprised to learn that Keynes was an inflation hawk in World War II. His "General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment," a brief for tax cuts and public works during slumps, was inspired by the Great Depression. But with the government deficit soaring and unemployment shrinking fast as Britain geared up for war, Keynes identified the problem as too much, rather than too little, demand. His prescription? Fiscal restraint. When an American disciple expressed shock, Keynes shot back, "You are more Keynesian than I am." 
Skidelsky has another surprise in store for those who think of Keynes as the patron saint of big government. Keynes's "How to Pay for the War" was a blueprint specifically designed to preserve personal freedom and prevent Britain from being turned into a centrally planned "slave" state. Shown a rationing plan, he said sarcastically, "The policy of fixed prices plus having nothing in the shops to buy -- an expedient pursued for many years by the Russian authorities -- is undoubtedly one of the very best ways of preventing inflation!" Though some of his ideas were adopted, his proposal to rely on compulsory savings (to be paid back after the war), in lieu of confiscatory taxes, price controls and rationing, was ultimately defeated by the Labor Party, which saw wartime controls as the first, desirable step toward socialism after the war.
Keynes's second challenge was to negotiate Britain's wartime loans in Washington. Here Skidelsky imparts a provocative twist to his narrative by emphasizing the rivalry "between Britain and America for postwar position which went on under the facade of the Grand Alliance." Skidelsky, a Tory peer as well as the professor of political economy at the University of Warwick, shares the sentiments of revisionist British historians like John Charmley who argue that Britain made a mistake in throwing its lot in with America and accepting the American terms for aid. "Churchill fought to preserve Britain and its empire against Nazi Germany," he writes. "Keynes fought to preserve Britain as a Great Power against the United States. The war against Germany was won; but, in helping to win it, Britain lost both empire and greatness." 
Using the calm of war to reflect on the turmoil of the coming peace (as he used to joke), Keynes then turned his attention to postwar financial and trade arrangements. Here, too, his ideas shaped the debate, as he argued that if America wanted an open trading system and the liberation of Britain's colonies, it had to provide large cash infusions to war-ravaged countries. His proposal for an International Clearing Union to overcome the economic conflicts of the 1930's framed the debate that ultimately led to Bretton Woods and the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Keynes died before the Marshall Plan got under way, but his vision was crucial in its creation.
The Eton-educated Keynes liked to think of his countrymen as Greeks living in an American "new Roman empire," but found negotiations with Americans "exhausting and exasperating."+ "I always regard a visit to the U.S. as in the nature of a serious illness to be followed by a convalescence," Keynes wrote to a friend, complaining that America's capital was full of "utter boobies" who spoke incomprehensible legalese ("Cherokee"). Yet he never wavered from his belief that "the New World had to be yoked, and kept yoked, to the Old World, if the latter were to enjoy durable peace and prosperity."
Skidelsky asserts that Keynes's faith in America's good intentions explains "what otherwise might seem inexplicable, namely the deference Britain paid to American wishes, both during and after the war, and its failure to exploit crucial elements in its bargaining position -- like fighting a more limited war, or even making a separate peace with Germany." Here Skidelsky's otherwise nuanced analysis veers into implausibility. It stretches credulity to think that Britain and the United States would really have wound up on a more nearly equal footing after the war, as Skidelsky implies, had Keynes succeeded in clawing back more of Britain's war costs or gotten the Americans to agree that Britain could retain its interwar system of imperial trade preferences. 
Skidelsky contends that "the way Washington managed the flow of lend-lease supplies had the effect, and possibly the intention, of leaving Britain dependent on U.S. help after the war on whatever terms America chose to impose." This may be true. What is unconvincing is his broader claim that "the terms on which American help was rendered to Britain during the war would decide whether or not Britain remained a great power." Most historians agree that the war merely accelerated the dissolution of Britain's empire. And although Britain's peacetime options were surely circumscribed by external debt piled up during the war, as well as by the termination of its special trade and currency relationships with former colonies, the terms of American aid simply could not have accounted for the huge gap in economic clout at war's end. America's population, after all, was four times as large, its economy four times as big and its factories 50 percent more productive. 
Indeed, Skidelsky's emphasis on Keynes's foreign policy role misses the far more likely cause of Britain's failure to keep pace with the war's losers, Germany and Japan, in the decades following World War II -- namely, Britain's disastrous postwar experiment with socialism. He does note, however, that Keynes had curiously little to say about the infamous Beveridge "cradle to grave" social security plan, which inaugurated that experiment. Keynes focused exclusively on the plan's affordability, ignoring its potential for wreaking havoc with incentives and efficiency. "The battle lines on social policy were being drawn up which have raged ever since," Skidelsky writes. "Keynes's incuriosity about this battle is itself curious. The truth seems to be that he was not interested in social policy as such, and never attended to it."
Keynes once referred self-deprecatingly to his own writing as "the croakings of a Cassandra who could never influence the course of events in time." But by the time his diseased heart finally gave out, he had placed his stamp on policy more than any economist before or since. Despite oversights and mistakes, his influence was enormously positive. The open trading system and the institutions created at Bretton Woods contributed to the greatest period of prosperity that the world has ever known. The continuing debate over who was to blame for Britain's decline notwithstanding, British living standards rose faster in the half-century after the empire was lost than before. 
By portraying Keynes as a man of action as well as ideas, Skidelsky has, as he hoped, "rescued Keynes from the economists, and placed him in the world of history where he properly belongs." Skidelsky has not only achieved a masterpiece of biographical and historical analysis, but demonstrated that Keynes attained his own stated ideal of economic thinkers as "the trustees, not of civilization, but of the possibility of civilization."

 CORRECTION:
A review of "John Maynard Keynes. Volume Three: Fighting for Freedom, 1937-1946" on Jan. 20 dated the Bretton Woods conference on international finance incorrectly. It was in 1944, not 1946, and Keynes's death in 1946 followed by four months the ratification of the conference's agreements, not the conference itself.

 SCIENCE, TRUTH,
AND DEMOCRACY
By Philip Kitcher.
219 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $29.95.
 PHILIP KITCHER is a distinguished philosopher of science who is well known for several books, including "Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature" (1985), "The Advancement of Science" (1993) and "The Lives to Come: The Genetic Revolution and Human Possibilities" (1996). His goal in "Science, Truth, and Democracy" is to equip the philosophy of science with the ethical dimension it still largely lacks: we need to rebuild the great house of science so that the views of the people can guide decisions about the goals, and the financing, of research. The issue is not new, but it has a new urgency and visibility as the Human Genome Project gathers speed. (Kitcher prefers to call it "the genomes project," because we should not forget that it works on a bundle of DNA fragments drawn from a number of distinct individuals.)
Kitcher's central thesis can be put in a sentence: democracy should guide science in its search for truth. And his principal concern is with the "should": with the moral constraints on science; with how science should be run. But before he can take this up, in the second half of the book, and make explicit policy recommendations, he has to moderate an old argument about truth and objectivity that still rumbles on inside philosophy of science, just as it does throughout the humanities.
On one side we find the relativists, the subjectivists, the antirealists, the postmodernists. They say the strangest things. They say that there is no such thing as the way the world is, considered as it is in itself -- i.e., independent of ourselves and our concepts. They say that the idea of objectivity, the idea that science aims at and sometimes attains the truth about how things are, is incoherent -- a foolish bauble left over from the babyhood of thought. They say that all we really do, when we do science, is spin a great system of sentences, and although we like to think these sentences state how things are, we are wrong. The sentences play only with one another, they don't connect to reality, they're not made true or false by the way the world is. According to Richard Rorty, one of the high priests of this church, "only a sentence can be relevant to the truth of another sentence." So don't appeal to the way the world is, for there is no such thing.
This, or something like it, is still the dominant view in vast areas of the humanities. But when Rorty says (so blithely) that only a sentence can be relevant to the truth of another sentence, a sentence like "Millions of human beings were murdered in the 20th century" comes to mind. For what makes this sentence true, and is therefore relevant to its truth, is not other sentences in a web of sentences, but the strictly nonlinguistic fact that millions of human beings were murdered in the 20th century. "Twenty million people have died of AIDS." "The sea is salty." "The World Trade Center has been destroyed."
Might the nonsense be less bad if it didn't build in such an astonishing contempt for the reality of human suffering? I think it would be just as bad, but Kitcher doesn't get as cross as I do. He is, in his own phrase, a modest realist, a gentle, ingenious debater, brilliant at taking over the fragments of good sense in the excesses of his opponents and finding mild, true uses for their slogans, thereby voiding their rhetoric. He fully endorses their insistence that the practice of science is penetrated by human interests, and shaped by moral and cultural values. He wholly agrees with them that scientific progress is not a rarefied, autonomous accumulation of truth, but is grounded in particular social contexts, contingent on the accidents and biases of past preoccupations, successes and failures. He even co-opts the chic claim that "we make the world" rather than confronting a world independent of us. It is quite true, he says, that we profoundly transform our natural and cultural environment by our scientific discoveries and by the technologies and worldviews to which they give rise. In this sense we do make our world, and have always done so -- all the way from stone axes to quantum computers. But none of this puts in question the realist notions of truth and objectivity, or science's claim to represent the way the world is.
With his "modest realism" unassailably in place, Kitcher moves on to the ethics and politics of science. He quickly dispatches what he calls the theology of science with its "myth of purity," according to which the pursuit of knowledge is an absolute good, to be curbed only by a ban on inhumane methods (here he cites the wickednesses of the Nazi doctors and the 1932-72 Tuskegee syphilis experiments, in which black men in Alabama were left untreated "for the sake of science"). There is, as he says, no overriding right to pursue knowledge for its own sake, quite independently of the consequences. Still less is there a duty to do so. There must be constraints on the aims and targets of scientific inquiry, and not just on its methods. Kitcher quotes Tom Lehrer's famous lines: " 'Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? / That's not my department,' says Wernher von Braun."
So what should these constraints be? Should we ban certain types of inquiry in order to protect existing schemes of values? Kitcher takes the question seriously, but points out that such regimes are most unlikely to work. The deepest "shocks to our self-esteem" have come from apparently innocent quarters. It was an attempt to reform the church calendar that led Copernicus to eject us from the center of the universe, and it was a passion for cataloging exotic organisms that led Darwin to put us in our place as a species of primate. And Freud, when he came to the conclusion that we are not even masters in our own house -- our own minds -- was simply trying to find an effective treatment for the spectacular emotional difficulties of upper-middle-class Viennese women.
So how should we manage scientific research in a democratic society? What should guide us? Kitcher takes the problem right down to the root, where he turns up Socrates' old question, the first question of ethics: How should we live? What makes a life go well? He launches himself straight at it, undeterred by 2,000 years of argument, and lays out a neat scheme for its answer before returning to the specific question of how to regulate scientific research. Here there are many difficult questions of detail, and Kitcher addresses them with delicacy and dialectical sophistication, setting out his ideal of "well-ordered science": a democratic system that would create and gather information about the "tutored personal preferences" of the citizenry and feed it into the vast institutional engine of science. It is at best an ideal, as he says, and he spends some time considering how it might have a regulatory role in an imperfect world.
WHEN Kitcher asks his fundamental questions -- What exactly is the goal of scientific inquiry in a democratic society?" "What is the collective good that we want inquiry to promote?" -- one may flinch. It sounds too limited and efficient, too threatening to pure, blue-sky research. It's hard not to regret the 1993 decision to scrap the Superconducting Supercollider in Texas, which would have advanced (but at vast expense) our understanding of fundamental physics. But Kitcher persuades, by patient argument, that new forms of accountability and direction are required. He is as concerned as anyone to preserve all the necessary freedoms; but he insists that we need more controls on the practice of science, that we need them now and that we will have to make certain sacrifices.
"Science, Truth, and Democracy" is an outstandingly good book; it flashes with the steel of reason. It is, however, highly condensed, and not always easy to take in at a single reading. Sometimes the dialectic is a little oversprung, and one is unsure where one is in the exchange of point and counterpoint. But Kitcher has almost perfect aim when it comes to what really matters. The book as a whole is a remarkable illustration of the sheer force of thought, the conceptual firepower, conferred by successful training in philosophy. (Some years ago, The Economist reported on a survey, conducted over 19 years, that showed that philosophy students scored at least five percentage points above average in admission tests for professional and graduate schools in America. No other subject matches that.) Perhaps the relevant government officials should be enrolled in Philosophy 101 and kept there until they can follow every move in "Science, Truth, and Democracy."

 Down and Out,
On the Road
The Homeless in American History.
By Kenneth L. Kusmer.
Illustrated. 332 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $35.
 The current recession comes on top of a nationwide backlash against the homeless, who, even as their numbers grow to alarming new levels, face diminished forms of public relief and a multitude of laws against panhandling and living on the streets. So it is a pleasure to announce that the homeless, who have so little else, have at least gained, in Kenneth L. Kusmer's excellent "Down and Out, On the Road," a history of their own.
Homelessness predates the Republic, to judge from the colonists' fretful efforts to control the "rogues, vagabonds, common beggars and other lewd and disorderly persons" in their midst. But, Kusmer argues, it was the Civil War that gave vagrancy its first big boost. Although the war was expected to inculcate "the stern, unyielding discipline of the camp," its immediate effect was to accustom a generation of men to riding in trains, camping out and foraging for food. The word "tramp" originally described a military foraging expedition; a "bum" was a soldier who foraged a little too enthusiastically. And of course, the war left many men too damaged -- physically and psychologically -- for normal, settled forms of work.
The expansion of the nation's rail network in the late 19th century made hoboing a marginally viable lifestyle for the intermittently unemployed. In the hobo jungles that grew up along the tracks, a kind of counterculture arose, in which "you share and share alike in true fraternal style," leading some to imagine that America's tramps were not just "utterly depraved savages," as the affluent usually saw them, but members of a secret Communist conspiracy. Displaced African-American men found a relatively nonracist haven in the hobo world; even gays and women tramped. In 1902, the leader of a "large and dreaded band of marauders and tramps" in Monroe County, N.Y., was discovered, upon arrest, to be a woman.
While poorer people were likely to help the homeless with a nickel or a meal, the educated middle class tended to view such handouts as the very source of vagrancy. Charity "reformers" targeted charity itself, campaigning against the practice of giving to beggars and insisting that all forms of help be tied to work, or at least to psychologically redemptive make-work projects. Even the Salvation Army came under attack, at the beginning of the 20th century, for encouraging pauperism by "tempting many weak and weary men and women to relinquish the hard struggle to provide for themselves," and leaders of the social work profession went so far as to advocate arresting the Army's bell-ringers under anti-begging ordinances. 
Some of the late 19th- and early 20th-century tramps were indeed conscientious objectors to the world of work, opting for what one called a "freedom undreamed of in factories." College students rode the boxcars for fun and cheap transportation; the young Sherwood Anderson, James Michener and Louis L'Amour all sampled the tramping life. For middle-class men, hoboing served both as an alluring counterpoint to the tame, middle-class, male, breadwinner ideal and as a warning of the fate that awaited the man who strayed from accepted male behavior.
But Kusmer, who teaches history at Temple University, marshals an impressive amount of evidence to show that most of the homeless did not volunteer for their condition. Economic recessions predictably swelled their ranks, and layoffs and industrial accidents kept up the supply of unemployed and broken men. The postindustrial economy of recent decades has been, if anything, even more reliably productive of the down and out, in boom years as well as bad ones, with the numbers of the homeless rising to about a half a million by the mid-90's. In our deindustrialized and gentrified cities, far fewer of the homeless fit old stereotypes of the bum: about a third are women, half are people of color and many are children.
I would have liked "Down and Out, on the Road" to go on for a few more chapters on, say, the current housing crisis, welfare reform and the recent proliferation of low-wage service jobs. But the history Kusmer relates speaks for itself: ours is a society that routinely generates destitution -- and then, perversely, relieves its conscience by vilifying the destitute.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/50 East 42nd Street; 
Ballet Dancer of a Building, Its Tower Lithe and Trim

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
NOW that the building across the street has been demolished to make way for a new tower, passers-by can better appreciate the graceful lines of the former Heckscher Building, which was put up in 1916 at the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue. Compared with the clunky office buildings that surround it, 50 East 42nd Street, as the Heckscher Building has long been known, is a ballet dancer of a structure, its setback tower lithe and trim. 
 Its builder, August Heckscher, was widely praised at the time for teaching a civics lesson in skyscraper reform. But closer inspection of real estate records suggests that he was simply making a civic virtue out of necessity. 
 In the 1910's, as traffic to Grand Central Terminal increased, development began to transform the north end of Murray Hill. A then-towering 21-story office building at the southwest corner of 42nd and Madison, designed in 1912 and demolished last year, signaled the end of the neighborhood's residential character. The building was completed in 1913, along with a new Grand Central, which replaced its outdated predecessor. 
Heckscher, who was born in Germany, had come to the United States after the Civil War and by the 1890's had achieved great wealth in various mining operations. He became interested in real estate development and in 1915 announced plans for a new kind of building. This was before the 1916 Zoning Resolution went into effect, with its requirements for setbacks on tall buildings to allow light and air to reach the street. The 1916 regulations were a response to concerns that buildings like the 21-story structure were causing overcrowding and ruining the city by interfering with light and air.
The only height restriction on office construction before 1916 was the economic limit of how high a building could go before elevators and other systems took up too much of the rentable space.
Heckscher's new building, designed by Jardine, Hill & Murdock, was quite different. Above a five-story base, the 27-story tower sets back from each side, 23 feet from the 42nd Street side. Heckscher told The Real Estate Record & Guide that "it will be a boon to New York if owners of high buildings will build in such a manner that each high building shall be wholly self-contained, light obtained from the outside on each facade."
The 23rd floor was built with a squash court for tenants, who could also use terraces along the top, and the peak of the tower was illuminated. 
In 1915 The New York Times praised Heckscher for his early adoption of the ideas for setback towers. If built to the density of the conventional building across the street, the Heckscher Building at the time could perhaps have had double the floor area it wound up with.
"The average structure put up on this site would no doubt have shot up flush with the building line," The Edison Monthly magazine said in 1917. The building was divided into small and medium-size offices. Directories of the 1930's and 40's list tenants like the National Father's Day Committee and the Sky Writing Company of America. 
Heckscher cut a large figure in the New York of his time, though sometimes in ways he must not have welcomed. At the time Heckscher was building, he had a 111-foot-long, $80,000 yacht, the Cabrilla. He had been on the defensive for at first supporting the German side in World War I. And in 1918, a year after the United States entered the war, Heckscher sued two women for $500,000 for saying that his yacht had spied every morning on American shipping and that he had reported to German agents. He dropped the suit after receiving an apology.
After the passage of the 1916 Zoning Resolution, he built another Heckscher Building -- now called the Crown Building -- at the southwest corner of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, completed in 1921. Heckscher died in 1941 with an impressive legacy of public charity -- the Heckscher Museum in Huntington, on Long Island; the Heckscher Foundation for Children, at 104th Street and Fifth Avenue (now El Museo del Barrio); and playgrounds and other gifts. (A grandson, also named August Heckscher, was parks commissioner under Mayor John V. Lindsay, as well as being an author and active in many civic organizations.) 
But the widely praised design of 50 East 42nd Street may have been dictated by calculation rather than idealism. At the time it was going up, Heckscher was also constructing another commercial building, at 244 Madison, at 38th Street, battling intense community opposition from the Morgans, Peabodys and other old families who were hoping to keep that section along Madison residential. 
The building at 244 Madison was conventional in form, filling more than 90 percent of its lot and rising straight from the building line. Why use setbacks on 42nd Street, but not four blocks south?
An analysis of Heckscher's title to the 42nd Street property yields strong clues. The building at 50 East 42nd replaced five old row houses that faced Madison Avenue and were numbered 307-315 Madison. But Heckscher could secure ownership of only the central three: 309, 311 and 313. He had to lease the northernmost and the southernmost homes. 
The lease details of the southerly plot are not clear, but his 1914 lease for the 42nd Street corner required that any new building be erected so that the portion above 315 Madison Avenue -- 23 feet on Madison and 118 feet down 42nd Street -- be built "such that it can be made self-contained." 
Under that condition, Heckscher would have been required to make any tower have two sets of fire stairs, elevators, plumbing risers and bathrooms and two lobbies -- one for the main part of the building, another for the part over No. 315. 
He also faced the possible loss of any tower above the leasehold site at the end of the lease term. Such costs rose far above a civics lesson, and Heckscher and his architects chose to build only a five-story section over the leasehold sites, with the tower portion rising above only the portion for which he owned the land. 
Alan Abramson, a member of the partnership that now owns 50 East 42nd Street, said that the leaseholds were bought out long ago. His group bought the building in the 1960's, and about 10 years ago removed the dropped ceiling in the lobby and found enough of the original coffered ceiling to make molds to restore it entirely. A small plaque below a glass-covered opening in the wall identifies an original steel column with a rivet inserted by Heckscher. 
Now 50 East 42nd Street is suddenly prominent again, as the preparations for a new building give a clearer view of Heckscher's tower. The 1912 office building across the street has been demolished so a new 35-story tower, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and built by Brookfield Properties, can rise on the site. 
The new tower, which is expected to be completed in 2003, will eventually overshadow Mr. Abramson's building. But that is of no concern to Mr. Abramson, who has nothing but praise for his property. 
"It's a successful building," he said, "filling an important niche in a time of big properties, with small and medium-sized space users."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Boston; 
A Rapid Downturn in a Once Thriving Office Market

BYLINE:  By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE 

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
SURROUNDED by upscale offices, shopping and residences, the $140 million office building nearing completion at a prime downtown address, 131 Dartmouth Street, is strategically located next to a commuter rail and rapid transit station. With its cast stone and lead-coated copper accents, the red brick building has been designed to enhance the Back Bay and South End neighborhoods that it straddles.
 But what the 370,000-square-foot building does not have is tenants. That the project has not leased any space six months before it is scheduled to open reflects the rapid turnabout in the Boston office market. 
 "I don't recall a building being so advanced in construction with no tenants," said Mark Maloney, director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the city planning agency. 
But, he added: "The prospects for 131 Dartmouth Street are very good. It was hard to envision how it could fit on the site, but once it's completed, it will find tenants because it's attractive, well located and near another successful tower that recently came on line, 111 Huntington Avenue." That 931,000-square-foot tower, which is a few blocks away, is 96 percent leased, according to Claude Hoopes, senior vice president of Boston Properties Inc., its owner. 
While Boston has fallen fast and far, the region's other metropolitan office markets -- Cambridge and the suburbs -- have in some ways slid even further. By December 2001, the region's availability rate -- space being marketed by landlords and tenants for immediate or future occupancy -- was 17.7 percent of all office space, up from 5.7 percent at its peak a year earlier. 
In Boston 11.7 percent of the office space is available, up from 4.7 percent by the end of 2000; in the suburbs 21.7 percent is available, compared with 6.7 percent; and in Cambridge 20.5 percent is available, versus 1.3 percent at that market's peak in December 1999, according to Spaulding & Slye Colliers International, a full-service real estate company here. 
Of course, property performance mirrors economic activity and this region is in recession. But, Mr. Maloney maintained, the economy is not in the dire straits it navigated in the early 1990's, when property foreclosures and bank failures soared.
Indeed, Massachusetts' current unemployment rate of 4.3 percent pales in comparison with the 9.6 percent reached in 1991, according to DRI-WEFA, an economic research firm. Meanwhile, construction starts in the region's 140-million-square-foot commercial property market, projected for 2002 at about 5 million square feet, is sharply lower than the peak of nearly 11 million square feet started in 2000 but far better than the trough of 300,000 square feet started in 1993, the last year in which a downtown tower opened without tenants, said Robert A. Murray, research director of F. W. Dodge, the construction information division of the McGraw Hill Companies.
Yet, if the underlying economy is more stable and diverse than it was during the worst of the last real estate recession, the proportion of unwanted space throughout the region as a whole is somewhat greater. In 1991, the 130-million-square-foot office market had an overall availability rate of 16.9 percent: 15.6 percent in Boston, 11.3 percent in Cambridge and 19.3 percent in the suburbs. 
THAT downturn occurred after a rash of unwise lending led to overbuilding that crippled the real estate market and shattered some major financial institutions. The current office glut has resulted mainly from overoptimistic tenants who expected continued economic expansion and leased more space than needed. In the real estate market of the late 1990's, with lenders requiring high equity ratios for construction loans, demand for offices was high and supply modest. As a result, tenants worried about being locked out of the market.
But as the recession deepened and profits shrank, tenants flooded the market with 2.2 million square feet of sublease space in 2001, compared with 200,000 square feet a year before, explained William P. Barrack, a principal at Spaulding & Slye.
For instance, the Fidelity Corporation is marketing almost 400,000 square feet of sublease space in two financial district buildings and is developing two towers at the waterfront that are still scratching for tenants. The World Trade Center East, opened in August 2000, is about 17 percent vacant while the companion west tower, due for completion this spring, still has 29 percent of the space to lease, according to the city planning agency.
As the market retrenched in 2001, Boston lease transactions fell 70 percent; average asking rents for new Class A offices -- modern spaces in prime locations -- dropped to an average of $50 a square a foot from $75 and sublease rates to about $40 a square foot. At the same time, landlords have sweetened inducements, offering prospective tenants 12 months of free rent on a 10-year lease, up from 6 months, Mr. Barrack said.
In Cambridge, where the 13-million-square-foot market has taken the wildest ride, landlords have lowered average asking rents on new offices by about 40 percent, to $38 a square foot and $30 a square foot for sublease space. Meanwhile, some developers with raw new offices, like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are converting them into laboratory and research space to feed the still hearty appetite of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies paying rents in the range of $60 to $70 a square foot, said Steven C. Marsh, managing director of real estate for M.I.T.
An economic recovery would be expected to resuscitate the office market. When profits rebound, companies will add jobs and lease more space. But, that is not likely to happen this year in the suburbs, which are laden with telecommunications, software, electronics and manufacturing companies. In the more sought-after locations of Cambridge and Boston, rich in research, health care and professional service companies, the real estate market may not slide much further since employment is actually expanding slightly, according to the state Department of Employment and Training. 
Still, job losses may continue through midyear, pushing unemployment in Massachusetts up to 5.2 percent, according to a projection by DRI-WEFA. Any recovery in 2002 is expected to be slow, with scant new construction, analysts, brokers and local officials said. 
With some luck, leasing in the Boston area will be more active by next summer, when doors open at 131 Dartmouth Street. The 11-story building was designed by Arrowstreet Inc. and is owned by a joint venture of Edward A. Fish Associates, Heritage Property Trust and Sullivan Properties, the managing partner. The one-acre site has underground parking for 725 cars.
THE project has a construction loan of approximately $114 million from HypoVereinsbank, which expressed confidence in the area. "Real estate is cyclical; Boston will bounce back," said Robert Dowling, managing director of the New York office. 
James F. Sullivan Jr., the leasing director, said asking rents are now $55 to $60 a square foot, down from a range of about $65 to $75 a square foot that was planned two years ago.
The building's facade features sections on Floors 1 through 4 that bow outward and a curved element above the entry that reaches to the roof. The entire structure steps back as it rises, with five stories on Dartmouth Street, clad in the red brick characteristic of South End town houses, to 11 stories faced with ivory cast stone echoing the midrise office and retail buildings of the Back Bay. The one and a half story lobby will have a clear glass wall to let in light, said James P. Batchelor, a principal at Arrowstreet.
An optimistic Mr. Sullivan has pinned his hopes for the building on the most basic of real estate marketing principles. "It has location," he said. "It's next to the train station with the highly desirable South End residential neighborhood on one side and the offices of Back Bay on the other so companies can attract a work force that want the walk-to-work urban lifestyle."

HEADLINE: ART; 
Sleepy Museums Are Waking Up

BYLINE:  By R. W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
GENERATIONS of Connecticut students can recall a field trip to a house museum. It was better than Miss Cooney's algebra class but not as good as a snow day, a low-key peek at the past but not a stirring experience.
 House museums -- a smattering of cultural artifacts set up in a historic dwelling -- occupy the quietest corner of the cultural world. But in Connecticut that is slowly changing, as developments in museum management make their way to these smaller institutions. 
 In some cases the Connecticut museums have relatively new directors, who are well aware of the blockbuster exhibitions and savvy marketing that have made New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and other big-city institutions the popular sites they are today. But in others, executives who have been on the job for years have begun adopting newer methods of doing business.
For example, house museums are increasingly competing with each other and with larger cultural institutions for precious tourist dollars, visitors and financing. They are renovating their properties, focusing on homely improvements like parking and rest rooms but also adding or upgrading gift shops.
In addition, they are revamping presentations with the latest techniques in historic research and interpretation -- explaining the social and economic contexts in which art and artifacts were created, to make it easier for visitors to understand and relate to American history.
William Hosley, executive director of the Antiquarian & Landmarks Society since 1998, may be one of the best examples of the aggressive leadership style that is infiltrating the world of Connecticut museums. The society, a Hartford organization founded in 1936, owns nine historic houses across the state. These include the 17th-century Joshua Hempsted House in New London; the Nathan Hale Homestead in Coventry; and two Victorian manses -- the Isham Terry House and the Richard Upjohn House -- and the Butler-McCook Homestead, all in Hartford.
"The most popular heritage destination for Connecticut school children is Sturbridge Village, which is in Massachusetts," Mr. Hosley, 46, said recently at his Hartford office. "We'd like to change all that."
He added: "It's important to reach out to new audiences. There's a new sense of mission at many traditional historical organizations."
In part, this is because of new leaders like Mr. Hosley. Other institutions, like the Connecticut Historical Society, have also hired new executives recently. Marjorie St. Aubyn has been executive director of the Lockwood-Matthews Mansion in Norwalk for less than two months. But even museums with more entrenched leadership are changing their ways.
Mr. Hosley pointed out that his group, as well as the Lockwood-Matthews Mansion, the Mark Twain House in Hartford, and the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme -- a boarding house in the 19th century where American impressionist painters including Childe Hassam spent summers -- all have major development campaigns. The money goes to refurbishing properties and creating and upgrading amenities, like the gift shops. But it also pays for revised presentations.
For example, Jeffrey Andersen, director of the Griswold Museum for 25 years, said, "We're in the process of returning the house to what it was in 1900, so we can tell the story of American Impressionism as it was being born and brought along, in and around this place."
"We used to walk through houses pointing out Chippendale chairs, and that was it," Mr. Andersen added. "Now we tell stories that people want to hear."
The new attitudes are noticeably more sophisticated than the old. Mr. Hosley is working with other Connecticut groups to attract more visitors to Hartford's cultural attractions, using that city's most famous historical figure, Mark Twain, as a lure. "If Hartford is a heritage mall, the Mark Twain House is its anchor tenant," Mr. Hosley said.
Mr. Hosley is a 1977 graduate of Middlebury College and earned a master's degree from the Winterthur program in early American culture in 1980. Before he came to the antiquarian society, he was curator of American decorative arts for 17 years at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, one of Connecticut's preeminent museums.
At the atheneum, he organized several exhibitions including "The Great River: Art & Society of the Connecticut Valley," and "The Japan Idea: Art and Life in Victorian America." He has also written numerous scholarly articles and books on decorative arts, as well as "Colt: The Making of an American Legend" (University of Massachusetts Press 1996), about the Colt family, which built its firearms empire in Hartford.
His first major project at the society was to raise nearly $1 million to refurbish the Butler-McCook Homestead at 396 Main Street in Hartford. Beginning in 1782, four generations of the Butler-McCook family -- lawyers, doctors, teachers and businessmen -- lived in the house. But the distinguishing feature of the property, Mr. Hosley said, is that the family never threw anything away. And so their documents, furnishings and family photographs provide a window into American social history.
"This is the oldest house in Hartford and one of the best-documented houses in America, with a history beginning in 1705," Mr. Hosley said. "But you wouldn't know it from the way we used to present it."
Renovation of the property is under way, including repairs to the house and the construction of a history center in the former 19th-century medical office of Dr. John McCook. The house is scheduled to reopen in June, with a dramatic presentation of the family saga, Mr. Hosley said.
"We'll reinforce the relationship between the house and its Main Street environment, and with the rest of Hartford," Mr. Hosley said.
The exhibition will introduce visitors to 300 years of Main Street history as experienced by four generations of Butlers and McCooks, he said.
The money for this project came primarily from private sources.
"Connecticut has invested $66 million in the arts in recent years, but very little of that money went to heritage projects," Mr. Hosley said. He estimated that when the complex is complete, it will attract 11,700 visitors a year. If each visitor spends an average of $75 while in the Hartford area, that will mean $877,500 a year in tourism income, he said.
In addition to upgrading the society's holdings, Mr. Hosley is working with the Greater Hartford Arts Council and the Connecticut Humanities Council to try to attract more tourists to Hartford, which is also home to the Connecticut State Capitol and the Museum of Connecticut History.
"The greater Hartford area has historic attractions that any city would love to have," Mr. Hosley said. "We have to get that message out."

HEADLINE: OUT OF ORDER; 
Working From Home, I Think

BYLINE:  By DAVID BOUCHIER; E-mail: liorder@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FORTY MILLION Americans pretend to work at home. They have escaped the drudgery of commuting, they don't need to wear respectable clothes or make-up, or to shave or even to shower every day. Neurotic colleagues and hysterical bosses are a thing of the past, and a person who works at home is safe from the kinds of bathetic office romances that you see on daytime soap operas. He also gets to watch all the daytime soap operas.
 About a third of all office workers say they would prefer to work at home. But nobody has done a survey of people who actually do work at home, to find out how many of them dream about going back to a real office. 
 I've been dreaming about a real office. Ten years ago I abandoned my regular job and my daily commute and became self-employed. I was a stingy employer and, for reasons of economy, I set up my office in the spare bedroom.
It was wonderful, at first. My commute was reduced to the distance from the kitchen to the bedroom, and my time seemed to be my own at last. But I soon ran up against the universal curse of the home office. Trying to work at home is a complete waste of time.
Our four cats loved having a full-time caretaker, and constantly demanded attention by killing my computer mouse or shredding my files. All through the "working" day I was distracted by telephone salespeople offering life insurance, gold cards, replacement windows, cheaper heating oil or Caribbean cruises. A steady stream of repairmen passed through, pretending to clean the oil burner, fix the leaking roof, cut down trees, decongest the plumbing or hunt for termites. When the house was quiet for a moment, the presence of beds and sofas offered a constant temptation to nap. Then there were all those small domestic tasks, like replacing light bulbs, splitting logs and rinsing out cat-food cans, that had to be done before settling down to real work.
Often I was interrupted by Tony, the UPS man, with an interesting package, or by my favorite magazine arriving in the mail. At the end of the day, I abandoned my overflowing "in" tray and returned home by simply walking into the kitchen and switching on the radio, so I could gloat over the traffic reports.
This is the kind of workday most people dream about. The trouble was, there was no work in it.
But now my life is transformed. To celebrate 2002, I have acquired a proper office in which to exercise my genius. It wasn't easy. When I walked into the local real estate office and told the nice ladies what I kind of space wanted, they were full of enthusiasm and started pulling files out of the cabinet. Then I told them my budget. They laughed loudly and pulled out a new set of files -- ancient and dog-eared with use. The rents were incredible, and the locations were appalling. I was offered rooms in people's basements, converted garages, a derelict cottage for $950 a month. I considered renting a self-storage locker and just moving in with my desk. But even this was beyond my budget.
At last, by luck, I found the ideal office space under a bookstore in Port Jefferson, and grabbed it. But then I was the proud possessor of an empty room with power outlets. To make it into a workspace, furniture and equipment had to be added. The stuff in my home office was too old and dilapidated to be exposed to the public gaze, so I began hanging out in places like Office Max and Staples, where acres of serious office furniture are on display.
Most of it was too grandiose for my taste. People who buy office furniture seem to suffer from a lack of self-esteem, and want to imagine themselves as C.E.O.'s of a big corporation. I looked at dozens of "executive style" fake mahogany desks with names like Windsor and Prestige, and massive high-backed fake leather chairs like those used by international villains in old James Bond movies.
Some of the small office equipment was tempting. I almost bought a time clock (just $259.99), so I could keep track of my own chronically unreliable work habits. I also fancied a small water cooler, around which I could chat with my colleagues, if I had any. But in the end I settled for garage-sale chic.
I'm proud of my new office. The old computer matches the old furniture, the borrowed bookcases are full and I've set up an ancient coffee machine that I found in the basement at home. The cat from the neighboring cafe has taken to visiting, and seems to anticipate food. The office is in the middle of the village, so I don't feel isolated any more. Friends have started to drop in for free coffee, even though (or because) Starbucks is just across the street. Having a bookstore upstairs is a constant though pleasant distraction. It really is a treat to pack my briefcase in the morning and go to the office.
Back home, my old office has been restored as a spare bedroom. It looks very comfortable and domestic. But there is an empty space under the window where a small desk might fit, just big enough to hold my laptop. Then perhaps I will be able to get some work done, at last.

HEADLINE: A 'Help Wanted' Sign Fails to Stir Much Help 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
WHILE many large employers in Connecticut are laying off employees, Electric Boat is putting on a major push to hire 500 to 1,000 workers this year to build nuclear-powered submarines at its shipyard in Groton. But the company is not having much luck finding workers.
 Electric Boat, in a partnership with Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia, is starting to co-produce the Navy's next-generation Virginia-class submarine, which Electric Boat designed. That will boost shipyard employment by at least one-third this year alone, and more in coming years, depending on how much new construction and repair work the company is awarded. 
 Company officials said that one problem it is having with attracting workers is the perception that wild swings in its workload have historically brought an unending cycle of layoffs and rehiring. Workers in the area haven't forgotten that. 
"The challenge, of course, is to be able to provide workers with an opportunity to be here for a long time," said Michael W. Toner, the president of Electric Boat. "I'm really not interested in bringing people in only to have to lay them off after a year or two."
The other problem is the state's economy. Despite a recession that has hit the rest of the nation, Connecticut isn't doing too badly and unemployment is comparatively low, at 3.2 percent in November. It was 5.8 percent nationally and 2.3 percent in the New London area.
"Connecticut will perform stronger than the country in the recession that is going on now, and the southeastern part of the state will perform even better than the rest of the state," said Peter M. Gioia, an economist with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. "There's an awful lot of positive economic activity in three different sectors down in that area."
Mr. Gioia said in addition to Electric Boat, the two casinos in southeastern Connecticut are expanding, and Pfizer has opened a major pharmaceutical research complex in New London. 
"That's going to create labor demand that's not only going to affect southeastern Connecticut, but Rhode Island and the rest of Connecticut," Mr. Gioia said. "It is a problem, but when you're in a recession, it's a great problem to have."
A decade ago, Electric Boat painted over the sign outside its personnel office that told people where to apply for a job. Now the welcome mat is out, however. Executives have made presentations to local schools, business groups and other organizations where it is trying to spread the word that the shipyard is hiring again. Included in its pitch is a short video in which existing workers talk about how rewarding it is to build the high-technology warships.
"Ten years ago I think we would have laughed at the thought of making a video like this," because so many people wanted to work at Electric Boat, said Robert Nardone, the company's vice president for human resources. "Times really have changed for us."
Mr. Toner said the company is hoping to avoid layoffs by working with the Navy to bring in not just new submarine construction contracts, but repair work and other jobs that can stabilize the workload.
Cynthia Clegg, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Southeastern Connecticut, said she is encouraged by the company's efforts not to bring on a lot of people at one time, which would only raise the specter of layoffs down the road.
"It's not just Electric Boat. Look what's happening now in the financial services industry -- some companies just expanded beyond what they should have, and it was not smart expansion," Ms. Clegg said. "We need to keep in mind what happened in the 1990's and take the smart-growth approach. Nobody really wants those cycles to come back."
At one point, Electric Boat was the largest employer in the state, with about 25,000 employees, including more than 20,000 at its Groton shipyard. But that was during the 1980's, when the United States was squared off against the Soviet Union, and the Navy was ordering four or five submarines a year.
Then, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, defense spending declined. The Navy ordered only four attack submarines during the entire decade of the 1990's, and Electric Boat's employment dropped to about 9,000, most of it in its ship design bureau. Employment in construction jobs in Groton dropped to 1,500 people.
Now, the company is building two of the new submarines in Groton. The Navy plans to build a total of 30. The company is looking workers who include pipe fitters, electricians, painters and shipwrights. Hourly wages range from $9.50 to $17.50. Company officials said they are willing to train anyone with a high school education.
"If you know reading, writing and arithmetic, we can teach you all the rest," Patrick J. Bullard, chief of training and education for Electric Boat. "A graduate of a technical school would definitely be better prepared, but it is not a requirement."
The company has started to bring in small groups of new employees every week to start three weeks of training in the general skills that workers will need: how to read blueprints; how to work safely in an industrial area, and how to understand the alphabet soup of acronyms that are used around the yard. Classes that can hold 15 people have been about half full.
Mr. Bullard said new employees also learn how to use the computers that have become commonplace throughout the yards, which track the use of material, monitor progress of certain jobs, and run some of the production machines, much to the surprise of people who still have visions of World War II-era industry when they think of shipyards.
"We're trying to break some of the old models. People still think of us as the old Kaiser Liberty Shipyard, but we're not like that," Mr. Bullard said, referring to the old yards that built many of the ships for World War II. "It's a cleaner, safer place. We have laser guided and robotic welding machines. It's a different environment."
In one recent indoctrination class, George C. Clark, an instructor who was a pipe fitter before he was brought in to teach the indoctrination course, explained how to tell from a diagram what kind of material a pipe joint is made of, and what kind of testing it will have to undergo.
One of the students, Marie A. Brainerd of North Windham, said she was working for a company putting together lights and sirens for emergency vehicles when she heard about the Electric Boat openings.
"I was ready for a new challenge, because I was bored with my old job, but I still wanted something that would take advantage of my background in electronics," Ms. Brainerd said. The prospect of layoffs, she said, was not something that would have stopped her from taking the job.
"That's a possibility in most places that people work today," she said. "But I don't think this is a bad time to be looking into a job like this. I think this is a pretty good time for defense."

HEADLINE: Little Has Changed, Except the Population 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
FOR nearly two centuries, the small town of Sherman has lived a relatively anonymous existence, and that's the way residents not only like it but strive to keep it.
 After all, this is a community where neighbors still check on one another to make sure they are O.K. The firemen's ball is one of the biggest social events of the year, and a stranger with an honest face may be asked to mind a store if an employee needs to step outside. 
 It's this Norman Rockwell flavor along with a good school system and relatively cheaper land and lower taxes that has long made residents treasure their town. But in the past decade, those same qualities have also been responsible for more than 1,000 people moving here, earning Sherman the distinction of being the fastest growing town in the state. 
Not everyone is happy about it. 
While Connecticut cities like Hartford may be struggling to make a name for themselves and maintain or increase their population, residents of this northern Fairfield County community would rather no one had heard of the town.
"It's like that good restaurant that you find down around the corner," First Selectman Arthur von Plachecki explained. "You don't want everyone to know about it so when you want to go there for dinner you can get a reservation."
In fact, Mr. von Plachecki, who contributed to the population boom by moving here in 1993, hesitated to be interviewed for this article.
"It's our kind of secret little corner of the world," he said. "I really didn't want everyone to know about it."
According to the United States Census, it may be too late for that. From 1990 to 2000, Sherman saw its population surge from 2,809 to 3,827, an increase of 1,018, or 36.2 percent. Colchester was the second fastest growing town, with its population rising 32.5 percent.
What's interesting is that Sherman is an out-of-the-way community. The closest urban center, Danbury, is about 20 miles away, or about a half-hour drive, depending on the traffic and time of day. But while it may seem remote, Sherman's expanding population is symbolic of a trend that is sweeping the state, according to Robert G. Cromley, director of the Center for Geographic Information and Analysis at the University of Connecticut. 
"That's where all the growth is occurring, is out of the way places," Mr. Cromley said.
Mr. Cromley said an analysis of the census data shows people are looking to move from the cities and inner ring suburbs to the fringe of metropolitan areas, where they can find more space and cheaper land. It's becoming easier to do because most families have multiple cars, he said.
"With everybody working and everybody having more freedom of movement, it's allowing the population to move farther and farther out," he said. "And people are choosing lifestyles that are more kind of rustic, so to speak."
Though it does not lack sophistication, Sherman certainly fits the image of a quaint New England community with its historic 19th century downtown village. 
Tucked between the New York border and the northern shore of Candlewood Lake, the town, which celebrates its bicentennial this year, has road signs that warn motorists of bridle path crossings and monthly jazz vespers at a local church are advertised by a homemade sign that is plopped down on a stretch of grass at the town's main intersection.
There are horse farms and stone walls and waterfront communities that offer sweeping views of Candlewood Lake. And, as Katie Harrison, a real estate agent, put it," Sherman has "one of everything."
There's one traffic light. One bank. One grocery store. One gas station and one school. There are two churches in town, and, she added, "There's definitely more than one town gossip."
The town is so small that when a reporter recently tried to interview a cashier at the historical society's gift shop, the employee said, "Do you have two seconds? Great. You're in charge," before running across the street to use the bathroom.
And when a neighbor of Janet Goldberg, a retired social worker who moved here last year from Pelham Manor, N.Y., hadn't seen Ms. Goldberg in a while, the neighbor called to make sure she was O.K.
"When does that happen?" Ms. Goldberg asked. "I think that's wonderful."
It's that sense of community that convinced Mr. von Plachecki to settle there. A self-described corporate nomad, Mr. von Plachecki moved to Sherman from southern California after his company, Aetna, transferred him to Westchester County. He has since retired, but he and his wife decided to remain in Sherman.
"We have lived here longer than anywhere we have lived in 40 years of being married," he said. 
"I think it's the people," he explained of his decision to stay. "I think that it's one of the few places left that still has a real sense of helping your neighbor, of volunteerism, of being concerned with what's going on with the community."
While that may have been the reason why Mr. von Plachecki moved here, it was the town's low crime rate, median household prices and school system among other things that prompted Connecticut Magazine to name Sherman the best small town in Connecticut three times in the past six years. The rating was based on a comparison of communities with populations that are less than 4,700.
According to the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, the median sales price for a home in Sherman in 1999, the most recent year available, was $266,250, compared with $565,000 in Darien and $580,000 in Westport, two other Fairfield County towns. In the same year, Sherman residents were less likely to be a victim of a crime. The crime rate there was 10 per 1,000 residents compared with 14 in Darien and 24 in Westport. Darien topped all three towns in the results of the Connecticut Master Test given to eighth graders in the fall of 1999, but the other two towns were close behind and all were well above the state average.
Ms. Harrison and her business partner, Kathy Fazzone, said the publicity from the magazine helped attract attention to Sherman.
"That seemed to bring in a lot of young families," Ms. Fazzone said. 
Suddenly the town, which has long been a popular summer and weekend retreat, became an outer ring suburb. 
The Sherman School, which serves grades K-8, has had its enrollment nearly double in the past 10 years, jumping from 255 to 480, said Daniel J. Murphy, the school's principal.
The growth meant the town had to do a much-needed $10 million school addition and renovation, which included a new library media center, more classrooms, a computer lab, full-size cafeteria and kitchen, Mr. Murphy said. 
The popularity of Sherman also has put pressure on longtime landowners like Richard and Bill McGoldrick, brothers who have received inquiries from developers. The McGoldrick's are third generation Sherman farmers, who specialize in beef and hay. Between them, they own 150 acres. 
"It's kind of heart breaking to see how much development there is," said Richard McGoldrick, 64, who has lived in Sherman his entire life. "We're trying our best to keep it from developing any of our property but we just hope we can hold out."
His 70-year-old brother, Bill, who worked for J.P. Morgan before he retired in 1989 and returned to Sherman to help with the farm, gave 35 acres of his land to a local land trust this year. He said he hopes to give more in the future. 
And the growth has meant that the town has lost some of its close-knit feel, longtime residents said. 
When John O'Connor moved here in 1961, if a "strange car went through town, everybody knew," he said.
These days, people actually complain about traffic. Route 37, which runs through the historic center of town, has become so busy that Anda J. Styler, an acrylic painter and resident, said she no longer goes there to paint because "there's a million people driving by." 
Yet the town still seems rural to newcomers like Mrs. Goldberg. Her husband, who was raised in Brooklyn, is still trying to adjust to things like the absence of street lights. 
"He's never lived anywhere in his whole life where you couldn't walk out the door and see at night," she said, laughing.
That's just one aspect of living in a rural community. And, as Michael Crawford, a selectman, said, "If you like small towns, you'll love Sherman."
Just do the town residents a favor. Don't tell anybody about it.

HEADLINE: Newsday Leads Trend Toward Thin Papers 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY 

DATELINE: MELVILLE 

 BODY:
FOR Newsday, Long Island's hometown newspaper, 2002 got off to a lean start.
 The paper began the new year by shrinking from three sections to two on weekdays, eliminating 48 pages of news content each week. Last week, hundreds of employees received buyout offers intended to cut 50 to 100 jobs. 
 Industry analysts say that papers across the country are suffering from reduced advertising revenues in the current economic downturn -- the worst advertising drop for newspapers since the Great Depression -- and are being forced to make cuts. But analysts say no other paper of Newsday's size and stature has cut back as far. 
"We've seen some nipping and tucking, with papers folding some sections into others," said Douglas M. Arthur, a newspaper industry analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "But I can't think of any top-10 newspaper making that significant a reduction in coverage."
No one suggests that the changes are a sign of impending doom for Newsday, which is read by more than 577,000 people daily and more than 675,000 on Sundays, making it the eighth-largest newspaper in the country. Newsday, which has won 16 Pulitzer Prizes, is widely regarded as one of the nation's best newspapers and acts as a powerful civic institution on Long Island, which has 2 counties, 13 towns, 2 cities, 95 incorporated villages and no real center.
But the recent changes have rattled workers worried about their jobs and readers concerned about the paper's quality.
Veteran employees are mulling their options, and younger, more recently hired workers fear that they may be subject to layoffs if not enough people opt for buyouts.
"Sure, people are worried," said Dennis A. Grabhorn, the president of Local 406 of the Graphic Communications International Union, which represents most of Newsday's employees. "Right now, nobody knows what the future holds." 
Newsday eliminated 50 jobs last year, part of about 1,400 positions that were cut throughout the Tribune Company, which acquired Newsday when it bought the paper's owner, the Times Mirror Company, in June 2000.
The Tribune Company, the nation's third-largest media corporation, also owns The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times, 8 other daily newspapers and 23 television stations, including WPIX, Channel 11 in New York. Knight Ridder, the nation's second-largest newspaper chain, reduced the work force at its 32 daily newspapers, including The Miami Herald and The Philadelphia Inquirer, by about 2,000 people.
The New York Times Company, which owns this newspaper, The Boston Globe and 16 other papers and 8 television stations, cut its work force by about 1,200 last year, including about 400 positions at The Times itself.
"Earnings are down, and companies are responding rather aggressively across the country," said John Morton, a Maryland-based newspaper and media industry analyst. "What will be interesting to see is if there is a recovery, will they restore what they cut?"
Stuart Vincent, a spokesman for Newsday, said the paper hoped to see pages return eventually but had not determined if it would ever try to revive the three-part format. "Our publisher has said all along that the newspaper industry is cyclical, and right now we're at the bottom of the cycle," he said. "It's just a question of when it will come back."
Raymond A. Jansen, the publisher, and Anthony Marro, the editor, declined to be interviewed for this article, but in an article published in Newsday last month about the cuts, Mr. Jansen was quoted as saying, "To keep the company healthy we have to shrink." He added that even though there would be fewer sections and pages, the quality of the paper would remain high. "I don't think it will be that noticeable," he said.
But some readers were not persuaded. One of them, Michael Kaminer, wrote an angry letter to the paper and said Mr. Jansen's comment that the reductions would not be "that noticeable" was "an insult to the intelligence of your readers."
In an interview, Mr. Kaminer, the owner of a public-relations company in Manhattan, said the elimination of two sections -- one on Wednesdays about computers and electronics, the other on Thursdays, a guide to live music and the regional club scene -- was very apparent to him as a reader.
"A lot of the things in these Part 3 sections were what made people like me really enjoy reading the paper," he said, adding that he already missed a column on interesting Web sites and articles by music and dance critics.
"When you travel, you see that a lot of papers elsewhere all seem to carry wire copy and then run just a few local things that really give the paper and the place some character," Mr. Kaminer said. "I don't think Newsday is anywhere near be coming that, but I hate to think that might be where it's headed."
In addition to eliminating the Wednesday and Thursday sections entirely, Newsday has slimmed down what used to run in Monday's Business Report, Tuesday's Discovery section on science, medicine and health, and Friday's Real Estate section, and folded what remains into Part 2, the traditional features section of the paper. Capsule movie reviews have been eliminated from the weekly television guide, and stock tables on most weekdays have been reduced to one page from the previous four to five pages. The Saturday stock tables, reporting on Friday's markets, were eliminated in 1996.
Mr. Vincent said the 48-page reduction would affect all of the paper, including local, state, national and foreign coverage, and sports, business and entertainment news. He said there would be significant savings on paper and delivery costs, but he did not give a specific amount. When there were three sections, the second and third sections were printed and delivered to dealers first, and the trucks would make a second run to deliver the front section. Now the entire paper will be delivered in one run.
Robert M. Johnson, the publisher of Newsday from 1985 to 1994 and now the chairman of Bowne & Company, a Manhattan printing company, said he could understand the decision to eliminate the third section of the paper. The section was added in 1997, when the boom times of the 1990's translated into heavier advertising. Some of the cutbacks, like the technology coverage, mirror cuts other papers have made as technology advertising has fallen sharply.
"If they never attracted the advertising support they wanted, I could see cutting back there," Mr. Johnson said of the third section. "On the other hand, I think cutting back on the stock listings and on other general coverage is a real mistake. That makes the paper less complete and makes it a less valuable newspaper."
Being able to find stock listings and broad coverage of news in Newsday, he said, makes it easier to persuade readers that they need no other newspaper. "Cutting that many pages is a far more fundamental decision than just cutting staff," he said. "It changes the look and feel of the newspaper. And I'm disappointed as a reader."
Newsday is no stranger to upheaval. In 1995, the Times Mirror Company shut down New York Newsday, the paper's foray into the New York City market. About 800 jobs were lost then, but Newsday maintained a city edition and a newsroom in Queens.
While the latest cuts are no doubt prompted by the listless economy, several Newsday reporters said there was a general feeling that the cuts would have been less severe if the Tribune Company had not been the corporate owner. The Tribune Company has a reputation for guarding the bottom line with greater zeal than Newsday's former owner, Times Mirror, and last year's cutbacks at Newsday, which resulted in early retirement for about 50 workers, were part of a corporatewide effort. Last November, the company also announced salary cuts for top executives at all of its businesses and a wage freeze for 18,000 nonunion employees.
Fred Bruning, a reporter for Part 2 and a vice president of Local 406, said that although the impending buyouts might be advantageous for some employees, the loss of those workers would be felt by those who stay. "Because the Tribune feels a need to reduce staff, there will be some very familiar faces and valuable people who are apt not to be here," he said. "And the operation as a whole is diminished by that." 
Gary Weitman, a spokesman for the Tribune Company, said that while there was no formal freeze, hiring would be limited to critical functions. He would not say whether 2002 might bring layoffs but instead reiterated a statement the company made when it announced the salary reductions and freezes in November.
"We said then that the Tribune would further reduce corporate expenses and that all of the company's business units would implement further cost-saving measures," he said. "We have a reputation for being a very efficient company, and we've always prided ourselves on that."
He added that Newsday was the only Tribune paper so far to eliminate sections.
The Tribune Company reported last month that its revenues for the first 11 months of 2001 were $4.8 billion, down 7 percent from $5.1 billion during the same period in 2000.
Some media experts said that despite the loss of some coverage in Newsday, they are heartened by the paper's recent efforts to expand its reach by entering into partnerships with WPIX-TV, Channel 11; News 12 Long Island, the Cablevision station; and WALK-FM. In all three cases, reporters from Newsday produce broadcast segments as well as articles that will be reported in the next day's paper.
Abby Kenigsberg, a journalism professor at Nassau Community College, said she saw these efforts as Newsday's attempt to make the paper into a recognizable brand in a variety of media, a move that was part of a bigger trend nationally.
"If less money is coming in, then you have to reassess your services," she said. "Like all other communications companies, they're pulling back, but at the same time, they're expanding into other technologies, including the Internet."
Ms. Kenigsberg noted that some of the features that have been cut from the newspaper, like music and television listings and a real estate advice column, would be available on Newsday's Web site. "So they're not dumping information," she said. "They're just putting it in a way that's more cost-effective, and they're gently redirecting the reader."
Robert W. Greene, a retired Newsday assistant managing editor who is now the chairman of the journalism department at Hofstra University, said that while some of the changes might be jarring to readers, most would adjust, just as they had in past reconfigurations. "The newspaper business is always contracting and expanding," he said.
Mr. Vincent, the Newsday spokesman, said the cutbacks would not affect the effort to increase circulation and improve coverage in its New York City edition, which is sold primarily in Queens. The paper announced plans to bolster that edition last year and increased the staff for that edition from 45 to 60 people.
Mr. Greene said it was important that Newsday had no plans to pull back in the city. "So even if they're contracting in one area, they're still poised to make a move in another if the same contraction is hurting The Daily News or The Post," he said.
Newsday's franchise on Long Island remained intact, he added.
"Newsday will always be a profitable newspaper because it has an absolute monopoly over three million people," Mr. Greene said. "It's their regional newspaper. It'll always be there."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island; 
Buying a First Home: How the Times Have Changed

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE 

 BODY:
WHEN Laura and Philip Carey purchased their first home last year, their motivations were much the same as those of average first-time home buyers in Long Island of about 30 years ago: own a house where they could raise a family in a good school district. But three decades have brought significant differences in the pursuit of that dream, starting with the purchase price. 
 Unlike many married women in the 1970's, Laura Carey, who is 37, will continue working after her baby is born in April so she can help to pay for the $320,000 four-bedroom colonial in South Huntington. The price is considered average for Long Island but is affordable to the Careys only if both of them work. And the Careys are at least 10 years older than the typical first-time home buyer of the 1960's and 1970's. 
 "We had both been scrimping and saving for a house for years, and family members helped us," said Mrs. Carey, an administrator for a software company in Melville. Her husband works in the floor-covering business in Manhattan. The 36-year-old house was way over their budget, she said, but it had just been totally renovated and had a brand-new kitchen and a fireplace. 
"It had everything we didn't think we could afford," she said. "Any other house we looked at in that price range would have required at least $50,000 of fixing before I could be happy." 
In the mid-1960's, Trudy and Adam Gaus, who were then in their 20's, were able to purchase their $22,500 three-bedroom cedar-shaked ranch house in Hauppauge on Mr. Gaus's $12,000-a-year engineer's salary. The newly built house had a full basement, a den with a fireplace, an eat-in-kitchen and a dining room. Mrs. Gaus gave up her job as an art teacher and stayed at home to raise her two sons. This year, she said, a similar house in the neighborhood sold for $350,000. 
Specialists in Long Island's demography say the profile of the average first-time home buyer has drastically changed since the late 1960's.
"Back then, the value of a house was twice that of the median income and was affordable on one salary," said Roy Fedelem, principal planner at the Suffolk County Planning Department.
"Between 1980 and 1990, all that changed -- the house prices tripled," he said. "While the income went up as well, it wasn't enough, and that's when we had a problem. A family with a median income could no longer afford a median-income house on one salary." 
In November 2001, the average house in Nassau County closed for $337,724, and in Suffolk for $268,836, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors.
Katy Anastasio, the principal of Anastasio Associates in Huntington, who sold the Careys their house, said many houses selling for about the average price today require extensive repairs.
"Amazingly enough, what is often considered an average house price on Long Island today is between $300,000 and $500,000, because upscale has increased to $750,000 to over a million," she said. "Many of those buying for $400,000 and $500,000 are first-time buyers in a category once reserved for second-time home buyers who were moving up."
Pearl Kamer, chief economist of the Long Island Association, a Commack-based business group, said "a gradual shift in the economy to white-collar service" over the past 30 years has added to the changing profile of the first-time home buyer.
Since the downsizing of the defense industries on Long Island in the late 1980's and early 1990's, she said, there are fewer blue collar workers in manufacturing jobs and more in white collar service jobs, encompassing a wide range of positions, including high-salary financial, advertising and technology jobs; business owners; and teachers.
In November, out of a total of 1,250,000 jobs on Long Island, 108,000 or about 10 percent, were in manufacturing, Dr. Kamer said, adding that "30 years ago it was 25 percent." 
The lifestyle changes that come with two working family members are reflected in the typical house being built, said Robert Wieboldt, executive vice president of the 600-member Long Island Builders Institute in Islandia.
According to national statistics provided by the National Home Builders Association, a trade organization based in Washington, today's homes are larger and have more amenities than ever before.
While Long Island follows national trends in home building, it tends to be more traditional in design, primarily staying with the colonial format or ranch style, Mr. Wieboldt said. 
According to the association, the average square footage of a new single-family house has increased about 50 percent nationwide since 1970, to 2,265 square feet from 1,500. Also, houses built with two or more stories have increased to 52 percent from 17 percent; two or more bathrooms to 54 percent from 15 percent; one or more fireplaces to 59 percent from 36 percent; and central air-conditioning to 85 percent from 36 percent. Houses built with brick or wood siding decreased to 35 percent from about 70 percent, while vinyl or aluminum siding increased to 40 percent from 8 percent. 
"The mind-set was different years ago," said Dorothy Herman, president of Melville-based Prudential Long Island, which has 37 offices on Long Island. "Construction, rather than cosmetics, was more important. Unlike today's buyers, they wanted finished basements and brick houses, and they weren't as concerned about closet space. People were willing to buy something, add to it and fix it over the years to the way they wanted it. They would buy, raise a family, save their pennies and maybe add that extra bathroom."
Today there is more immediacy. "First-home buyers don't want to wait," she said, "and they are more into aesthetics, high ceilings, entertainment space, home offices and saunas in the master baths."
Twenty years ago homeowners entertained in their finished basements; today they want entertainment centers. It used to be important to live near Main Street, she said, while today that doesn't matter.
According to a consumer survey "What 21st Century Home Buyers Want," conducted by the home building association, walk-in pantries and linen closets top the list of desired features today. A dining room and laundry room are musts, but a separate living room is not as important as a family room. High ceilings -- at least 9 feet rather than the traditional 7 or 8 feet -- are important on the first floor.
The homes of the future will look much like today's new homes but will have more amenities and features making them safer, more comfortable and energy-efficient, builders say. 
Projecting from current consumer demand, builders expect that by 2010 the average house will have the master bedroom and laundry room on the main floor; a flexible interior design with space that could easily be converted for a variety of purposes, including a home office; security systems; modular wiring systems for high-speed data access; multiple telephone lines; and building materials and products that require less maintenance. 
Thirty years ago most people buying a house of Long Island came from an apartment in Brooklyn or Queens, Ms. Herman said. "Those buying today," she added, "already came from a big house and don't want to sacrifice and wait 20 years to have what their parents had."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Despite Worst U.S. Vacancies in 30 Years; 
Flat Year Seen For Hotels Here

 BODY:
The hotel occupancy rate in New York City fell 10.6 percentage points last year, averaging 73.3 percent, and is expected to remain near that level this year, according to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm. 
 Hotel operators have been cutting prices to attract customers, so the average daily price in New York City fell to $191.70 in 2001 compared with $222.37 in 2000. 
Any increase in occupancy this year will probably come at the expense of prices, officials of the firm said. 
 Nationwide, according to the study, hotel occupancy is expected to decline again this year, falling to the lowest level since 1971. Last year the nationwide average occupancy rate fell to 60.3 percent from 63.7 percent in 2000. This year the firm expects the decline to continue to an average occupancy rate of 59.6 percent, the lowest level in more than three decades. 
According to the national forecast, no segment of the hotel industry will grow in occupancy until 2003, when an increase in demand and only a 0.8 percent growth in the supply of hotel rooms is expected to push the occupancy rate up to an average of 60.8 percent.
The firm said the leading factors weighing on occupancy rates were a decline in travel caused by the recession, the increasing inconvenience of air travel, the increased possibility of airline delays and fears over the safety of traveling.

HEADLINE: Pumped-Up Gyms Stretch and Flex 

BYLINE:  By CARIN RUBENSTEIN 

 BODY:
HANGING on to a pull-up bar while she struggled to do 15 sets of leg lifts, Michelle Croce, 30, admitted that belonging to the Saw Mill Club in Mount Kisco was not cheap. 
 "There are other clubs to join, but this one has everything," she said recently. Because she goes to the club three times a week, and working out is so important to her, Miss Croce, a nurse in White Plains, said that only a major financial disaster would make her consider dropping her precious health club membership. 
 In this recession, that's exactly what anxious health club owners in Westchester are desperate to hear. Indeed, they'd like to persuade every member to continue paying for a place to get fit, arguing that it is not a luxury, but a necessity -- one that shouldn't be sacrificed. 
"People will go to health clubs even when things are bad, because they still want to look good and feel good," said Jerry Janda, editor of Club Industry, a trade magazine for health club operators. "Clubs have become not only a place to work out, but a place to be seen and to socialize." Bill Beck, general manager of Club Fit in Briarcliff, agreed. "People see us as part of their lives, like brushing their teeth," he said. "It's one of those things you can't do without."
Many health clubs are betting on just that notion. 
Health club operators in Westchester are investing millions of dollars in their businesses, even in a rocky economy. They're renovating old clubs as well as building new ones, while facing increasing competition from one another and from nonprofit clubs, most notably Y.M.C.A.'s. The result is a heated competition for members, which has engendered some belligerent sniping among neighboring clubs and impassioned criticism of the tax-free status of the county's upscale Y.M.C.A.'s. 
The focus of the fitness clubs' business plans is changing from recruiting to retention as club owners are learning that they can make more money by keeping old members than by attracting a never-ending supply of new customers. They're luring their loyal members into paying additional fees for children's programs and sports leagues, summer camp, private and group lessons, personal trainers and massages, and into spending at on-site cafes and pro shops. And they have row upon row of popular aerobics machines, like the elliptical trainer that allows users to climb stairs with a gliding motion.
During the next few months, the first Westchester branch of Synergy Fitness will open in Hartsdale, at a cost of $1.5 million. The chain, with headquarters in Manhattan, is ranked the 31st largest in the country, according to Club Industry, which publishes an annual rating of the top 100 largest clubs nationwide. A Curves health club opened last year in Sleepy Hollow; with 21 branches in the county, it's the fastest growing health club franchise in the country. 
This spring, a $2.5 million Solaris, a privately owned tennis and health club with a fifth branch in Hawthorne, will open its new field house in Yorktown. Across the river, a $3 million branch of New York Sports Club will open next month at the Palisades Mall in West Nyack, the sixth Westchester-area club owned by Town Sports International, with headquarters in Manhattan, which is ranked third largest nationwide.
These are just a few of about 51 commercial health clubs in Westchester, which have approximately 65,000 local members, according to Harvey Lauer, president of American Sports Data, a sports and fitness firm in Hartsdale. In addition, nearly 25,000 people belong to local Y's, according to statistics released in 2000 by the national Y.M.C.A. 
SUCCESSFUL clubs are also putting millions of dollars into renovating and improving their existing complexes. 
"We're open 364 days a year, 18 hours a day, and things get used," said Rick Beusman, owner of the Saw Mill Club. The club is closed Christmas. "You have to keep improving and replacing equipment, because people like variety and change. The years in which we don't do capital improvements are unusual.".
The club just spent $500,000 to upgrade the men's locker room and to make other improvements. Club Fit, in Briarcliff, completed a $9 million construction project there last year, adding a new pool, a children's wing, a spinning and wellness studio and a larger fitness space, presumably to pull ahead of its main competitor, the Saw Mill Club.
Competing capital improvements aside, health club owners engage in some rather vigorous backbiting. One owner asserted that his high fees limit memberships, thereby avoiding the crowded, impersonal conditions of clubs that focus more on recruiting new members than on providing quality service. An employee at one club criticized the quality of the tennis court surface at another's. An owner pointed out that at her competitor's place, members are so overwhelmed by the noise and chaos that they never get to use the overpriced club.
Whichever health club is best, most are not cheap.
Fees at local health clubs range from an annual cost of less than $1,000 for a family at most local Y.M.C.A.'s to a premium price of more than $3,300 a year for a family at the Saw Mill Club in Mount Kisco. The cost to join many of the commercial clubs is difficult to pin down, in part because they don't reveal the information readily, and also because there is usually a one-time initiation fee, along with a monthly charge. Both fees are subject to seasonal sales and bargaining, and monthly fees vary based on usage. 
For example, nannies may join the Saw Mill Club for an extra fee, over and above the family fee; at Club Fit, nannies can join without an enrollment fee and for less than a full membership, but only if they're under 25. Children under 5 are free at the Saw Mill Club, as long as there are no older children in the family, but Club Fit requires a family membership for all children under 18, regardless of age. 
Almost all members permit clubs to debit member fees automatically by electronic fund transfer. So if members fail to keep careful track of their monthly credit card charges, they may have no idea how much they spend each year on their health club membership.
Bruce Cooperstein, a chiropractor in Katonah, has a family membership at the Saw Mill Club, but he's not sure exactly what he pays each month. "There's a set fee for the four of us, but my children charge things like lunch, so I think it usually costs us between $250 and $300 a month," he said.
Affluent families who don't need to keep close track of their health club bills probably won't be affected by an economic downturn, said Mr. Janda of Club Industry. But for members of clubs where price matters, like Y.M.C.A.'s, he said, it's a different story. 
Y.M.C.A. directors are careful to point out that fitness is only a small part of what they do. In fact, Ravenell Williams, director of the Y.M.C.A. in Tarrytown, was shocked at the idea that the Y.M.C.A. might be considered a health club.
"That's like calling a church a temple," he said. "We both do religion, but our philosophy and goals are completely different."
Still, several local Y's, including those in Tarrytown and Rye, have invested millions in recent renovations and additions to their current fitness centers, only to see contributions fall drastically since Sept. 11.
"Charitable giving is on the decline, down around 40 percent for the year," said Robert W. Lap, president of the Central and Northern Westchester Y.M.C.A. At a time when Mr. Lap is trying to raise more than $4 million to build a new building in Somers, this is no small matter. 
"I'm not sure we can make it up," he said.
The possibility of a new upscale Y in Somers has nearby owners of commercial clubs bursting with resentment.
Owners of several nearby clubs are incensed that the tax advantages the Y.M.C.A. enjoys will allow the Y's to underprice membership fees and to steal the fitness market from commercial clubs.
"In upscale communities, the Y.M.C.A.'s are misusing their tax-exempt status to compete aggressively in the adult fitness industry," said Kevin Buckley, a government relations manager for the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, a trade organization, voicing the near-unanimous anger of his commercial members.
But Mr. Lap, president of the Y.M.C.A. that wants to build the new buiilding in Somers, refused to get embroiled in the controversy, pointing out that none of the club owners had criticized him directly. 
"In Somers, we're responding to community need," he said. "There's never been a Y.M.C.A. telling a health club owner what he can and can't do, but I'm not sure that's true in reverse."
While the mission of the Y.M.C.A. is to serve the community, a health club is in business to make money. 
Bally Fitness nationwide had revenues of more than $1 billion in 2000, according to Club Industry's Top 100 list. Town Sports International, which owns New York Sports Clubs, had revenues of $225 million in 2000, and even the comparatively minuscule Saw Mill Club had revenues of $11.5 million that year.
Not every health club in Westchester meets with instant success. 
A new Dolphin Fitness Club, the third in the county, has been set to open in Sleepy Hollow for a year, said Mayor Philip Zegarelli of Sleepy Hollow. The space is full of exercise machines and recruiters there have been accepting money from potential members, "coming on in a very aggressive manner," Mr. Zegarelli said. But the village refused to give the club a certificate of occupancy, because the club failed to meet town regulations, he said. The space didn't have heat and "they illegally tapped into our water lines," Mr. Zegarelli said.
So far, between 25 and 30 people have sued for refunds in Small Claims Court, having paid either $299 for a one-year membership or $329 for two years, said Larry Cassidy, a Sleepy Hollow village clerk. 
Murray Wichard, general manager of Dolphin Fitness, said the club is completing construction and is hoping to get final approval from the village and will open soon. 
The key to making fitness profitable, owners agree, is not to throw a constant stream of never-ending new customers onto the treadmill, but to instill club loyalty and encourage members to spend vigorously while working out.
"The clubs that retain the most members generate the most revenue and are more stable in the long term," said Bill Howland, director of research at International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association. "Repeat customers are less expensive than new customers." It costs about $150 to acquire every new member, he said, including sales commissions, advertising, mailings and orientation packages.
Mr. Beusman of the Saw Mill Club believes that when it comes to members, less is more. "We're not interested in high numbers," Mr. Beusman said. "We're interested in long-term members."
Mr. Beusman estimated that about 40 percent of his profits come from revenues other than member dues, including a children's preschool program and summer camp, children's parties, full-scale tennis and aquatics programs for children and adults and personal training. He also gets a percentage of the profits from his cafe and pro-shop concessions.
At Club Fit, which owns a cafe and a club store that sells exercise-related items like gel seats for spinning bikes, about 30 percent of the revenue comes from sources other than membership fees, Mr. Beck said.
IT'S not surprising, then, that club owners see dollar signs on every massage table and in each child-care corner, because they have to use their space to earn the most dollars per square foot. To a club owner, tennis courts are not good, because they require a large space for too few paying players. Juice bars are good, because they need a small room but hold many paying customers.
Children's teams are ideal, because paying customers pay surcharges to use the facilities during otherwise little-used daytime space, and instill club loyalty, dozens of families at a time.
The strategy works on Helen Pillsbury, 39, an internist in Mount Kisco. Dr. Pillsbury works out several times a week and her two daughters are loyal swimmers on the Saw Mill Club team. The girls practice two or three times a week, and their Brazilian au pair also works out at the club, for at least two hours a day.
As for dropping their club membership, at this point it's unthinkable, said their father, Andy Pillsbury, 39. 
"The girls have gotten pretty adamant about wanting to swim," Mr. Pillsbury said, adding, "We'd face a lot of pressure from them if we wanted to quit."

Clubs Lure the Whole Family With Lessons, Teams and Parties
MANY health clubs in Westchester find their own particular marketing niche. At Curves and Lucille Roberts, for instance, it's women only. At the New York Sports Club and Gold's Gym in White Plains, it's basic, no-frills adult fitness.
A few clubs in the county focus exclusively on attracting and serving families, including babies, toddlers and teenagers. 
Nationwide, slightly more than half of health clubs offer children's programs, according to a survey conducted by the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association in 2000. 
These fitness centers have adopted the Y.M.C.A.'s motto, "We build strong kids," and then taken it a giant step further. 
In several of Westchester's clubs, children can learn not only swimming and tennis, but also lacrosse and volleyball, yoga and kung fu, and even Hawaiian dancing, complete with split bamboo sticks, feather gourds and Hawaiian drums, all the better to entice parents to renew their memberships.
Like the nationally known Y.M.C.A. swim programs, most family-oriented commercial clubs offer swimming lessons for children, beginning at 6 months old.
At the Saw Mill Club in Mount Kisco, there are group and private swim classes for infants, toddlers and school-age children, as well as a competitive swim team for children of all ages. 
The club also offers children's tennis classes and a competitive tennis team. It holds daily preschool sessions, two hours a day, as well as an after-school club for older children. There are vacation mini-camps and an all-day summer camp. The club offers youth fitness classes for preteenagers, basketball clinics, birthday parties and will even hold Sweet 16 parties and bar mitzvahs.
Both the Club Fit in Briarcliff and the one in Jefferson Valley, offer similar programs, along with creative dance, kung fu and yoga classes for children. 
They also offer teenage fitness sessions, Hawaiian dancing, junior spinning and junior kick-boxing classes.
At the Total Fitness Center in Scarsdale, there are weight machines specifically designed for use by children between the ages of 5 and 10.
"We do a lot of athletic training for children," said the owner, Dave Friedman, who also offers yoga and karate classes for children.
Solaris in Yorktown, plans to begin indoor soccer, field hockey, lacrosse and volleyball leagues for children when it opens its new field house in March. There will also be sports camps in tennis, soccer, volleyball and basketball, during the school year and in the summer, said its owner, Elizabeth Gagliardi. 
"Kids here are so sports-oriented, there's a real need for it at the club," she said, "especially during the winter when they can't go outside."

Westchester Symphony Is Silenced

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS 

 BODY:
IT was an amateur orchestra and then a professional orchestra and more recently a troubled orchestra. Now it is a defunct orchestra. The Westchester Symphony Orchestra, which began in 1924 as the White Plains Symphony Orchestra, announced this week that it would cease operations. There will be no requiem. The last two scheduled concerts have been cancelled. 
 "We need $50,000, like, yesterday," said Stephanie Friedman, a Scarsdale resident and the symphony's acting director, a position she took last summer after its former management structure came unglued. Mrs. Friedman had been serving as the group's publicist when Suzanne Meszoly, its executive director, left abruptly. The orchestra's operating budget for the fall 2001-spring 2002 season was $100,000; they were unable to raise it. The symphony then postponed its first concert of the season and embarked on a recovery effort, including an attempt to become more pop-oriented. It didn't help. 
 The orchestra also cut its numbers, performing this year as a chamber group rather than the full symphony it has been in the past. Subscribers have dwindled to 350, each of whom paid $400 a season for a pair of tickets to four concerts. "We're trying to get other arts organizations to honor the tickets," Mrs. Friedman said. She mentioned the Westchester Philharmonic as a possibility.
For its first six decades, the symphony was an ensemble of local amateurs who would take breast-feeding breaks during rehearsals or dash out early to watch their children in sports. They played in local high schools and other small venues, as much for their own enjoyment as for anyone else. In the last 20 years, though, the Westchester Symphony moved toward professionalism and unionization. 
Under the guidance of two musical directors -- first Martin Canellakis, then Anthony Aibel -- out went many of the amateurs and in came open auditions, wages, sponsorship (from organizations including the Westchester Arts Council, the Altman Foundation, the New York State Council on the Arts and the Eugene Grant Family Foundation). There were noted guest appearances and a taste of the big time: a performance in Alice Tully Hall, a television appearance and favorable reviews. 
Now there is only the memory of the final note of Beethoven's Fourth, the last piece the group performed as a full symphony.
"It's a sad time," said Mrs. Friedman. 
Elaine C. Carroll, executive director of the Westchester Philharmonic, the county's other notable orchestra, echoed her regret. "The performing arts are vital to the community, and any loss is a loss for Westchester," she said. 
Many factors contributed to the downfall, according to people involved with the orchestra. There was the soured economy and Sept. 11, which made it harder to get corporate sponsorship. And the crowds that came had aged; younger people in Westchester, like younger people elsewhere, are not drawn in significant numbers to classical music. There was stiff competition in the classical repertory from the 18-year-old Westchester Philharmonic, which has nearly five times the subscriber base. The Performing Arts Center of Purchase College has been the home stage for both. 
Some say the board should have been more active. Others say the management was disorganized. But the Westchester Symphony is only the latest casualty in a troubled time for the arts; symphonies from Toronto to St. Louis are also struggling.
"It's really a matter of everything," said Shirley Fuchsberg of Rye, who is chairwoman of the board. The last few years, she said, "have been worse and worse and since September, it's been like a nightmare." 
Mrs. Fuchsberg first came to see the symphony after being invited by a friend 28 years ago. "Sometimes when you're at a certain place at a certain time, something just gets to you," she said. "This symphony just got into my imagination." She served as president before her current position. 
Alice Model, a Larchmont resident, plays the viola and has been a member of the symphony since 1964. She survived the purge of amateurs. She has served as president and also as a board member. She has probably played her last professionally, she said. "I'm 65 and I'm not a member of the union like the other orchestra members, so I'm not looking for work," she said. "I'll just play chamber music with my friends." 
Margaret Swinchoski, the principal flutist and a former personnel manager of the symphony, said the group's demise was "just another nail in the coffin of my career." Asked why the symphony failed, she said: ""I think they had to work harder on funding." 
Anthony Aibel, who became the musical director in 1992 at 22, straight out of the Juilliard School, said: "Good things come to an end. It was a wonderful, magical run."
Mr. Aibel, who lives in the New York City, now wants to dedicate himself to making classical music more tenable to younger generations. "We live in a visual age," he said. "More needs to be done to integrate the arts of film, theater and classical music." He wants to hold concerts for young people in small venues so they can sit up front and he can talk to them during the performances about the music. 
Mr. Aibel is ready to move on. "Diversify is pretty much my middle name," he said. But Mrs. Fuchsberg can't quite bring herself to accept that the symphony's long run is over. "At the end of the year, maybe we'll see what's happening," she said. "I don't know anything definite, but it's certainly on my mind to do that." But she continued: "There were just so many forces against us. There was nothing we could do."

HEADLINE: Loans That Turn a Home Into a Cash Flow 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
A DOZEN years after their introduction, reverse mortgages remain little known, and perhaps less understood. Only an estimated 60,000 to 75,000 of the loans, available to people 62 years of age or older who own and live in their own house, town house or condominium, have been made. But a number of financial institutions, seeing a marketing opportunity based on the sharply increasing number of Americans who are living longer, are vigorously expanding their reverse-mortgage programs.
 The reverse mortgage requires no financial, credit or medical reports, yet promises to put tax-free money into the hands of its borrowers. And borrowers can remain in their home without having to repay any of the loan until they sell, move out or die. 
 In addition, when they do repay, the repayment amount cannot exceed the value of the borrower's home at the time the loan is repaid. If the value of the home exceeds the amount of the loan, what is left reverts to the owner or the owner's estate. 
Depending on the reverse mortgage they choose, borrowers can receive their loans in a lump sum, in monthly payments for as long as they live in their home, from a line of credit or from a combination of a line of credit and monthly payments. 
The most popular choice is the line of credit, because it offers the borrower considerable flexibility and because interest is charged only as the money is actually borrowed, according to Bronwyn Belling, the project manager of the Reverse Mortgage Program for the AARP Foundation, an arm of what was formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons. In addition, Mrs. Belling said, the untapped balance available usually increases by the same rate as the interest that is being charged on the loan balance; if the untapped balance is $100,000 and the interest rate being charged is 10 percent, that $100,000 line of credit would become $110,000 after a year, assuming that no part of it had been drawn out. Joyce Kuhn, assistant vice president and loan officer at Connecticut's Ridgefield Bank, said that at her bank, reverse mortgage borrowers typically want access to a line of credit along with monthly payments.
Reverse mortgages are loans that, like other types of mortgages, are secured by the borrower's house or condominium. (Co-ops are not eligible for such loans, because they are technically owned by a corporation in which the homeowner holds shares.) 
The loans have ceilings, and the full value of the home is never available to the borrower. The major factors in setting the amount that can be borrowed include the home's appraised value and the age of the borrower (or, if there is more than one owner, of the youngest borrower) -- a 75-year-old will be able to receive a higher proportion of the home's value than a 65-year-old will.
Another factor in determining how much money can be borrowed is the current interest rate -- the lower interest rates are when the loan closes, the bigger the loan amount will be. Loans can be taken out in a lump sum or over time, and the interest is added to the amount that must be repaid by the homeowner when the home is sold or vacated, or by the estate when the homeowner dies.
The location also affects the ceiling on the amount of money that can be taken out of a home, because the Federal Housing Administration sets maximum amounts on a county-by-county basis around the country for the most popular type of reverse mortgage, the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage. The maximum amount for a single-family house is $261,609 in both Westchester County, N.Y., and Bergen County, N.J., and $237,500 in Fairfield County, Conn.
But there are reasons to look carefully at the details of the loans. Many people spurn reverse mortgages, loan specialists say, because of their high origination fees and closing costs. 
For example, a reverse mortgage loan on a house in the metropolitan area valued at $200,000 would net a 65-year-old borrower about $90,000 and a 75-year-old borrower about $113,000, according to Vanessa White, a vice president at BNY Mortgage in West Paterson, N.J. However, total closing costs for each borrower would be about $10,400. That consists of 2 percent of the value of the property (in this case $4,000) for a one-time mortgage insurance premium payable to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, another 2 percent for the lender's origination fee and about $2,400 for the array of closing costs, including title search, appraisal, recording fee and attorneys' fees.
That $10,400 is approximately double the average closing cost nationwide on a conventional mortgage for a $175,000 house, according to Phil Colling, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The higher fees are in part a reflection of the limited availability of reverse mortgages, lenders say, and the additional time required to complete the paperwork for relatively uncommon loans. 
The reverse mortgage costs may be financed as part of the loan, which would reduce the borrower's out-of-pocket expenses but also lower the net amount available to the borrower. 
Those steep costs are one reason the reverse mortgage loan is not generally suitable for short-term financing. Gary Schatsky, a Manhattan financial adviser and lawyer, said that in his opinion reverse mortgages are so costly that "they should not be the first, second or third choice of most people." But, he conceded, "they're tremendous for people to be able to access their equity if they have no other money to live off." 
AND there are psychological problems as well. Many people shun reverse mortgages, lenders say, because they cannot bear the thought of in effect trading in the house that would otherwise go to their children. But Mrs. Kuhn said that as many as 40 percent of the inquiries Ridgefield Bank receives for information about reverse mortgages are from adult children, many of whom are more concerned about their parents' well-being than about inheriting their house. 
While still decidedly a niche product, reverse mortgages are becoming better known largely because the major lenders in the category include subsidiaries of Wells Fargo & Company, Lehman Brothers and the Bank of New York. In addition, the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, a nonprofit trade organization in Washington that promotes the product, has made a concerted effort in recent years to get the word out. Convinced that reverse mortgages will grow in popularity over time, lenders are making reverse mortgages in more parts of the country and are seeking to make them less mysterious.
"It's a product that's greatly misunderstood by many consumers and not all that well known to lenders and bankers, but it will be soon," said Jeffrey D. Moulton, a national marketing manager for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, based in Des Moines.
Wells Fargo made reverse mortgages available last year at 1,200 of its 1,500 offices and more than doubled its reverse mortgage sales force, adding more than a dozen sales representatives throughout the Northeast, including its first one in Westchester County. As a result, the bank's reverse mortgage sales volume exceeded $300 million in 2001, just about double the previous year. 
The BNY Mortgage Company, an affiliate of the Bank of New York, was among the first to offer reverse mortgages in the New York metropolitan area. Its reverse mortgage loans have increased an average of 50 percent a year in recent years, according to Mrs. White. Last year the company made 432 reverse mortgage loans in the area, she said, including 286 in New York City.
The Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corporation, the Lehman subsidiary, entered into a partnership 15 months ago with the CUNA Mutual Mortgage Corporation, the biggest national mortgage lender in the credit union system, to make reverse mortgages available for credit union members and their families.
The fact that reverse mortgages are a mere trickle compared with the estimated 12-million-plus conventional mortgages originated last year and valued at more than $2 trillion, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, does not appear to discourage reverse mortgage lenders. 
"The way we look at it, we had a good year," said Mr. Moulton of Wells Fargo, "but we really haven't started yet." 
Moreover, reverse mortgage lenders say there has been a pronounced increase in recent months of the proportion of customers who are affluent. The main reasons, Mrs. White said, are that many people have been wary of cashing in their stock as their portfolios have sharply dropped in value in the last two or three years and many others who had been living off high interest payments and generous dividends until a year or two ago suddenly found themselves with anemic yields. As a result, some have turned to reverse mortgages.
Another reason people with money are turning to reverse mortgages, according to Jim Mahoney, the chief executive of Financial Freedom Senior Funding, whose company offers both a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage and a proprietary reverse mortgage that, unlike those insured by the F.H.A., has no loan limit, is that the loans are tax-free and the interest on them is tax deductible when they are repaid. Noting that Financial Freedom has extended loans for up to $2 million on a home valued at $6 million, he added, "Many high-end borrowers are not looking at the economic benefits as much as the security that comes with having a lifetime income."
Rudolph Clark, 76, a retired real estate salesman who lives in Brooklyn, is not one of those investors, but after taking his own reverse mortgage last March to pay bills, he is enthusiastic about the product.
The brownstone Mr. Clark bought in 1955 for $10,800 had sharply increased in value over the decades, with some nearby houses selling for seven figures. But last year he found himself $85,000 in arrears on his real estate taxes, with no means of paying them other than selling his house. Or so he thought. But after vaguely remembering having heard about reverse mortgages a few years ago and after attending a counseling session with a reverse mortgage specialist, as required by the Federal Housing Administration, he opted for the reverse mortgage. 
"I was attracted to it by not having to pay a monthly mortgage and by having money to pay my taxes," he said of the $147,000 loan that he received through Mrs. White.
His loan, the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (known as HECM and pronounced "heck-em") is overwhelmingly the most popular of the reverse mortgages, according to reverse-mortgage specialists, because it is available nationwide, insured by the Federal Housing Administration and usually provides the most money for the least total cost.
OTHER prominent reverse mortgages are the Home Keeper mortgage offered by the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and mortgages offered by Financial Freedom Senior Funding. Financial Freedom's proprietary Cash Account reverse loan is not subject to the limits on equity that can be tapped, as is the case with F.H.A.-insured loans. 
Mr. Clark paid his taxes in full with his loan and still has money for general expenses and home improvements. "This is where I've spent much of my life and where I still want to spend it until the end of the journey," Mr. Clark said. And because of the sense of security that his reverse mortgage has provided in what he refers to as his "twilight years," he is adamant in believing that reverse mortgages could do the same for many other older people who are cash poor but own a home. 
"That's why it's necessary that they be made aware of reverse mortgages," he added. "I've known people who sold their house or lost it just because they had no way of knowing about reverse mortgages."
As the AARP points out in its 68-page consumer guide to reverse mortgages ("Home Made Money," available by calling 800 209-8085), until recently there were two main ways to get cash from one's home: by selling it and then having to move, or by borrowing against the home and then making monthly loan repayments. Reverse mortgages, the guide says, offer "a third way of getting money from your home that does not require you to leave it or to make regular loan repayments."
But the booklet also points out that deciding on the kind of loan can be very complex. That is why the AARP encourages potential borrowers to attend free counseling by reverse mortgage specialists.
Nancy Bentley, one such counselor in East Hartford, Conn., said that counseling sessions usually run about an hour, but that potential borrowers often require a couple of sessions before their concerns and questions have been addressed. Mrs. Bentley added that about 75 percent of the would-be borrowers wind up taking reverse mortgages, but, lenders say, usually not until almost a year afterward. 
"Reverse mortgages are one of those things that haven't caught on yet," said Bob Ceilly, a 67-year-old real estate broker in Brightwaters on Long Island, who took out a $128,000 reverse mortgage from Wells Fargo three months ago to fix up his century-old house. He is having a new kitchen installed, after which he plans to add two bathrooms and a new heating system. 
"I've spoken to several people, including attorney friends of mine, about reverse mortgages," Mr. Ceilly said, "because I think it's a great concept. But their reaction was usually, 'Duh!' " 
He would get no such response from Sally Knakal, also on Long Island. She thinks so highly of reverse mortgages that she is on her second. She took out her first one seven years ago, when she became a widow at 62 and most of her wealth was in the equity in her house. Younger borrowers receive less money from reverse mortgages than do older borrowers, based on actuarial life expectancy tables, and Mrs. Knakal found herself running low on money sooner than expected. 
Then about a year ago she learned of the Financial Freedom Cash Account. It provides a line of credit that is not subject to the F.H.A. limit, from which consumers can borrow for as long as they occupy their home. The minimum draw is $500 and the unused portion increases by 5 percent annually until maturity.
Like Mr. Ceilly, Mrs. Knakal intends to improve her house, beginning with a new driveway this spring. 
Sam Taylor, a 73-year-old consulting engineer in Darien, Conn., also acquired a reverse mortgage from Financial Freedom, opting for a line of credit to support his business, which he runs out of his home.
"Since I have a great deal of equity tied up in my home," Mr. Taylor said, "I decided I'd like to have use of some of that money." 
WEALTH and income play no role for borrowers obtaining reverse mortgages. Instead, the amount of cash borrowers can get from an F.H.A.-insured reverse mortgage is subject to the market value of the property and loan limits that vary by county and usually change at least once a year. This year, for example, the average reverse mortgage insured by the F.H.A. nationwide is $144,336 for a single family house, but the limit is $392,413 in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii and the Virgin Islands. 
Those limits apply whether the borrower's house is worth $150,000 or $1 million. But Mr. Mahoney, who is also co-chairman of the National Reverse Lenders Association, said there is an effort by the association and the industry to have a uniform nationwide limit, rather than county by county. That will require the approval by HUD and an act of Congress, and Mr. Mahoney said the proposal appears to have bipartisan support.
Reverse mortgages are complex products, and specialists caution those interested to compare carefully the costs and benefits of various loans.
Almost like a mantra the AARP booklet warns again and again to compare, compare, compare. "It's the surest way to evaluate a reverse mortgage," said Ken Scholen, a specialist in reverse mortgages who wrote the AARP booklet. In it, he warns: 
"Most likely no one you know has ever taken out a reverse mortgage. So there's probably no one you can turn to who has first-hand experience as a reverse mortgage borrower. And very few professional advisers have any experience with these loans, either."

At that time homeowners -- or their estates -- repay both the amount borrowed and the interest that has accured on the loan.

The Power to Help

BYLINE:  By STAN KOSIEROWSKI; Stan Kosierowski is president and chief executive of PSEG Energy Technologies in Edison.

 BODY:
GIVEN our tight economy, heightened national security concerns and renewed anxiety about our supply of oil, it's time that we in the Northeast became serious about conserving electricity. Conservation is a meaningful act, just when many of us are looking for something of lasting good to do for our country. Investment in more efficient electrical equipment in our homes, offices and factories benefits us, individually and collectively, for the long term. 
 In fact, few individual acts could be more in our long-term national interest. Though oil prices have dropped 30 percent over the past several months, we all know the saving is temporary. With oil prices, what goes down, goes up. By contrast, the payoff for investing in more efficient lighting and in heating and cooling equipment is permanent. 
 First, let's see what investment in saving electricity does for the pocketbook. Let's assume that all of us from Virginia to Massachusetts -- homeowners, businesspeople and factory managers -- modernized our lighting and heating and cooling systems. Based on real experience, we each would immediately cut our electric bills an average of 25 percent. At that rate we'd recoup any investments within two years from lower electric bills -- or sooner still with utility and state rebates factored in. For the region as a whole, the aggregate annual saving would be measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Reducing electrical use by that same 25 percent in each home, office and plant would cut regional power consumption by a whopping 133 million kilowatt hours. That could be enough to enable us to shut down dozens of power plants and cut our oil imports from Saudi Arabia by more than half. Greater energy self-sufficiency translates directly to greater national security and maneuvering room in global diplomacy. 
Another winner is the environment. That same 25 percent regional saving in electricity would reduce sulfur and other emissions by thousands of tons a year as well, easing the global warming threat and improving the air we breathe. 
Too often we nod approvingly at new rebate programs for investing in energy-saving lighting but don't take advantage of them. We perk up at news of a new more energy-efficient heater or air-conditioner, but we don't pursue it. It is estimated that 90 percent of the Northeast Corridor's homeowners and 70 percent of its businesses could very readily achieve that 25 percent saving simply by taking action. 
Rebate offers are better than ever right now, and the paperwork is simple, sometimes even nonexistent. Some large contractors will give a rebate up front and collect from utilities or states themselves. Couple state or utility rebates with the variety of deals available from responsible contractors, and modernization can wind up costing nothing. 
Municipalities and parking garages can benefit too. At 8 watts apiece rather than 68, LED bulbs in traffic lights save our cities $1,200 a year over incandescent bulbs per intersection. They'll also last 10 times longer, reducing accidents caused by burned-out traffic signals or changing bulbs at rush hour. "Energy harvesting" controls in parking garages turn lights off during daylight and on at dusk. Occupancy sensors turn on the lights only when people are using the space. 
The United States remains the biggest electricity consumer in the world, and we depend on that electricity for our prosperity and standard of living. Every kilowatt we conserve reduces our vulnerability to a California-type scenario right here. The Atlantic Corridor from Virginia to Massachusetts accounts for 16 percent of nation's energy consumption, and about as much as all of Europe and South America combined. 
The United States imports about 40 percent of the oil necessary to generate electricity. Unfortunately as we have learned recently, much of that oil comes from countries that may not be the steadfast suppliers we once believed them to be. 
Utilities or electrical contractors will gladly provide a free survey and recommendations. Even in the unlikely event that none of your electrical equipment needs modernizing, they can make present equipment run better longer. That in itself would likely cut your energy bill by 5 percent or more. 
When's the best time to modernize? It's best to get it done before next summer's cooling season, when electrical demand peaks. 
Electric power conservation is the right thing to do, and the right time to do it is now.

Pulling Ailing Schools Up by the Bootstraps

BYLINE:  By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
THREE years ago, the science curriculum was drastically changed at the Whittier Elementary School in Camden to allow the students to roll up their sleeves and become explorers.
 They began growing beans and writing in their journals about plant growth, keeping birds and fish in some classrooms to observe their habits and doing yet more laboratory work, said Marilyn Allen, the principal at Whittier in one of the nation's poorest districts. 
 To show the way, teachers were encouraged to take graduate science courses and bring their knowledge back to the classroom; the after-school program emphasized science and social studies.
This year, the payoff came.
Whittier's state test scores showed that 62 percent of the 50 students who took the test were advanced in science and 38 percent were proficient. What was most astounding was that the scores were not far off from those in affluent districts like Princeton, where at Riverside Elementary School 66 percent scored advanced in science and at Community Park Elementary about 64 percent were advanced. 
"We used the philosophy 'Let me do it and I'll learn it,' " said Mrs. Allen. "It has a lot to do with the enthusiasm of our teachers."
In language arts literacy, 80 percent of Whittier's fourth-grade students scored proficient; 89 percent scored proficient or advanced in math.
Not all the state's disadvantaged districts did nearly as well as Whittier. For the most part, students in affluent suburbs scored higher than those in poorer areas, and scores for black and Hispanic students lagged behind those of their white and Asian counterparts.
The assessments -- which began being administered to 4th-, 8th- and 11th-grade students three years ago to determine if the state's five-year-old curriculum standards were being met -- have been the subject of criticism and debate among educators.
Critics say students are tested too frequently and that the scores do not mean a great deal because an out-of-state company grades the tests -- and many of the graders are not teachers. At times the scores have been sent back for re-evaluation.
Nonetheless, the tests have prompted districts throughout the state to revamp their curriculums, particularly in writing, and fourth-grade students now spend a lot of time doing exercises similar to those they will be tested on in the spring.
So far, scores have gone up every year as teachers have changed to conform to the material on the tests. For instance, of the 103,000 fourth grade students who took the tests last April and 2001, about 79 percent scored proficient or advanced proficient in language arts, as against 55.1 percent the previous year; 66 percent of them were proficient or advanced in math and 87 percent in science.
A breakdown by race showed that 88 percent of the state's white students and 91 percent of all Asian students scored advanced or proficient in language arts literacy as against 55 percent of black students and 65 percent of all Hispanics. There was a similar gap in math, with 78 percent of white students and 85 percent of Asian student passing, versus 35 percent of black students and 48 percent of Hispanics.
But Dr. Michael Smith, an associate professor of education at Rutgers University, cautioned that the statistics merely reflected the students' economic status.
"So often race and class correlated," Dr. Smith said. "We are not recognizing the impact of the economic status. Kids whose home cultures are more like school culture have an advantage."
At time the writing prompts can also put students from poor, urban backgrounds at a disadvantage, he said. 
For example, Dr. Smith said that one test he came across in his research used a story about an elderly man on a farm who has a telescope he had never used.
"It's white, rural and elderly," Dr. Smith said. "What's the point of entry there for some students?"
While Dr. Smith applauded the state curriculum standards, he suggested making some changes, like eliminating the timed tests, because of his contention that some students are put at a disadvantage.
Bucking the trends, some schools in Abbott districts -- the state's poorest -- like Whittier showed marked improvement in the latest tests.
For instance, Grace Giglio, the principal at at No. 16 Elementary School in Paterson, said she was "elated" when she received the scores. In language arts literacy, 87.9 percent of the almost 40 students taking the test scored proficient or advanced, a 55 percent gain over the previous year. In math, 91 percent scored proficient or advanced.
"We had a tremendous amount of community support and staff development," Ms. Giglio said, noting that community volunteers donated computers and participated in tutoring and mentoring programs.
In addition to training the full-time teachers, substitutes also received instruction.
Ms. Giglio, who has a proficiency in math, spent time in the classrooms and helped institute a Quiz Bowl in the fourth grade in which students competed in math, literature and science.
Southampton School No. 2 in Burlington County -- situated in a diverse community with a largely blue-collar population, also saw great improvement in its scores, with 97 percent of the 94 students scoring proficient or advanced in language arts literacy, said Sharon Danfield, who has been principal for the past four years. Of that group, 23 percent scored in the advanced category.

To the Editor:
 Re "Argentina's Crisis: It's Not Just Money" (Week in Review, Jan. 13): The rise of anti-free-market populism in Latin America certainly does not bode well for the United States' foreign policy objectives. But blaming capitalism for the economic woes in Argentina and elsewhere is a mistake since no country in Latin America, except possibly Chile, has yet fully embraced real free-market reform. 
 The type of partial reforms that plague Latin America, in which some markets are partly liberalized without the benefits of needed institutional change, are similar to the problems in Russia and Eastern Europe. Despite an economic collapse Russia chose not to retreat, but to actually accelerate its reform efforts, and Russia's economy is set to grow at close to 8 percent this year alone. The anti-free-market, protectionist policies being advocated by Argentina's new president only threaten further economic collapse.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FRESH KILLS; 
To an Artist's Eyes, Beauty Is Trash, and Trash Beauty

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY

 BODY:
For years, Staten Islanders have spread rumors about a pack of wild dogs that roam the outback of the 2,200 acres at the Fresh Kills landfill. Though the odd stray mutt has been spotted there, no pack has been found. Still, the rumors persist. 
 Now comes Natalie Jeremijenko, an artist who proposes to unleash a set of robotic, radiation-sniffing dogs on the landfill. The image may be whimsical, but in the artist's plan the robots would do serious work at the site, which has the variable air quality common to all dumps. 
 "The dogs are equipped with radiation detection and air-quality sensors to sniff out toxins," Ms. Jeremijenko explained. "They also have Web cams on their non-barking ends." 
She conceded that her project had little chance of being installed soon at the site, which stopped accepting household trash last March and is now the site of debris from the World Trade Center. But she proposed it anyway at a discussion last weekend of the "Meanings and Legacies of Garbage" at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center. 
Ms. Jeremijenko, a panelist at the event, was joined by two other artists, Michael Bramwell and Mierle Laderman Ukeles, and by Benjamin Miller, a former official of the Department of Sanitation.
They were a pro-garbage group. Mr. Bramwell described an art piece he once performed in which he swept weekly the halls of "the most deteriorated tenement in Harlem." He learned from it that garbage removal could serve as "the cultural model for care and concern."
Ms. Laderman Ukeles, an unpaid artist in residence for the Sanitation Department, said she was first drawn to the department as an art subject because she was fascinated by large systems. "I fell in love with the garbage later," she said.
Ms. Laderman Ukeles sometimes portrays trash as a victim of social forces. "Garbage is the collusion of society to strip objects of their identity," she said. As the department's artist-in-residence, she once did an art piece in which she shook hands with all the city's thousands of sanitation workers.
For his part, Mr. Miller suggested that the Fresh Kills landfill receive household trash again. He contended that such a move would pose no environmental or health risk and would save the city at least $240 million a year.
But the moderator, Robin Nagle, an anthropologist at New York University, quickly put the idea in perspective.
"I agree with Ben on the economics and the logic," she said. "But no one is going to embrace the idea at all." JIM O'GRADY

Credit Counselors Have Problems, Too

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
LAST year was particularly busy for the multibillion-dollar credit counseling industry. With the economy in a recession and consumer debt and unemployment rising, millions of people turned to the industry's roughly 800 nonprofit agencies or for-profit companies for help in managing their bills.
 But the industry has had its own share of problems. For one thing, many creditors that provide a portion of the money for the credit counselors' operations pared their contributions -- called fair-share funds -- even more last year, to 8 percent or less from 15 percent a decade ago, industry executives say. 
 Adding to the industry's woes were reports last year of some companies charging high fees for substandard service, and questions about whether some groups were truly nonprofit.
"This is an industry that is in turmoil right now," said Travis B. Plunkett, the legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America. 
Yet consumer advocates like Mr. Plunkett say credit counseling can still work for many people -- as long as they find a reputable agency that is appropriate for their needs.
Of course, that may not always be easy in an industry that is largely unregulated. Because many credit counseling organizations have set themselves up as nonprofit entities, the Federal Trade Commission has no authority over them. Only 17 states -- including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- regulate credit-counseling concerns, usually by requiring licensing or other authorization for conducting business. (By contacting their state banking departments, however, consumers may be able to learn whether a particular agency or company has had complaints lodged against it.)
There are also many counseling services from which to choose, some with similar-sounding names.
"It's a difficult time for legitimate credit counseling organizations when there are so many well-funded competitors out there that are not adhering to what we think is a basic set of principles for the industry," said Bill Cullinan, interim president of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling in Silver Spring, Md., the largest credit counseling network, with 1,450 local offices.
Mr. Cullinan said he was especially concerned about credit counseling companies offering services online or over the telephone that automatically put clients in debt repayment plans rather than providing true financial counseling that could help them avoid problems. By contrast, he said, the foundation's member agencies focus on counseling and place only about one-third of the people who seek their services into such plans, usually when their total debt obligations outside of mortgages, auto loans or rent are 80 percent to 90 percent of their gross incomes.
Before they agree to work with a company or agency, consumers should ask the counselors about specific services they provide, experts say. Will they be taught about proper budgeting? Will they be placed automatically into debt-repayment plans? Will they be urged to buy additional products or services? How much will it all cost?
Some consumers may have wished they had asked those questions. One of them is the owner of a home-based apparel business in the Los Angeles area, who asked that he not be identified. The weak economy, he said, had made him fall behind in paying his bills, and he sought the help of a credit counselor, Debticated Inc. in Huntington, N.Y. He said he was assured by the company that he would be charged nothing in advance and that the interest rate on some of his credit cards would be lowered.
He said he found in early December that his first month's payment of $1,529, which had been billed as a voluntary contribution, would go entirely to the company rather than his creditors. He said he also discovered that his interest payments would be far higher than he had been told.
He complained to the company and resigned from the program. In two weeks, he said, he got his money back.
Rory Mulholland, a lawyer for Debticated, said the consumer in question could have stayed in the company's debt-payment program without paying the voluntary contribution. He also said the company could not promise specific interest payments because it dealt with hundreds of creditors.
JOEL GREENBERG, the board chairman for the nonprofit Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies in Fairfax, Va., which has 54 agency members, says his members are allowed to charge consumers no more than $75 to set up a debt management plan and no more than $50 a month in maintenance fees. Members of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling are not required to limit their fees but most charge, on average, $25 to $40 for set-up fees and $12 a month for maintenance fees, Mr. Cullinan said. Some of the organization's members do not charge for their services, he added.
Both organizations say their members are not permitted to pocket a client's first debt payment. 
Mr. Plunkett of the consumer group said people should ask companies how much time and money they spend on counseling. 
Some companies vigorously defend their fees. The Cambridge Credit Counseling Corporation in Agawam, Mass., for example, charges a mandatory, rather than voluntary, upfront fee equal to a consumer's total monthly debt; it also charges a monthly maintenance fee that is 10 percent of the monthly debt payment. Chris Viale, the company's general manager, said the fees were necessary because they ensured that the company could provide extra services and because fair-share contributions from creditors had fallen to 6.2 percent, on average. "A year ago we were almost at 12 percent," he said. 
In exchange for the higher fees, he said, Cambridge Credit Counseling provides consumers with certain perks, like a rebate program. Clients who make full payments on time can get back 3 percent to 3.5 percent of their payments every six months, he said.
Mr. Viale said that of the 35,000 to 40,000 households that his company works with each month, only 15 percent end up in its debt-management program. The rest, after working with a company representative for about a half-hour, receive a set of financial workbooks, a two-hour video and access to an online education center. "It would be impossible for us to continually counsel consumers," Mr. Viale said. 
Credentials are another consideration for consumers. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling and the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies have differing sets of standards for their members and provide accreditations.
Mr. Plunkett advised consumers to resist signing up with the first credit counselor they encounter. "When it comes to debt problems, consumers often feel a sense of urgency," he said. "But shop around."

Pension Bubble Loses Some Air

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
THE late 1990's was a golden age for stocks -- and for Americans' potential retirement incomes. Assets in private pension funds doubled from 1995 to 1999, to $5 trillion. Workers plowed big portions of their high salaries of a booming economy into tax-deferred 401(k) accounts. 
 What a difference a couple of years can make. Though the 2001 data is not yet available, the stock market's tumble probably at least stunted the growth of pension fund assets and might have even reversed it. Some experts, meanwhile, believe that proposed legislation intended to protect retirement accounts from corporate failure, in the wake of the Enron bankruptcy, could reduce everyone's incentive to save. 
 The golden age of retirement savings was a long time in coming, said James P. Smith, a labor economist at the Rand Corporation. "The private pension system was certainly underdeveloped 50 years ago," he said.
Dora L. Costa, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted that before World War II, "private pensions were extremely rare, and when people did have them, they paid out puny amounts." Starting in the 1950's, companies began offering improved pensions that would pay fixed benefits to retirees. In the last two decades, the responsibility for guaranteeing income in retirement has shifted more to workers, through 401(k) plans, Individual Retirement Accounts and other tax-deferred investments.
Longer life spans helped make greater saving possible. "People live longer and lead unimpaired lives longer," said Donald O. Parsons, a professor of economics at George Washington University. "That, in the brutal world of the market, immediately translates into wages." 
Professor Costa noted that longer lives also necessitated more savings. With longer retirements, people need to supply more retirement income.
For lower-income people, Professor Parsons said, Social Security did the most to promote stable standards of living in retirement.
In fact, Mr. Smith said, the combination of traditional pensions, 401(k)'s and Social Security has made retirement incomes for low- to middle-income Americans similar to their incomes while working. "There are more households with access to some money that they will be able to use to smooth their consumption during the retirement years," he said.
Scott M. Kahan, the president of the Financial Asset Management Corporation in New York, agreed. "Many people, up until the last year, were on track for a comfortable retirement -- in fact, were looking to retire early," he said.
Now that picture could be changing.
Despite the fact that the government raised contribution limits for 401(k) plans, Mr. Kahan said, account balances had stopped growing and had even begun to fall. "People are looking at the year-end statements and realizing that they were losing money in their 401(k)," he said.
Soon, 401(k)'s may lose some of their attractiveness. A bill introduced by Representatives Peter Deutsch, Democrat of Florida, and Gene Green, Democrat of Texas, would limit to 10 percent the share of a 401(k) plan that may be held in company stock. Though the bill could prevent cases like Enron's, in which employees overinvested in company stock and lost most of their retirement savings after Enron's collapse, it could also have a negative effect on savings. If the limits on stock are strict, companies may see less reason to match their employees' 401(k) contributions. Some employees may then have less incentive to save.
"You're going to lose that match" if the limits are too small, said Lowell M. Smith Jr., a consultant on retirement benefits law at Invesmart. "The matches can end up being pretty significant chunks of money."
Mr. Kahan contended that the tax break provided by 401(k)'s would still be enough to entice workers to save. But even if employers continue to offer matching contributions, Americans may be saving too little.
That is the position of Laurence Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University. "People need to realize that their living standards might be dramatically lower in the future" because of a weaker stock market and uncertainty about Social Security, he said. "Over all, saving for retirement is far too little." 
Retirees would indeed find themselves in dire straits if faced with any reduction in Social Security benefits, Mr. Kahan said.
"People don't realize the value of Social Security," he said. "Many times people can't save what we're telling them to, even if they plan for Social Security" to continue paying its current levels of benefits. But, he added, his clients are starting to talk about socking away more money.

HEADLINE: Ninth Avenue Noir

BYLINE:  By ELIAS WOLFBERG

 BODY:
LOOKING today at the Windermere, the massive eight-story apartment building at the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 57th Street, it is hard to imagine that for its first few years it was a grande dame of New York apartment life. 
 But there are ample clues that the structure at 400-406 West 57th Street was once an architectural jewel. Built in 1881, it is the second-oldest large apartment house in the borough. Only the Manhattan on 86th Street and Second Avenue, dating from 1880, is older. The Windermere's imposing patterned arrowhead cornice still proudly faces north. Intricate brickwork and three-story bow-front windows are telltale signs that its builders relished the architectural eclecticism of the 1880's. In its prime, many of the Windermere's occupants could be found nestled in the pages of Phillips' Elite Directory, the bible of upper-class New Yorkers and their prestigious addresses. 
 Today, plywood and sheet metal fill nearly every one of the building's 169 street-side windows, making the Windermere look like a beat-up jack-o'-lantern. The custom-made brick facade, once the color of burning coal, is mostly a dirty, weathered red. A strange urban wrap of scaffolding and a 15-foot wooden fence barricade most of the base from the street. 
Inside, most of the several dozen sprawling seven- to nine-room apartments have been chopped into dreary single-room-occupancy units. The only remaining tenants are half a dozen middle-aged men, only one of whom regularly pays rent directly to the landlord.
Early last summer, the Toa Construction Company of Tokyo, the Windermere's owner, quietly put the building up for sale; although Toa's New York lawyer declined to comment on any matter related to the building, the reported asking price was $35 million. But while the building sits on a prime piece of Manhattan real estate, and Clinton, the surrounding neighborhood, has experienced rapid gentrification and skyrocketing property values, the Windermere sits like a forgotten castle on a hill, its future uncertain. 
There are formidable obstacles to redevelopment. The building's legacy includes a series of lawsuits; harassment of tenants dating to the early 1980's; and a rent strike that has been going on for nearly two decades and continues to this day. Complicated issues of zoning and financing further cloud its prospects. Most tenants were driven away in the 1980's by disrepair and harassment intended to empty the building, but the few who remain are reluctant to leave.
A new owner willing to invest the $45 million to $55 million needed to buy and renovate the Windermere may emerge. But at the moment the building remains unsold, an unsung architectural heirloom shrouded in disarray while fashionable shops and restaurants and high-priced co-ops housing young professionals sprout up around it.
"The neighborhood is more than up and coming," said Arpad Baksa, a Manhattan architect who specializes in renovating old buildings and who has seen the Windermere's interior. "It came. The fact that this building is in the state it's in is absurd. But it is a problem building."

Bonanza on the West Side
The Windermere was the inspiration of three young men with little experience in real estate who were almost certainly trying to strike it rich as land speculators. 
In 1879, a 24-year-old clerk, William E. Stewart, who still lived with his parents, went into business with his 37-year-old boss, a lawyer named Nathaniel McBride, and a 25-year-old builder, William F. Burroughs. They bought the 100-foot-by-125-foot site for $39,000. Unlike the developers of the Dakota or the Osborne, the work of famous architects whose reputations endure today, they hired an obscure architect named Theophilus G. Smith. The result of the collaboration was the apex of their professional lives.
West Side real estate in the late 19th century was a little like the Internet in the late 20th: a nearly empty frontier that speculators saw as an untapped pot of gold. 
Two years, a catchy name (perhaps inspired by Lake Windermere in England) and $350,000 later, a modern structure that towered over nearly every other building in the neighborhood opened its doors.
Each of the 39 apartments offered five or six bedrooms. They were outfitted with engraved marble fireplaces, mirrored parlor walls, carved hazelwood moldings and glossy parquet floors. Dumbwaiters brought food from a basement kitchen up to tenants who didn't care to cook. Other amenities included liveried servants, hydraulic elevators and telephone service, a technological marvel given that the city's first telephone exchange had started operating only two years before. Tenants paid $600 to $1,100 a year, when the annual middle-class income in the city was about $2,500.
The New York Times and The Real Estate Record, the city's leading architectural trade publication, hailed the building as "important" and "notable," and a subsequent front-page article in The Times waxed eloquent on a tiki hut with sweeping views of Manhattan that a building manager had erected atop the roof.
The Windermere housed a few famous tenants, among them Henry Sterling Goodale, a blue-blooded dilettante with two daughters who wrote a popular book of poetry that earned them a reputation as the American Brontes.
But the building was quickly eclipsed by taller and grander newcomers like the Chelsea Hotel on West 23rd Street (1883), the Dakota on West 72nd Street (1884), the Central Park Apartments (1885) and the Osborne on West 57th Street (1885), which siphoned off the Windermere's clientele. 
The building struggled to survive by becoming a home to bohemian (a k a unmarried working) women, but it soon sank into decline. By the late 1960's, when the neighborhood around it had become known as Hell's Kitchen, its mix of large apartments and single-room-occupancy units had a population including hippies, drug users and prostitutes.

The Young McQueen and Kotto
Around this time, a young actor named Steve McQueen abandoned his room at the Windermere instead of paying the rent he owed. He was succeeded by another struggling actor named Yaphet Kotto. Mr. Kotto ultimately left too, but not long afterward found himself on the doorstep of his old digs.
"In about 1970, I'm filming 'Across 110th Street' all over New York City with Anthony Quinn," said Mr. Kotto, who went on to star in the television series "Homicide." "And I park my Winnebago on the sidewalk, and I think, 'God, this place looks familiar,' and I'm parked in front of the building."
He continued: "I'm in my trailer one night on my dinner break, and I hear this knock, bam-bam-bam, on the door, and it's my old landlord saying, 'McQueen owes me money.' So I paid him two or three hundred bucks for me and McQueen."
One of the happiest days of his life, Mr. Kotto said, was when he left the Windermere because he could afford a new apartment. 
The Windermere's darkest days began in 1980, the year Alan B. Weissman, then the owner, began trying to empty the apartment house of its tenants. This was not unusual at that time. Like many other buildings on the West Side, the Windermere was home almost exclusively to low-income renters. Emptying such buildings to be able to replace them with modern, more lucrative structures was not uncommon. 
But by many accounts, few buildings surpassed the Windermere in terms of tenant harassment. All the major New York newspapers covered the trials that sent the Windermere's managers to jail. According to former tenants and court papers, rooms were ransacked, doors were ripped out, prostitutes were moved in and tenants received death threats in the campaign to empty the building.
"How often do building managers go to jail?" asked Joe Restuccia, executive director of the Clinton Housing Development Company, a neighborhood group. "They never go to jail. This was so extraordinary." 
The overall case ended up changing the state's housing law, making tenant harassment a criminal offense. Although Mr. Weissman was never linked to the harassment, he and his wife, Vivien, made top billing in the 1985 edition of The Village Voice's annual list, "The Dirty Dozen: New York's Worst Landlords." 
Cappy Haskin, 55, who moved into the building in 1970, vividly remembers that time. A small woman with gold-rimmed glasses and hair tucked into a bun, she habitually scowls. But as she sat on a wooden bench in a community garden in Clinton, tears streamed down her cheeks when she described how she had been forced by a court order to leave her apartment in 1983. A decade later, she settled with Toa for an undisclosed amount of money. In late 1999, after fighting landlords for nearly two decades, she finally retrieved belongings she had stored in Harlem for 17 years. 
"My stuff sat in storage for all these years because in some ways I never moved out of the Windermere," said Ms. Haskin, who lives nearby and does odd jobs in the neighborhood. "I'd like to see it not torn down for personal reasons but also for the neighborhood. Because it would mean in my mind that whatever I did, and all that has gone on there, wasn't in vain." 
Mr. Weissman, who sold the building to Toa in 1986, still laments that the property has never been developed.
"Look at the taxes the city has missed," he said in a recent telephone interview from his office in Port Chester, N.Y., where he is a real estate developer. "There should have been a building up. That's hundreds of thousands of dollars a year that the city is missing. It's absolutely ludicrous."

Holdouts in a Desolate Place
Today, two of the Windermere's three wings are sealed off, and inches of pigeon excrement blanket the floors of many of the abandoned rooms. An eerie greenish light illuminates the hallways. Although the original fireplaces remain, their hearths have been painted over and their marble ornamentation is gone, giving them the look of faces with their features lopped off.
Nearly all the parquet floors are warped and covered by linoleum. Water has damaged most of the walls. Gaping holes in the ceilings of the occupied apartments reveal the overhead beams. Rattling around in the immense shell, which contains 165 single-room-occupancy units and roughly eight apartments, are the half-dozen final holdouts -- a seventh died at the end of December -- who stubbornly remain.
One survivor, Paul Charlton, 57, has lived in the Windermere since 1976. A gray-haired man who works as a doorman at a nearby building, he has an S.R.O. in a top-floor apartment, in quarters overflowing with packed cardboard boxes, piles of old magazines, a fishing rod still in its plastic case, and shelves filled with everything from a small African mask to a toaster oven.
Another tenant rents an S.R.O. in the same apartment, but the two don't get along. The neighbor put up a flimsy cardboard barrier in the middle of the central corridor with two signs, one that reads "No Trasspassing" and another that says "Beware of Dog," although the neighbor's dog died some time ago.
In the 1980's, Mr. Charlton remembers smelling marijuana in the elevator and seeing prostitutes and their clients entering and leaving the building. "I never would have moved in here in the first place," he said, "if I knew what was going to happen."
He remains, he says, because he is close to his job and because of the low rent; he is supposed to pay $120 a month to a private escrow account. But whether the goal of the owner is higher rents is debatable.
"The owners are not really after the tenants' rents," said Fred Cohrt, an organizer at the Housing Conservation Coordinators, a tenants' rights group in Clinton. "The landlord has always wanted for the tenants to just disappear."
While other, grander buildings in New York have been torn down, the Windermere survives because part of it is in the Special Clinton District, a zoning district that protects buildings in the area. The Windermere could be demolished only if the Buildings Department determines it was about to collapse. If it came down, the zoning mandates that any new structure could be only a small fraction of the present building's size.
"If you tear it down and build a new structure, you can only build about half of what's there," Mr. Baksa said. "Economically, I don't see how that would make sense."
Since 1988, tenants and neighborhood groups have tried to get the Landmarks Preservation Commission to protect the building by designating it as a landmark.
"If it were cleaned up, it would look pretty interesting," said Richard A. Plunz, a professor of architecture at Columbia University and author of "A History of Housing in New York City" (Columbia University Press, 1990). "The upper middle class basically reinvented itself around this type of high-rise luxury building." 
But the owner has vigorously opposed the designation, which would severely restrict opportunities for altering the structure, and the application is in limbo.
Even if a new owner could be found, he or she would face additional hurdles. Settling with the current tenants could cost several million dollars. Gutting and rebuilding the interior could add $10 million to $20 million. The asking price, $35 million, is considered high in today's market.
Even so, people familiar with the Windermere say it is a tempting, if tarnished, jewel.
Pamela Liebman, chief executive officer of the Corcoran Group and a leading expert on residential real estate in the city, said a refurbished Windermere could offer one-bedroom apartments renting for $2,400 or selling for $400,000, or two-bedroom units renting for $3,400 or selling for $495,000. The roughly 1,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space along Ninth Avenue could generate additional revenue.
Redevelopment projects elsewhere in the city have shown that renovating an old building can be profitable. The Manhattan, the city's oldest large apartment house, was in such bad shape that in 1988 The New York Times reported that it seemed destined for demolition. The present owners bought it for $8 million in 1998 and invested $5 million more. Today apartments rent for as much as $8,500 a month.

The Location Is a Plus
The Windermere's location is also a plus. Ninth Avenue and 57th Street is again a hot spot. The ultra-chic Hudson Hotel is just across the street. One-bedroom apartments in the ordinary-looking building just to the west of the Windermere rent for $2,500 a month and sell for more than $300,000.
So, 121 years later, the well-heeled world the Windermere first catered to has returned to Hell's Kitchen. Though the building looks much the same from the outside -- if a lot more weathered -- the Windermere's legacy of neglect continues to haunt it. And despite its venerable past, the building's future is still in doubt.
"The Windermere is not in bad shape, considering how bad it looks when you walk inside," Mr. Baksa said. "This building is a pariah and it got this way because of pure greed. What it needs is for someone to say, 'I have a vision.' "
