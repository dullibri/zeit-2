HEADLINE: He's No Christie Whitman;
15% Hasn't Been Dole's Solution

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THREE years ago this fall, a relatively unknown New Jersey politician from a locally famous Republican clan, Christine Todd Whitman, frustrated Gov. Jim Florio's bid for re-election, largely on the strength of promised (and subsequently delivered) tax cuts. She and her campaign have since cast an iconic spell over her party, not least Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
But with less than two months to go until Election Day, with conventions having convened and bounces having bounced, with Mr. Dole and his running mate having ceaselessly trumpeted their promise to cut income taxes 15 percent and still balance the budget in short order, the New Jersey juju does not seem to be working. Mr. Dole trails President Clinton by 13 percentage points in the latest New York Times/CBS poll, and people are talking landslide. 
 So what's wrong?
The campaign itself blames neither the message nor the messenger. It blames the image makers, and last week it replaced them, pushing aside Don Sipple and Mike Murphy, a pair of established media pros, in favor of a less experienced but more aggressive trio of advisers. Campaigns going nowhere fast often do this kind of thing; as a matter of fact, Mr. Dole brought in Mr. Sipple to replace Bill Lacy last February when things were going badly.

 
 
Ebb Tide
 To tell the truth, there has been nothing very memorable about the Sipple/Murphy ads. But no one outside the Dole campaign thinks the new media consultants will have an easy time selling the candidate or his tax cut.
Economics is important, but there are other issues in this as in all elections. This time, the Republicans' stand on abortion has cost them dearly, especially in the pivotal suburbs and especially among women, who account for much of of Mr. Clinton's lead. Mrs. Whitman, who favors abortion rights, faced no such hurdle; indeed, she ran strongly in the suburban belts around New York and Philadelphia, exactly the kinds of places where Mr. Dole is in trouble.
She was young (47) and fresh; Mr. Dole is old (73) and, if by no means worn out, overfamiliar as a political insider in a day when experience is counted a liability, not an asset. She is personable and telegenic, as she showed in Chicago last month; on the small screen, he looks klutzy and rather forbidding. She caught a rising Republican tide, a year before the party's great Congressional sweep of 1994; he must fight a Republican ebb tide, the result of public disenchantment with the party's stewardship on Capitol Hill in the last two years.
And there's another reason that Mr. Dole might suffer in comparison with Mrs. Whitman on the subject of taxes. Most state constitutions (including New Jersey's) require balanced budgets, so wary voters know that if tax cuts reduce revenues, governors will be forced to cut spending by an equal amount, however unpopular that may prove. At the Federal level, there is no legal requirement to match programs to resources, which has led Presidents to do the politically popular thing first, cutting taxes, and postpone the political root canal therapy, trimming entitlements.
This year voters are increasingly content with their economic lot, according to the Times/CBS poll, and increasingly they give Mr. Clinton a fair amount of the credit. Even among the 40 percent of the electorate that says the standard of living of the next generation is not likely to improve, Mr. Dole is able to do no better than hold Mr. Clinton to a draw.
People may detest the Internal Revenue Service and the whole tax structure, but Mr. Dole has proposed no root-and-branch reform of taxes. He might have done better if he had, instead of settling for a pallid and often offhand commitment to work for a "fairer, flatter" income tax system.
As it is, the Republicans are having trouble getting people to believe them. Despite all their efforts to convince the public that their supply-side formula will make it possible to cut taxes, preserve essential services and balance the budget, all at the same time, people are growing more skeptical, not less.
Last month, shortly after Mr. Dole's proposals were unveiled, 51 percent of the electorate expressed doubts about his ability to make the tax cuts he has promised; in the latest survey, the figure rose to 64 percent -- almost two-thirds. And although voters say they trust Mr. Dole more than Mr. Clinton, an astonishing 41 percent say that if he won he would increase taxes, 35 percent say he would leave them as they are and a mere 18 percent say he would actually cut them.
A big reason may be Mr. Dole's own record. He is a belated convert to supply-side economics, recruited by Steve Forbes and others after a political lifetime of loudly advocating spending cuts before tax cuts. Indeed, he still describes himself, in unguarded moments on the campaign trail, as "a longtime deficit hawk" -- just the sort of bird supply-siders gun for.

 
 
Rubber Numbers
 Of course, it may simply be too early for the new message to sink in. Maybe by November a tax cut will prove as powerful a lure as in the past, regardless of its budget-busting potential. Mrs. Whitman, 20 percentage points down in the polls in mid-October, caught Mr. Florio at the wire, winning by only 25,000 votes.
There is plenty of evidence that Americans still shrink from difficult budgetary decisions, especially if they believe their own benefits are imperiled.
In the last two years, Newt Gingrich has confronted, far more squarely than the Clinton Administration has ever done, the kinds of spending cuts long-term deficit-elimination would entail, and that, along with his abrasive advocacy, has earned him a political black eye.
But perhaps Americans are growing more sophisticated in evaluating the rubber numbers that politicians love so dearly at campaign time.
Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who earned a spot in political annals for his self-immolating advocacy of a deficit-fighting tax increase in the 1984 Presidential campaign, said the other evening: "The difference is that the public has had a taste of Reaganomics and its deficits. Then they hadn't, so I got crucified." Dole, Kemp & Co. insist, of course, that if supply-side economics had been applied rigorously, the deficit would have shrunk, not grown.
Such would be the result of their own plans, they argue, but the public seems to disagree.

 BODY:

POLITICS
 
Whose Economy Is It?
O.K., so the economy's doing better, but did Bill Clinton make it happen? Come on, now: can one mere mortal truly make the difference in a vast, sprawling creature like the American economy? But that question is beside the point: in politics, it's appearances that count, and a recent poll shows that people give the President a lot of credit. Some 72 percent feel economically secure (yes, you could argue that that leaves an awful lot of insecurity), and 55 percent approve of the way Mr. Clinton is handling the economy. That approval, by the way, has shot up from 46 percent two weeks ago, suggesting that the Democrats' little gathering had an impact. And if Bob Dole thinks he'll get votes by tapping into economic anxiety, he may be barking up the wrong tax cut.
 
UNEMPLOYMENT
 
Young and Old at Work
That poll was followed by a bit of good economic news: the August unemployment rate dropped to a seven-year low of 5.1 percent, from 5.4 percent in July. And there were strong gains for those often left on the fringes: people under 25 and over 54. Oddly, though, the stock market didn't act in its usually perverse way. The Dow industrials did drop 49 points the day before the jobs data came out, ostensibly because of worries that a strong report would mean higher interest rates, which would hurt stocks. But when the job numbers hit on Friday, the market took it in stride, with the Dow tktktkt tktktktting. Go figure.
 
ECONOMIC POLICY
 
Inflation Takes a Holiday
Forget about whether children on welfare will go hungry, or whether anyone will ever see the tax cuts that politicians keep promising. No, here's the burning economic issue: Should policy makers go through hoops to hammer inflation, now a nice nonthreatening 3 percent or so, down closer to zero? A minor academic quibble, you say? Well, top Federal Reserve officials and economic policy makers from around the globe felt they had to trek to Jackson Hole, Wyo., a week ago to discuss it. (Of course, most people would discuss anything if they got to do it at a snazzy mountain resort.) Alan Greenspan's conclusion: "Price stability is within reach." But critics say zero inflation would have a cost: higher unemployment, because employers, unable to effectively cut wages by keeping them steady, will cut people instead. A high price that would be for inflation-free perfection.
 
MEGA-STORES
 
Home Sweet Office
Remember when "offices" were in big, ugly buildings, while "homes" featured easy chairs and refrigerators? Of course not. Today it is a pitiable home indeed that doesn't have three computers, two phone lines, a color printer, a fax, a copier and cabinets stocked with office supplies. No wonder, then, that stores like Staples and Office Depot -- gleefully feeding what has become a $185 billion market -- have grown like crazy. But not fast enough for them, apparently: last week, Staples agreed to buy Office Depot in a $3.4 billion stock swap. The merger will create a giant that's twice the size of its nearest rival, with more than 1,100 superstores nationwide. The company had better hope people don't get fed up with it all and convert those home offices back to dens.
 
AND MORE MEGA-STORES
 
Now It's Bookstore City
It's never quite made sense. New York, the nation's biggest city, had the smallest bookstores -- storefront nooks jammed to the pressed-tin ceilings, musty basement literary lairs. But no matter, much of that is being wiped away by those book mini-cities that some people insist on calling "stores." Barnes & Noble, of course, has already barreled around town with its vast superstores (dropping along the way, the slogan: "If you paid full price, you didn't get it at . . ." slogan; now that many of its rivals have succumbed, you may well pay full price). But suddenly it has someone its own size to pick on. Borders just opened a 38,000-square-foot store in lower Manhattan. (Complete with cappuccino? Of course.) But are people reading those books? Or are they all surfing the you-know-what?
 
PUBLISHING
 
Sorry: Politics, Not Sex
And what books sell? Simple, says Harold Evans, head of Random House. "If we didn't publish books by people who had illicit sex, we would be out of business." The illicit sex of the week, of course, involved Dick Morris, if the tabloids had it right, and Mr. Evans is now paying Mr. Morris $2.5 million to tell his tale. Here's the odd thing, though: Mr. Morris won't be writing about illicit sex (not his, anyway), just about being a political guru -- though the whiff of intrigue certainly didn't hurt. He already had a deal with Random House, you see (which the White House isn't at all happy about), but last week, cashing in on his new infamy, he shopped the book around before landing back at Random House -- for more money.
 
BANKING
 
Farewell, Chemical
Chase gave last week, and Chase took away. Actually, it was a year ago that Chase Manhattan announced that it was merging with Chemical, a move that would take away 100 branches in the New York area. But appearances count for a lot, and it was not until last weekend that the Chemical signs actually came down, officially killing off yet another New York institution. But perhaps out of guilt, perhaps because it's saving so much with those new economies of scale, Chase gave $750,000 to Carnegie Hall to support a recital series -- "the largest corporate sponsorship for programs" ever, a Carnegie Hall official said. On Chase's new balance sheet, though, do numbers under $1 million even register?
 
IRAQ
 
Is It Principle, or Oil?
High moral principles are routinely cited when we try to batter Saddam Hussein into submission (though of course it's other, less exalted Iraqis we're battering), but some less idealistic souls say that in the long run it's really just about oil. It's got to keep flowing, after all, so we can maneuver our mighty sport utility vehicles through those rocky, wild suburban malls. In the short run, though, oil prices and oil-company shares soared as soon as we struck -- since the attack killed any chance for 700,000 barrels a day to start flowing out of Iraq.
 
AWAKENINGS
 
Beyond Chicken Noodle
Campbell Soup. That's a sleepy company if ever there was one. Chicken noodle. cream of tomato. Yawn, yawn, yawn. Last week, though, Campbell announced to the world that it was snapping to attention and reinventing itself -- to go to "a new level," as its president put it. What's it all about? Among other things, a huge $2.5 billion stock buyback and more spending on advertising. And no self-respecting overhaul would be complete these days without job cuts: Campbell will dismiss 650 workers, including 11 percent of its headquarters staff. So was this just a lot of noise? Investors certainly didn't think so, with the stock leaping to a record the day of the announcement and rising even further the next.

HEADLINE: The Fallout on 'The Falling Out';
City's Renewal on 13th St. Is Hardly Gentrification

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article "As Dumpsters Replace Squatters, Uneasy Calm on 13th Street" (Aug. 25) did not explain that the city is rehabilitating the 13th Street buildings for low-income housing. 
 And I cannot let the statement that the squatters "made the buildings livable" go unchallenged. Conditions in the buildings, recorded by our agency's videotapes and photographs, were appalling -- both extremely dangerous and unsanitary.
The construction workers you mentioned are implementing the first stage of the city's longstanding plans, plans delayed by the squatters, to rehabilitate the properties as housing for 41 low-income families. Rents for 29 of the apartments will be affordable to tenants earning as little as $14,800 a year, and the maximum allowable income will be $34,100 per year for a family of six. An additional 12 apartments are specifically for homeless families who will come from the city's shelter system. This is not gentrification.

HEADLINE: Staying Power;
How Saddam Hussein Survives by Losing

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE first question to John Deutch, the Director of Central Intelligence, after he gave a speech on terrorism last week was the one that a lot of people may have been wondering about but were afraid to ask:
"I would hate to sound cruel and that sort of thing, but with all the Kurds being killed and the rough situation in Iraq, I can't help but wonder why we haven't killed Saddam Hussein," a member of the audience said. "It just seems like if we could get him out of the picture, it'd be much easier." 
 The audience at Georgetown University laughed. Mr. Deutch patiently explained that assassination was against America's laws. Besides, he said, it isn't something the United States does particularly well.
The answer is as obvious as the question, but it defies common sense. After the Iraqi leader invaded Kuwait six years ago, President Bush called him a "wacko" and "worse than Hitler." Defeated militarily by an international coalition, subjected to the toughest economic sanctions in history, denied control of a fourth of his territory by American warplanes, how is it that he is still around to make more trouble?
The answer to that question is less obvious. But it is the same for President Clinton as it was for President Bush. Both Administrations, it seems, would have welcomed Saddam Hussein's departure from the political stage, but only with a long list of conditions:
* As long as Iraq didn't disintegrate in the process.
* As long as America's allies weren't too badly offended or frightened.
* As long as Iran wouldn't step into the breach.
* As long as Americans weren't put at risk.
* As long as the operation didn't cost too much.
In other words, if Iraqis themselves could remove Mr. Hussein from the scene neatly, replace him with another strongman, keep the country intact and do it without bothering the neighbors, it would be a good thing. If they couldn't, the United States has had no intention of doing it for them.
So two Administrations have fallen into a course of half-measures: Keep Mr. Hussein isolated with political and economic sanctions, and punish him with limited military force whenever he shows signs of military adventurism. However much from time to time policy makers might wish him gone, they have been paralyzed by what they think the cost would be: another massive war involving American troops; a large-scale, lengthy covert operation, or costly air strikes that would upset nervous allies in the region and might not work anyway.
There was Mr. Hussein again last week, smiling in grainy Iraqi television footage (was this some bad rerun from the 1991 gulf war days?) as he declared victory against the United States and vowed to retaliate against American interests, even as President Clinton was declaring on American television that Iraq had been punished by American military power. There, too, were the national security aides from the Bush Administration again, defending their unfinished war and selectively reinterpreting history in the process.

 
 
Thomas Jefferson, Where Are You?
 Toppling Mr. Hussein was never part of the war plan, and who's to say anyone else would have been better, said Colin Powell, the wartime chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "I have never quite seen a Saddam Thomas Jefferson Hussein standing in the wings, ready to come out and be a democrat," he told CNN.
What none of the Bush officials said, of course, was that Mr. Hussein may be in power today because of the American decision to end the 100-hour war before destroying Mr. Hussein's elite Republican Guard. The Bush Administration wanted to avoid the impression that the victorious Americans were eager to slaughter the retreating Iraqis; thus they lost the chance to deprive Mr. Hussein of the force that, now as then, forms the military backbone behind his power.
Fast forward to the Clinton years. The events of last week were an unwelcome reminder that the Clinton team has done no better than the Bush team at reaching (or even defining) its long-term goals in Iraq.
Asked whether the ultimate goal of Washington's attacks was the removal of Mr. Hussein from power, Defense Secretary William Perry said that all of the American responses to him through the years were intended to either "deter him" from unacceptable actions or "punish him" if he did take those actions. Well then, a questioner asked, if Mr. Hussein's ouster is not the goal, won't the United States have to hit him over and over? Yes, Mr. Perry essentially said.
Mr. Deutch sees it a bit differently: The United States wants Mr. Hussein to go -- if the country does not fall apart.
"We stand for a change in the regime in Iraq that will not only preserve the integrity of the country, but will stop it from being an obvious threat to its neighbors," he told his audience at Georgetown.
Even a covert C.I.A. operation to overthrow the Iraqi leader that was authorized by Mr. Clinton this year offers scant evidence of real determination. It seems much too small to do the job.
Although the Kurds in northern Iraq bear the most responsibility for the current dustup, the United States is partly responsible as well.
After setting up Operation Provide Comfort to shield the Kurds from Iraqi retribution in 1991, the United States lost control of the operation by allowing Turkey to take the lead in maintaining it. Turkey, which has problems with its own Kurds, played the two Iraqi Kurdish factions off each other and denied them economic assistance when it suited its needs. American protective flights over Iraq were greatly reduced; America's military presence on the ground decreased. Diplomatically, the United States treated the fighting between the two Kurdish factions as relatively minor.
"Washington conducted an absent-minded policy," said Morton I. Abramowitz, President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who was ambassador to Turkey during the gulf war. "It failed to make dealing with the enormously complex problem of northern Iraq a high enough priority."
So Saddam Hussein wound up intervening in the Kurdish struggle and reasserting authority in the area. Mr. Clinton responded with missile attacks on Iraq's air defenses, but just what was accomplished?
Mr. Clinton's aides said the purpose of the raids was to send Mr. Hussein a clear message about his behavior. But the message was mixed. Granted, the missile attacks reminded Mr. Hussein that he could not do as he pleased, even in his own country. But by attacking sites in the south rather than in the north, where Iraq's tanks were deployed, the United States left the impression that it wants Mr. Hussein to survive -- just hemmed in more than before.
The fact that the north was not attacked also gives the Iraqi Kurdish factions a green light to continue their fighting -- promising both Iran and Iraq further temptations to interfere. As ominous, last week's events call into question the whole future of the American-led operation to protect the Kurdish enclave.
Finally, the episode exposes the cracks that have been opening in the international coalition formed against Iraq six years ago. The United States has much less room for maneuver than it did when Kuwait was overrun and Saudi Arabia seemed to be the next target.
On the eve of the gulf war in 1991, Mr. Bush wrote in his diary, "Hope to see the madman is gone." The hope survives, but so does Saddam.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Way to Lure Business

 BODY:
The financially strapped government of New York City doles out hundreds of millions of dollars each year in tax breaks and loans to encourage businesses to remain or expand within the city. In pursuit of that goal, the city sometimes gets into self-defeating bidding wars with Connecticut and New Jersey just to keep businesses from moving a few miles away. There are few overall benefits to that kind of competition. But now the State Legislature has passed a bill guaranteed to make the situation worse by giving the five boroughs new resources to engage in bidding wars of their own. Gov. George Pataki should recognize that the city's broad interest lies in a veto of the bill.
The focus of the bill is an independent city authority called the Industrial Development Agency, which floats bonds and grants tax breaks for projects that promote the growth of jobs. Often the agency becomes simply a borrowing vehicle for private businesses, which benefit from the bonds' tax-exempt status. Under the bill, pushed by Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, a likely opponent of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the next election, borough presidents would get a quarter of the $122 million annual allotment of agency funds to launch their own economic development projects, as well as the ability to grant tax relief to businesses. 
 Mr. Ferrer argues that the bill is necessary because the Bronx is constantly slighted on economic development projects, having received 2.5 percent of the Industrial Development Agency funds spent from 1987 to 1995. But it is irresponsible to grant boroughs the power to award tax breaks that will only worsen the city's huge budget deficits.
If the Bronx or any other borough feels it is not getting its fair share of money, there are better remedies than balkanizing the funding and taxing powers of city government. Mr. Giuliani should, for example, offer to review the city's strategy to make sure no borough is being shortchanged. The city's economic development strategy has to be unified and coordinated in order to work.
Mr. Pataki is said to be sympathetic to the Bronx's concerns. Supporters also note that the bill has a safeguard -- the mayor may veto any project put forward by a borough president. But at a time when the feasibility of each development project needs to be examined ruthlessly, the bill will inevitably lead to competition among boroughs over which can offer the most generous inducements to businesses. It's bad enough that City Hall feels it has to fight Stamford or Jersey City over luring businesses to New York. It makes no sense to let the the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island join the fray.

Just a Little Inflation, And Everybody's Happy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
A NEW theme is gradually inserting itself into the debate over inflation. The traditional stance -- beat down inflation -- still draws plenty of applause. But after a long spell of mild inflation, economists, politicians and corporate executives are migrating toward the view that the present inflation rate should be preserved, perhaps nourished.
The hammerlock that the anti-inflation battle has had on economic policy is easing up. There is more talk of economic growth and job security as issues that should be higher on the national agenda than fighting inflation. And there is more talk now, even at a conference last weekend sponsored by the Federal Reserve -- the premier inflation fighter -- of the damage that could result from pushing the inflation rate to too low a level.

 
 
The Threat Is Gone
 
 "What people seem to be recognizing is that we no longer seem to be threatened with accelerating inflation as we were in the 70's and 80's," said Paul M. Romer, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "There is still a group arguing for an inflation rate of 2 percent or less, but most economists, without saying so explicitly, now favor an annual inflation rate that ranges between 2 and 4 percent."
Various business organizations, including the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, argue increasingly that fighting inflation, when it is already sufficiently mild, is incompatible with their goal of increasing the demand for what corporate America sells. Similarly, the layoffs and wage stagnation that have plagued the nation in recent years are widely viewed by unions and by many workers as a by-product of the Federal Reserve's effort to soften the economy and thus push down an inflation rate that is already low.
For the last four years, inflation has risen at an annual rate of 3 percent or less. It is 2.9 percent for the 12-month period through July, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. That is significantly lower than the rates -- generally, 4 percent or more -- that prevailed from the late 1960's until the early 1990's.
"Inflation is just not a cutting-edge public issue anymore," said Richard Nelsen, a Columbia University economist, "but there is obviously very widespread concern that incomes are rising very, very slowly."
Whatever the shift in priorities, the Federal Reserve, which has the power to fight inflation by keeping interest rates up, has not eased up on inflation fighting. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has expressed sympathy in public testimony for the emerging view that times have changed. But the latest published minutes of the Fed's deliberations portray the central bank's policymakers as favoring, as usual, "some additional progress in reducing inflation."
So far, President Clinton and Bob Dole are not mentioning inflation in their election campaigns, preferring instead to stress their formulas for growth and prosperity, as if inflation weren't a factor. Among other reasons, neither party wants to risk arousing the ire of the financial markets, which for years have raised a hue and cry at any attempt to push for more economic growth or for full employment at the risk of raising the inflation rate.
That is still a red flag on Wall Street, but it is not quite as high as it was. "This is the first time in years that we have inflation low enough for a long enough period to have a debate over how much growth is possible," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street bond house. "We are at a moment when the bond market is allowing this national debate."
The debate is not a new one, of course. For generations, two camps have existed. One is composed mainly of people, usually wealthy people, whose main concern is to preserve the value -- the purchasing power -- of the wealth they have accumulated. Rising inflation can devalue these savings, which are held mainly in notes and bonds.
The other camp includes those who benefit from an economy that thrives at the cost of some inflation. Among them are wage earners counting on raises, retailers and manufacturers counting on a little inflation to help raise prices, homeowners who like to see their property values rise, and people in debt, who find that inflation can make their debts easier to repay.

 
 
Same Old Dispute
 The struggle between these groups gave rise to the Midwestern populists (pro-inflation) who opposed the Eastern establishment (anti-inflation) in the 19th century, the free silver (pro-inflation) vs. gold standard (anti-inflation) debate, hard money (anti-inflation) vs. easy money (pro-inflation) and, most recently, tight monetary policy (anti-inflation) vs. easy policy. The terms have changed, but for more than a century the issue has been basically the same.
Over the last 18 years, the anti-inflationists have been the big winners, beneficiaries of the nation's reaction to the 12 and 13 percent inflation rates in the late 1970's and early 1980's, which upset everyone. For a while, the winners spoke of driving the inflation rate down to zero, and some in this camp still argue that a zero inflation rate would encourage more savings and investment.
Only now, after four years of persistently mild inflation, has the pro-inflation viewpoint begun to be heard again. Increasingly, its proponents note, for example, that Government statistics probably overstate inflation, so that the already-low rate of 3 percent might really be only 1.5 percent, or even less. Indeed, zero inflation might have already arrived. If so, further efforts to drive down inflation would result in deflation.
Other arguments are also surfacing. Three economists from the Brookings Institution, in a new study that was discussed at the Federal Reserve conference last weekend, argued that the costs of driving the inflation rate down to zero from 3 percent would outweigh any gain. The economy would slow, encouraging layoffs and driving up the unemployment rate by 2 percentage points from its current range of 5 percent to 6 percent.
And so the debate gathers steam. "There is a span of views on inflation," Mr. Romer of Berkeley said, "that until very recently were not very well articulated."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Dick Morris's Behavior, and Why It's Tolerated

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FIRST came shock. Then the titillation and the jokes from the late-night comedians. Now the book deals.
And through it all there has been a curious silence and even expressions of sadness and fealty from those he apparently betrayed. If the tawdry saga that is the Dick Morris affair seems to teach anything about the ways of the influential, it is this: in an age when politicians prattle on about personal responsibility, some people, even when caught, seem to get away. 
And in this case, if an as-yet-undisputed article in a supermarket tabloid is to be believed, they're getting away not only with violations of ethics but criminal behavior.
To be sure, Mr. Morris, the former chief political strategist for President Clinton, hasn't gotten off scot-free. He was forced to resign in disgrace after the tabloid Star reported that for a year he had retained Sherry Rowlands as a $200-an-hour call girl, allowing her to listen in on phone conversations with the President and to have advance looks at speeches by Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton. But beyond making Mr. Morris and Ms. Rowlands the butt of jokes, virtually everyone -- prosecutors, the taxman, feminists, Mr. Clinton -- seems willing to give them a pass.
In an average day, the District of Columbia police make 300 to 500 arrests, on a variety of charges, of men and women engaged in prostitution as either "johns" or hookers. Yet a spokesman for the Police Department said it had no plans to bring charges against Mr. Morris over his reported frolics at the Jefferson Hotel, or to launch an investigation into whether such charges were warranted. Under D.C. law, having sex with a prostitute is not illegal; soliciting sex with one is. Unless the transaction is witnessed (generally through the use of policewomen posing as hookers on the street), it's difficult to prove a crime has occurred. So the police don't bother investigating.

 
 
Trade Secrets
 "As far as we are concerned, he has not committed a crime, other than associating with a prostitute," said Sgt. J. C. Stamps, a D.C. police spokesman. "That's not a crime. It may be a problem ethically, but it's not against the law."
But the reported actions of Mr. Morris, who has neither confirmed nor denied the Star account, and Ms. Rowlands, who was paid by the tabloid as its primary source, conceivably could have spawned other crimes; it is unclear whether that possibility is being investigated.
It does not appear to be against the law to allow a person outside of government to be privy to private conversations with the President, so long as they don't involve classified information. But it could be a crime if such access is used to get wind of pending governmental action and profit from it -- new regulations on tobacco, say. But legal experts say that making an insider-trading case against either Mr. Morris or Ms. Rowlands would be difficult. For starters, there is no evidence so far that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Morris spoke of such matters or that Ms. Rowlands heard of them if they did.
Then there is the question of whether Ms. Rowlands paid taxes on her income from prostitution. Unless exempted by Federal statute, all income is taxable whether it comes from legal or illegal activity. Therefore, if she did not report her earnings from prostitution (although it would be doubtful she would say that was the source), Ms. Rowlands could end up doing hard time instead of just "Hard Copy."
But Sheldon Cohen, a former Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, said the agency normally did not pursue those kinds of cases unless the amount of money was significant. And the world's oldest profession is a cash business, so if a call girl reports any income, it's difficult to determine whether she underreported it. As a result the I.R.S. usually doesn't investigate. "If they chased every prostitute on that basis they wouldn't be chasing anybody else," Mr. Cohen said.
Aides with the Clinton campaign, which was paying Mr. Morris as a consultant, said a preliminary audit indicated that campaign funds weren't used to pay Ms. Rowlands, thus they do not believe there was any violation of Federal election law.
Legal issues aside, there is still the court of public opinion. And aside from the fulminations of editorial writers and columnists, the reaction of official Washington has been strangely muted. Anger at the betrayal of a President and the demeaning of the White House has been expressed only obliquely.

 
 
'Nobody's Asked Us'
 Even health officials who have warned of prostitution in an age of AIDS have had nothing to say. "When this happened, the Surgeon General was on vacation," said Damon Thompson, a spokesman for Acting Surgeon General Audrey Manley. "She just got back in town this week and has had her plate full with other business at hand."
Feminists vigilant against Republican efforts to restrict their independence on abortion have not seized upon this new, high-profile opportunity to rail at the exploitation of women in prostitution. When asked why the National Organization of Women had not said anything about the Morris affair, a spokeswoman for the organization replied, "Nobody's asked us." Later Patricia Ireland, NOW's president, said in an interview that she felt the group had bigger fish to fry than a dethroned political strategist.
"Yes, we are trying to change the culture," she said. "While he may be a prime example of bad behavior, it is not like he is heading up the Senate Finance Committee, or tricked voters in his last election like Senator [Bob] Packwood did. Dick Morris doesn't have that kind of power anymore."
Rather than publicly speak of how Mr. Morris apparently abused his confidence, Mr. Clinton called the departed political strategist a "friend" and the President and First Lady telephoned to console him. "We're not interested in making this last any longer than it needs to," said a White House official. "We would much rather get people's attention focused back on the economy and the issues."
And so far, Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, has not made an issue of Mr. Morris, except for making some glancing asides in speeches about a lack of values in the White House; aides make clear to reporters that these refer to the Morris scandal. Republican strategists have said that Mr. Dole does not want to appear to be exploiting the Morris affair for political gain. But some political observers suggest that the Republicans are wary of making too much of Mr. Morris since he has worked for Republican candidates as well as Democratic ones.

 
 
'Deadened' Senses
 With so many public notables keeping quiet, wishing the Morris affair would just wither and die, it is little wonder people are cynical. Indeed, some observers say the saddest thing of all regarding the Morris affair is the little interest the public has shown in it.
"I think our senses have been deadened," said Thomas Mann, a scholar at the Brookings Institution. "People have just come to discount all this stuff. There are so many scandals, so much behavior that seems reprehensible. It's so common, so every day, so much in our face on a regular basis that we don't react anymore."

HEADLINE: Campaigning on Portents of Doom and Boom

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON, while walking across your bridge to the 21st century, take a long look back at the middle part of this one. Divorce was rare and most children were born into two-parent families.
Bob Dole, while harkening back to a country that you say was better and more civil, say hello to the early days of the 20th century, when Jim Crow was enforced formally in the South, informally elsewhere, and about 1 of 200 Americans was addicted to cocaine or opium. 
 This year, the quadrennial political debate over just how bad things are is joined by the sound of fin-de-siecle sirens for the death of character, spirituality and even Tuesday-night bowling leagues. This prompts some social critics to say we have simply become a nation of whiners.
Still, the fog of gloom refuses to lift in many quarters. It is good for journalism, book publishers, preachers and political underdogs.
But beyond people who may have a stake in a glass-half-empty view, the persistent sense of decline seems to have taken on a life of its own.

 
 
Perceptions and Election Targets
 The Presidential race, on a significant level, is about crafting a narrative that fits with people's perceptions of their lives. Challengers, be they Bob Dole or Ross Perot, usually say the country has gone to hell. Incumbents say things are looking up.
Recent polling indicates that this durable equation may not work as expected this year. The New York Times/CBS News Poll finds the public rating the economy the best since 1988, giving credit to the President. Even the pessimists, those most anxious about the state of their lives, are leaning toward Mr. Clinton.
For Mr. Dole to convince people that he can return them to a time of "tranquillity, faith and confidence in action," the nation has to feel as though its best days are behind it.
On the major issues, Mr. Dole points to decay. In San Diego, he said, "We are a nation paralyzed by crime," with "the lowest education achievers among the leading industrial nations," a place where "drug use has soared among the young." As for general prosperity, Mr. Dole says, taxes are up, wages are down and the overall economy "is in the tank."
For President Clinton, optimism has replaced the fears that he himself stoked four years ago, when he decried a nation where most Americans "work harder and earn less." At the 1992 convention the Democrats sounded exactly like Bob Dole does today, and portrayed a country of "decline, decay and deception."
Now, Mr. Clinton trumpets the 10 million new jobs created on his watch, and tries to dispel the effect of people who respond, "Yeah, and I've got three of them."
Americans have become so accustomed to quantum leaps in their quality of life that any leveling off is seen as decline, says Robert J. Samuelson, author of "The Good Life and Its Discontents: The American Dream in the Age of Entitlement." "We expected that life in all its aspects would constantly improve," he writes. "Our present extreme pessimism is merely the mirror image of this earlier extreme optimism. Neither is justified."
At some point in the coming weeks before the election, most Americans are likely to ask: How bad is it now? Or, put the other way: how good was it before? While statistics can be marshaled to go in any direction, some general truths emerge:
The economy. For the last 20 years, median wages adjusted for inflation have remained flat. The gulf between the rich and the poor is great.
But the American economy is now in the best shape of any modern democracy, creating so many new jobs that many areas are reporting acute labor shortages. As a result, wages are finally edging up. Home ownership is the highest it's been in two decades.
What's more, despite widespread anxiety over corporate downsizing, nearly two-thirds of the new jobs created in the last two years were in areas that paid higher than the median wage, according to a recent Government report.
Americans, however, see something else. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll found that 68 percent of the people surveyed thought it was somewhat or very hard to find a good job at good wages locally.
Drugs and crime. Drug use among teen-agers jumped 80 percent since Mr. Clinton took office, but the number of Americans who said they used an illicit drug dropped to 12 million this year from 22 million in 1984.
Serious crime dropped last year for the fourth consecutive year, especially homicide. Arguably, Americans are safer compared to 10 years ago but not compared to the 1940's or 1950's.
Health. About 40 million Americans lack health insurance. One in three is overweight. But many life-threatening diseases now have cures. Also, with the advent of Medicare in 1965 came the first generation of elderly Americans free of fears that even a relatively minor illness could bankrupt them.
Education. In 1945 just 5 percent of American adults were college graduates, and 25 percent had high school degrees. Last year, 25 percent had college degrees; 81 percent had finished high school. And for the first time the percentage of black high school graduates roughly equals that of whites.
Still, dropout rates are high, and American test scores lag behind those of other industrial nations.
Morals. Though a tough thing to measure, this has been a hardy perennial in books and speeches on decline. In 1945, 3.9 percent of children were born out of wedlock; last year, 31 percent were. Divorce, in the last 30 years, has nearly quadrupled, but shows signs of leveling off.
Church attendance has declined, with about 37 percent of Americans attending once a week. But this is still higher than in any other industrial country.
On a more abstract scale, shame is not what it used to be. Witness the fact that the former Presidential consultant Dick Morris, who resigned after allegations that he had patronized a call girl, can follow the now-familiar track from disgrace to book contract in a week's time.

 
 
Compared to What?
 For all the numbers, most people see a better world or a bleaker one based simply on what they are used to, says Alan Ehrenhalt, the editor of Governing magazine and author of a new book on communities in the 1950's titled "The Lost City."
Mr. Ehrenhalt says the 1950's were viewed as an ideal time because what came before it, the Depression and global war, was so awful.
"People lived better than they ever thought they would," he said. "Now, we don't seem to trust the future to any great extent. There is a profound absence of the sense of the possible."
Even Presidential optimism is not what it used to be. Whereas President Kennedy said, "Man holds in his hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty," President Clinton seems to have settled on keeping children in school and away from cigarettes.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
Two Republicans Come to Town, One on a Mission, One More Mellow

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: V.I.P. VISITORS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: NORTH CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Years can go by and nothing of political import happens on Easton Street, but this week two major Republican events were held there, and though they were just across the way from each other, they felt a half a century apart.
The bigger event was on Thursday, when Bob Dole came to Easton Street. The Stark County Republicans did a splendid job turning the little Walsh University gymnasium into just the sort of perfectly controlled television backdrop that national Presidential campaigns need at every Middle American stop. 
 The local Republican chairman, Charles Brown, had received a call from Mr. Dole's handlers a few days before saying they were planning to spend an hour in Stark County as part of an Ohio swing. "They said they wanted a good-sized venue and they wanted young people," Mr. Brown said.
Mr. Brown chose Walsh, a conservative Catholic campus of 1,500, where many, like the president of the student body, Jeffrey Ryan, come from suburban and small-town Republican families. It was arranged in 15 minutes. Mr. Brown called Tom Hannon, a businessman who is a major contributor to both the Republican Party and Walsh University. Mr. Hannon called a Walsh official. Walsh was delighted to accommodate the Hannon who gave Walsh its Hannon Child Development Center.
The Secret Service required that everything be in place in the gymnasium the night before and it was not until 1:30 A.M. on Thursday that Janet Weir Creighton, the county auditor and local Dole campaign chairwoman, put up the final piece of bunting, then headed home for a few hours of sleep.
An hour before Mr. Dole arrived, Norman Kurtz, a Walsh administrator, shouted: "We need four more students with Walsh shirts! Let's go!" He was supervising the all-important seating in the bleachers behind the podium, which would show up on television news.
"Good!" he said. "Now let's get 10 more lined up ready to go!"
Ms. Creighton had a million things on her mind: Would she remember to shake Mr. Dole's left hand, rather than the right one, which was injured in combat? Would she remember to call him "Mr." rather than "Senator"? The Dole advance team was worried that Canton had no commercial television station and she had assured them that Cleveland stations would come. Would they?
And not least of all, would some curious idiot pull the rope running across the gym floor and release the balloons from the ceiling by mistake?
To prepare the 1,500 supporters crammed into the steaming hot gym, Ms. Creighton, a former high school cheerleader, led them in chants, first dividing the room in half and having one side shout "Dole!" and the other "Kemp!"
"Now let's change it around!" she said. "This side do Dole, and this side Kemp!"
The other major event on Easton Street this week was Representative Ralph Regula's traditional election-year fund-raiser, a $50-a-plate barbecue steak picnic that featured former Vice President Dan Quayle.
While Mr. Dole's appearance had the feeling of one of those rides at the Stark County Fair that spins people around 10,000 times, Mr. Regula's picnic, held across the street on Tuesday evening at Hoover Park as the sun set through the trees, felt like stepping into the soft light of a Vermeer painting. There were no TV guys.
Mr. Quayle, who has been campaigning across the Midwest for Republican Congressmen, held a leisurely news conference with about a dozen local newspaper and radio reporters. If he did not know an answer -- like what his position was on an excise tax on bird-watching items -- he said so. If he did not want to take sides on an issue that was a political hot potato he joked, "I'm on the side of both, obviously," and went on to the next thing.
He spent a couple of hours mixing with the crowd of 1,100. The speculation is that by helping out Republican Congressmen now, he will have plenty of favors to call in if he makes a Presidential run. Many of the rank-and-file Republicans commented on what a treat it was to see a former Vice President close up in a quiet setting, how much brighter, more sophisticated and more human he seemed than they had expected from the image conveyed by the national media.
Ed Moody, who is active in the Republican Party and also writes for a local weekly, The Louisville Herald, loved the Quayle visit. "I felt so relaxed," he said. "I got a feel for Quayle."
Though Mr. Moody is a Dole supporter, he did not attend the Presidential candidate's campaign stop here on Thursday. "I've been to those kind of things," he said. "I was out at the Iowa caucuses supporting Dole and reporting. I got to shake his hand once. He came into the room, he was surrounded by a lot of people in suits looking at their watches."
Mr. Quayle has lived both styles of campaigning and "by far" prefers the leisurely approach that allows real contact. The tightly scripted Presidential campaigns are "very monotonous, very boring," Mr. Quayle said, adding: "The media must get bored, too. To get your message out you repeat it over and over again and if you want to add something new, you drop a few sentences in and hope they notice it."
He says the primary reason for the scripting is the mistrust that has grown up between the press and politicians since the Watergate era. "From the Presidential candidates' perspective, they feel they have to have it this way," Mr. Quayle said. "There is this gotcha journalism -- any mistake, any flip-flop, any miscue is going to be amplified.
"They make it less possible to make mistakes. So you don't take the risk. You just don't talk to the press. Unfortunately, that's where we are. Presidential campaign events are made for television."
And while he says security concern for Presidential candidates is part of why campaigning is so tightly controlled, it is not the major reason. "Look, we use security to keep you guys away," Mr. Quayle said.
Mr. Dole's speech to the packed Walsh gym was well received. ("Dole Speech Hits Home," read the lead headline the next day in The Repository, the Canton newspaper.) "It was good," said Stacie Sulin, a sophomore from a Republican family who will vote for Mr. Dole this fall. "There wasn't really anything that stuck out -- it was stuff I heard before."
The speech touched on most of the same points as Mr. Dole's Republican convention speech, including his pledge to cut taxes 15 percent, a measure he said was supported by "three Nobel Prize-winning economists."
He talked about taking a harder stance against drugs, including using the National Guard for border duty, and criticized teachers' unions as a destructive force for their "hammerlock on the education system." He said he would support public financing of a school voucher system that would permit parents to send children to their school of choice.
He could be counted on to make his pledges happen, he said. "Bob Dole is honest," Bob Dole said. "His word is good."
He called Stark "one of those bellwether counties that people will be watching all over America," and vowed to carry it in November, along with Ohio and the nation.
Afterward, Mr. Dole spent almost as much time shaking hands as he had on his speech. Wherever he went in the gym or outside, he was encircled by a crowd of Secret Service men and supporters wanting to touch him and wish him well.
There were none of those cracks in the game face that were seen at the Regula/Quayle event, none of those off-guard moments that help an observer form either an affection for a public man or an antipathy toward him. What mainly struck Ms. Sulin, the Walsh sophomore, was how long and hard Mr. Dole worked shaking hands and how vigorous he seemed. "He looked younger than I thought," she said.
The event had gone precisely as the Dole organizers hoped. Ms. Creighton, the local Dole chairman, had been so busy concentrating on leading cheers and her speech that at the end she had to ask someone, "Did the balloons come down?" They did, precisely on cue. Nor did she have to worry about TV news crews showing up. Not only did Cleveland come, Columbus was there, too. That night, most of the stations devoted at least a minute to the Dole visit.
The reporter from Channel 3 in Cleveland, Eric Mansfield, was one of the few television newsmen lucky enough to get through the crowd and push close enough to Mr. Dole to shove a microphone in his face and ask a question. He wanted to know how Mr. Dole planned to appeal to younger voters (he will speak of the future), whether Ohio was important to the Presidential race (it is) and whether Mr. Dole will return to Ohio to campaign (he will, a lot).
Later, when most of the gym crowd had cleared out, the TV 3 reporter said, "I figured I'd better not ask hardball questions. With the Secret Service all around, they'd have him out of there in a second."
Living midway between Democratic Cleveland and Republican Columbus, the citizens of Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County have a history of voting for the winning Presidential candidate. This is the 25th article in a yearlong series that explores the forces shaping the political debate at the grass roots.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: POLITICAL MEMO;
Past Is No Guide to Stands Taken by Candidates

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Barely two years ago, President Clinton was envisioning the greatest expansion of Government social policy in at least a generation. The transformation of the American health care system, he proclaimed, was his "most urgent priority."
But in his re-election campaign this year, the President has set his sights so low that his greatest ambition seems to be to give small grants to community organizations to help parents teach their children to read. 
 As for Bob Dole, he is proposing deep tax cuts for all Americans, embracing a radical economic theory that until recently he called bunkum.
The positions the Presidential candidates are taking this fall are so at variance with the stands they have taken all their political lives that voters may wonder whether their Presidencies would reflect their promises or their pasts.
To those who have followed their careers, it is hard to imagine that Mr. Clinton would take a hands-off approach to the country's social problems or that Mr. Dole would follow an economic policy that he has called fiscally imprudent.
The most common explanation for this curious state of affairs was expressed this week by Ted Van Dyk, a veteran Democratic strategist who is no fan of either candidate.
Being far ahead in the polls, Mr. Van Dyk said, Mr. Clinton is playing it safe with proposals that will stir little opposition. Since Mr. Dole is far behind, he must shoot for the moon to stand a chance of catching up.
"Both of them are dealing with the practicality of what's available," Mr. Van Dyk said.
Mickey Edwards, a former Republican Congressman from Oklahoma who teaches politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said that it had only recently become common for candidates to adopt positions that were at odds with the ones with which they had generally been associated.
"Always in the past," he said, "you made the best case for your cause, and then you won or lost. Now, we have just accepted the idea that as a routine thing candidates move to the left and move to the right and move to the center, and nobody blinks an eye."
On issues that have been more peripheral to the campaign, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole are espousing views that are generally consistent with ones they have always taken.
Mr. Clinton, for instance, supports abortion rights, and Mr. Dole does not. Mr. Dole's stands are more favorable to business, Mr. Clinton's to labor. Mr. Clinton emphasizes environmental protection, while Mr. Dole stresses the importance of development. Mr. Clinton favors gun control, and Mr. Dole generally does not.
But on the central issues of how much money the Government will raise and spend and how much the Government will be involved in the direction the country takes, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole are taking positions that are out of character.
In his campaign four years ago, Mr. Clinton promised not only to change the country's medical system, but to create millions of new jobs, expand educational opportunities, rebuild the cities and generally take an active role in American life. In his speech accepting his party's Presidential nomination in 1992, he challenged George Bush: "If you won't use your power to help America, step aside. I will."
This year, Mr. Clinton's promises are by comparison exceedingly small bore. In his standard stump speech, these are the main things he says he wants to do in another term:
*Teach small children to read.
*Prevent people convicted of domestic violence from owning guns.
*Change the tax law so even fewer people would owe capital gains taxes after selling their homes.
*Help those on welfare find work.
*Stop children from smoking.
*Require businesses to give workers unpaid time off for occasions like parent-teacher conferences.
*Give tax breaks to middle-income families to help them raise young children, offset the cost of college tuition and buy a first home.
*Clean up more toxic-waste sites.
Some steps Mr. Clinton advocates, like encouraging schoolchildren to wear uniforms, are even outside the purview of the Federal Government.
What about eliminating poverty or improving the economy or making health care affordable to all? Mr. Clinton does not address those issues this year.
What about the impending crisis in Social Security and Medicare early in the next century when the baby-boomers begin to retire? He does not talk about that either.
The President's campaign promises are not just modest and inexpensive. They are also so unexceptionable that even his staunchest critics cannot criticize them. What can Republicans say -- that it is a bad idea to teach more children to read?
The other side of the coin is that Mr. Dole's endorsement of supply-side economics is as uncharacteristic as a turnip in a martini.
In his career in the Senate, he was known much more for forging compromises than he was for taking strong policy positions. One of the few ideological lines he drew was the contempt he expressed, in public and in private, for the notion that deep tax cuts are the magic elixir for economic growth.
In 1982, he was the chief sponsor of one of the largest tax increases in history, a measure he wrote in an effort to offset the budget deficit that grew out of the tax cuts Ronald Reagan had won the year before. In the following years, much of Mr. Dole's political energy was spent fighting for deficit reduction. Representative Newt Gingrich, now Speaker of the House, referred to Mr. Dole as the "tax collector of the welfare state."
In his recently reissued autobiography, Mr. Dole wrote: "If the old-time religion says you can't endlessly spend more than you take in, then the old-time religion is good enough for me."
But now he has adopted the tax-cut philosophy whole hog. He would reduce tax rates by 15 percent across the board. He would give couples with annual incomes below $110,000 a $500 tax cut for each child 18 and younger. He would cut the capital-gains tax rate in half, and expand individual retirement accounts.
This would cost the Government about $550 billion in lost revenue over the next six years. In his campaign speeches, Mr. Dole insists that this loss can be offset with painless spending reductions, and that the budget will then be balanced.
Few economists outside the Dole camp believe that can happen.
Mr. Dole has exempted two-thirds of Government expenditures from cutbacks -- Social Security, Medicare (except for the savings outlined by the Republican-controlled Congress last year), the military and interest payments on the national debt.
What is left is the basic operating costs of the Federal Government -- air traffic control, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Border Patrol, prisons, national parks, the Census Bureau, highway repair and countless other activities that Americans expect from their Government. On average, they would have to be cut from current levels by 37 percent after accounting for inflation. Neither Mr. Dole nor anyone else has suggested how to do that in a way that would be both practical and acceptable politically.
Furthermore, Mr. Dole's plan is based on economic assumptions that many economists believe to be unrealistically optimistic. If so, the cutbacks in Government programs would have to be even larger. They would have to be greater still if Mr. Dole followed through on his promise to build a land-based missile defense system, a project that could cost $50 billion or more.
Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Dole does not address the question of what to do about Social Security and Medicare for the baby-boom generation.
No one can be certain what all this means for the next four years, but Mr. Edwards, the former Congressman turned professor, has as good a take as any.
If Mr. Dole becomes President, he would probably not stake much on the idea of tax cuts, Mr. Edwards said, but if a Republican-controlled Congress approved the tax plan, Mr. Dole would almost certainly sign the bill.
If Mr. Clinton is re-elected, Mr. Edwards figures, he must decide what he wants his legacy to be. If he wants to try to be remembered as a late 20th-century Roosevelt, he will raise his sights and attempt to expand the Government and the social safety net. If he would rather be remembered as the President who reshaped the Democratic Party into a winning party, Mr. Clinton will shrink the Government and appeal to the middle class.
"I can see him go either way," Mr. Edwards said.

Waiting for Ayatollah Gorbachev

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran

 BODY:
What produces a Mikhail Gorbachev? That is the question.
You see, if change is to come to Iran, it is not going to come by the Shah's son riding back on a white horse to oust Iran's Islamic leadership. And it isn't going to come by way of the ragtag Iranian opposition based in Iraq regaining power in Teheran. No, if Iran is to become the more pragmatic, fully law-abiding member of the world community that the West seeks, it will only be because an Iranian Gorbachev emerges from the Muslim leadership that now thoroughly dominates this nation and is able to forge a more moderate, but still Islamic, course from within. 
 Mikhail Gorbachev was produced by a combination of economic and social pressures that came together in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980's. Have U.S. economic sanctions on Iran shown any sign of producing a Gorbachev-like figure within Teheran's Islamic leadership? The consensus answer here is: "No -- not yet."
Why? For one thing, Iran's merchants, through ingenuity and corruption, have found enough alternative markets and ways around the U.S. sanctions to stay in business. I just spent a morning walking through Teheran's sprawling bazaar, which was packed with shoppers. I asked one merchant after another how U.S. sanctions affected them. The vast majority didn't know there were U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Others said they were adapting -- the wedding-dress maker was getting material from Japan, the rug dealer was selling to Germany, the jeans maker was getting fabric through Turkey. The export-importer said that credit was very tight, but that there was nothing he couldn't buy from America through Dubai or European intermediaries. But gold dealers said business was slow because Iran's 50 percent inflation had eaten away incomes, so many newlyweds couldn't afford gold. The economy grew at 1.5 percent last year. Not great, but not a disaster. "U.S. sanctions have had little effect, because the only countries supporting them are America and Israel," said A. N. S. Khamooshi, head of Iran's Chamber of Commerce.
But the more important reason Iran's economic crunch hasn't become critical is O-I-L. Iran's Islamic Government still earns 80 percent of its foreign exchange from oil exports, which also account for almost 70 percent of Government revenues. Because Iran has no problem selling its 2.5 million barrels a day, the regime has a steady income, without having to radically restructure the economy and open up to the world the way the Soviet Union had to.
Sure, the camp of technocrat-pragmatists allied to President Hashemi Rafsanjani argue that Iran cannot live off its oil industry forever, especially since it now needs a huge amount of reinvestment to sustain its oil wells. But this group is opposed by a still-dominant majority, led by the nation's Spiritual Guide, Ali Khamenei, who argue that the Islamic Republic is growing fast enough and that growth of the economy is not the only priority, because with it comes a corrupting materialism, from the Disney Channel to McDonald's. Indeed, there is still a strong anti-growth movement among the mullahs. During recent parliamentary elections someone scrawled graffiti at a building site in plush north Teheran: "Enough Prosperity."
Still, with a soaring population of 65 million people, half of whom are under the age of 17, Iran will eventually have to overhaul its state-dominated economy, if it is to provide enough new jobs to absorb all its young people. That's when things will get interesting. Because to export oil requires no social change. To export computer chips or auto parts that are globally competitive requires a real restructuring of the Iranian economy, major foreign investment, an unleashing of the private sector and a real integration with the world.
So when will that crunch come? When Iran's steadily rising population runs into Iran's gradually declining oil revenues. That won't be next year, but it's coming. Only then will Iran have to face the reality that it can't export revolution and auto parts at the same time, because exporting revolution leads to isolation from the world and exporting auto parts demands the world. Only then will conditions be right for an Ayatollah Gorbachev to emerge -- a cleric who will try to moderate Iran's Islamic system in order to preserve it.
And until then? An Iranian woman I know put it best: "Iran will never be a happy place as long as we have oil. We could be Japan if we didn't have oil."

HEADLINE: Nantucket Journal;
In Planned New Supermarket, Island Sees Its Character for Sale

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: NANTUCKET, Mass.

 BODY:
Now that the summer crowds and traffic are gone, people here can get back to worrying about another major threat to this island's quaint tranquillity: the proposed supermarket. The one that would have an outdoor herb garden, fruit trees, brick walkways and a playground, as well as five additional stores.
"People are getting tension headaches and waking up in the middle of the night," said Teena Loftin, who moved to Nantucket nine years ago from the Boston area with her husband, Richard, a lawyer. "We're all desperate. We're all walking around looking at each other saying, 'What can we do?' " 
 During the summer, when the year-round population of 7,000 swells to more than 40,000, people complain about the lines, and lack of parking spaces, at the island's two supermarkets, an A.& P. and a Finast.
Other communities might welcome a new and bigger store. But on Nantucket, with its devotion -- some might say obsession -- to preserving its heritage of whalers and Quakers, the supermarket is the psychological equivalent of Wal-Mart.
Stephen Welch, a landscaper, has formed an antimarket citizens' group, Nantucketers for Controlled Development, and hearings by the Planning Board have drawn as many as 500 people, more than go to the annual Town Meeting. Another hearing is scheduled for Monday.
"This is unrestrained," said Dorothy Slover, head of the Nantucket Historical Association, which, along with the Chamber of Commerce, opposes the market. "This will forever change Nantucket, just as if the Industrial Revolution had hit it."
Local newspapers have printed vitriolic letters in opposition, and "Bag the Market" bumper stickers are a common sight. To many opponents, it is the scale of the project -- small by mainland standards, but large for this 14-mile-long island -- that is cause for concern. The market would cover 39,500 square feet and have 258 parking spaces.
"They're talking about a playground, pedestrian malls, bicycle and moped facilities," said Mrs. Slover, a designer from Washington who was in her family's elegantly restored 19th-century Greek Revival summer house here on Main Street.
"You can be certain there will be video," she added, referring to arcades with video games.
Billy Cassidy is a native Nantucketer who is the spokesman for the developer, Donald Conte of Grafton, who wants to build the supermarket on the outskirts of town. "This isn't a big store," Mr. Cassidy said. "It's nothing. They think I'm bringing Blockbuster Video."
Nantucket does not have Blockbuster Video. Nor does it have traffic lights, McDonald's or a Gap. The main street is cobblestone and illuminated by electrified gaslights. The boutiques selling antiques, fine chocolates and designer clothing are decorated with window boxes overflowing with petunias and impatiens.
Diane White, a columnist for The Boston Globe, wrote recently that "the whole island looks as though it might have been designed and decorated by the staff of Martha Stewart Living magazine."
To many people here, that other island off Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, might as well be the mainland. Martha's Vineyard is where President Clinton spent two summer vacations. And look what happened: even more celebrities, crowds and write-ups in People magazine.
Nantucket prides itself on being smaller, wealthier, less populated and more reserved. It certainly has more gray shingles. Public telephone booths are gray shingled, as are parking signs. In keeping with the rigid code set by the Nantucket Historic District Commission, the Cumberland Farms convenience store is gray shingled. The new market would, naturally, have gray shingles.
Gray shingles notwithstanding, the supermarket plan seems to embody the fears of Nantucketers that their island is not the sleepy outpost it once was. With all the summer people, Nantucket Airport has become the 73d busiest airport in the country, ranking ahead of Little Rock, Ark., and Oklahoma City. On July 7, the field had 1,211 takeoffs and landings, 46 more than Logan Airport at Boston.
There were 299 permits for single-family houses issued in 1994, more than for just about any other city and town in the state. The median house price is $450,000, and that will not buy waterfront property.
As the grocery debate rages, no one has complained about a private golf club that is under construction. Reports say a membership will cost upward of $150,000.
Mr. Cassidy, a nephew of the present owner of the site, Donald Holdgate, said that he knew many native Nantucketers, carpenters and plumbers and schoolteachers who were for the market but that they did not attend the hearings.
One, Charles Pearl, a retired high school teacher who arrived on the island in 1926 from Revere, Mass., said: "I'm in favor of free enterprise and private property. We need a bigger and better store."

HEADLINE: La Guardia's Legacy: A Duty to the Needy;
Federal Welfare Shift Spotlights Unusual Amendment to State Constitution

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
One warm summer day, a prominent Republican stood before a group of civic-minded people, some of them pillars of his party, and told them that the welfare system was "unworkable and cumbersome."
If the welfare system were fixed, he predicted optimistically, not only would the old, the sick and the needy be better off in the long run, but government would save money and the overall economy would get better. 
 The time was July 1938, the place Albany. The Republican was not a supply-sider caught in a time warp. He knew nothing of country clubs. Perhaps recalling his tenement childhood, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York believed that government had a sacred duty to protect the unfortunate.
And so, in a gesture that reverberates six decades later as the welfare system is being overhauled, he urged the Committee on Social Welfare at the New York State Constitutional Convention to adopt an amendment declaring that the state had an obligation to care for its sick and needy.
"I can't come up here each year to the Legislature and beg for money," Mayor La Guardia said.
The Mayor had a good friend on the committee: Adrian P. Burke, a young lawyer from New York City who was active in charities that aided children. Sometimes, the two would visit children's shelters together, with results that were at once comic and touching.
"The children were very much attracted to Fiorello," Mr. Burke, now 92, recalled in an interview last week from his retirement home in Lauderhill, Fla. Perhaps, Mr. Burke said wistfully, it was because the Mayor had a squeaky voice and was not that much taller than the children.
As Mayor La Guardia spoke to the social welfare committee, the setting was full of political paradox. Republicans were in the majority at the convention, but that was not necessarily to his advantage. Many in his own party distrusted Mr. La Guardia, who was liberal and only nominally a Republican, having been elected on a fusion-reform ticket intended to clean up a mess left by the colorful but corrupt Mayor James J. Walker.
Mr. Burke, a Democrat, liked what Mr. La Guardia said. So did another Democrat, Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York, who was not on the committee but whose opinion counted a lot.
The members of the social welfare committee were considered more liberal than the other convention delegates. "We were very anxious to have a liberal approach to social welfare," Mr. Burke recalled. "We felt the children were not getting what they deserved."
In Mr. Burke's recollection, the 11 Republicans and 6 Democrats on the committee were leaning toward a sweeping social-welfare amendment anyhow, and probably would have passed one even without Mr. La Guardia's high-pitched entreaties.
In any event, Mayor La Guardia got his wish. The amendment was proposed by the social welfare committee, adopted by the delegates and a few months later was approved by the voters.
Section 1 of Article 17 of the Constitution reads: "The aid, care and support of the needy are public concerns and shall be provided by the state and by such of its subdivisions, and in such manner and by such means, as the Legislature may from time to time determine."
There is no comparable language in the United States Constitution, and in few, if any, other state constitutions. No one yet knows exactly what the words will mean for the state and for New York City now that Congress has passed and President Clinton has signed legislation that would end some Federal welfare grants, deny some benefits to legal immigrants and impose five-year limits on assistance to adults.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani predicted recently that the Federal changes, coupled with the new burden on the state and the chain-reaction effect on the city, could cost the city more than $700 million annually six years from now.
"The city of New York is really just a better place than a lot of other places in terms of caring for people and understanding the worth of human beings," Mr. Giuliani added.
City officials have predicted that the fundamental questions of who is needy and what is adequate minimal state support will wind up in court.
That may be, but in 1977 the state's highest tribunal, the Court of Appeals, declared that while the Legislature could determine how the needy should be helped (and by how much), the Constitution barred simply cutting off aid.
The court looked not just to the language of Article 17 but to the intent of the delegates to the 1938 convention, particularly that of the members of the Committee on Social Welfare, and held that they had deemed state aid to the needy to be "a fundamental part of the social contract."
Mr. Burke agreed wholeheartedly and expressed pride for his role in the amendment's passage. "We were way ahead of all the other states," he said.
Mr. Burke said that he was fairly well off in the 1930's -- "I had a job," he said, "and if you had a job in the Depression you were rich" -- but that he and every other person on the committee had felt the Depression, if not through personal suffering, then through the hardships of relatives, friends or neighbors. So, of course, had the voters.
One member of the committee was Aaron L. Jacoby. Orphaned as a child, he grew up to become active in Brooklyn Democratic politics. He was executive director of the Brooklyn Hebrew Orphan Asylum in the 1930's and was active in several other child-care agencies. He served on the Public Service Commission in the 1950's and died in 1987 at the age of 94.
When Mr. La Guardia took office in 1933, there were, by some estimates, more than 1.5 million New Yorkers on some form of public assistance. Teachers remarked that many young children seemed dazed and distracted in school, as though old before their time. They were undernourished.
The amendment that Mayor La Guardia wanted (and two related ones specifying that nothing could be done to prevent the Legislature, or local governments, from caring for the needy) were among nine put to the voters on Nov. 8, 1938.
The voters re-elected Gov. Herbert H. Lehman over his Republican challenger, Thomas E. Dewey, and approved six of the nine proposed amendments, including the social welfare package.
Mr. Burke became a power in city and state Democratic politics and served on the Court of Appeals.
Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was once his law clerk and, he recalled in a recent interview, would sometimes point to the 1938 amendment when pressuring the Legislature to come up with more money for relief programs.
Mayor La Guardia had predicted that passage of the welfare measures, along with protections against child labor and a reliable system of unemployment insurance, would mean that "the next constitutional convention will spend very little time on the question of relief."
He was wrong. The next constitutional convention, held in 1967, spent a lot of time talking about welfare. Dr. Henrik N. Dullea, the vice president for university relations at Cornell who wrote his doctoral thesis on the 1967 gathering, noted that the convention adopted an amendment calling for the state to take over local welfare programs in the decade beginning in 1970.
But Republican leaders urged rejection of some amendments, contending that they would cripple state finances. Some voters may have been uneasy over a proposal to repeal a ban on aid to church-related schools.
Whatever the reasons, the voters rejected the convention's recommendations, although some were later accomplished gradually through legislation.
The 1967 convention was called by the State Legislature. The people themselves get a chance every 20 years to summon a convention. Their next chance is in 1997.
Gov. George E. Pataki has argued that the courts should not compel society to care for the needy, saying that it is a moral, not a legal requirement, to do so.
The Governor is now studying the new welfare proposals, keeping a watchful eye on the clause and what impact it may have on New York's ability to care for the poor.
"New York State has a proud history of caring for the needy," said Zenia Mucha, the Governor's communications director. "And we will not turn away from that. The courts in interpreting that phrase may, in some cases, have gone beyond what is reasonable in terms of providing for the needy."
Now and then, experts on government complain that New York State's Constitution, its fourth since the Revolutionary War, is absurdly long and detailed -- the width of ski trails on Whiteface Mountain is specified, for instance -- and should be streamlined.
Mr. Burke, his memories of his countrymen's poverty undimmed by age, said he thinks the social welfare amendment will remain, as a symbol of a progressive state. "Everybody likes kids," he said. "They need a lot of help, I can tell you."
Mr. Cuomo said he hoped the amendment survived, not just because it bespoke generosity "but because it's just simple intelligence" to help people who are poor and jobless not by choice but by circumstance.
Asked for a prediction on what might happen in states whose constitutions do not have such an amendment, Mr. Cuomo said, "No sane American wants to see a child starve."

HEADLINE: Political Briefing;
THE CAMPAIGNS FOR CONGRESS

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

 BODY:

California
G.O.P.'s Candidates Worry About Dole
The newest Field Poll shows President Clinton with a 22-point lead over Bob Dole in California, a survey that is likely to feed nervousness among Congresional Republicans. If the top of the ticket staggers, the effect on Republican turnout can be significant in the struggle for Congressional control, in which California could play an important role. The outcome could be disastrous for Republicans if the Dole campaign decides to cut its losses and pull out of that expensive state, redirecting its time and money to more winnable regions. 
 "It could mean 2 to 3 percent at the margin in some of these close races," said Thomas Mann, a Brookings Institution expert on Congress. "And for the really close ones, that could well be enough to tip it."
The Dole campaign has tried to reassure Republicans that it has no such plans. Gov. Pete Wilson said in a recent interview that Mr. Dole had assured him that he would not write off California. Still, there are lingering memories of 1992, when President George Bush won only 33 percent of the vote in California.
Craig Veith, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said, "Our candidates and members set out from the beginning, regardless of the condition of the Presidential race, to run their races." Mr. Veith added that they were raising the money to make sure their message got out.
Jim Whitney, his counterpart at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, "Having Clinton run that strongly helps Democrats across the state."

Minnesota
Resurgent Wellstone Leads in New Poll
Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota was widely considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents around, but a new survey shows him with a 9-point lead in his rematch with Rudy Boschwitz, the Republican challenger.
The survey came after a wave of Republican attacks, hammering Mr. Wellstone as an outside-the-mainstream liberal on issues like welfare. (Mr. Wellstone was the only Senator seeking re-election this year who voted against the welfare overhaul.) But the poll showed that Mr. Wellstone, who was running essentially even with Mr. Boschwitz back in May, now leads him, 46 percent to 37 percent.
The welfare issue, which some Republicans had predicted would be devastating to Mr. Wellstone, ranked fourth when voters were asked to name the race's most important issues. Ahead of welfare were taxes, spending and the deficit; the economy and jobs, and health care.
The poll was conducted for The St. Paul Pioneer Press, KARE-TV News and Minnesota Public Radio from Sept. 1 to 3. It was based on a survey of 803 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

Arizona
Inquiry Is Sought On Forged Signature
Representative J. D. Hayworth, an Arizona sportscaster turned Republican firebrand, and a man who delights in poking at Democrats from the floor of the House, is embroiled in a dispute back home over a forged signature on an election document. Democrats contend that he ought to be thrown off the ballot over it.
The fight began after Democrats noticed that Mr. Hayworth had filed two copies of an "Affidavit of Qualification," a form that all candidates are required to file with the state. The first was filed June 27, the day it was due, the second a week later. Democrats noticed that Mr. Hayworth's signature was notably different on the two and hired a handwriting expert who declared that the first signature was a fake.
Mr. Hayworth apologized for the forgery and said it was done without his knowledge by an errant staff member. Democrats contend an apology is not enough, and are pushing for an investigation.
Partisan tempers are running high in this fight for Arizona's Sixth District, a largely rural, heavily Mormon district that covers the northeastern third of the state. Steve Owens, a Phoenix lawyer and former top aide to Vice President Al Gore, is the expected Democratic nominee.

Texas
A Familiar Name Upsets Democrats
Representative Jack Brooks had the kind of name recognition in Texas that comes with 42 years in the House. That explains why Texas Democrats are upset with the sudden reappearance of the name, "Jack Brooks," on the ballot in the Ninth Congressional District.
It is not the old Jack Brooks, who was once the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and was defeated by Steve Stockman, a Republican, in 1994. It is G. Jack Brooks, 58, a heavy-equipment operator who told newspapers in Texas that he was running to make a statement about "this crazy government."
Democrats are worried that voters will think that this Jack Brooks is the old Jack Brooks, and thereby dilute the vote for Nick Lampson, the Democrat who won the party's nomination in a primary in the spring.
"This doesn't pass the smell test," said Jonathan Brown, press secretary for Mr. Lampson. "There's no question that Steve Stockman is the most endangered Republican in the House and far too much is ascribed to coincidence here."
Spokesmen for Mr. Stockman said their campaign had nothing to do with Mr. Brooks's entering the race; Mr. Brooks, who is running as a Democrat, has also denied that anyone in either camp urged him to make the race.
The imbroglio reflects the upheaval in Texas as a result of a recent redistricting decision, in which Federal judges threw out the results of the party primaries and opened the Nov. 5 election to more than one candidate from both parties. A runoff will be held Dec. 10 if no candidate wins a majority.

Florida
Turnout of Voters Remains Very Low
 Florida has registered more new voters than any other state under the Motor Voter law, but officials discovered last week that big registration gains do not necessarily translate into big turnout.
Florida's registration rolls have swelled by more than 1.3 million voters since 1994, but only 25.6 percent of the state's voters cast ballots in the primary on Tuesday. That was the lowest turnout since at least 1970. ROBIN TONER

HEADLINE: Union Members March On a Rescheduled Day

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
With thousands of hospital aides, teachers and electrical workers as well as a re-election-minded Mayor stepping down Fifth Avenue, yesterday's union parade was in many ways like Labor Day parades of old, but with a new date and theme as part of labor's efforts to gain members and clout.
The dozens of New York unions sponsoring the parade rescheduled it for the first Saturday after Labor Day to attract more marchers and spectators. With the parade's slogan "America Needs a Raise," the unions adopted a theme designed to warm the public to labor and show that unions are out to help not just their members but all workers. 
 Noting that unions have fought for a higher minimum wage and health insurance for all Americans, Brian McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council, said, "We see ourselves as advocates of all working people in the city, whether they know it or not."
As head of the federation of city unions, Mr. McLaughlin sought to organize the largest parade in years to demonstrate that New York labor, like the A.F.L.-C.I.O. under its new president, John J. Sweeney, was on the mend and could capture the public's imagination.
Despite the threat of rain, the parade was indeed the largest in years. Labor leaders and several police officials said the parade, which lasted for 5 1/2 hours and stretched 25 blocks, had more than 200,000 marchers.
The parade consisted of members of more than 100 unions, including steamfitters, asbestos workers, theatrical stage employees and even some of the city's 35,000 workfare employees. Seeking to publicize their cause, more than 50 workers on a 14-month strike against The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News also marched.
As high school bands, bagpipe-playing construction workers and a dozen floats inched past St. Patrick's Cathedral and the Disney store, thousands of spectators stood behind police barricades, occasionally cheering, but it was unclear whether they were buying labor's new message.
But one group -- politicians -- seemed to be paying close attention to labor as they maneuver for union support during elections this November and next.
At a union breakfast at the Intercontinental Hotel before the parade, the room overflowed with elected officials paying tribute to labor: Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; State Comptroller H. Carl McCall; Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate; Peter F. Vallone, the City Council President; seven members of Congress; four borough presidents, and more than a dozen City Council members and state legislators.
Mr. Giuliani stood out as one of the few Republicans at the breakfast, although Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross later joined the parade and Gov. George E. Pataki signed union hats and met construction workers at their block party on East 76th Street.
Several labor leaders had kind words for the Mayor, demonstrating that Mr. Giuliani had maintained good relations with labor despite bitter negotiating battles.
"He's someone who works with us," said Stanley Hill, executive director of the 120,000-member District Council 37, the largest union of municipal workers.
Mr. McLaughlin praised the Mayor for promoting economic development but faulted him for vetoing a so-called living wage bill that would raise wages for low-paid employees who work for city contractors.
"We agree with him on some things, and we have had some big disagreements with him on others," Mr. McLaughlin said.
In his tribute to labor, Mr. Giuliani noted that his grandmother was able to retire with dignity and some savings thanks to contracts won by her union, the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union.
"The fairness and equity workers now have did not happen by accident," he said. "It happened because of the labor movement."
Near 44th Street and Fifth Avenue, where the marchers set out, Mr. Giuliani was occasionally booed. One heckler yelled, "Don't sell our city hospitals, you bum."
But once the parade moved north of 59th Street, there was steady applause for the Mayor. Everywhere were signs promoting labor's pet causes: "Downsize Newt," "Don't Privatize City Hospitals" and "Broom Closets and Stairwells Are Not Classrooms. Let's Rebuild NYC's Schools."
Leading the parade was its grand marshal, Thomas Van Arsdale, an electrical workers' official and former president of the Central Labor Council.
"This is beautiful," said Billy Giel, a 38-year-old Teamsters member from Matawan, N.J., who was driving the boilermakers' float. "More people are getting involved now in the union, even white-collar workers. They're all feeling pushed by downsizing."
Wearing a T-shirt and cap emblazoned with the word UNITE, for the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, Claudia Braithwaite, a retired jewelry worker, said, "I'm here to show my respect for labor, and what it's done for workers. It's not doing that well, though. It's still having problems with sweatshops."
Mr. McLaughlin, who also serves as a Democratic member of the State Assembly from Queens, had pushed to reschedule the parade after disappointing turnouts at recent parades. Labor leaders agreed to change the date because many union members are on vacation during Labor Day. Concerned that Fifth Avenue had few shoppers on Labor Day, union officials also wanted the parade to be on a day when the avenue was full of shoppers and museumgoers.

HEADLINE: Hard Times, Not Paradise, For Young Cubans in U.S.

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
They were lost in the Florida Straits, drifting atop rope-lashed planks of wood and sagging rubber dinghies. But as they pitched across the shark-infested waters, the 139 Cuban teen-agers who had abandoned family and country kept their hopes alive with visions of life in the United States.
There would be Reeboks and blue jeans, they told one another, and cities where the food would never run out. There would be sports cars to drive, grand houses to furnish and places where people could speak without fear. 
 The teen-agers clung to those dreams during the days at sea and through the months in detention camps, until the Clinton Administration admitted them in the winter of 1994, resettling them with foster families in nine states across the country.
"For us, America was like paradise, a place where your life was ready-made," said Antonio Serrano-Velot, who was 17 when he left Cuba.
But 20 months later, the story of the Cuban teen-agers is mostly one of dashed expectations and disappointed dreams, both for the immigrants and for some of the Cuban exiles who fought for their admission.
Nearly a third of the teen-agers -- most of whom were high school dropouts and many of whom had rebelled against authority in Cuba -- have been expelled or suspended from school here for offenses that include fighting, truancy and carrying weapons to class, a survey of refugee resettlement agencies shows. A quarter have been arrested on charges that include assault, drug possession and car theft. About 15 percent have run away from their new homes. And while some have excelled, earning school honors and job commendations, most have bounced from foster family to foster family, challenging authority at every turn.
"I had so many dreams," said Maikel Romero, 17, who wept when the New Jersey foster family he had grown to love kicked him out for fighting with another Cuban boy, "and nothing has turned out like I thught."
A look at the rocky resettlement of the Cuban teen-agers provides a rare glimpse of the complexities involved in assimilating minors who come to the United States without parents or guardians. Since 1980, about 11,000 refugee minors have been placed through programs financed by the Federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services.
By most accounts, those programs, which were developed for the Vietnamese boat children of the late 1970's, have worked well, and the young foreigners have thrived here, completing high school and finding steady work.
But the programs have required fine-tuning to address the needs of the 139 Cuban teen-agers, who set sail at various times in the summer of 1994. All were picked up by United States Coast Guard ships and taken to the Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they remained in the camps until being brought to the United States.
Although adjusting is difficult for most foreign minors, refugee experts say it has been particularly trying for the Cubans, who quickly rebelled against the highly structured programs that suited the Vietnamese.
The reasons for the difference are hard to assess, the experts say, but they note that the Cubans spent their childhoods breaking rules, whether by stealing from Government stores, working the black market to feed their families or protesting against President Fidel Castro.
It was perhaps inevitable, the experts say, that young people who grew up resisting authority would continue to do so in the United States, especially when their golden visions failed to materialize.
Accustomed to spending their days at the beach and their nights partying with friends, many of the teen-agers resisted attending class or obeying family curfews. They wanted to work and live independently, not to study and live with foster families.
"They risked their lives to get here, expecting to get houses and lots of money and to live on their own," said Rosa Torres, a social worker assigned to counsel the 11 Cuban teen-agers who were resettled in and around Washington. "Instead, they were told to follow rules they had never followed at home: to go to school, to follow family rules, to respect authority. And many of them just wouldn't do it."

The Inexact Science Of Resettlement
But if the Cubans were not ready for America, neither were the foster programs entirely ready for them.
Most refugee workers were accustomed to Vietnamese children who had been sent to the United States by their parents to study and work, and who usually excelled in school and quickly adjusted to family life. But many of the Cubans left without their parents' knowledge. Those whose parents did know were sent with an emphasis on work -- to make money they could send home.
In the rush to find homes and schools for the teen-agers, many refugee workers never learned that the tattered Cuban economy, which often pays Government doctors less than waiters can earn at foreign-managed hotels, had spawned a generation of young people who would probably rebel against full-time education and structured family living.
To make matters worse, the programs placed the teen-agers in states where operating costs were low, like Michigan, and most of the Cubans ended up living with foster parents who did not speak Spanish. Florida, which has a shortage of foster families, took none.
The Federal Government is now planning to re-evaluate its placement procedures.
"The reality is that we have not come together as a resettlement community and looked at all the factors that determine where a refugee should go," said Lavinia Limon, director of the resettlement office.
But for the struggling teen-agers, perhaps most painful was discovering that they had given up everything for a fantasy.
Long before the rafts set sail from Havana, the teen-agers had spun together a patchwork vision of truth and myth gleaned from letters received from Cuban exiles in Miami, shortwave radio broadcasts and pirated American movies. To them, the United States was a glittery city with tropical climes, where everyone was rich, spoke Spanish and embraced new Cuban immigrants.
Instead, the teen-agers ended up in cities like Rochester and Newark, where some classmates shouted out anti-immigrant slurs. And instead of finding high-paying jobs, the young Cubans washed cars or sorted chicken parts in poultry plants.
"I didn't come to America," said Yoduel Robles, 18, who was expelled from school and found only minimum-wage work. "I came to Virginia."
Members of the Cuban exile community, who had fought their own battles to acclimate to America, vigorously supported the teen-agers at first, lobbying the White House to get them admitted to this country.
But once the teen-agers arrived and word spread of their troubles, some Cuban exiles reconsidered their welcome, refusing to open their homes to young people they viewed as delinquents damaged by years of living under Communist rule.
They said the teen-agers reminded them of some of the Cubans who came to the United States in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which brought 125,000 Cubans to the United States, among them several thousand criminals and psychiatric patents.
"The Mariel experience made a lot of people gun-shy," said Raul Sanchez, a Cuban-American restaurant owner in Washington who hired one of the Cuban teen-agers but chose not to be a foster parent. "People were worrying that they would be taking criminals into their homes."
Diego Amador, a member of the Cuban American Association in Lansing, Mich., took in a 16-year-old, Adrian Castellanos, who has twice been named the employee of the month at a local McDonald's.
But he said no one should be surprised that Cuban-American families were reluctant to take the rest of the teen-agers. "It breaks my heart to say it," Mr. Amador said, referring to the teen-agers, "but some of my people are garbage."

Hoping to Escape Lives of Desperation
What the teen-agers hoped to find in the United States was simple: a better life.
In Cuba, Mr. Romero, who was a high school dropout, stole bread from a Government bakery whenever he was hungry, which was almost every week. His father, who worked a jackhammer and never earned enough to feed his family, told his son he would never eat stolen food.
But when his stomach ached from hunger, he ate the bread, too. The son saw his future in his father's face and jumped on a raft in the summer of 1994. He was resettled in New Jersey.
Mr. Robles, then 17, had six months to go on a two-year prison term for posting anti-Castro fliers when the warden offered him a weekend's leave, he said. He took a boat to the United States and was resettled in Virginia.
Mr. Serrano fled with a sister after his brothers were imprisoned for stealing food. Mr. Serrano survived the trip and was also placed in Virginia, but his sister drowned.
"They said it was a place where you didn't need to steal to live," said Mr. Serrano, who is now 19. "I wanted that more than anything."
At first, things were just as the teen-agers had imagined.
Their new homes were filled with wonderful technology -- stereos with remote controls, televisions with huge color screens and machines that answered the telephone when no one was home. The streets were clogged with cars, and the stores were filled with Levis, gold jewelry and a dizzying array of foods.
Confronted with such abundance, two brothers in Phoenix hoarded bread and hunted rabbits in the desert, convinced that the city would soon run out of food. In Richmond, Mr. Serrano once bought a can of dog food for lunch. He was eating it when his foster mother snatched the can from his hands. She was horrified, but Mr. Serrano knew then that he had really arrived. Imagine, he marveled, a country with so much food that it packaged some for pets. "At home, we barely have enough for people," he said.

Restrictions And Rebellion
But the free world, the Cubans discovered, was not so free.
"Here there are so many laws, laws against drinking, against smoking, against going to bars," complained Jacinto Infante, 18, who was resettled in Lansing. "In Cuba, a 14-year-old boy is a man, and you can do those things."
But when the teen-agers tried to live in the United States as they had in Cuba, there was trouble. Mr. Serrano, who started smoking when he was 12, was suspended from school for refusing to stop. Mr. Robles was expelled for cursing at a teacher and disrupting class.
In Washington, some teen-agers threatened social workers with knives. Mr. Romero was thrown out of two foster homes for fighting and skipping school.
"It's so hard for us to adapt to this new life," Mr. Infante said. "We come from an entirely different system, one that teaches you to rob, to fight, to do anything to survive."
But the social workers struggled to guide even the most rebellious teen-agers because behind the angry faces they saw lonely young people who were terrified that they would never fit in.
In New Jersey, one boy so missed his mother that he recorded their monthly phone conversations and replayed the tape before he fell asleep. Mr. Serrano wept as he relived his sister's drowning. Desperate to fit in at school, the teen-agers adopted the clothes and idols of their classmates.
"Oh, man!" Mr. Romero would say over and over, wearing his silver-rimmed sunglasses and his Red Sox baseball cap flipped backward. But some students laughed at his stilted English. "Go back where you came from," they yelled.
As the months passed, refugee workers saw that they had to adjust the programs. They moved teen-agers from foster homes into subsidized apartments, freeing them from family rules. They shifted some young people to part-time adult education, giving them more time to work. And for those who refused to work or to go to school, the officials terminated financial support.
"Now we see some progress," said Bach-Cuc Tran, director of the refugee minor program in Lansing, echoing the views of her colleagues.
Refugee workers say that the young people have not been in the United States long enough to find their way and that some may never find it. But they see hope in the success stories -- like the Michigan teen-ager who is starting community college this fall.
Mr. Robles, who was expelled from high school, has thrived in his adult-education program and now works part time as a cook. "It's not what I thought, no money falling from the sky," he said. "You can get ahead, but you have to work."
Mr. Serrano quit school and dropped out of the foster program that supported him. He now works at a poultry factory and lives with a sister. "I have work and I have food," he said, "which is more than I had at home."
Mr. Romero, who is now living with his third foster family, is starting his sophomore year in high school and hopes to join the military when he graduates. In a recent letter to his sister, he promised, "One day when people speak of me, they will speak of me with pride."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: CAMPAIGN FINANCE;
LOOPHOLES ALLOW PRESIDENTIAL RACE TO SET A RECORD

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Even though Republicans and Democrats strongly argued for campaign finance reform this year, both parties are taking advantage of a variety of loopholes to get around Federal campaign spending limitations, making the 1996 Presidential race the most expensive in history.
These loopholes are allowing corporations to pour money into the Presidential race at record levels -- at far more than the $5,000 legal limit. This year each party expects to raise $120 million to $150 million in private donations -- in addition to the $172 million in Federal money given to both parties. By November, some experts say, campaign spending may well surpass $600 million -- money spent by the parties, by the candidates' campaigns and by outside organizations, like labor unions or advocacy groups, on the candidates' behalf. 
 The biggest force behind the surge in fund-raising is the growth of what are known as soft-money donations, money from rich individuals and corporations that goes to the parties, not to the candidates. Critics say that soft dollars have become a backdoor source of money in the Presidential race that is easy to raise, hard to trace and makes a mockery of laws designed to prevent corporate influence peddling in Washington.
"The parties find it is a lot easier to raise $100,000 in soft money with one phone call to a corporation than to try to collect $1,000 donations from individuals," said Ellen Miller, executive director at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group.
"Soft dollars are like cyberspace accounting -- it's hard to follow where it goes," Ms. Miller added. "This is classic 'wink and a nod' behavior. Soft money barely makes the letter of the law. And within the spirit of the law, it's a joke."
The power of soft dollars came into play at the recent Democratic National Convention. At a luncheon paid for by the Public Securities Association, a Wall Street trade group, and several Wall Street firms, the Democratic Party honored members of its "Business Council," those who gave $10,000 or more, with a chance to meet with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. Many executives having lunch with Mr. Rubin were from businesses directly affected by Treasury decisions.
In addition, the executives were approached for even more money. Mr. Rubin gave a brief speech extolling the Clinton economic plan and criticizing Bob Dole. He was followed by Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic Party official, who praised Mr. Rubin as "the greatest fund-raiser in the history of the planet." Then, after explaining that "by law, Bob can't raise $1," Mr. McAuliffe exhorted the crowd to donate even more.
Under laws enacted in 1974, individuals can give only $1,000 to a Presidential candidate and corporate political-action committees are limited to $5,000 donations. To offset the loss of that private financing, money from the Federal Government was made available to candidates starting in 1974. This year, each candidate will receive $74 million for the general-election campaign and $12 million for the convention.
But, a glaring loophole remained -- corporations and individuals were allowed to give unlimited amounts to the national parties for activities like voter registration, television advertising and get-out-the-vote campaigns. This soft money is supposed to promote the party, and not specific candidates, but many see this as a distinction with little difference.
The $10,000-a-ticket 50th-birthday dinner for President Bill Clinton last month raised money for the Democratic Party. But, said one prominent Democratic fund-raiser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity: "You can spend $10,000 to wish happy birthday to Clinton, and it doesn't violate Federal rules."
Soft money was slow to catch on in the mid-1980's, and only became a force in the 1990's. Now, "the soft money numbers are off the charts," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit research group.
"This money is disbursed silently and mysteriously," Mr. Lewis added. "It is hard to track where it goes, but it supports the candidates. That's why it's called soft money, because it is so squishy. It can grease the skids in Washington for some powerful companies, while the average citizen doesn't have access."
Between Jan. 1, 1995, and June 30, 1996, both parties already exceeded previous soft-dollar records, and fund-raising is still in full swing.
The Democratic Party has raised $70.3 million in soft dollars so far -- more than twice the $34.5 million it raised in the entire 1992 Presidential race, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. By the end of June, the Republican Party raised $83.9 million in soft dollars, almost double the $49 million raised in 1992.
Party fund-raisers, while decrying the amounts spent this year, say both parties are caught in a financial version of an arms race -- each wants a financial war chest as big as their opponent's. Bipartistan legislation that would have barred political parties from handling soft money was killed in Congress this year.
"I have no reason to feel uncomfortable with soft dollars," said Howard Leach, finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. "All the parties do them and, unless the rules are changed, they will continue. I, personally, would like to see campaigns cost less money and run for a shorter period. But, since our opponents are running an expensive campaign, we have no alternative but to buy high-priced media like they do."
David Eichenbaum, communications director for the Democratic National Committee, said: "There is no question, there need to be changes in how campaigns are financed. But, until the overall system is changed, we are not in a position to say 'We won't raise money.' We want a level playing field."
The growth of soft money is the inevitable outcome of two clashing factors: the $1,000 individual limit and $5,000 corporate limit on contributions to candidates that were set two decades ago and have not kept pace with inflation and the rising cost of waging a media-driven Presidential campaign.
"The dollar limits are constant, but the cost of campaigning has gone up," said Kenneth Gross, a Washington attorney and former chief of enforcement at the Federal Election Commission. "The only outlet is an increase in soft dollars."
Already, some in the political process say the effect of soft dollars is corrupting. "There is just too much money being raised," said Alfred C. DeCotiis, a lawyer from West Orange, N.J., who has raised more than $5 million for the Democrats. "As a practical matter, if you write a large check, you get to be well known in the party and you get a certain amount of access."
Added Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat: "Money is distorting democracy now. Money not only determines who wins, but often who runs. If you've got a good idea and $10,000 and I've got a terrible idea and $1 million, I can convince people that the terrible idea is a good one."
Corporations, who often give money to both parties to insure access regardless of who wins, say that soft dollars are a way to get their message before influential politicians.
Some of the biggest soft-dollar donors are corporations with pressing issues in Washington. Telecommunications companies, whose fates are being rapidly reshaped by deregulation, are top givers. This industry has given $4.6 million in soft dollars, so far, $2.5 million to Republicans and $2.1 million to the Democrats.
Tobacco companies, under assault from an increasingly hostile Clinton Administration, also write big checks. They have also given $4.6 million to both parties, $3.9 million to the Republicans and $714,000 to the Democrats.
One of the big telecommunications donors is AT&T, which has given $743,000 in soft dollars, almost equally split between the parties.
"Government can change how you live and how you work," said Gerald Lowrie, senior vice president of the Federal Government Affairs for AT&T. "If you ignore who is in office, it can be at your peril."
Darienne Dennis, director of communications for Philip Morris, which sells tobacco, food and beer, said: "Philip Morris supports those who share our thoughts. We have a responsibility to our employees and shareholders to be in the political process and we are happy to do so."
Philip Morris, is the biggest soft-dollar donor to the Republicans, having given the party $1.6 million so far. The Democrats received a more modest $350,000 from the corporation.
Soft dollars, however, are only one of several ways to raise money while getting around the donation limits.
Each party has set up a compliance committee, with a budget of about $6 million, to pay for the cost of complying with Federal election laws. Individuals can make an additional $1,000 donation to one of these committees.
The two recent conventions saw the establishment of tax-deductible accounts for corporate donations to help offset the cost of running the political gatherings. About $25 million was raised for each convention by local host committee -- in addition to the $12 million in Federal money given to the parties.
"It seems like $12 million in public funds would be enough to buy a lot of balloons," said Mr. Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity. "But the parties have turned the conventions into Olympic sponsor-fests."
A new wrinkle in loopholes opened just two months ago when the United States Supreme Court ruled that under the constitutional protection of free speech political parties could set up "independent committees" to solicit even more donations, as long as the fund-raising and the activities it financed were not co-ordinated with the Presidential campaign.
Previously only lobbying groups, like the National Rifle Association or Americans for Term Limits, could set up such independent committees to benefit candidates. It is still too early to determine how big this loophole will be for the parties.
Then there are "in kind" donations of office space, phone banks and other equipment by businesses, which are difficult to value. AT&T, for instance, provided office space to the Republicans at their San Diego convention; Xerox provided photocopiers and General Motors provided cars to the Democrats in Chicago.
On top of all this, special-interest groups are spending their own money to support their favorite candidates -- money not regulated by the Federal Government. The big giver this year is the A.F.L.- C.I.O., the labor organization, which has endorsed Bill Clinton and has earmarked $35 million for a "grass-roots" campaign for pro-labor candidates.
"If you look at it, any spending limits that were put into the law are just not effective," said Herbert Alexander, head of the Citizens Research Foundation at the University of Southern California. "Soft money, labor money, compliance money and independent committees. It's all related to getting a Presidential candidate elected."

HEADLINE: What's New at G.M.? Cars, for a Change

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
GENERAL MOTORS, once one of America's most successful corporations, developed a reputation in the 1980's as a confused car-making bureaucracy that rolled out one look-alike product after another with little fanfare and modest sales success.
Now it is making a big attempt to get back on track. In one of the most ambitious new-car changeovers in a generation, the world's largest auto maker is preparing to introduce 15 all-new models in the next few months, replacing everything from its 14-year-old Buick Century to its Dustbuster-shaped mini-vans. The changes involve 10 assembly plants, 31,000 factory workers and hundreds of suppliers that will produce cars accounting for 40 percent of G.M. sales. 
 It is also trying out a marketing program borrowed from Procter & Gamble, whose former chairman, John G. Smale, served a stint as G.M.'s chairman until last year. He decreed that G.M. needed to better distinguish its seven brands, like Cadillac and Saturn, and 82 models of cars and trucks. As a result, G.M. has a platoon of recently hired recruits who know plenty about marketing baby wipes, pencils and Listerine, but are just getting their feet wet at selling Oldsmobiles, Cadillacs and Buicks.
At stake is whether G.M. can rebuild its core business of selling cars and vans in the United States. John F. Smith Jr., the affable finance man who was rushed in to rescue the company four years ago, must prove that he can successfully design, build and sell cars and mini-vans to a public that has lost much of its loyalty to G.M.'s brands.
While Mr. Smith and his team of lawyers and financial engineers get high marks for resuscitating G.M.'s balance sheet and turning impressive profits in the company's lending, satellite communications, electronics and other operations outside the car business, he has yet to prove he can remake the company into an auto-making star.
"It's a huge year for us," said G. Richard Wagoner Jr., the president of G.M.'s North American operations. "This year is basically all hands on deck to get the products out."
With nearly $170 billion in sales last year, G.M. is bigger than AT&T, I.B.M., Microsoft and Federal Express combined. And with more than 700,000 employees, it has twice the payroll of the United States Postal Service. Turning around such a Goliath is an enormous, complicated task given G.M.'s tendency for manufacturing glitches, ho-hum marketing and spotty quality.
"They will have a very tough time launching all those vehicles," said Alexander Trotman, chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, which has substantially overhauled its product line. He added, "It took 90 years to get where they are, and I don't think it's a five-year change" to turn it around.
G.M.'s task is especially difficult because it will be rolling out its new models over the next six months just as it tries to reach a new national labor contract with the United Automobile Workers union. G.M. has had rough labor relations. A 17-day strike in the spring virtually shut down G.M.'s North American auto production, and another disruption could turn this fall's introductions into a chaotic mess of shortages on dealers' lots and missed opportunities.
G.M.'s vehicle introductions must be successful if the company is to meet Mr. Smith's objective of earning profits equal to an average of 5 percent of sales in good years and bad. Although G.M. earned a staggering $6.88 billion last year, the most in corporate America, its profit margin worldwide was only 4.1 percent. While Mr. Smith has not announced a profit target for each year, G.M. needs roughly to double its current margins in good years if it has any hope of hitting the 5 percent average.
The prospects for G.M.'s shares also hang on the new models. The stock has fallen 3.3 percent over the last year, to $47.75 on Friday, while the Standard & Poor's 500 has climbed 15 percent.
Meeting the profit targets and bolstering the stock price won't be easy. G.M. has chosen to keep prices low in many segments, preferring to sell practical value instead of pricey sizzle. That leaves cost-cutting and increased efficiency as its chief means of raising profits. It is a delicate balance of manufacturing vehicles for less money while raising quality, and could lead to a showdown with the U.A.W. The union has been resisting every attempt by G.M. to buy less costly parts from nonunion suppliers.
"We need to be competitive in our plants, and that's the way we're approaching this," Mr. Smith, the chairman, chief executive and president of G.M., said this summer. "We've got to keep enough flexibility that we can go in and fix the weak plants."
Yet G.M. needs concessions from the U.A.W. if it is to remain competitive with domestic and foreign rivals. Ford and Chrysler buy a much larger proportion of their parts from outside suppliers that often are not unionized. The difference in outside purchases has given Ford a cost advantage over G.M. of $440 a vehicle, and Chrysler a $600 advantage, according to a study this summer by Harbour & Associates Inc., an automotive production consulting firm.
THE new models coming out this autumn are off to an uneven start. Automotive reviewers have been impressed with the design of some of the vehicles they have seen so far, notably G.M.'s five new 1997 mini-vans, two of which are for export. "We have some questions about rear-seat comfort, but beyond that they're just superb," said David E. Davis Jr., the editor of Automobile magazine and a driver with 40 years of experience in evaluating new cars.
The 1997 Pontiac Grand Prix, a sporty midsize sedan that turns heads in parking lots and is the first of the 15 models to go on sale, looks to be a hit. Starting at $18,579, the car, with its swooping lines and "wide track" stance, is getting a warm reception. Bob Carpenter, the general sales manager at a Pontiac dealership in Dallas, said he had been selling them as fast as they rolled off the trucks.
The problem is that they are not arriving faster. Whereas Ford cranked up its new full-sized pickup truck in six weeks, G.M. is taking six months to bring Grand Prix production to full speed at its Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City, Kan. "We're not going to be able to get enough," Mr. Carpenter said.
G.M. officials say they made a deliberate decision to assemble the new vehicles slowly at first. The hope is to maintain quality levels and break G.M.'s almost Soviet-style emphasis on production quotas, a holdover from the 80's that fostered a move-the-metal culture that paid too little attention to quality, particularly for new models.
"We are going to be methodical and very attentive to every detail," said Harry J. Pearce, the company's vice chairman. "It would be very inappropriate to base an assessment on one arbitrary variable, time."
The complexity of some of the new-model introductions is partly responsible for the slowness. Most auto makers try to avoid putting many models in one factory, particularly one that has just been modernized. But G.M. plans to build all five new mini-vans in a rebuilt factory in Doraville, Ga., that used to make midsized Oldsmobile sedans.
When Donald E. Hackworth, a G.M. group vice president, rattles off the planned output at Doraville, he sounds like someone describing an entire car line instead of the output of a single factory. "We build left-hand drive and right-hand drive, long wheelbase and short wheelbase, and four different engine families, including diesel, both manual and automatic," he said.
If G.M. someday succeeds in producing all of these mini-vans quickly and with high quality, it will reap large savings from the economies of scale. But for now, the mini-vans are inching along the assembly line at the rate of one every 12 minutes, so as to familiarize workers with the many different procedures needed to build such a variety of vehicles. The plan, Mr. Hackworth said, is to reach 60 mini-vans an hour this winter.
But the Doraville plant also has some labor tension. The U.A.W. is quietly fuming that G.M. has hired outside companies to manufacture the seats, install engine brackets and apply a protective coating for the shipment of export models, a union official said. Negotiations on these issues will proceed after a national labor contract is concluded, but the workers there have already voted overwhelmingly to go on strike if talks cannot settle the disputes.
The gentle pace of production, combined with the prospect of labor troubles, has troubled financial experts like Scott Merlis, an auto analyst in Westport, Conn., who have begun to reduce slightly their estimates of the company's third- and fourth-quarter earnings. Every month of low production means another month without a full return on the billions of dollars that G.M. has invested in developing the new models. And every month that passes before the new models are widely available leaves an opening for Japanese auto makers to hurry their own vehicles into production.
Indeed, John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Schroder Wertheim & Company, worries about Japanese auto makers reaching the market first in large quantities with cars like the 1997 Toyota Camry, an acclaimed new version of the midsize sedan that goes on sale tomorrow. The Camry has been significantly redesigned to compete at low prices with some G.M. models.
Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz, a New York investment and brokerage firm, is particularly critical of the slow Grand Prix introduction. "It's crazy -- it makes absolutely no economic sense," she said. "I don't know how they can ever make money on the program -- dealers want it now."
She pointed out that auto makers can charge the most money for a car in the first year of production, when customer interest is highest. "Sporty cars are cars of passion," she said. "There's an element of 'Gosh, it's new! I've got to have it now.' "
Mr. Hackworth, who oversees the G.M. group responsible for mini-vans and midsize and luxury cars, defended the Grand Prix introduction by pointing out that the company had continued to keep cars flowing to dealers by building some 1996 Grand Prix models in the summer even as production of '97 models began.
MR. WAGONER said all of G.M.'s new models would help the company's profits more than the models they replace. He contended that G.M. could start making new models quickly, as it did with the redesigned but not entirely new Saturn coupe this summer. But the company has given itself a far more ambitious test with the production of so many all-new models in Doraville and elsewhere.
"At Saturn, we're basically just changing the product, not changing the plant location," he said.
Yet G.M. is highly sensitive about the arrival of the Grand Prix and other new models. It has stopped releasing weekly production information on new models, breaking an auto industry tradition and making it harder for parts suppliers to forecast the need for their products.
Some analysts are more forgiving than Ms. Keller of G.M.'s deliberate pace in building new models. This year's factory changeovers, they point out, are going faster so far than the glacial, problem-ridden start of production two years ago of the Chevrolet Cavalier and Lumina.
"There's no question that General Motors can do better," said Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. "There's no question that this year is also an order of magnitude better than the launches of the last two or three years, and you have to walk before you can run."
G.M. plans to build up large-enough stocks of new models to introduce them at a rate of roughly two a month over the next half-year. When it does begin promoting them, it will rely on a new team of marketers, many from outside the auto industry. Their job is to bring new clarity to the public's impressions of brands like Buick, Oldsmobile and Chevrolet that have been muddied over the last two decades by too-similar cars and advertising.
The first G.M. division to emphasize brand management was Pontiac. The division's executives were among the earliest to spot where the power lies on G.M.'s board, modeling their efforts more than four years ago on Procter & Gamble's brand-management approach.
Through new designs and relentless repetition in advertisements, Pontiac has tried to convince the public once again that it is synonymous with excitement. The goal is to produce such loyalty to Pontiac that buyers are willing to pay extra for its cars, said Bill Heugh, brand manager for the Pontiac Grand Prix.
"One way you can measure brand equity is to answer the question: Does the market let you charge a premium for your product, or does it force you to discount it with constant rebates and other incentives?" Mr. Heugh said when the Grand Prix was introduced earlier this summer.
Because many G.M. executives lack experience with strong brands, the previously tradition-bound G.M. has made some surprising moves to bring in expertise. Just a few months ago, Robert P. Baird was in charge of selling Baby Fresh baby wipes at Scott Paper. Now he is the brand manager in charge of persuading as many customers as possible to plant themselves in the seats of the latest Cadillac Sevilles and Eldorados.
Cadillac buyers and babies have something in common, Mr. Baird said in a recent speech in Chantilly, Va. "I've found out that whether it's baby wipes or luxury cars, there's one thing that's universal -- if given a choice, everyone would rather have heated seats," he said.
The new brand managers face G.M. bureaucrats and car dealers who refuse to allow the death of any of the company's seven car and truck lines. The result is that the brand managers must persuade the public this autumn that there is a difference not only between a Chevrolet mini-van and a Ford mini-van, but also among a Chevy, a Pontiac and an Oldsmobile.
G.M. executives say that cars that look alike when lined up will seem quite different when advertised with separate slogans and displayed in separate showrooms. Four of G.M.'s new midsize sedans looked fairly similar when displayed together in January at the Detroit auto show. But Vincent Barabba, G.M.'s head of market research, said they would look different in showrooms.
"You can create a lot of difference in how a customer feels about a vehicle from how you position them," he said.
SOME experts are more skeptical, saying that while G.M. may have strengthened its brand images, its 82 models are still too many and the company will inevitably end up dissipating its advertising budget trying to promote them all. Ms. Keller at Furman Selz was particularly critical of the four midsize sedans -- the Buick Century, Chevrolet Malibu, Oldsmobile Cutlass and Pontiac Grand Prix -- that will soon compete in a market segment that is shrinking steadily as more and more Americans buy Jeeps and other sport utility vehicles. G.M. will introduce two other midsize sedans next year, the Buick Regal and Oldsmobile Intrigue.
"They may be different from one another, there just may not be any market for them, or certainly not as big a market as was hoped for," Ms. Keller said.
Even if G.M. has found a winning strategy for designing, building and marketing cars, it faces rocky labor relations. G.M. has had eight local strikes in the last three years, including the 17-day walkout in March at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, that crippled assembly plants across North America. Ford has not had a local strike in a decade and is counting on that record to quickly bring out the Expedition, a large sport utility vehicle that will compete in a segment G.M. has had to itself with the Tahoe, Yukon and Suburban.
"One of the secrets of our profit success this year is how quickly we can get the Expedition launched," John M. Devine, Ford's chief financial officer, said at the company's annual meeting last spring in Kansas City, Mo. "You have to have a good relationship with the U.A.W."
All of this adds up to a difficult but surmountable challenge, G.M. officials contend. "In an organization as large and as complex as G.M., it's naive to think you can make changes" quickly, Mr. Pearce said. "We're making what I would call consistent, steady progress."
G.M. executives are reluctant to predict what will happen to the world's largest auto maker if they fail. If the new models turn out to be duds, or if G.M. executives lock themselves into too generous a labor contract, G.M.'s trucks, foreign auto sales and satellite communications business will help keep the corporation soundly profitable as long as the American economy thrives.
But with North American automotive operations still accounting for more than two-thirds of the corporation's sales, G.M. must develop successful models now or the next recession will be a horrible experience indeed.

A Day in the Life of Ivan Subovitch

 BODY:
The first annual Substitute Teacher Appreciation Week begins today, honoring those who, in its founder's phrase, "get no sick days or respect." Is it really that bad? To find out, we called Paul Emus of Imperial Beach, Calif., a typical sub whose four years in various southern California school districts inspired "Not Young Enought to Know Everything," a self-published book of tips for fellow sufferers. Emus admits to being ambivalent about sub life; intrigued, we asked him to blend his experiences into a composite day. A composite worst day. 
 5:30 A.M. The phone clangs. On most mornings, it's an automated substitute-procurement system, which, HAL-like, tells Emus to press 1 to accept a job, 2 to decline. Today it's Carmen, a friendly sub procurer from San Isidro Middle School. Emus likes Carmen. He takes the job.
 7:30 A.M. Emus arrives at San Isidro in his Volkswagen van. He packs a TV, a VCR and - as emergency entertainment - a karaoke machine. San Isidro, near Tijuana, is so tough that subs there receive an extra $15 "combat pay." With wary affection, Emus describes its students as "little gangsters."
 8:30 A.M. In homerooms, Emus, a sturdy sixfooter, discovers there is no seating chart, a vital tool of keeping unfamiliar students in order. When he tries to seat them, chaos erupts, and Emus starts ejecting students. But in the end it is Emus who is expelled, for losing his temper during the uproar. "I was actually, uh, relieved," he recalls later. "We all have bad days."
 Noon. Emus pulls afternoon duty at Chula Vista High. At lunchtime he escorts his students to the cafeteria but he doesn't join them because school chow has made him ill several times. Instead Emus retreats to his van for a lonely yet economical lunch: canned fruit cocktail.
1 P.M. Assigned to physical-education class, Emus leads 50 students outside but he fails to notice that one of them has taped the locker-room door so that it does not lock. When he returns an hour later, he finds the contents of all the locker bins on the floor and graffiti on the walls.
 2:45 p.M. One more chance of venue: Bonita High, an academically sound school in a community known for its high concentration of millionaires. A nice opportunity ... except that when Emus tries to discipline certain "spoiled" students, they ignore him, flaunting their family wealth and connections. After school, Emus loads up his van, noticing with resignation that most students drive cars nicer than his.
9:30 P.M. In bed, Emus contemplates life. "You can't be a substitute forever," he sighs, citing his average annual earnings of $13,000. (He makes ends meet in the National Guard.) Yet the alternative - one of the full-time teaching jobs he has applied for - may involve too much commitment. "I try not to worry," Emus says. "I go home, get a good night's sleep." Good idea. Work resumes at 5:30 sharp.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Manhasset, L.I.;
A Prosperous Enclave of Gracious Living

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
FROM the crest of Manhasset Avenue, it is possible to view two features that help make well-to-do Manhasset -- a blue-chip area that, by tradition, includes most of five incorporated villages.
On one side, beneath an overpass, Long Island Rail Road tracks lead to Manhattan, a brisk 28-minute commute on spiffy express trains that run, after one stop in Great Neck, uninterrupted to Penn Station. 
 Down a sweeping entrance road on the other side, the clock tower of Manhasset High School, one of Long Island's most highly regarded public schools, rises from a handsome campus. Members of the Class of 1996 were accepted at 171 colleges rated highly competitive by Barron's College Guide. Ninety-five percent of the class is going on to higher education.
"There is no doubt our schools and our commute to the city are two of our best points," said Diane Harragan, the president of Blaich House and Home Realty.
But in Manhasset, she and others said, there is much more.
An air of unquenchable prosperity, subdued but unmistakable, pervades distinct neighborhoods where roomy, sturdily constructed, single-family houses, many built during the 1930's or earlier, have been upgraded, expanded and improved.
Homes built by William Levitt before World War II give a strong unifying element to the Strathmores and Strathmore Vanderbilt unincorporated areas where "every house is magnificent and very different," said Carole Belley of Lovejoy Real Estate. The homes are grander than those that Mr. Levitt went on to build in Levittown. Scrupulously maintained, early-19th-century homes rise from landscaped splendor in older villages, where colonials, Dutch colonials and Tudors shine.
THEN there is Manhasset Bay, where sailing is a passion. Private clubs include the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club and the Port Washington Yacht Club for sailors, boaters, tennis and dining. For golfers, the Plandome Country Club has an 18-hole course. One village, Plandome, has its own dock and a village green with tennis courts.
The 36-acre Long Island Science Museum on the Leeds Pond Preserve offers educational programs emphasizing field and lab studies on its wooded grounds.
And the Miracle Mile, a regional shopping hub on Northern Boulevard, features the tony 193,000-square-foot, 50-store Americana at Manhasset shopping plaza, including Giorgio Armani and Barneys, on one end and stores like Lord & Taylor and Barnes & Noble on the other.
But on nearby Plandome Road, where a new clock tower on a commercial building is a recent adornment, Manhasset's traditional downtown shopping area and its enduring hometown feeling have not been eclipsed.
Longtime Plandome Road staples include Wright Hardware, which was opened in 1921, and the Manhasset Theater triplex moviehouse, which, with its Art Deco design, opened in 1935.
Annie V. Holdreith, a sales agent at O'Connell Real Estate, said Manhasset reminded her of a New England village. But the economy, she and others said, is tied to that other island.
"Other towns can be affected by the Long Island economy," Ms. Holdreith said. "Here, we are driven by the Manhattan economy because of all the people who work in the city."
"For Sale" signs are never posted here, but about 160 Manhasset homes were on the market this summer. Realtors said strong demand had grown even stronger in the last year. Young families, people who grew up in the area and people moving up from Queens or less exalted parts of Nassau County were among the prome buyers, they said.
While Manhasset is overwhelmingly white, a black community has deep roots in an area once known as the Valley. The AME Zion Church on Community Drive, built in 1833 and now a Town of North Hempstead designated historic landmark, served free blacks and Matinecock Indians before the Civil War and still holds services.
North Shore University Hospital is also on Community Drive, as are a number of commercial buildings.
Manhasset has a full array of civic organizations, Protestant and Catholic churches and Jewish synagogues. The Friends Meeting House on Northern Boulevard, an old Indian trail, marks a Quaker presence that dates to the 17th century.
The nearby Onderdonk house, built in 1836, is a town landmark and a leading example of Greek Revival architecture. It was the home of Judge Horatio Gates Onderdonk, grandson of Adrian Onderdonk, the town's first Supervisor.
Home prices tend to be lower in unincorporated areas of Manhasset, though the Whitney estate and other grand properties are in these areas south of Northern Boulevard. But in general, prices tend to be higher in the villages of Plandome Heights, Munsey Park and Flower Hill, and highest in the villages of Plandome and Plandome Manor.
House rentals, when they can be found, range from $2,000 to more than $3,000 a month for a three-bedroom house. They are far higher for larger homes. The 200 or so Condominiums on Shelter Rock and Searingtown Road sell from about $400,000 to $800,000.
Stone Hill, a housing development planned on the former William S. Paley estate on Shelter Rock Road, will offer custom homes for around $1 million. Nearby, homes at the Grace Wood development on the former W.R. Grace estate start at $750,000. New houses start at $1.3 million in a small development on Manhasset Woods Road.
IN a recent directory of America's 300 richest towns published by Worth magazine, Plandome Manor, Plandome, Flower Hill and Munsey Park were in the top 50. Plandome Heights ranked 150th, and the unincorporated area of Manhasset was 226th. The ratings were based on average household income and housing value.
A part of the Village of North Hills is in the Manhasset school district. Shelter Rock, a large glacial boulder with a ledge that once sheltered Matinecock Indians from wind and rain, is there.
Many Manhasset children attend private schools, but the general feeling here is that Manhasset public schools, with about 2,300 students, are equal or superior to them.
Seventy percent of the 176 graduates of Manhasset High School's Class of 1996 earned Regents diplomas. Advanced-placement courses, honors classes and advanced research programs are offered. More than 80 percent of students participate in extracurricular programs. And there are 65 athletic teams.
The middle school, for the seventh and eighth grades, is in the high-school complex. There are two elementary schools for kindergarten through sixth grade, the Munsey Park School and the Shelter Rock School.
St. Mary's Roman Catholic School on Northern Boulevard teaches kindergarten through 12th grade and also has pre-kindergarten programs. About 97 percent of graduates in the Class of 1996 are going on to college. Eight hundred and fifty students attend the high school. Tuition is $4,200.
College preparatory courses are offered in English, computers, business, social studies, math, science, foreign languages, religious studies, art and music. The ice hockey team won a state championship this year.
Sister Mariette, the assistant principal at St. Mary's, said the school attracted students from diverse economic and cultural backgrounds. About 450 pupils attend elementary classes. Extended-day programs through the eighth grade run to 6:30 P.M. Tuition ranges from $2,100 to $2,600.
The name Manhasset, first applied between 1835 and 1845 to an area previously known as Little Cow Bay, was derived from the Indian word Manhansett, meaning "island neighborhood." The Manhansetts also inhabited Shelter Island.
The Matinecocks called the Manhasset area Sink Sink, meaning "place of many stones." By the 17th century, the British and Dutch were disputing ownership. In 1640, English settlers from Lynn, Mass., sailed into Cow Bay, now Manhasset Bay, but were chased off by the Dutch. They sailed on to Southampton.
On the eve of the Revolutionary War, residents of the north shore of Hempstead split with their Loyalist neighbors to the south. Many joined the Continental Army or local militias. In 1784, in a reflection of the split, the State Legislature formed the northern area into the Town of North Hempstead. The town hall, not built until 1907, is on Plandome Road in Manhasset, opposite a park where the old Plandome Road School once stood.
A trestle crossing the valley brought the Long Island Rail Road to Manhasset in 1897. But not until 1924, when a new station was dedicated at its current site, did downtown Manhasset begin to grow. By the 1930's, Manhasset was already established as a prosperous commuter town. Another station is in Plandome.
Manhasset housing prices soared in the mid-70's and have been climbing, with few pauses, ever since. "In the early 1970's, you could get together $25,000 and move here," said Charles M. Studness, a Manhasset resident. "Now entry people need a lot more resources."

BUDGET BUZZ: There was shock in Manhasset last May when the annual school budget, normally a shoo-in, was unexpectedly rejected by a vote of 961 to 895. The following month it passed easily, 2,144 to 1,216, with just a little less than $200,000 trimmed from the original $43,722.252 proposal. But there is a sense in the community that the original budget rejection and an earlier voter spurning of an $8 million plan for a new Manhasset Public Library last year is a sign of purse-tightening in the highly taxed, conservative area. "I don't know why it was defeated," said Charlotte A. Lee, an investment banker who is financial secretary of the 50-year-old library's board of trustees. "It was a great idea and a great location." A $13 million building plan failed two years earlier. Now the library is falling back on its own resources to build a 250-square-foot expansion. On Sept. 25, the mood of Manhasset voters will be tested again in a referendum on a $21.5 million proposal to reconstruct, enlarge and improve public school buildings.

HEADLINE: Laud Limits on New York Business Districts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thank you, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, for turning your attention to New York City's business improvement district programs (news article, Sept. 5). I am perplexed by the lack of city control over tax assessment monies given to the districts. 
 The business improvement district for Madison Avenue, which personally concerns me as an art gallery owner, is an oxymoron.
Madison Avenue does not have to be improved; the businesses are the improvement. With its international flavor, the avenue is the most elegant of the city.
Most shops have their own garbage pickup, maintain their sidewalks and have private guards.
I do not deny that an improvement district may function in other areas, but I question their budgets and excessive executive salaries.
Must things arrive at crisis before we are aware of the potential for fraud and misuse of funds? I fear that without surveillance the surtax on real estate, paid mostly by the shops, may be again raised to feed the further expenses of the district fiefs.

HEADLINE: Huddled Masses in the Schools

BYLINE: By Frank Padavan; Frank Padavan, a Republican, represents northeastern Queens in the New York State Senate.

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
New York City's students went back to school this week, taking their seats in overcrowded classrooms -- and in closets and locker rooms and spaces carved out of auditoriums. What is to blame for the congestion? You need not look much further than the huge and continuing increase in the population of immigrant students.
In the past 10 years, school enrollment has soared from 850,000 to 1.06 million, a rise of 200,000. When classes began on Wednesday, the system counted 134,875 students who had entered the United States in just the past three years. 
 The Board of Education has long been aware of this mounting crisis. Three years ago, at hearings I conducted in the State Senate, Robert Tobias, director of strategic planning, projected that 383 schools would have to be built by 2003, at a cost of $10 billion, to accommodate the expected rise in immigrants. At the time, only 25 schools were under construction.
Immigration is a national problem, of course, with enormous local consequences. Yet the response from the Federal Government has been virtually nonexistent. Congress, which has never moved aggressively to combat illegal immigration, recently decreed that legal immigration should remain at its historically high levels. It is unlikely to pass a bill allowing states to withhold public education for illegal immigrants; and even if it did, it is most unlikely that President Clinton would sign such legislation.
I do not advocate pulling children out of public schools, regardless of where they were born. But Congress should at least recognize its responsibility to provide financial aid to New York City and the handful of urban centers that have been bearing most of the burden of immigration, both legal and illegal. To date, efforts to compel Congress to share the costs have been uniformly unsuccessful. In lawsuits brought on behalf of New York and other states, the Federal courts have held that Congress has no constitutional obligation to contribute to immigration-related local costs; conversely, the courts have said that while Congress can deny immigrants financial support, New York State cannot.
President Clinton has recently proposed a change that would allow states to redirect Federal education dollars from programs to new classrooms. The change could have a major impact on New York City's overcrowding, without imposing a significant burden on Federal taxpayers.
But first, the city must recognize the need. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani must acknowledge that the immigration of the 1990's has added to the city's burden, especially in education. Gov. George E. Pataki should join the Mayor and let Congressional leaders know that New York City needs this kind of help. Politics should not be a factor here, since the affected cities and states represent a bipartisan collection.
New York City's members of Congress must recognize that the quality of life enjoyed by the immigrants they represent will be determined by the caliber of their education. And not just immigrants: all neighborhoods, all groups are imperiled by overcrowding in the schools. So is the city's ability to contribute productive employees to the work force. In the end, the region's economic future is at risk. The stakes are too high to ignore.

HEADLINE: Okinawans Send Message to Tokyo and U.S. to Cut Bases

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: NAHA, Okinawa, Sept. 8

 BODY:
In a referendum aimed at sending a message to Washington and Tokyo, citizens of Okinawa voted today by an overwhelming ratio of 10 to 1 in favor of a reduction in the American military bases on this island in the south of Japan.
But the message was muted by a low voter turnout of 59.5 percent. Saying a high turnout would be needed for the ballot to be influential, the Okinawa government and other opponents of the bases mounted an energetic campaign to get people to the polls by arguing that this would be a historic opportunity for people to take their future into their own hands. 
 Okinawa's Governor, Masahide Ota, a leading opponent of the bases, argued that despite the low turnout, 53 percent of the 910,000 registered voters favored the base reduction.
"It's the first time Okinawan people have displayed their will on their own," he said at a news conference tonight.
It is not clear how much impact the results will have. The referendum is not legally binding, and the bases are a national matter, not a local matter, to be decided by the Governments of the United States and Japan.
Officials of both Governments say they knew even before the referendum that Okinawans disliked the bases, and in April officials proposed a plan to close some of them, including a noisy helicopter field.
"The issues are there anyway, whether or not there is a referendum," a United States official said before the balloting. He and a Japanese official said the preliminary base reduction plan was not likely to change much by the time the final plan was issued in November.
Still, the results today suggest that people here are not satisfied with the reductions announced so far. The plebiscite will also serve to keep the spotlight on the issue and keep up the pressure on Washington and Tokyo, some analysts say.
"The result shows that the people back Ota's stance," Muneyuki Shindo, a professor of government at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, said tonight, "and I think the Tokyo Government will have no choice but to respond to that."
Koichi Kato, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, which is the center of Japan's governing coalition, said the Government would strive for more base cutbacks.
"A majority of the voters cast ballots and we take this seriously," he the Kyodo news service quoted him as saying.
But Naoyoshi Sunagawa, general secretary of an organization representing those who rent their land to the bases, said that because of the low turnout and the vague way the question on the ballot was worded, the referendum result cannot be read as an endorsement of Governor Ota's campaign to eliminate all bases by 2015.
"It shows that the base reduction should be conducted in a realistic way," he said.
Governor Ota will meet with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Tuesday and is expected to hear about programs to help support the economic development of Okinawa, which is the poorest prefecture in Japan.
Mr. Hashimoto, who is expected to call for a parliamentary election this fall, wants to keep the Okinawa situation in check. He particularly wants Governor Ota to sign leases allowing for the continued use by United States forces of some privately owned land on Okinawa. Mr. Ota tonight declined to say whether he would sign.
Today's vote took place almost exactly a year after the rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl, who was abducted by three American servicemen subsequently convicted for the attack. The crime unleashed pent-up fury at the bases, and that outcry led to the base reduction plan announced in April.
The referendum was the first ever held by a prefecture in Japan and is part of a budding movement toward local ballots in a nation long controlled by the central Government. Last month, the town of Maki held the nation's first official local referendum, also nonbinding, in which voters rejected plans for a nuclear plant in their town.
While many people welcome these moves toward local autonomy, officials in the central Government are increasingly worried that important national facilities like military bases, power plants and waste incinerators will never find homes if local voters can reject them.
The question of local determination is a poignant one for Okinawa, a sun-dappled chain of islands that has long been subject to rule by others. Once an independent kingdom, Okinawa was annexed by Japan in the 1870's, and many Okinawans feel that they are treated as second-class citizens. The islands were occupied by the United States from the end of World War II until 1972, two decades after the occupation of the rest of Japan ended.
Now, despite the fact that Okinawa accounts for less than 1 percent of the land area of Japan, it is home to 75 percent of the United States bases and well over half of the 47,000 American servicemen in Japan.
On the main island of Okinawa, bases take up 20 percent of the land. That has subjected residents to crime, noise and dangers from accidents like plane crashes.
The referendum here was different from the typical plebiscite in that it was not intended to tell the local government how to act. It was aimed at giving momentum to the prefectural government's campaign to rid the island of bases.
The final tally was 482,538 or 89.1 percent, in favor of a base reduction, 46,232, or 8.5 percent, opposed and 12,856 invalid ballots.
A lopsided vote in favor of base reduction was expected, so instead of the margin, many people were focusing on the turnout. This was especially so because some groups favoring the bases or those opposed to holding the referendum, including the local branch of the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan's largest political party, urged people to stay away from the polls.
The turnout of 59.5 percent was lower than the 66 percent turnout in the election for the prefectural assembly earlier this year and lower than the 62 percent turnout in last year's gubernatorial election, when Mr. Ota was re-elected. In Maki, where the nuclear referendum was held last month, 88 percent of the registered voters cast ballots.
Some people apparently did not vote today because of worries about the economic impact of base closings. Even though cities with bases are most subject to the noise and dangers from them, they are also most economically dependent on them.
In the village of Kin, where the rape of the schoolgirl took place, the turnout was only 52 percent, and 20 percent of those who voted opposed the base reduction, twice as many as for the prefecture as a whole.
Others said they had not voted because the question on the ballot was vague and poorly phrased. People were asked whether they agreed with or were opposed to a consolidation and reduction of the American bases and a review of the Status of Forces Agreement, which specifies the rights of American military personnel in Japan.
But the question did not specify how much or how quickly the bases should be cut back or how the forces agreement should be modified. And it did not allow for people to vote separately on the two issues.

HEADLINE: Aristide, Out of the Limelight, Keeps Place in Haiti's Heart

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
He has been out of office since his term expired in February, and nearly two years have elapsed since 20,000 American troops landed here to restore him to power. But Jean-Bertrand Aristide's hold on the imagination and aspirations of his countrymen seems as strong as ever.
Each morning, supplicants gather outside the gates of the compound near the airport where the former President and his new wife now live, quietly and comfortably. Politics in this country continues to be defined by whether you are for or against him, and walls all over the capital are still filled with paintings of his smiling face or graffiti urging his return to power. 
 But Mr. Aristide, 43, is maintaining a low profile these days. He has traveled to Europe and Japan since leaving office and will soon embark on a college lecture tour in the United States. Here at home he has made an effort to stay out of the public eye and to build the sort of domestic life never available to him in the past.
"He is his same calm self," said William L. Swing, who as the American Ambassador here continues to see the former President often. "He is listening to his classical music, doing a lot of reading, and writing. But he really hasn't been out a lot."
Two weeks before he left office, Mr. Aristide, a former Roman Catholic priest, married Mildred Trouillot, 33, a Haitian-American lawyer who had been one of the legal advisers to his Government. They are expecting their first child in the fall, and while Mr. Aristide has not talked much in public about the pregnancy, his transformation from Catholic priest to expectant father in less than two years fascinates the Haitian public.
Initially, some of Mr. Aristide's more ardent followers worried that his marriage to an American-raised descendant of a prominent light-skinned family here might weaken his commitment to Haiti's poor. But Mr. Aristide said that neither his marriage nor impending parenthood should be any cause for concern to the peasants and slum-dwellers who voted him into power in 1990 and remained loyal to him during his three years in exile.
"Frankly, I feel the same," he said during an interview at his home here. "A human being is a human being, and when someone is attacked or hit, I feel that I too am attacked or hit, and when they are hungry, I feel that I am hungry.
"Some people think I will be different, and they are surprised, or happy, to see that I am the same man, ready to listen to people and share their concerns when they are facing problems. Being a priest one day, a President the next day, being a former President today -- it all means giving to someone and wanting to serve."
Though Mr. Aristide has moved from the presidential palace to a spacious, whitewashed residence in the suburb of Tabarre that is guarded both by United Nations troops and private bodyguards, petitioners continue to flock to his door for assistance or favors. During a typical day, he said, he receives visitors "from early in the morning until late at night, and then my personal day will start."
Among those who have sought his counsel is his successor as President, Rene Preval, a friend who in the past was so close that people often referred to them as twins. "We talk as often as is necessary," Mr. Aristide said. "It can be more than once a day, or it might be every couple of days."
In mid-July, the Haitian Government uncovered what it described as an assassination plot against the two men organized by former military officers. Mr. Aristide, who survived numerous such attacks when he was a parish priest, made it clear that he remains fatalistic about such threats, his newly enriched life as a family man nothwithstanding.
"I always said my life was for my country and my people, and I gave that life years ago," he said. "I have had to assume that responsibility."
This spring, there were indications of a rift between the current and former presidents, with Mr. Aristide subtly undermining the economic privatization plan that the United States and other foreign aid donors were pressuring Mr. Preval to carry out. But when Mr. Aristide returned from his trip to Japan this summer Mr. Preval made a point of going to the airport to embrace him.
The focus of most of Mr. Aristide's attention is the Aristide Foundation for Democracy, a nonprofit organization "which seeks to deepen the roots of Haitian democracy by increasing popular participation," according to its charter. At its church-like auditorium just down the road from Mr. Aristide's home, the group has organized seminars on political issues, sports, music and theater programs for children, and literacy classes for adults.
The foundation's latest program is its most ambitious: a savings and loan association intended to encourage small-scale business and agricultural projects among the poor. In less than a week this summer, more than 12,000 people enrolled as members before registration was closed, contributing a minimum of $7.00 in return for the right to borrow money at interest of 1 percent a month.
Mr. Aristide remains involved with Lafanmi Selavi, the charity for orphaned and abandoned street children that he founded when he was a parish priest. He also is sponsoring a project to give poor children a radio outlet of their own and allow them, as he put it, "to tell Haiti what they think of life, so that we listen to them, and not only them to us.
"These kids are like my sons or little brothers," he said. "As the father of Lafanmi Selavi, I try to educate my sons, and my daughters too, from the streets in order to see them assume their own responsibilities in the future."
But Lafanmi Selavi, which means "the family is life" in Creole, has also become the focus of a heated political controversy here. Mr. Aristide's critics, who have become bolder and more outspoken since his departure from office, have accused the organization of siphoning off millions of dollars from aid that Taiwan offered the Haitian Government for a road-building project.
"There is nothing, nothing, nothing true about those allegations," Mr. Aristide said. An agreement with Taiwan called for Lafanmi Selavi "to receive money to pay the companies to build the road" and oversee its construction, he said, but all money was to be channeled through the Haitian Government, which "still has to pay the money that they owe" to contractors.
"Lafanmi Selavi has not made money on this," said Laura Flynn, an aide to Mr. Aristide. "At this point, it is actually out money."
Mr. Aristide's opponents have also suggested that his foundation is less a genuine grass-roots self-help organization than a political vehicle intended to help him mount another run for the presidency when Mr. Preval's term expires in 2001 (the Haitian Constitution forbids a President from succeeding himself). But he scoffed at that notion, arguing that the foundation is engaged in the same kind of work for the destitute and the oppressed that has interested him all his life.
"If some people for their own reasons are frightened because they see poor people getting together in a peaceful way, sharing hope, that is their right, to be afraid," he said, chuckling. "And it is our right to assure them that we are the same as always: always nonviolent, always together, always open."

HEADLINE: Workfare Cuts Costs but Tracking New Jobs Poses Problems

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has often described his workfare program -- by far the largest in the nation -- as "saving the lives" of people on welfare by putting them to work. But while the program has helped New York City slash its welfare spending, it has not demonstrated that it can rebuild the futures of men and women on welfare.
According to city records, less than one-tenth of those who have spent time working for their benefits in the workfare program have reported to the city that they have found full-time jobs. 
 By contrast, nearly two-thirds of the 122,700 people who have been in the workfare program since it began in early 1994 have left it a few months later, disappearing from the city's books. Though they have given up their welfare benefits, saving the city $175 million in this year alone, they left behind no indication of whether they have gained either real jobs or the "renewed self-worth" the Mayor says workfare provides.
The remaining 35,000 people are still in the workfare program, cleaning streets and parks, doing clerical work and assisting janitors in city buildings, all in exchange for their welfare benefits.
The city has made no effort to track the progress of the 89,000 people who have left the workfare program. As a result, it does not even know what has happened to the 11,700 people who have reported finding real employment. Some of the private companies who have hired large groups of former workfare participants for real jobs say they are happy with the program, but report that only a few workers have kept their "permanent" jobs longer than a few months.
City officials argue that the majority of those who have left the program probably have jobs, noting that the homeless rate has not significantly risen in the last year and a half, while the crime rate has fallen. But they concede that they really do not know what has happened to most of those who have left workfare.
"Where else could they have gone?" asked Richard J. Schwartz, the Mayor's senior adviser and the architect of the workfare program. "If they weren't finding work, the evidence of that would be out on the streets of the city, in plain sight to everyone, but that simply isn't the case, because the program works."
He said that in the course of assembling the workfare program in a few months, the city has not been able to track the progress of everyone who has left. "That's a completely unrealistic expectation of how welfare and workfare can be administered," he said, adding that the city eventually plans to make a survey of those who leave workfare to determine what happens to them.
City officials declined to provide a list of people who have left workfare, saying interviews with those who have left would violate privacy clauses of the state social-services law. Asked for data, several welfare advocacy groups said they did not keep records of people who have already left workfare.
The effect of workfare on its participants is becoming an issue of great concern around the country the recent passage of the new Federal welfare law, which requires a quarter of adults on welfare to be working within two years, and half of them within five years. Those who favor such provisions say working for benefits prepares welfare recipients for the private workplace, forcing them to face the fact that in five years, most will be cut off from assistance under the new law.
The new law "emphasizes work and independence, to give people on welfare a chance to draw a paycheck, not a welfare check," President Clinton said last month in explaining his decision to sign the bill. "It gives us a better chance to give those on welfare what we want for all families in America, the opportunity to succeed at home and at work."
But there is no evidence from the nation's largest experiment with workfare that any such preparation is taking place. Only a few hundred of the 35,000 people now in the workfare program are receiving any kind of job-specific training, and city officials have expressed more concern about reducing the number of people of welfare than in learning what happens to those who leave.
"They don't want to know the answer to that question, because it would destroy the myth that people are going from welfare to work," said Stephen DiBrienza, chairman of the City Council's General Welfare Committee and a frequent critic of the Giuliani administration's welfare policies. "It is an absolute myth."
Faced with the small number of people reporting leaving workfare for jobs, Mayor Giuliani has now begun saying that permanent employment is not necessarily the point of the workfare program.
"Frankly, the workfare program in and of itself is a valuable program, whether it leads to permanent employment for every single person," the Mayor said on his weekly radio show last month. "To say to somebody that in exchange for your welfare check, you have to do something that improves the quality of life for your fellow citizens, that's what the social contract is all about."
Workfare, in fact, has been more valuable to the city by helping to push recipients off the welfare rolls before they even participate in the program. In the year and a half since the Mayor instituted his welfare changes -- which along with workfare have included a tough new eligibility screening program and finger-imaging for participants -- 166,000 people have left the welfare rolls. Half of those people never entered the workfare program, forced out because they did not meet the new requirements or dropping out voluntarily.
Many of those people already had jobs or found jobs quickly when faced with the threat of spending 26 hours a week in the workfare program. Mr. Schwartz said 27,000 people gave up their welfare benefits once they were told to report to workfare jobs; 22,000 of those said they already had jobs or had found new ones. That number is almost twice as high as the 11,700 who have reported finding real jobs after participating in the workfare program, formally called the Work Experience Program and known as WEP.
The program has also proved useful to the Mayor in his effort to improve city services while the budget and the number of city employees has been reduced. He called a news conference last week, for example, to claim that the city's parks were cleaner than they have been in years, a fact that he and Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern attributed in part to the 5,200 workfare participants now picking up trash and doing other chores for the Parks Department.
Performing such tasks, however, is often more valuable to the city than it is to the long-term careers of the workers. Critics of the program say the administration's decision to use the workers for city services rather than to provide them job training will mire them in a future of menial work.
"If workfare is going to be effective, it has to be redesigned as a training program," said Mark Cohan, a lawyer with the Center on Social Welfare Policy and Law, a Manhattan-based organization that assists lawyers for welfare recipients. "At the moment, there is absolutely no evidence that WEP has been effective in moving people from welfare to work."
Currently, Mr. Schwartz said, about 1,500 people are involved in small pilot training programs in city parks and in building maintenance, learning skills like plumbing, carpentry and specialized cleaning. But for the most part, it is the fact of their working, rather than any specific skills, that is the prime benefit to the 35,000 people in workfare, he and the Mayor said.
"It's a lot better than their staying at home, just collecting a check at home," Mr. Giuliani told the First New York Conservative Democratic Club in Forest Hills, Queens, at a recent political meeting. "It's a lot better for us, and most importantly, it's a lot better for them. It keeps them in the work force, it makes work discipline and the work ethic a part of their life. And frankly it gives them something worthwhile to do."
Though New York City's workfare program is far larger than comparable programs around the country, its results so far in finding employment have been similar. A 1993 national study by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, which was financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, found "little evidence that unpaid work experience leads to consistent employment or earnings."
Prompted by such concerns, the city last year set up a program called Business Link, which is intended to connect workfare participants with large businesses that have openings for full-time employees. The businesses get a tax credit for hiring welfare recipients.
Mr. Schwartz said about 4,200 people had left workfare for real jobs through the Business Link program and through hiring by city contractors, but he said he could not disclose the names of most of the companies because not all wanted to be identified as hiring welfare recipients.
Beverly Butler, a spokeswoman for Gap Inc., said the clothing store company had hired about 300 people from the workfare program in various jobs in its stores in Greenwich Village in the last year. She said the company liked the program and planned to expand its use of it citywide later this year.
But while the company provides training, health benefits and better pay than welfare checks, only 30 or 40 of the people involved have stayed on as full-time employees. The rest have quit, she said, a rate of turnover similar to the Gap's regular hiring.
Borg-Warner has hired about 600 people from workfare to work as security guards and in other positions in the company's Wells Fargo security division, said a spokeswoman, Lynn Gloveka. More than 25 percent are still in permanent positions after a training period, she said.
But Mr. Schwartz said focusing on permanent employment missed the point of the workfare program. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Works Progress Administration, Mr. Schwartz said, the purpose was simply to get unemployed people working again.
"The W.P.A. was never judged by the standard of how many people found permanent work," he said. "The standard was getting people back into the work force immediately, and that's exactly what New York City is doing today. These people are working again and that will give them the best type of preparation."

HEADLINE: Arthur S. Flemming, 91, Dies; Served in Eisenhower Cabinet

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Arthur S. Flemming, who was Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare from 1958 to 1961 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower and held other high posts in government and education, died on Saturday in the Washington House, a retirement home in Alexandria, Va., where he spent his last few years. He was 91 and had been a longtime resident of Alexandria.
The cause was acute renal failure, his son Thomas said. . 
 Mr. Flemming, a Republican, devoted his career largely to the theory and practice of government service and to the Methodist Church and to education. He was the United States Commissioner on Aging from 1973 to 1978 and chairman of the bipartisan, six-member United States Commission on Civil Rights from 1974 to 1981.
Over the years, he worked for Democrats as well as Republicans. President Clinton, who awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994, said yesterday: "Arthur Flemming was a close friend to me and the First Lady. He transcended party, generation and race in search of consensus on some of the great issues of our day."
Mr. Flemming was not always so warmly viewed from the White House. In 1981, he was dismissed from the civil rights post by President Ronald Reagan and replaced with a conservative Republican, Clarence M. Pendleton Jr. On the day he was dismissed, Mr. Flemming warned publicly that the Reagan Administration was drifting back to a philosophy of "separate but equal" in school desegregation cases. A spokesman for the commission, Charles Rivera, linked Mr. Flemming's dismissal to his strong advocacy of civil rights.
A stooped man whose voice sometimes trembled with emotion when he spoke of civil rights issues in those days, Mr. Flemming was a familiar figure on the Washington scene even before President Eisenhower appointed him to his Cabinet.
When he joined the Cabinet, he was an educator -- having just stepped down as president of Ohio Wesleyan University -- with much interest and experience in manpower and labor-management problems. When he resigned from the Cabinet at the end of the Eisenhower Administration, Mr. Eisenhower said that "dramatic progress" had been made while Mr. Flemming was Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in improving the health, education level and economic security of the country.
In leaving office, Mr. Flemming warned that the United States would have to make "a far greater investment in the field of education than the nation has been willing to recognize" to meet its basic educational needs in coming years. He left behind a detailed accounting of those requirements in the form of three studies, prepared by the Office of Education, that had been undertaken at his direction more than a year earlier.
Mr. Flemming was president of Ohio Wesleyan University from 1948 to 1953 and again in 1957 and 1958, president of the University of Oregon from 1961 to 1968 and president of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., from 1968 to 1971. His church work led him to become president of the National Council of Churches from 1966 to 1969.
Mr. Flemming started out in Washington as an instructor in government and a debating coach at American University from 1927 to 1930, and he was on the editorial staff of what is now the U.S. News and World Report magazine for some years in the 1930's. In 1939, a Democratic President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, appointed him as a Republican member on the Civil Service Commission, where he remained until 1948. In the mid-1950's, before joining the Cabinet, he was director of the Office of Defense Mobilization.
Arthur Sherwood Flemming was born and reared in Kingston, N.Y., and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in 1927 from Ohio Wesleyan University, a master's degree in 1928 from American University and a law degree in 1933 from George Washington University.
In addition to his son Thomas, of Alexandria, he is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Bernice Moler; two other sons, Harry, of Alexandria, and Arthur H., of South Pasadena, Calif.; a daughter, Elizabeth Speece of Delaware, Ohio; a sister, Elizabeth Sherbondy of Pittsburgh; 12 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Susan Parker, died in 1993.

HEADLINE: In Westchester, Welfare Meets Managed Care

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: YONKERS, Sept. 4

 BODY:
When Isabel Briceno showed up with her feverish 1-year-old, Selena, and a Medicaid card at the emergency room of St. Joseph's Medical Center, she got two surprises.
Staff members told her she had come to the wrong place for a minor ailment like Selena's ear infection. Then she learned that Medicaid would not have paid for the visit anyway. Tiny Selena, it turned out, had been placed by Westchester County in a health maintenance organization, and so was a trailblazer in the latest growth area for managed care: welfare clients. She could have skipped the emergency room and simply seen a family pediatrician. 
 In the era of managed care, life has changed for Ms. Briceno's daughter and the rest of Westchester County's 32,000 recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, who are now required to join H.M.O.'s. And soon it will be the same for 2.5 million of the 3.6 million Medicaid recipients throughout New York State.
Interviews with doctors, health administrators and families in Westchester's program -- the first in the state -- indicate that welfare recipients, accustomed to dreary waits in crowded emergency rooms and clinics, have warmed to the managed care concept of a steady family doctor. There are signs that managed care has begun to improve the quality and consistency of their care. And officials project that it will save Westchester more than $8 million a year.
Although many Americans spurn managed care because it limits their choice of doctors and specialists, Medicaid recipients, by and large, seem to like H.M.O.'s because they never had much choice to begin with, and had no one to monitor their care over time.
"For Medicaid patients, it's 500 percent better," said Dr. Elio J. Ippolito, a veteran family doctor in Tarrytown. "They get good regular care from a good group of doctors."
For these patients, managed care has pried open the doors of many family doctors, pediatricians and specialists who once refused to take them because Medicaid reimbursements are so low -- as little as $7 a visit. Janet Foley, a 25-year-old welfare recipient from Eastchester, said her enrollment in the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York gives her access to a better pediatrician for her 2-year-old, Karen, than the medical office she had visited as a Medicaid client.
"It was a storefront type of place and they rushed everyone through," she said. "The doctor didn't even take off her diaper to check whether she had diaper rash."
If patients are pleased, so too are welfare officials, for whom a primary appeal of managed care is cost. Dr. Barbara A. DeBuono, the state's Health Commissioner, and Mary Glass, the county's Commissioner for Social Services, say that managed care has saved up to 12 percent of the money Westchester spends on medical care for the poor, in part by reducing emergency room visits. Ms. Glass said the county would spend $58 million this year on managed care for welfare recipients, while a pure Medicaid program would have cost $66.5 million.
Encouraged by such savings, New York State, eager to shave $1 billion to $2 billion a year from an annual Medicaid budget of $22 billion, will require all its counties and New York City to start enrolling their welfare recipients early next year.
But Westchester's program may not be a prototype for the rest of the state, particularly New York City, cautions Dr. James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, which studies health issues. The county has a rich supply of doctors, a comparatively well-regarded bureaucracy and a manageable welfare caseload. Some New York neighborhoods have virtually no private doctors, leaving the poor little choice but emergency rooms for basic care. And the scale of the city's caseload threatens to make enrolling patients in managed care a bureaucratic nightmare.
To test such criticism, the state, which is waiting for a Federal waiver before beginning the mandatory managed care program statewide, is closely watching a demonstration project that has enrolled welfare clients in southwestern Brooklyn.
If the experience of other states is any guide, speedily shifting tens of thousands of the poor and uninsured off Medicaid and into privately run health care plans can be an open door to trouble. Tennessee, a pioneer in shifting poor residents into managed care, grappled with marketing abuses that potentially could have cost it millions and denied coverage to legitimate applicants.
And critics of managed care say it limits patient choice and constrains doctors, who must clear many of their treatment decisions with the company. Under managed care, each recipient chooses or is assigned a primary doctor who not only provides basic treatment but also controls the number of costly visits to specialists and hospitals.
Welfare clients in Westchester, the experts say, seem to be receiving more preventive care because the H.M.O.'s, eager to meet state standards, have kept track of such fundamentals as immunizations, prenatal visits and pap smears.
"With Medicaid you're on your own," said Mark Santiago, director of marketing for Health Source, one of the county's managed care providers.
Anecdotal evidence also suggests there has been a small decline in the numbers of welfare families seeking care for routine ailments in emergency rooms, where a single visit costs Medicaid $125. Those recipients who do show up for relatively minor problems are told they will not be treated unless they receive authorization from the primary doctor in their H.M.O.
"We get a few every day where authorization is not given because the H.M.O. does not feel it's an emergency case," said Michael Spicer, executive vice president of St. Joseph's.
From the doctors' point of view, managed care for welfare clients has also been a windfall, bringing new patients. Dr. James Sayegh of Yonkers, who spurned low Medicaid fees but says he can live with his H.M.O. fees, has had to hire an associate and a nurse to accommodate hundreds of new H.M.O. patients.
But there is some dissatisfaction. Four of six managed care plans that Westchester uses do not pay a doctor for each visit, but instead pay a small monthly fee whether or not the doctor sees the patient. While the fee is ultimately higher than what Medicaid pays, some doctors say it encourages a kind of assembly-line processing of patients. There is no time to schmooze.
"Patients understand that I can't give them all a lot of time because I'm not reimbursed to give them a lot of time," Dr. Ippolito said. "The shy patient may lose out. If they want to complain about the weather or Aunt Millie, I can't listen to them."
The fees doctors receive from managed care plans run less than $10 per month for an adult patient. Dr. Ippolito told of visiting a diabetic patient in the hospital each day for a month, and receiving in return a total of $10 from managed care. If the patient had not been in managed care, Dr. Ippolito said, he would have charged $50 for each visit and received something closer to $1,500.
Managed care proponents stress that doctors receive their monthly fee for each patient no matter how few times they see that patient. And Toni Chagnon, president of Genesis Health Plan, which has 6,400 of Westchester's welfare clients, points out that her plan, which is solely for Medicaid-eligible patients, pays doctors monthly fees that are comparable to those paid by H.M.O.'s dealing with private paying patients.
Moreover, the two H.M.O.'s that pay doctors for every visit rather than a monthly fee also pay rates competitive with commercial insurance plans. The Oxford health plan pays a doctor $54 for an initial visit; Independent Health Plan pays $51.
Westchester County pays an H.M.O. $328 and up per month for each infant under 6 months, a minimum of $70 for people 20 and under, and $191 for adults between the ages of 21 and 64. Those fees cover routine checkups, specialist visits, and hospitalizations as well as eyeglasses, hearing aids, prescription drugs, lab tests, X-rays and transportation to doctor's offices.
Linda Samuels, a deputy commissioner for social services in Westchester, said that some critics complain that the program "is more generous than the average person gets in their health plan."
"But that is the way Medicaid has been for many years in New York State," she said.
Despite the gains made by managed care, most private doctors continue to spurn welfare clients. Dr. Tallon, of the United Hospital Fund, said there was a suspicion that economic and racial discrimination might play a role. "Some doctors don't want poor people in the waiting room," he said.
Independent Health, one of the health plans used by Westchester's welfare families, acknowledges that it has made acceptance of Medicaid clients voluntary for its participating physicians.
"No one is a winner if you force physicians to see welfare recipients when they don't want to," said Barbara Pike, Independent's assistant director of marketing.
While doctors may get paid more than they did with Medicaid, the heart of the county's cost-saving strategy has been to use managed care organizations to reduce emergency room visits. The H.M.O.'s have negotiated steep discounts with hospitals for nonessential emergency room visits and they telephone patients who make such visits to remind them to call their primary doctor first.
Dr. Karen Costley, medical director of Ossining Open Door, a clinic that is part of the Health Source network, said the county's plan still did not provide a sufficient deterrent for patients to forgo the emergency room.
"The E.R.'s feeling is that medically, legally, a patient is presented to our door, we have to care for them," she said. "And then there's the managed care plan which says we're not going to pay to see a patient that we paid primary care physicians to manage. So it becomes a battle between the managed care plan and the E.R., and the patient usually gets what they want."
Still, patients accustomed to showing up in an emergency room and waiting have had to adapt to a system built on appointments, and that has not always worked out so well. Dr. Costley says Open Door's "no-show rate" is 20 percent.
"Our patient population has other life priorities that just doesn't allow them to keep their appointments," Dr. Costley said. "There's a lot going on sometimes and we don't always get calls canceling."
For many welfare recipients the changeover to managed care has been no more upsetting than switching membership cards. A welfare client like Milagros Lebron, 52, of Yonkers, chose her plan, Health Source, because Dr. Sayegh, the doctor she has seen for her high blood pressure, is part of that network and so is her neighborhood pharmacy. Ms. Briceno, a Peruvian immigrant, chose Community Choice Health Plan so she could stay with her doctor, Syed Shariff.
"He's a very good doctor," Ms. Briceno said. "When I take the baby, he checks her real good, like the urine, and he gives her a lead test."

HEADLINE: Campaign Trail;
THE PRESIDENTAL RACE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

 BODY:

If It's Tuesday . . .
Many a campaign-addled pol, on the fifth speech of an eight-speech day, has mounted the dais to express delight at being in Cincinnati when he was actually in Columbus. Only a master orator can convince the audience that he meant to say it.
Ladies and gentlemen, the platinum-tongued President of the United States:
"I want us to have an education system in which, by the year 2000, in Covington, Ky., and every --" Bill Clinton said midway through his boilerplate stump speech on Aug. 31. Then as his audience, the good citizens of Covington, Tenn., began to register dismay, he halted. 
 But only briefly.
"Now wait a minute," the President continued, barely skipping a beat. "In Covington, Ky., in Covington, Tenn., Covington, Mass., in every single Covington in America, every single one, every child will have access not only to computers . . ." And on he went.
There are 10 cities and counties in the United States named Covington, including one each in Tennessee and Kentucky (but, alas, not in Massachusetts). Luckily for Mr. Clinton, he was not speaking in Memphis.
 
Dole Rescued by Blowout
When a military helicopter assigned to the White House overturned and burst into flames in Orlando, Fla., on Friday, no one made any wry references to a crash-and-burn Clinton campaign. But then, Mr. Clinton has a yawning lead in the polls, and funereal analogies hardly seem apropos.
Not so the campaign of Bob Dole. And when Democratic operatives got a look at his political schedule last week, they could hardly wait to seize on its symbolism. Mr. Dole, they gleefully pointed out to reporters, planned to hold a town meeting at a New Jersey company that makes life rafts, inflatable vests and other emergency survival gear.
The distance from that tidbit to news stories about a "sinking" Dole campaign whose advisers were "jumping ship" was short indeed, the Democrats reasoned. And in fact, one New Jersey newspaper suggested before the event that Mr. Dole was going to the factory at a time when he was "in deep water."
But the press never got a chance. On Friday, the day of the planned visit, the remnants of Hurricane Fran skirted into New Jersey. The event was called off.

Ripe for Comment
When not preparing remarks for "Washington Week in Review" or writing thoughtful analyses, political journalists while away long hours in the air between campaign stops with stimulating parlor games.
They squat on plastic meal trays during takeoff, using the force of jet engines to surf down the plane's main aisle. Or they play Seat-O, in which a stash of dollar bills goes to the lucky flier whose seat number matches the serial number of a bill drawn at random. Or they sing over the intercom system.
Most of all, they roll oranges up and down the aisle. Sometimes they scrawl comments on the fruit and roll it into the first-class cabin, where the candidate is expected to roll back a response.
The Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, Jack Kemp, received so many missives that he banned orange-rolling last week, saying he had run out of citrus replies. Reporters responded a few flights later by rolling a watermelon into his cabin, calling it "an orange with dynamic scoring." The term, embraced by Reagan-style conservatives like Mr. Kemp, loosely embodies the argument that tax cuts generate still more tax revenue by stimulating economic growth.
Mr. Kemp returned the melon with an inscription. "We're all supply-siders now," he wrote.

Wild About Harry?
And the resounding leader in four new Presidential opinion polls is . . . Harry Browne!
Who?
The Libertarian Party says Mr. Browne, its Presidential candidate, trounced President Clinton, Bob Dole and Ross Perot in four August polls -- not of registered voters, but of Internet surfers.
Mr. Browne collected at least a third of the vote in each survey, including 40.2 percent in a poll conducted on the popular "Politics Now" Web site managed by several leading newspapers, a news magazine, a network and the analytic weekly magazine National Journal. Mr. Clinton was second in two polls; Mr. Dole in the other two.
There is a caveat: the polls were not scientifically conducted. Rather, they measured the sentiments of Web-cruisers who visited the sites and chose to register their sentiments with a mouse click or two, or perhaps three. Still, the surveys may reflect the decidedly free spirit among many Internet users, who have campaigned hard against Government controls on cyberspace.
No word on how Mr. Browne's running mate, a software company owner named Jo Jorgensen, fares against Al Gore and Jack Kemp.

Sound Bite
"My wife, Elizabeth, has traveled to the scenes of many natural disasters these past five years. That doesn't include my campaign, of course." -- Bob Dole, speaking to the National Guard Association on Sept. 1. MICHAEL WINES

Helping the Black Jews

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Maybe, as readers of I Kings 10:13 surmised, King Solomon had an affair with the Queen of Sheba before her return to Arabia. Or perhaps, after the destruction of the Temple in 586 B.C.E., a tribe of Israelites fled to Africa.
Whatever the origin of Ethiopian Jewry, thousands of Africans who believed in Judaism -- relying on the Bible, without benefit of Talmud, and stricter than the most orthodox on certain rituals of purity -- kept their faith for more than two millennia. 
 Threatened by war, persecution and starvation, 50,000 trekked across deserts or were ransomed by Israel and airlifted with U.S. help to the place these gentle people maintained was the Promised Land. The State of Israel extended full citizenship under the Law of Return.
What a heartwarming story. Five years after Operation Solomon, how has it worked out?
Not as well as it should have. Although most live in far better conditions than the misery they fled from, they are poorer than other recent immigrants. Half are unemployed.
Mistakes made in America by social engineers were made anew in Israel. Misguided government policy encouraged segregation, and ahead loomed urban ghettos, welfare dependency and a black underclass.
Dissatisfaction flared last year after health officials, fearing the high incidence of H.I.V. infection in Africa, were revealed to have been disposing of blood from Ethiopian Jewish donors. A demonstration in front of Prime Minister Peres's residence made headlines and elicited apologies, but the far greater offense to Ethiopian Israelis was ignored.
Over half the blacks in Israel are under 18, which should offer a tremendous opportunity to teach and uplift a new generation -- but the kids are not getting the equal-opportunity education they deserve.
That upsets Micha Odenheimer, a California-born rabbi who heads the Israel Association for Ethiopian Jews at 34 Ben Yehuda Street in Jerusalem. "We still have time to turn this all around," he insists, "if we go all out to educate the children."
He's pressing for Head Start programs, tutoring, and free books and software to give blacks a fair chance at academic, not only vocational, achievement. No more shunting black kids to the worst schools in the poorest neighborhoods. His goal is to raise the percentage of Ethiopians matriculating beyond high school from 8 percent to at least the national average of 38 percent, which the rabbi says is doable in the next few years.
When applied early, such affirmative action works. And a nation with universal military service has an edge in integrating, instilling pride and advancing members of a minority racial group; E.J. officers in the Israeli Defense Forces will be a leadership cadre later.
An unexpected ally in this campaign to prevent an underclass is the new Prime Minister, who likes to refer to Ethiopian Israelis as "this precious part of the Jewish people." Mr. Netanyahu sees that part not as any Jewish white man's burden but an opportunity for his nation to light a candle in the race-relations darkness.
The diplomatic advantage of a multiracial society is obvious (Israel's new consul in Chicago is a young woman born in Ethiopia). But the equal-opportunity potential for Israel -- small enough to be a laboratory, steeped in the tradition of education -- would be to serve as a model for race relations in the coming century.
The world could use an example of racial diversity within religious and national unity. Science could do with a rebuttal to hypotheses of genetic inferiority. Blacks and Jews in the U.S. need every bridge they can build; success of Ethiopian Israelis (don't call them "felashas") would blunt the wedge threatened by the Qaddafi-Farrakhan connection.
That's why, in the week that Jews believe they are inscribed in the Book of Life, I hope that Rabbi Odenheimer's inexpensive cause is enlivened. Though primary responsibility lies with the new Israeli Government, Mr. Netanyahu should set up a channel for outsiders to participate.
This will not get the media attention of a handshake with Yasir Arafat or a standoff with Syria. But years from now, Israel's obeisance to equality for its African-born children could sparkle, in Shakespeare's simile, "like a jewel in an Ethiope's ear."

Perot Urges Redesign of Tax System

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

 BODY:
Ross Perot took on taxes last night, exhorting a national television audience to "get rid of the I.R.S. and create a new tax system that works."
"As your President, we will get rid of the I.R.S. and the tax code, and replace them with a fair, paperless, modern system," the Reform Party presidential candidate vowed in a half hour "infomercial" on NBC. 
 To warm up his audience, expected to be in the millions, Mr. Perot charged that Republicans and Democrats refuse to reform the tax system because they are beholden to "special interest groups who buy tax breaks with their campaign contributions."
"The professional politicians in Washington buy our votes with our tax money; this is called pork," Mr. Perot said. "Then, they pass legislation which plunges us deeper in debt, while at the same time promising us tax cuts to get our votes."
Saying that "democracies always collapse over loose fiscal policies," Mr. Perot quoted an 18th-century Scottish historian, Alexander Tytler, as warning that "a democracy can only exist until voters discover that they can vote themselves money from the public treasury."
Since 1913, when the Internal Revenue Service was created, Federal tax regulations have increased from 400 pages to 80,000 pages, he said.
"It is estimated that the time spent preparing tax returns each year costs us $300 billion," he continued. "In 1960, we operated the entire Government of the United States for only $100 billion."
Backed by multicolored graphs and charts, Mr. Perot continued: "Americans spend more than five billion man-hours each year preparing income tax forms. That is more hours than we spend each year manufacturing cars in the U.S.A."
To redesign the American tax system, Mr. Perot said he would bring together a panel of leading tax experts to evaluate and to run computer models on several proposed tax systems, including the flat income tax idea proposed earlier this year by Steve Forbes during the Republican primaries. At the completion of the study, Mr. Perot said, proposed changes would be put before the American people "in plain language."
Mr. Perot, a self-made businessman, said an overhaul of the tax system would have to go hand in hand with a balanced budget amendment.
For his panel of tax experts, Mr. Perot proposed several people associated with the Concord Coalition, a non-profit group dedicated to balancing the Federal budget.
Hewing to a conservative fiscal line throughout his paid address, Mr. Perot attacked the 15 percent income tax cut proposed by Bob Dole, the Republican candidate. Saying it did not "make any business sense," he asked, "Shouldn't we first cut spending, and then cut taxes?"

HEADLINE: Governor Raises Possibility Of Fed Interest Rate Increase

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The drop in the unemployment rate to 5.1 percent in August raises the risks of unacceptable wage inflation, Laurence H. Meyer, one of the newest members of the Federal Reserve Board, warned this evening.
"That makes a difference," Mr. Meyer said, referring to the decline of three-tenths of a percentage point reported on Friday that carried the jobless rate to a seven-year low. 
 In a speech to the National Association of Business Economists here, Mr. Meyer, one of the Fed's seven governors, did not overtly indicate that he was now concerned enough about inflation to vote for a tighter monetary policy when the Fed's policy-making committee meets on Sept. 24. But various members of the audience sensed that the central bankers were leaning toward raising short-term interest rates.
"The governors are pretty concerned at this point," said David W. Berson of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the association's president.
In his first public statement since taking office in June, Mr. Meyer referred to Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, when he told the association's members "there is no question that the latest data reinforced the sense that chairman Greenspan expressed a couple of months ago that we are in a circumstance in which a prudent central bank must exercise heightened surveillance of the inflationary risks and stand ready to respond if necessary."
Those remarks were inserted in a speech that had been written before the employment report was released on Friday. The figure also showed strong job growth and a surge in hourly earnings.
Mr. Meyer said in answer to questions from reporters after his speech that inflation was not yet accelerating, but he added that the Fed must not "sit around" and wait for it to happen before taking action.
Rather, he said, the central bank's role is to prevent revived inflation.
In his remarks, Mr. Meyer said, "growth itself does not cause inflation."
Mr. Meyer, a professional economist who ran his own St. Louis consulting firm for 14 years, said, though, that the economy showed other signs of a desired cooling from an unsustainable 4.8 percent rate of expansion in the second quarter.
"If you look at the demand-side indicators, they look pretty weak," he said.
Summing up the current challenge to monetary policy, Mr. Meyer said that the Fed must be vigilant in sustaining progress made against inflation, now about 3 percent, a figure that he believes is overestimated by about 1 percentage point.
As a result, he said, he is paying close attention to forecasts of short-term growth as an indicator of inflationary pressures and on labor costs as a key factor in transmitting those pressures to prices.

HEADLINE: PRO-HUSSEIN KURDS TAKE ANOTHER CITY IN NORTHERN IRAQ

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: SULAIMANIYA, Iraq, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Thousands of Kurdish civilians and hundreds of armed guerrillas fled Koi Sanjaq in northern Iraq today as the Kurdish faction that has been backed by President Saddam Hussein's forces mounted an eastward offensive and overran the city.
Officials of a rival faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which had controlled the city, said tonight that their forces had abandoned Koi Sanjaq in the face of an overwhelming attack by the forces of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which together with Iraqi troops captured the regional capital of Erbil eight days ago. 
 In Sulaimaniya, the Patriotic Union's last major stronghold, there was a mood of despair tonight. Officials of the losing faction accused their rivals of having once again employed Iraqi armor and artillery, and they and residents expressed fear that their rivals would now turn their sights on Sulaimaniya.
Kurdistan Democratic Party officials and the Iraqi Government denied that Iraqi forces had taken part in the assault today.
[In Washington, Pentagon officials played down the significance of the attack today in the north and said that the United States was unlikely to be drawn into any fighting between the rival Kurdish factions. At the same time, the United States warned Baghdad that it risked new attacks if it tried to repair air defenses in southern Iraq that American missiles struck last week. Page A10.]
Foreign aid workers who visited Koi Sanjaq before it fell also said they had seen no evidence of Iraqi involvement.
Reporters who tried to reach the battle zone from the east were prevented from doing so by the Kurdistan Democratic Party forces, and those who reached the area by a circuitous route were warned by the fleeing Patriotic Union fighters against trying to reach Koi Sanjaq.
But it was evident at least that the Kurdistan Democratic Party, led by Massoud Barzani, was capitalizing on its crushing victory a week ago to press its advantage against what are now clearly the fearful forces led by Jalal Talabani.
And on the defeated side there remained a conviction that their rivals' advance would consolidate a return of President Hussein's control over the region, where the United States and its Western allies created a safe haven for the Kurds in 1991 after the Persian Gulf war.
"Today he has Koi Sanjaq," one fleeing guerrilla, Mohammed Ghareib, said. "Tomorrow or the day after, he'll take Sulaimaniya. And then maybe we'll have to run all the way to Iran."
The two Kurdish factions, longtime political rivals, agreed to share power when the United States and its allies created the safe haven. But as international attention waned they began to fight over dwindling resources, and a bitter feud erupted over lucrative black-market trade.
As the Kurdistan Democratic Party forces advanced this afternoon, the residents and then defenders of Koi Sanjaq, a city of 50,000, took flight by car and cattle truck and on foot, climbing by road across a steep mountain range and seeking refuge here and in towns to the north.
At a crossroads called Bestana at the foot of the high ground, sweat-stained guerrillas still clutching their Kalashnikov rifles said they had no choice but to retreat as Mr. Barzani's forces mounted their attack, first overrunning Degala, 30 miles southeast of Erbil, then continuing toward Koi Sanjaq.
Sulaimaniya, the last large city in the hands of Mr. Talabani's group, lies some 75 miles southeast of Koi Sanjaq and outside the protected zone patroled by the United States and its allies. There are few natural barriers between the cities.
Officials of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan noted with apprehension tonight that when Iraqi forces entered Sulaimaniya in 1991 to suppress a Kurdish uprising, their initial advance followed the same route as today's offensive.
That Iraqi advance sent hundreds of thousands of Kurds fleeing into the mountains of Turkey and Iran, prompting the United States and its allies to undertake a relief operation and to compel Iraq to withdraw its units.
Even today, foreigners who work for several private aid organizations left Sulaimaniya out of concern over the Barzani faction's advance, and United Nations agencies based here decided to suspend their operations for at least two days.
The failure of the United Nations and the international community to respond forcefully to the fighting has angered many people here, some of whom staged demonstrations outside the local United Nations headquarters. As they traveled in the region today, some United Nations guards found themselves the targets of verbal abuse, an international relief worker said.
"They are very apprehensive because of the Iraqis," the relief worker said about the local population. "They think that if they come here, it is the end of the world."
Tonight, hundreds and perhaps thousands of people in Sulaimaniya had begun to flee as rumors swept the city that Mr. Barzani's forces, along with Iraqis, were on the way. With the main escape route to the north at risk of being cut off by a further advance, some may again see Iran as an attractive refuge.
Patriotic Union officials said the offensive today began at 4 A.M. They said that after capturing Degala, little more than a crossroads, by late morning, the Kurdistan Democratic Party forces -- which they said were supported by Iraqi tanks and artillery -- captured Koi Sanjaq, 25 miles away, by early evening. The Patriotic Union officials said the attackers had then continued to the top of the mountain range that separates that city from the long valley in which Sulaimaniya lies.
As the forces advanced, the Kurdistan Democratic Party's radio station told residents of Koi Sanjaq that they had no cause for alarm and urged them to stay in their homes. But nearly all of the town's residents apparently chose to flee rather than risk being caught in the fighting.
Not only Patriotic Union officials but also every fleeing guerrilla who was interviewed insisted that Iraqi forces had taken part in the attack. Some of the guerrillas said they had seen Iraqi T-72 tanks, which the Kurdistan Democratic Party forces do not have, and they said they had come under fire with multiple-rocket-launcher artillery, which is also not in the Kurdistan Democrats' arsenal.
The Patriotic Union also declared last week that a smaller offensive by the Kurdistan Democratic Party east of Erbil had included Iraqi forces, an assertion that the United Nations and the United States said they have no evidence to support.
But a Patriotic Union official tonight suggested that the rival group's forces might have gone to new lengths to conceal the Iraqi presence. He said his organization had information that the Kurdistan Democrats had ordered 30,000 outfits of Kurdish clothing that he said would be given to Iraqi troops.

HEADLINE: Believe It: People Get Signals on the Economy;
Perils of Inflation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Labor Market Tightens but Pay Gains Stay Slim" (Business Day, Sept. 5), on the dangers of lower unemployment and higher wages, advances two very debatable conservative ideas without much challenge. 
 First, you refer to states' "natural rate of joblessness, defined as the lowest level that allows for wage stability."
But of course there is no "natural" rate of joblessness.
In 1994 and 1995, conservative economists treated the public to a steady diet of long admonitory talks about the nonaccelerating rate of unemployment, and assured us that inflation would spiral out of control if unemployment dipped below 6 percent.
It has been below that figure for more than a year now without any sign of inflation. Judgments about the best rate of unemployment are, within fairly wide boundaries, political ones.
Second, you imply that higher wages are a danger to the economy. Elsewhere in your reporting, you have noted that most Americans have seen their real wages decline steadily for more than 20 years.
Why doesn't that count on the balance sheet?
Isn't it possible that higher wages, which are admittedly not in the short-term interest of employers, are in fact in the best interest of most Americans and in the long-term interest of the economy as a whole?
Such questions need to be widely addressed.

Part Artist, Part Hacker And Full-Time Programmer

SERIES: @WORK -- A Foot Soldier in the Programming Wars

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.

 BODY:
From the outside, the so-called browser war appears to be an epic corporate struggle: Netscape vs. Microsoft in a classic David-and-Goliath fight, with each side vying to control computing in the Internet era.
But the foot soldiers in this high-tech battle also know it as a campaign that takes a relentless toll, measured in long hours and lost sleep. Just ask Brendan Eich, a 35-year-old computer programmer at the Netscape Communications Corporation. 
 In mid-August, Mr. Eich was well into a workday that began at 9 A.M. and did not end until well past 2 A.M. the following morning. It was a few days before Aug. 19, when the company released the latest version of its browser software for finding one's way around the Internet, Navigator 3.0. He pointed to a futon nearby, noting that naps are a survival tactic in his sleep-deprived profession.
For Mr. Eich and other Netscape programmers, the home stretch of product development means that their routine 60- or 70-hour workweeks escalate toward 100 hours or more, as they scramble to fix bugs -- misbehaving lines of software code.
"I try not to count the hours," Mr. Eich said. "It's too depressing."
Things have slowed a bit for him since August, but not much. As soon as one product is out the door, work on the next one begins. "The next release is always around the corner," Mr. Eich said. "Here, speed is paramount."
Mr. Eich (pronounced IKE) labors on the grueling, lucrative frontier not only of the modern economy but also of the programmer's craft -- a blend of scientific precision and creative inspiration.
There are some 550,000 computer programmers in America, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, about the same number as bus drivers, real estate agents or house painters.
And like the practitioners of these other trades, the nation's programmers are a diverse lot. They range from hourly workers doing the mundane upkeep on old programs to entrepreneurial code hackers like Mr. Eich writing new Internet software that they hope will transform the computer industry -- and make them rich.
The ranks of computer programmers swelled by 25 percent in the last dozen years. And the Labor Department projects that their numbers will increase further, to more than 600,000 by 2005. Job growth is expected to be far greater in new fields like Internet software, as employment in traditional fields like mainframe programming eases.
Yet the kind of programming that creates new products and new companies is mainly a result of creativity and not head counts. Writing code, to be sure, is painstaking labor because computers are so literal-minded. A single number, letter or angle bracket out of order, or a space omitted, can make a program rebel.
Still, programming is as much an art as a science.
The artists of the profession have the ability to create the conceptual game plan for new products, think up helpful features and devise code-writing shortcuts so that programs are smaller and run faster.
The creative side of programming tends to be solitary work, as is writing a novel or composing a song. In fact, adding more people to a software project will typically delay the product even further. In the industry, this truism is known as Brooks's law, after Frederick P. Brooks Jr., a former I.B.M. software developer whose classic book on the process, "The Mythical Man-Month," was published in 1974.
In recent years, new software languages and programming tools have made it easier for code writers to express their ideas. "But the real important work will always be the creative thought," said Mr. Brooks, a computer science professor at the University of North Carolina.
 
The Competition
Web Browsing Is at Stake
While software development has long been a matter of programmers racing against deadlines, the rush for riches on the Internet has squeezed new-product cycles to six months or less. Many of the programs are being distributed over the Internet as soon as they are finished, with work on the next version starting right away.
Nowhere is the Internet way of life, both the pressure and the thrill, more in evidence than at Netscape's corporate campus in Mountain View. The leader in software for browsing the Internet's vast World Wide Web, Netscape, founded in 1994, is now in a furious battle with the Microsoft Corporation. Netscape's Navigator program holds nearly 85 percent of the browser market, but Microsoft is doing all it can to help its Explorer close the gap.
The significance of the rivalry extends beyond the browser software, however. Today, Microsoft's Windows operating system determines the look and feel of the computers used by most people. But as more computing shifts to the Internet -- for retrieving news, playing games, sharing work, even perhaps handling word processing and spreadsheet calculations in the future -- the balance of power could shift.
Indeed, Netscape hopes to capitalize on its early lead in the browser business to establish a preferred technology "platform" for the Internet. The Netscape and Microsoft browsers are built with rival sets of software tools, or platforms, which are used by Web developers to try to make their sites sufficiently entertaining or informative to lure people to spend time and money on line. Netscape workers cringe at any suggestion that Navigator is a mere browser. The company mantra: "We're building a platform here."
So is Microsoft, of course. The giant of personal computer software is not only a marketing juggernaut, it is also catching up fast in technology, especially with its 3.0 version of Explorer, introduced last month.
"For Netscape to succeed, it has to continue to be seen as the innovator," said David Smith, an analyst at the Gartner Group, a research firm. "If Netscape loses that edge, it's lost the war."
For that edge, Netscape is betting on programmers like Mr. Eich. Soft-spoken and square-jawed, he is a product of Silicon Valley, raised in Palo Alto. He did his undergraduate work at Santa Clara University. After earning a master's degree in computer science at the University of Illinois in 1985, he returned to work first for Silicon Graphics Inc. and later for Microunity Systems Engineering Inc., an ambitious chip design and software start-up, but one that has had trouble turning research into products.
Mr. Eich was recruited to Netscape in April 1995, when the company had just 120 employees, compared with 1,300 today. With 11 years of industry experience, he is an old hand. "It's all been spent hacking software," he noted.
At Netscape, Mr. Eich has created a programming language called Javascript. It is, in essence, a tool intended to help Web site designers and graphic artists put features like animated icons or automated data- gathering into their Web sites without having to master complex programming. In the programmer's jargon, an innovative idea or clever shortcut is called a "neat hack," and Javascript itself is a neat hack.
 
The Language
Weapon of Choice Against Microsoft
Javascript can be thought of as training wheels for Java, the Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems Inc. Java is the new technology that has helped make static Web pages more animated and interactive, by fetching programs from powerful computers that run Web sites and bringing back information like sports scores and stock quotes to a user's personal computer.
With Javascript, Web builders can more easily put some basic interactive features into their sites, like validating credit card information on line. The scripting language can also be used to filter data and thus cut down on the number of electronic trips back and forth over the Internet to gather information, performing on-line chores quickly and reducing the waiting time that annoys users.
"The purpose of Javascript is to give potentially millions of people who are not programmers the ability to modify and embellish Web pages," Mr. Eich explained. "Java itself is still a pretty hard-core programming language."
Mr. Eich did the initial design work on Javascript in little more than a week in June 1995, as part of a project code-named Mocha -- for sweetened Java. The scripting language itself was originally called Livescript, but last December, with Sun Microsystem's blessing, it was changed to Javascript.
Features written in Javascript were first included in Netscape's browser last January, for Navigator 2.0. By now, trade publishers have brought out a few how-to guidebooks on Javascript, and the scripting language is starting to attract a loyal following among Web developers. "Things that could take hundreds of lines of programming code in Java can be done with a few lines in Javascript," said Bill Dortch, an independent developer in Priest River, Idaho.
For Netscape, Javascript is a weapon in its struggle against Microsoft, a reason Web developers might choose Netscape's technology over Microsoft's. Though not a stand-alone product, Javascript is an ingredient in Netscape products besides its browser, like server software and Web site tools. James L. Barksdale, the president of Netscape, describes Javascript as a "key tactical component of our strategic platform." To try to keep pace, Microsoft has developed its answer to Javascript, a scripting language called Jscript.
For Mr. Eich, the work may be exhausting, but the setting is certainly informal. A couple of dogs roam the aisles of work cubicles, which are separated by shoulder-high partitions. A few programmers have tossed a military camouflage net over their work areas, while another has shrouded her cubicle in black mesh. On one wall hangs a satirical shrine to William H. Gates, complete with a gilt-framed picture of Microsoft's chairman.
Mr. Eich works in a larger space, occupied by three other programmers and five computer work stations. The setting is cluttered but purposeful, a "university lab rat atmosphere," as Mr. Eich describes it. For sustenance, he occasionally dips into a bag of multicolored Sour Gummy Worms candy.
In the last sprint before software is released, the programmers rush to remove the most worrisome bugs. Netscape's internal bug-tracking Web page, called Bug Splat, lists five categories of bugs from "trivial" to "critical."
"The criticals may not even be fixed at this stage," Mr. Eich said, as his team raced toward the Aug. 19 introduction.
Troublesome bugs that cannot be fixed in time become candidates for "workarounds," minor tweaking tricks that Web developers can use to alleviate the problems. Mr. Eich is known as a fixture on the specialized electronic forums, or Internet newsgroups, that focus on Javascript, offering advice and workarounds.
Javascript is written mainly in C, a higher-level programming language that looks like a mixture of broken English with errant punctuation and symbols. Underlying this software nomenclature is the interpreting and compiling code that Mr. Eich has written, which translates Javascript down into the digital 1's and 0's that can be electronically processed by the microchips of a computer.
In this process of communicating in a language understood by the machine, Mr. Eich explained, lies both the frustration and the joy of programming. "The pain of coding is saying things much more accurately than in a natural human language, removing the ambiguity of human speech or writing," he said.
"But it is a discipline," he added, "that once you've mastered it, enables you to be very efficient in making the computer do what you want it to do. You can make the computer do tricks. That's very satisfying."
Still, the software often plays tricks of its own on the programmers. To place his Javascript code into the latest version of Navigator, Mr. Eich had to write several thousand lines of programming. Some of the work was to add new features suggested by customers, or modifications, but much of it was debugging.
Frequently, though, the bugs resulted from his Javascript code reacting unpredictably when imbedded in the hypertext markup language of Navigator. The different kinds of software can behave almost as if they were living organisms when put together, sometimes coexisting peacefully, sometimes not. "Software is weird," Mr. Eich observed. "You have to rewrite code a lot. It's part of the process."
 
The Payoff
For Some, a Path To the Good Life
For the gifted and fortunate, programming can be a path to riches. That is certainly the dream at Netscape, where the programmers hope they are in the right place at the right time -- hopes encouraged by Netscape's spectacular initial public offering in August 1995. It was the second I.P.O. for Mr. Eich, who was at Silicon Graphics when it went public in 1986.
Even by the volatile standards of high-tech companies, the share-price movements of Netscape's stock have been striking. The stock closed at $37.125 last week, less than half its peak of $87 a share last December just before Microsoft announced its Internet strategy, but still more than double the public offering price of $14 a share, adjusting for a stock split. Yet Netscape will have to do well over the next few years for Mr. Eich and other employees to really cash in, given the waiting period of more than four years before all their stock options can be exercised.
But Mr. Eich, who is single, has done well already, financially -- comfortably a millionaire. He lives in a town house in nearby Sunnyvale, and is an investor in duplex apartments in Santa Clara and San Jose.
Still, he has misgivings about his grinding work regimen, and talks wistfully about perhaps quitting someday to spend more time on his outside interests, which include gymnastics and dance. (His office footwear last month was a pair of Capezio jazz-dance shoes.)
Programmers, like mathematicians, often have an affinity for music, another rule-based discipline with its own particular notation. And Mr. Eich has studied piano for 20 years, playing the works of Bach, Chopin and Stravinsky on the baby grand that one room of his Sunnyvale town house was designed to accommodate.
But like so many Silicon Valley programmers, Mr. Eich seems to dream mostly of running his own company someday. He figures he needs a nest egg of $5 million or $6 million to take that gamble, and he says he does not have that much set aside yet. At Netscape, programmers at Mr. Eich's level bring in salaries in the $100,000 range, so his entrepreneurial hopes depend heavily on Netscape's success and its stock price.
"At Silicon Graphics and now at Netscape, I contributed and I was part of the story," Mr. Eich explained. "But if I started my own company, it would be my story."

HEADLINE: Migrant Geese Face Cloudy Future

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
THE Canada goose, once a solely migratory bird whose majestic V-formations filled the autumn skies, in recent years has become an all-too-familiar year-round resident of Middle Atlantic suburbs and farms, including those of the New York region. There, as the goose population has doubled every five years of late, the big honkers have become pests in the eyes of many people.
There is, of course, another, older image of the handsome waterfowl with the jet-black head and neck, white chinstrap, fat, cream-colored body and broad brown back. "One of the great birds of the world," James A. Michener called the Canada goose in his novel "Chesapeake," which rhapsodized about the days when people's perceptions were shaped more by the migrating flocks' silhouettes against a full moon than by droppings left on lawns and in parks. 
 Today the two images -- romantic migrant and local nuisance -- coexist in reality. There are in truth two big populations of Canada geese in Eastern North America: the familiar year-round residents of the suburbs, comparative latecomers artificially introduced to the mid-Atlantic region since World War II, and the long-distance fliers, members of genetically distinct subspecies that do not breed with the year-round residents. About now, the migrants should be taking off from their breeding grounds in northern Canada on the same long journey to Chesapeake Bay and other mid-Atlantic localities that their ancestors have been making for centuries.
But while the resident goose population has boomed and prospered, the hardy migrants' future is clouded.
The migrants from Canada, perhaps 300,000 in all, are vastly outnumbered by the permanent residents, which total nearly a million. And while the resident population continues to expand, the number of breeding pairs among the the main group of migrants, in northern Quebec, dropped by more than three-quarters from 1987 to 1995; a scant 29,000 pairs raised goslings last year, compared with 130,000 eight years earlier.
Since the migrants are genetically separate from the resident geese, their shrinking numbers make them of special conservation concern: biological diversity is measured not only in species, but also in subspecies and in the variety of genes within a species that make it more fit for long-term survival.
"It's most important to retain these stocks of birds and to manage them individually," Jerry Serie, a biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, said of the migrants, not least because of their importance to the hunting economies of the Inuit and Cree natives in Quebec. Mr. Serie represents the Wildlife Service on the Atlantic Flyway Council, an American-Canadian waterfowl management group.
Biologists have attributed the decline of the migrants to hunting and unfavorable spring weather in the northern breeding grounds. The birds are shot for sport all along their migration route, and the Inuit and Cree kill them for food.
This year, for the second year in a row, hunting the geese has generally been prohibited during the winter in what is called the Atlantic flyway, from Quebec to North Carolina. The Inuit and Cree have curtailed their subsistence hunting as well. As a result, the breeding population rebounded to an estimated 46,000 pairs.
But the recovery, if one is under way, may be sputtering. Cold weather last spring led to a poor crop of goslings. Consequently, "we're going to be kind of hurting" when that poor crop reaches age three and begins to breed, said Mr. Serie.
From time immemorial, the object of this concern was prized by native hunters throughout the Northeast and Middle Atlantic region just as the Inuit and Cree prize it today. To one Michener character on Chesapeake Bay, an Indian called Pentaquod, the geese "seemed too big to be called birds; they were more like flying bear cubs loaded with edible meat."
The migrants are especially plump at this time of year in preparation for their taxing journey. One subspecies, Branta canadensis interior, fattens on the tundra vegetation of its breeding grounds on the Ungava Peninsula of Quebec just east of Hudson Bay. A less numerous subspecies, Branta canadensis canadensis, breeds farther east in Labrador and Newfoundland.
The breeding pairs, which mate for life and only rarely "divorce," have just regained their flight feathers after the molt that each year renders them unable to take wing. The goslings, having traded their coat of golden fluff for feathers, have made their inaugural flights.
The first waves should be taking off from the northern tundra about now and arriving in the Chesapeake region next week. Typically, the formations fly on a clear night, taking advantage of north winds that follow the west-to-east passage of a cold front, said Dr. Bruce Batt, the chief biologist for Ducks Unlimited, a waterfowl conservation group that participates in research on the geese. The formation is designed so that its members find it easy to relieve each other in the tiring role of wind-breaking formation leader. They do not make the entire trip at once, but instead stop often to rest, feed and gauge the weather. They are guided by land features and perhaps by the stars, biologists say.
Some of the migrants originally flew as far as Florida, Dr. Batt said. But as agriculture developed on the Delmarva Peninsula of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia in the last century, they began to zero in on the peninsula's rich cornfields. Ever since, the peninsula has been their major wintering ground.
After World War II, other populations of geese gradually began to establish themselves year-round in many places across the United States, often with the help of state agencies that introduced them as a restoration measure. As suburbs expanded, they provided ideal habitat: lots of grass to eat (geese are grazers) and no predators except for a few dogs. "Geese can handle anything up to the size of a fox or raccoon," said Dr. Batt, and even people must beware. "They can beat you up" with their wings, said Dr. Batt, who once was knocked out by a goose.
With little to fear from predators and hunting prohibited in most localities, the resident population gradually increased and then exploded. Actually, the residents do not stay in one place. They move around within the Atlantic region as weather conditions dictate. But they do not make the long-distance flight to the tundra, breeding locally instead.
While the migrants belong to two distinct subspecies, the residents represent a mixture of races, products of the many introductions from other parts of the continent, with the giant Canada goose, Branta canadensis maxima, predominant.
One difficulty in managing the geese is that hunters cannot readily tell the migrants and residents apart. The residents are now legally hunted in many localities as a means of population control. But how does one protect the migrant population while allowing residents to be shot? One option is to close the hunting season while the migrants are in the southern part of their range, during the winter, and open it at other times.
This is not considered a perfect solution, however, and researchers, including Dr. Batt, have embarked on a program aimed at sorting out the two groups more precisely. The program involves affixing tiny radio transmitters to geese in the Quebec breeding area and then tracking their movements by satellite. In this way, the researchers hope to determine where the geese stop during their migration and for how long. They might then be afforded extra protection from hunting in those areas.
Some computer models show that it might take 10 years for the breeding population to recover even in the absence of hunting, but Mr. Serie is more optimistic. The goal is to achieve a breeding population of 150,000 pairs. When half that number has been reached, hunting may be reinstated. This could come by the end of the decade, he said, but "at this point things are a little uncertain."

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK: Eric Steven Lander;
Love of Numbers Leads To Chromosome 17

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
IN the career of Dr. Eric Steven Lander, as in the new branch of biology known as genomics, the life of numbers and the numbers in life have come together.
Dr. Lander, director of the Whitehead Institute/M.I.T. Genome Center here, is a leader in constructing a complete catalogue of the human DNA code or genome. But he did not arrive at this position in the traditional way -- for example with a degree in biology. Only when past 30 did this curly haired and energetic figure first crack a book in biology. 
 Rather, he grew up in the thrall of numbers. As a high school mathematics whiz, he was on the United States high school team that came in a close second to the Soviet team in the world mathematics Olympiad in 1974. He later trained as a pure mathematician at Princeton University. Only then did he fall in love with biology, as he spent hours talking with his brother, Arthur, a neurologist.
Biology itself has also been undergoing change in recent years. The old style of academic biology is now admitting a brash new branch of inquiry, one that is information-heavy, computer-driven and closely allied to business. And for Dr. Lander, that has been perfect. When he emerged from his personal transformation, there he was, at the leading edge of molecular biology.
He established his credentials in biology by tackling subjects that could only be approached by someone with a strong background in mathematics, like how to analyze statistically whether a disease may be caused by one or many genes, and how to ferret out the different contributing genes.
In August, a team led by Dr. Lander found a gene that contributes to type 2 diabetes, a disease caused by many genes, each with many variants. Dr. Lander's strategy began with the calculation that elusive genes are easier to identify in isolated populations, where people are descended from only a few founders and have not accumulated the many genetic variations of more cosmopolitan groups. He searched for the diabetes gene among a group of people in the Bothnia region of western Finland where few outsiders have migrated in the last 1,000 years.
When biologists began to consider the task of making a complete catalogue of the entire three billion letters in the human body's DNA code, Dr. Lander's work made him a natural candidate to lead one of the several teams of DNA sequencers.
Craig Venter, head of the Institute for Genetics Research, a private concern in Rockville, Md., a competitor of Dr. Lander in the race to sequence genomes, said: "In sequencing whole genomes the breakthrough has been mathematics, applied math and new algorithms. These are the kind of things Eric is good at."
At the Whitehead Institute/M.I.T. Genome Center, Dr. Lander's group has produced the first genetic maps of the human and mouse genomes, a necessary step toward working out the complete DNA sequence. His laboratory is one of several that are financed by the National Center for Human Genome Research in Bethesda, Md. The consortium of laboratories had planned to complete the full DNA sequence of the human genome by the year 2005 at a cost of $3 billion, but is already two years ahead of schedule and below budget. The project has already identified many genes of medical interest and prompted investments by several companies.
Dr. Lander, 39, was born and raised in Brooklyn in a family of lawyers. As student at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, he was sent one summer to participate in an elite mathematics program, where the students decided that 17 was the most interesting of all numbers. They formed a 17 club and made up a T-shirt emblazoned with amazing facts about the number 17. Dr. Lander can still quote examples: "Many multisided figures are stable when set down any one of their sides, for example, a pyramid. But did you know that a 17-sided figure is the only one that is stable on one side only?"
Recently, the number 17 has sneaked back into his life. The Whitehead genome center has chosen human chromosome No. 17 as the one it will sequence as its contribution to the Human Genome Project.
"Someone suggested I had picked chromosome 17 because of my fascination with that number," Dr. Lander said. "That's not really true, but I am thinking of taking the old T-shirt out of the closet. I still have it."
As Dr. Lander followed his instincts, his career took some sharp turns, from pure mathematics at Princeton and Oxford, to managerial economics at the Harvard Business School. Then, while teaching mathematically oriented business classes by day, at night he crossed the Charles River to hang out in biology laboratories.
He had begun to see that beneath the surface of the two very different disciplines of mathematics and biology there lay some links of possible importance. Biology, however chaotic it might appear, had regions that he felt would yield to the firepower of mathematical methods. His first few papers exploring mathematical approaches to biology were sufficiently remarkable that he won a MacArthur Fellowship, the so-called "genius" award. "That grant was crucial for me," he said. "I was struggling to establish myself at the interface of math and molecular biology. Why should anyone take me seriously? The MacArthur gave me that essential credibility."
The $250,000 grant helped finance travel to the far-flung and isolated human populations where he knew gene-hunting would be easier.
Dr. Lander soon started to make an impact in molecular biology, creating the mathematical tools to tease out a major gene in asthma, and a "modifier" gene that can suppress colon cancer. But eventually he tired of hunting down genes in the genetic jungle, one by one. "That time is over," he said. He is now laying plans for the next era in biology, in which he foresees that the entire set of human genes and their functions will be available on one CD-ROM disk, so there will be no more Stanley-and-Livingston searching.
"Now, suddenly, biology is finite," he said.
"The genome project is wholly analogous to the creation of the periodic table in chemistry," Dr. Lander said. Just as Mendeleev's arrangement of the chemical elements in the periodic table made coherent a previously unrelated mass of data, so Dr. Lander believes that the tens of thousands of genes in present-day organisms will all turn out to be made from combinations of a much smaller number of simpler genetic modules or elements, the primordial genes, so to speak. He theorizes that these modules helped carry on life in the most primitive cells living on the planet three billion years ago. The basic functions of life carried out by the first genes must all have been formed very early in evolution. Dr. Lander surmises. Most present-day genes are variations on these few original themes, he said.
"The point is that the 100,000 human genes shouldn't be thought of as 100,000 completely different genes," Dr. Lander said. "They should be thought of as maybe a couple hundred families that carry on essentially all of life."
Making such a periodic table for families of genes will define a new direction for biology, in Dr. Lander's view. The completed table would mark the end of structural genomics, the analysis of the structure of genes. "When you get the last base of the genome, driven in like the golden spike in the transcontinental railroad, we'll maybe have a big ceremony," he said. "But when it's done, it's done."
Then comes what Dr. Lander calls functional genomics, or making practical use of the table. For example, Dr. Lander says, biologists may learn to read human DNA so effectively that laboratories will quickly be able to tell patients all the important variations they have in their entire gene set, or genome. Further, it should be possible to tell which of those genes are turned off or on at a given moment, thus getting a picture of whether the cells of the body are up to snuff.
"So here's the manifesto for the era of functional genomics," Dr. Lander said.
"One. At the DNA level we want the ability to re-sequence an entire genome -- anybody's genome -- in a regular medical setting, to find all the variations. Because you and I differ in one-tenth of 1 percent of our bases, and that accounts for our differences.
"Most genes will have two, three or four major variants. If you have 100,000 genes, that means there will only be about 300,000 major variants. It's a finite number. We can then take that list, and then correlate all the different variations with health outcomes. You could take the Framingham Heart Study and find the rate of each disease associated with each of the 300,000 variants of genes."
That would allow each person to get a full list of what diseases they are most at risk for, based on their inheritance.
With a mix of hope and skepticism, he said: "In principle, that would allow us to have personalized health care and personal health care strategies. In practice, of course, whether we do that will depend on what we as a society want to pay for, and how much we can protect our privacy, and so on."
"Two," he said, holding up fingers to signal the next item on his manifesto. "We want to be able to monitor gene expression." Finding out which of an individual's genes are active at any time would help indicate a body's response to drugs, dieting, exercise and other factors.
"All this is not so crazy as it sounds," Dr. Lander said. "Less crazy, in fact, than the genome project itself. There are already genetic 'chips' that can make these things possible."
He was referring to one of his favorite new technologies, which has put human genes on microchips. Genes in a blood sample can be matched against the standard ones on the chip to see if there are any important abnormalities.
So far, one company making "gene chips," Affymetrix Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., has succeeded in putting all the genes of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, on a chip for such comparison. The company has plans to put 30 to 40 human genes on one chip, and "in principle at least," said Robert Lipschutz of Affymetrix, "we should be able to put all human genes on a chip."
Dr. Lander has a piece of that company, as well as a major financial interest in Millennium, a company that intends to make use of the data from the genome project to design diagnostics and treatments for disease.
If there is a danger sighted ahead in the "new biology," some critics suggest, it is that businesses may be too close to science, and may even sometimes be in the driver's seat. Scientific judgments may too often yield under pressure from business needs.
Dr. Lander, an avid businessman, takes these problems more seriously than most people in science, said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the Federal genome project. Dr. Collins credits Dr. Lander with leading the way to help solve at least one of the problems -- that of hoarding data to gain business advantages.
The Whitehead genome center, at Dr. Lander's direction, puts out on the Internet all the data it produces on DNA markers and sequences, which are freely available to anyone who wants to copy the material.
At first the M.I.T. laboratory's data were posted every few months. Now they are posted monthly, and soon they will be disseminated almost daily, Dr. Lander said. "This work is paid for with public money and it's got to be made public as fast as we can," he said. "That means breaking with tradition and getting it out there long before it can be published in scientific journals."
The effect, he says, is highly stimulating for biologists. "We get 50,000 to 100,000 hits on our database per week. People need this data."
The Federal genome project office has begun to follow his lead, and those receiving grants must now make their data available at least every six months.
The task over the next few years for those leading molecular biology will be to get biologists away from their traditional tools -- pipettes, gels and flasks -- and into analyzing gene function with computers.
"In the next one to three years, we have to figure out how to get humans out of the loop," he said. "Then we can really get to work thinking about biology and what's going on in life."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against the Mark To a Nearly Two-Month High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose to a nearly two-month high against the German mark yesterday, deriving strength from a selloff in the mark on diminished fears of obstacles to Europe's plan for monetary union.
Further gains in the American stock and bond markets yesterday, on top of Friday's rallies, also helped support the dollar, as did remarks by Germany's top banker emphasizing widespread support for a strong United States currency. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar traded at 1.4995 marks, up from 1.4920 marks on Friday and the highest level since July 15. The dollar also rose widely against most other European currencies but ended marginally lower against the yen at 109.26, down from 109.32, partly because the Japanese currency also rose against the mark.
The British pound traded at $1.5570, down from $1.5605.
Some traders said the catalyst for the dollar's advance came from Finance Minister Jean Arthuis of France, who reiterated that France would reduce its budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product, as required by a plan to create a single currency in Europe in 1999.
Mr. Arthuis's remarks, in an interview on Cable News Network, helped counter rising skepticism that European nations critical to the success of the plan would not qualify under its stringent financial criteria. The mark had gained from such fears because of its status as a stable, haven currency in Europe.
Ralph Delzenero, vice president of foreign exchange marketing at the First National Bank of Chicago, said that as the dollar started rising in response, it surpassed important technical levels against the German currency that incited more mark selling and dollar buying.
The dollar was also helped by a second day of gains in the United States stock and bond markets, which rallied Friday after shrugging off fear of higher inflation from a strong report on employment.
Some traders said the dollar got an extra lift from remarks by Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central bank, and chairman of the Group of 10 central bank governors, who said they agreed that "a further development of the dollar is very important and that a strong dollar is in the interest of all." Mr. Tietmeyer spoke at a meeting of the group in Basel, Switzerland.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Europeans Agonize Over the Mall

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: TROYES, France

 BODY:
J. Byrne Murphy vividly remembers how eager many French cities seemed when he arrived here, in April 1993, to build the kind of suburban shopping centers that helped revolutionize retailing in America.
Yet within a month, the French Government effectively blocked new out-of-town shopping centers by subjecting the construction of retail space of more than 11,000 square feet -- about the size of a small Gap store -- to central Government approval. "Honey, we have a little problem," he recalls telling his wife. 
 Without knowing it, Mr. Murphy, who previously developed factory-outlet stores in the United States, had stepped ashore in Europe just as a powerful coalition was coming together to stem the spread of shopping malls -- a coalition that included small-store owners facing extinction, politicians fearful for the future of town centers, and environmentalists disgusted with the way automobiles chewed up the landscape.
Similar resistance meets many a Wal-Mart in the United States, as small cities and towns worry about losing the last remnants of business-district vitality. But in Europe, the survival of historic towns is, if anything, more crucial. The quaint shops that surround the Duomo in Florence, after all, are important to the city's tourist appeal, as well as the great Renaissance artwork.
Even in this chilly business climate, Mr. Murphy got his mall built. His company -- BAA McArthur Glen, a joint venture of BAA P.L.C., the British airport operator, and McArthur Glen Europe, an offshoot of the Horizon Group, one of the United States' biggest factory-outlet developers -- opened the $20 million center here in October. Business is so brisk at the low-slung, brick-faced complex of 42 stores -- featuring brands like Lee jeans, Reebok shoes, and Ralph Lauren and Lacoste fashions -- that plans are in the works for 17 more stores.
And therein lies a difficult choice for Europeans. While central governments struggle to brake suburban development, builders and retailers are convincing local planners that American-style shopping centers, and the restaurants, advertising and transportation that go with them, can offset a decline in manufacturing jobs.
With customers demanding lower prices and convenient access to stores, suburban shopping now accounts for a large share of retail business in Europe, especially in France. Workers are rushing to fill the new jobs. In Troyes, an old textile center 55 miles southeast of Paris with a population of 125,000, jobs in the fabric industry had dropped by half -- to 12,000 in 10 years. The McArthur Glen outlet mall created 225 jobs, with numerous applicants for each opening.
But the mall's opponents are digging in their heels -- perhaps to save what history is left, perhaps to score political points, perhaps as a symbolic gesture. In the process, they are helping to define the terms of a heated debate over how to spur growth without sacrificing the quality of centuries-old, town-centered life.
In July, President Jacques Chirac's officials in Paris bowed to anti-development pressure and further stiffened the 1993 law by subjecting the construction of food stores as small as 3,000 square feet to Government approval.
The debate is hardly limited to France. This is the state of the argument in some other European countries:
*In Britain, the Environment Secretary, John Gummer, had already responded to complaints about the collapse of inner cities by imposing similar restrictions.
*In Spain, the Catalonia region followed France's example.
*In Italy, where the erosion of independent stores is accelerating, the association of small retailers called for a three-year moratorium on suburban store building; the Government has yet to act.
*In Germany, which has a practice of limiting suburban shopping, the only notable out-of-town development in recent years has been in former East Germany, where confusion over just who owns downtown stores forced the authorities to allow retail development on the outskirts.
Just south of Troyes, French developers opened an outlet center called Marques Avenue in 1993, after the city fathers had ignored Paris's objections and given their blessing. With the opening of the McArthur Glen center, Troyes now attracts more than two million visitors a year, including French shoppers who drive the hour and a half from Paris, but also German, Dutch and Belgian vacationers who make a pit stop for the odd Ralph Lauren shirt.
In a former steel mill in the German city of Oberhausen, British developers are putting the finishing touches to a $1.3 billion mega-mall, with 230 stores and a 30-restaurant food annex anchored by Planet Hollywood. As in Troyes, the city fathers, hoping to replace some of the nearly half-million mining and steel jobs that the Ruhr region had lost since 1960, overrode the objections of independent retailers and central Government planners.
Where retailers and developers cannot overcome official objections, they are increasingly turning to acquisitions.
In August, a Houston developer, Hines Interests, acquired seven shopping centers in Italy, France and Spain in a $296 million deal, including two sites approved but still to be completed in Marseilles and Barcelona. Earlier, the French supermarket group Auchan announced the takeover of a rival, Docks de France, in a deal worth $3.78 billion.
Generally, industry experts say, as Europeans become increasingly mobile, they find that their francs and marks go further at big, efficient shopping centers than in expensive downtown stores.
Arlette Labrette, who helps manage Pusinic, a kind of five-and-dime along Rue Emile Zola, the principal shopping street of Troyes, has seen sales in the store, which opened in 1933, drop by half in 15 years. Yet when her relatives visit, she concedes, they never fail to go to the outlets.
Despite the restrictions, France has led Europe's retail revolution, as big chains like Carrefour introduced hypermarkets -- Wal-Mart-like stores that stock food and other goods at discount prices. Now, large retailers control more than 90 percent of retail trade in France, compared with 75 percent in Germany and 55 percent in Italy.
And that pattern of change is gathering strength elsewhere. In Italy, according to forecasts by the Nielsen group, the number of small independent stores will drop to 640,000 by 1998, from more than 700,000 today. In Germany, developers are watching the Oberhausen experiment to gauge its impact on surrounding towns. Robert Weitz, an economist at the Central Association of Retail Trade in Cologne, which opposed the project, predicts "no loosening, if anything a tightening," of German rules.
Nowhere has government action been as drastic as in France. According to the July laws, the building of new stores must be approved by four of six members of special panels of local politicians and representatives of chambers of commerce and crafts -- commonly hotbeds of resistance to large-scale trade.
Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the minister for small business, says the law is intended to meet a threat to France's small manufacturers and independent retailers, as well as to the health of city centers. The death of independent retailers is destroying jobs at a rate that the new shopping centers cannot offset, he said in an interview.
But Jerome Bedier, president of the federation of commercial enterprises, accuses the Government of caving in to political pressure from right-wing parties, which often enjoy the support of many independent store owners. The federation, formed last year to battle the Government's restrictions, argues that rather than saving jobs and protecting town centers, the laws will cripple the development of retailing, with ripple effects for French manufacturers who need outlets for new products.
The effect, Mr. Bedier said, will be lower consumption and economic growth -- and job destruction, not creation. Moreover, as French retailers like Carrefour burst their borders and become multinationals, they require a strong domestic base that, he said, would be eroded by the new laws' provisions. "It's a Maginot Line mentality," he asserted.
Such arguments in part echo , those Mr. Murphy says he used to convince the city fathers of Troyes.
By building a factory outlet, rather than a conventional mall, Mr. Murphy argued, the merchants of Troyes would not be directly hurt, since the factory outlets offer only seconds or outdated fashions, and in limited selection. Moreover, except for a small McDonald's, he agreed that the center would have no dining facilities, and would provide free bus service to the town center and its restaurants.
In January 1994, by a vote of 7 to 0, the local planning council approved the project.
Serge-Francois Martinez is director general of the Troyes chamber of commerce, which is so deeply divided that store owners opposed to the new outlets stormed his offices when the Marques Avenue project was approved. But Mr. Martinez speaks for the members who believe, as he puts it, that the outlets offer "a second chance for Troyes."
Noting that only about 25 percent of the outlet shoppers are locals, he argues that the shop owners' plight has other causes like low French consumption and a lack of parking near city centers. "But the retailers need a scapegoat," he said, "and yesterday it was the shopping centers -- today it is the factory outlets."
With textile-industry jobs melting away, he continued, unemployment in the center of Troyes is 13 percent, slightly above the national average, and the two million visitors a year drawn by the outlets can only buoy the region's economy. As for the downtown retailers, he predicts that they will evolve from the current mix of small food and other stores to the American suburbs' model -- a concentration of luxury shops and sellers of other goods and accessories marked more by chains and franchise outlets than by small shopkeepers.
The evolution will be painful, he conceded. Many store owners will suffer not only the decline of their businesses, but also the devaluation of their property -- often the main sustenance for retirement.
As for the restrictions imposed in July, "the politicians had to do it," he said, "but it doesn't change much. It's already too late."
"You can try to slow the pace of development, but you cannot stop it" he said. "The consumer will decide in the end."

HEADLINE: Martha Phillips, 98, a Force In Luxury Fashion Retailing

BYLINE: By ENID NEMY 

 BODY:
Martha Phillips, a notable force in luxury fashion retailing for more than 60 years and an early supporter of many of today's leading designers, died on Saturday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98.
Martha, as she was generally known (Miss Martha to her employees), was for many years a well-known front-row figure at major fashion shows in New York and Europe and a booster of, among others, Valentino, Halston, Geoffrey Beene, James Galanos, Pauline Trigere, Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta and Zandra Rhodes at the beginning of their careers. 
 Her customers at her elegant Park Avenue and Palm Beach salons were some of the world's richest and most socially prominent women, who often filled in checks that ended in three and four zeros.
There were four Martha shops in the 1980's, when sales were said to be almost $40 million. A boutique in the Trump Tower closed after several years, and a bankruptcy filing in 1992, attributed to the economy, resulted in the shuttering of the Park Avenue salon and another in Bal Harbour, Fla. The Palm Beach shop, operated by Mrs. Phillips's daughter, Lynn Manulis, remains, and Mrs. Phillips went in almost daily until shortly before her death.
"There was never anybody like her and there won't be anyone like her," Ms. Trigere said yesterday. The designer, who did business with Mrs. Phillips for almost a half-century, added, "She developed a special knowledge of who her customer was -- from the very first client, she knew what she was doing."
Mr. Beene described Mrs. Phillips as "an icon to an audience of a more frivolous era of dressing -- steeped in vanity and femininity."
And Mr. de la Renta called it "the end of a whole era" and Mrs. Phillips "the last of the great ladies of retailing with a true grasp of the luxury business and a tremendous sense of quality."
A small, meticulously groomed woman with carefully coiffed hair who wore signature David Webb jewelry, Mrs. Phillips did not hesitate to pop into fitting rooms as her customers tried on clothes. More often than not, she did not ask what they wanted but told them what they should have. More often than not, they listened. Although the salon had a workroom for alterations, Mrs. Phillips also did not hesitate, on occasion, to get on her knees to pin a hem.
There was never a time when she was not fascinated by fashion, Mrs. Phillips said in a 1983 interview on the 50th anniversary of her business. Born Martha Rollins in Brooklyn, where her father had a shop called the Star that specialized in hand-tailored clothes and riding clothes, she asked to help in the business one day when she was 8. Her father got a crate, placed it behind the counter and she stood there after school, selling lace blouses.
"People were so amused, they would buy," she recalled.
At 18, she married Phillip R. Phillips, a manufacturer of ready-to-wear clothing and in the early 1930's she opened a shop on the 12th floor of a Madison Avenue building. Despite the Depression, she refused to buy anything for the shop that would sell for less than $100.
"I did very well," she said. Her customers included Marjorie Merriweather Post, who brought in her jewels to make certain that both the color and the neckline of the dress were appropriate for showing them off properly. Other clients were Doris Duke, Brooke Astor, Gloria Vanderbilt and Diana Ross.
Mrs. Phillips remained there for 20 years, leaving only when the building was torn down. She then leased space in what was the Savoy Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue. After that building was sold to the General Motors Corporation, she balked at a shop she was offered downstairs in the plaza of the new building to be built on the site, saying, "Martha's customers never shop in cellars."
Shortly after, she and her daughter, who joined her several years earlier, found a location at Park Avenue and 58th Street where in plush surroundings she coddled her customers with tea and cookies while models paraded the clothes or saleswomen carried them out.
Mr. Phillips died in 1981. Besides her daughter, who lives in Palm Beach, Mrs. Phillips is survived by a son, Herbert R. Phillips, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a brother, Milton Rollins of Brooklyn, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
In an interview when she was in her mid-80's, Mrs. Phillips, who was chairwoman of her company -- her daughter was president -- said she had no intention of ever retiring.
"I like to think that what we're doing is being impresarios, finding talent," she said. "I like the excitement."

HEADLINE: Consumers Continued Pace Of Borrowing During July

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing, on the rise for three years, continued to grow in July as credit card use outpaced auto borrowing, Federal Reserve figures showed today.
The level of consumer credit outstanding rose by $7.7 billion in July, to $1.164 trillion, a greater rise than June's increase of a revised $6.7 billion. Previously, the Fed said credit rose by $8.3 billion in June. Wall Street analysts had expected a July increase of $7.4 billion. 
 The report suggests that the economy continues to expand, though analysts see signs, like rising loan delinquencies, that the pace of borrowing cannot continue to expand at the recent rapid rate. "People are still accumulating debt, but at a slower pace than a year ago," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
Over the last 12 months, big gains in the financial markets helped bolster the economy and consumer spending, Kathleen Camilli, an economist at the investment firm Tucker Anthony, said in a research report.
Now, however, "higher interest rates are slowing the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy," like housing sales and construction, Ms. Camilli said. Wall Street analysts monitor the Fed's consumer credit statistics in gauging consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity.
By category in July, installment loans, which include credit cards, increased by $7.2 billion, auto loans rose by $1.9 billion, and other types of loans decreased by $1.5 billion.
The Fed's monthly report also showed that the pace of consumer credit was rising at an 8 percent annual rate during July, up from the 7 percent pace of borrowing in June.
Strong labor markets and the lowest unemployment rate in more than seven years have contributed to the highest level of consumer confidence in the economy since the late 1980's.
Economists say, however, that after three years of steady increases in credit, consumer finances may be coming under stress, and that could help slow the economy. The economists cite rising delinquencies on bank credit cards as evidence many people may be overextended.
In addition, the Chrysler Financial Corporation, the main lending unit of the Chrysler Corporation, said recently that its credit losses doubled during the first six months of 1996, while delinquent car payments and repossessions also jumped. The main lending units of the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company have also experienced customer credit problems, although at more moderate levels, according to industry experts.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Rise; 30-Year Yield Slips to 7.07%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose for the second consecutive session yesterday, even as the market shifted its focus to reports on inflation and retail sales scheduled for release this week.
The 30-year bond rose 13/32 in price, to 96 2/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, dropped to 7.07 percent, from 7.10 percent on Friday. 
 Part of the price rise may well be that the market has priced in and is braced for an interest-rate rise of a quarter-percentage point at the Sept. 24 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's policy-setting arm. But some analysts doubt that the Fed needs to tighten credit immediately.
Referring to Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, Bruce Steinberg, manager of macroeconomics at Merrill Lynch & Company, said: "On balance, Mr. Greenspan will probably want to defend the Fed's credibility. After all, 25 basis points one way or the other won't make much difference to growth prospects, but by tightening, the Fed provides a powerful symbol of anti-inflation resolve." A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Still, Mr. Steinberg said, any Fed tightening is no sure thing. "I put the odds at 55 percent," he said. "And I believe that the next tightening move to be the only such action by the Fed for a long time to come."
Traders did note some speculators had already begun setting short positions in anticipation of an increase in corporate and global issuance this week that would compete directly with Treasury securities for investor dollars and might cause prices to dip.
Analysts are expecting some $2 billion in corporate debt to hit the market in the next few days, led by yesterday's $1.25 billion asset- backed deal by the American Express Company through Lehman Brothers. Sold in two parts, the issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation and backed by credit-card receivables.
The larger part of the sale was $950 million in asset-backed securities due in 2004 priced at par to yield the one-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, plus 15 basis points; the remaining $300 million of securities due in 2002 were also priced at par to yield the one-month Libor plus 12 basis points. The AT&T Corporation is expected to come to market today with a $930 million asset-backed sale through Merrill Lynch & Company.
At the Treasury's weekly bill auction yesterday, the three-month maturity was the surprise, exceeding expectations. The three- and six-month bills were awarded at an average rate of 5.17 percent and 5.30 percent, respectively. The bid-to-cover ratio, or the number of bids compared with the actual number of securities available, was a strong 6.21 to 1 for the three-month bill and 3.98 to 1 for the six-month.
Traders said that three-month bill's maturity near the end of the year made it more attractive and might have accounted for some demand. Also, the Treasury cut the auction to $22 billion, from $24 billion the previous two auctions, and $25 billion the two auctions before that.
Bill Gamba, head of government-bond trading at Cowen & Company, said, "The large bid-to-cover ratio could be indicative of a safe haven for investors until more of a definitive move is unveiled by the Fed."
Mr. Gamba noted that there had been some foreign buying overnight in the Treasury cash market, and said that the market's resiliency forced some speculators to cover short positions yesterday.
In addition, Mr. Gamba said the day was marked with some legitimate retail buying: "It tells me that customer accounts are more comfortable now and after Friday's employment data was released than they were prior to that."
Following are the results of yesterday's regular weekly Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Welfare as Japan Knows It: A Family Affair

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Genially welcoming a visitor into his "home," the piece of cardboard on which he sleeps in the Shinjuku train station here, Katsuo Kawagoe drew deeply on a cigarette and recalled the times he had applied for public assistance from the Government.
"They just said, 'What do you want?' " he remembered. "They were not helpful. The only way you can get aid is if you're over 65 or if you're really sick and taken to the hospital." 
 "When I turn 65, I'll apply for welfare," Mr. Kawagoe, who is 53, added between racking, tubercular coughs. "But until then I've got no chance if I'm healthy."
Japan has a welfare system that in some ways makes even the new, dismantled American system seem a model of generosity. Applicants in Japan are obliged to get help first from their families, and a poor person physically able to work is not eligible for help -- whether or not the person actually has a job.
From some perspectives, this system has worked brilliantly. The country's already strong family ties have been strengthened, and the main safety net is the family rather than the Government. The number of Japanese in the basic welfare program has declined sharply over the last half century, as people became better off and built up savings.
Today only 0.7 percent of the population receives benefits -- compared with the 4.8 percent of Americans who get grants from Aid to Families With Dependent Children or the 9.7 percent who receive food stamps. About 2.3 percent of Americans receive grants through the Supplemental Security Income program, which serves the elderly, blind and disabled.
To be sure, Japan's welfare system operates in a very different milieu from America's. Only 1 percent of Japanese births are to unwed mothers. That compares with a percentage that keeps climbing in the United States and has now reached 30 percent.
Japan also has a far lower percentage of drug addicts than the United States has, a much lower unemployment rate, a much more egalitarian distribution of wealth, a greater sense of family obligation and an abiding sense of shame that colors almost every aspect of life.
Scholars say that the system in Japan almost never breeds dependence, and they suggest that the Japanese approach has emphasized the work ethic and the importance of family ties.
Caseworkers rigorously check applicants and drop by their homes regularly to make sure that they do not have banned luxuries like cars or air conditioners, and fraud seems extremely rare.
For all these reasons, the welfare system seems to have broad public support in Japan. In fact, instead of grumbling about welfare mothers in Cadillacs, people sometimes carp about how the authorities are too harsh to the poor.
"This system is financed by the taxpayers, so it's natural that we should be rigorous," said Tokuyuki Kase, an official in the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. "Our standards are very strict."
Yet if the absence of a broad public safety net focuses people's minds on the need to stay on the tightrope, it is also clear that when some people inevitably do slip, there is often nothing to save them.
Last April, a 77-year-old woman and her disabled son starved to death in their Tokyo apartment. The local authorities apparently knew that the family was having trouble getting food, although it does not seem that they formally applied for welfare. After the bodies were found, the authorities discovered a diary kept by the woman, whose last entry read: "Every day is a struggle, and I want to die soon."
In another case, a 79-year-old widow was threatened with loss of welfare benefits unless she got rid of her air conditioner. She did, then collapsed in her apartment during the next heat wave and had to be taken to the hospital, where she spent six weeks recovering.
"This is a very cold society," said Yoshifumi Osaka, a homeless man who said he had forgotten his exact age but thought he was almost 80. Mr. Osaka ran away from his wife and children a year and a half ago, he said, "because they picked on me," and ever since has lived in a cardboard cocoon he built in Shinjuku station.
Like many homeless people, he says he has not applied for welfare benefits because he would never get them.
Japan does have two elements of a social welfare program that far surpass anything in the United States: universal medical care and comprehensive day care.
Everyone has access to doctors and hospitals at affordable prices, with the services free for the poor. And neighborhood nurseries throughout Japan provide excellent care for children from six months old to school age, if mothers work, for a modest fee that is waived for low-income families.
But while the United States offers a network of public assistance programs, Japan has no food stamps and relies principally on a single program of cash grants. Anybody who is poor is eligible, but only if the person has no family or assets and is unable to work.
"We go to financial institutions and check for savings accounts or other money," said Kanji Tanaka, a welfare caseworker in Kawasaki, a city just south of Tokyo, "and we look up the family registrations to check if there are relatives, and then we contact them."
Mr. Tanaka also visits the applicant's home to insure that it is not too lavish and that it does not have anything regarded as a luxury.
An applicant who owns a home is normally advised to sell it and use the proceeds until the money runs out -- and then to apply again. In May, a 96-year-old man was dropped from welfare because it came to light that he had $30,000 in savings. The caseworker told him to use that up and then reapply.
A welfare worker has a caseload of about 60 in Japan, and there is time for regular, unscheduled visits to recipients' homes. The caseworkers have great discretion in handling cases, as well as considerable moral authority in advising recipients what to do.
Because able-bodied people are normally excluded on the ground that they could find work if they wanted to, the largest group of recipients is the elderly -- many of them bedridden widows -- amounting to 44 percent of households getting aid.
Households with a sick or handicapped person account for another 41 percent. About 9 percent are single mothers, but in Japan most of them are divorced or widowed, rather than never married.
Akemi Watanabe, a caseworker in Kawasaki, said 2 of the 60 recipients in her caseload were single mothers, both abandoned by their husbands. Both work part-time while receiving a supplementary welfare check.
Most single mothers in Japan do not get benefits, because they have parents or other family members who can support them. Because of this, single mothers are likely to live with their parents, so that the child grows up under the supervision of several adults.
The mothers are extremely reluctant to accept welfare.
"The Japanese have a tendency to regard it as extremely shameful to receive welfare, and so they are hesitant," said Toshio Hata, a senior welfare official in Kawasaki.
Mr. Hata led the way to a local welfare office nearby, on the sixth floor of a Government building. He showed the way to a separate, hidden elevator going directly to the sixth floor, so that welfare applicants need not be embarrassed by getting off a crowded elevator at the welfare floor.
"This is something we have to do, to avoid humiliating people," Mr. Hata said. "All the welfare offices in Kawasaki have a separate elevator so that visitors are not embarrassed."
Scholars say that many people who are eligible for welfare do not apply, because of this sense of shame.
"I could have used it, but I have too much pride," said Shiro Kitajima, 48, a homeless man with serious back problems who was encouraged by officials to apply for an $800-a-month stipend. "I got free medication for five months, and that was enough."
In interviews with homeless people -- who only very rarely qualify for welfare -- it was striking how little sense of entitlement there was. Even those who said that they should be getting help quickly added that their neighbors did not deserve it.
"These people here who get up every few days and hunt in the garbage for food, they're just lazy," said a homeless male prostitute in his 30's, who would not give his name and did not think he should get assistance. "They shouldn't get help."
While dependency on welfare has not been a problem generally in Japan, one social group has more of a common profile with welfare recipients in the United States. This is a minority called the burakumin, who are ethnically indistinguishable from other Japanese but are descendants of those who had occupations considered "unclean," like skinning animals and burying the dead.
Burakumin are only a bit more than 2 percent of the Japanese population, but they have suffered discrimination for centuries and are disproportionately likely to abuse alcohol or drugs, to drop out of school, to have children out of wedlock and to qualify for welfare. About 5 percent of burakumin are on welfare, seven times the national average.
Burakumin community leaders say they worry not only about the impact of discrimination but also about these social problems, including excessive dependence on welfare. Still, these problems among the burakumin are diminishing rapidly as they start businesses and become more prosperous, and burakumin dependency on welfare is on the wane.

HEADLINE: Central Bankers' Group Adding to Ranks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: BASEL, Switzerland, Sept. 9

 BODY:
The Bank for International Settlements will admit nine new members, including China and Russia, as it expands beyond the industrial West to include central banks in the world's fastest-growing economies.
The bank, which serves the world's central banks, gave approval today for membership of monetary authorities in China, Russia, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. 
 The expansion "will permit them to participate more fully in the cooperative activities of the bank, and to have an influence on the common views," the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, said. Mr. Duisenberg, who is also head of the Dutch central bank, said the nine would acquire shares and become full members by next March in the bank.
The central banks from the newly industrializing economies will join the 32 current bank members. Mr. Duisenberg said the new members would not take part in the monthly meetings of the Group of 10 central banks, representing the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden. The central banker of the host country, Switzerland, also takes part.

HEADLINE: State Welfare Chiefs Ask For More U.S. Guidance

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
After seeking more authority over welfare policy for 15 years, state officials said today that they needed more Federal guidance on how to carry out the new welfare law.
Many of the officials said they expected to reap financial windfalls from the new law because the number of welfare recipients had dropped far below the levels of the last few years, which are used in computing the new Federal payments to states. Hardly any state officials mentioned the possibility of a recession, which would increase the demand for public assistance. 
 The state officials said they were frustrated by their inability to get authoritative interpretations of the new law from President Clinton's top domestic policy adviser, Carol H. Rasco, or from Mary Jo Bane, the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Children and Families.
State and Federal officials seemed to be feeling their way toward a new relationship as more than 500 state officials met in closed sessions to try to understand the intricacies of the law, which Congress passed at their behest.
The law, signed by Mr. Clinton on Aug. 22, gives state officials vast new authority to run their own welfare and work programs with Federal money. But states face severe financial penalties if they flout the law, which is complex and ambiguous on many points.
"It doesn't do us any good to get an opinion or an unofficial interpretation," said J. Maynard Chapman, the welfare reform manager in Colorado. "What we need is factual answers."
Clinton Administration officials were reluctant to give such answers, lest they be accused of undermining the law by trying to dictate decisions to the states.
After several hours of seminars with Federal officials today, Sue H. Sergi, Commissioner of the West Virginia Bureau for Children and Families, said the Federal experts "have still got a lot of questions" themselves.
Under the new law, each state will receive a lump sum of Federal money. Each state must have "objective criteria for the delivery of benefits" and for "fair and equitable treatment" of beneficiaries, the law says. Mr. Chapman said he wanted to know what was meant by "objective criteria" and "equitable treatment."
The new law imposes stringent work requirements on welfare recipients. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Budget Committee in the Missouri House of Representatives, said she wanted to know what activities would qualify as work.
The law generally requires welfare recipients to work within two years of getting cash assistance. But a woman with a child under the age of 6 is exempt from the work requirement if she cannot find "appropriate child care" within a reasonable distance of her home or her work site.
Arnold R. Tompkins, director of the Ohio Department of Human Services, asked: "What is appropriate child care? And is that decision made by parents, the Federal Government or the states?"
The new law imposes a five-year lifetime limit on welfare payments to any family. But a state may grant "hardship exceptions" to 20 percent of its adult welfare recipients.
Jerry W. Friedman, Assistant Secretary of Social and Health Services in Washington State, asked, "If somebody gets a hardship exception from another state like Idaho, does that person automatically qualify for the exception in Washington?"
J. Jean Rogers, the welfare director in Wisconsin, wanted to know how the time limit should be enforced when one welfare recipient married another welfare recipient who began receiving aid at a different time.
Perhaps the most frequent question was whether states would be allowed to continue operating experimental welfare programs for which they received Federal permission in the last three years. Typically, the Federal "waivers" cover only a few elements of a state program, but states want to continue operating the entire program.
Administration officials refused to give definitive answers, saying each state would have to decide for itself whether it is permitted to continue one or more waivers granted by the Federal Government. "You may wish to consult with the chief law officer of your state" in making this decision, the Administration said in a document given to state welfare officials.
Surveying the confusion among state officials, a Federal official commented: "States are like the dog that ran after the car and finally caught it. Now they're not sure what to do with it. It's amazing what happens when you wish for something and actually get it."
Another Federal official, Ms. Rasco, said: "We readily admit that we do not have all the answers. We are here for a two-way dialogue."
Larry Temple, deputy director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, spoke for many state officials when he said, "Our caseload is going through the floor." It has fallen to 46,000 families on welfare today, from an average of 60,000 in 1992-94. In the coming year, he said, Mississippi expects to receive $86 million of Federal welfare money under the new law, whereas it would have received $54 million under the old law.
Gerald H. Miller, director of the Michigan Department of Social Services, said the number of families on welfare in his state had declined by 24 percent, to 170,000 from 225,000 in 1993. In the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, he said, Michigan will receive $775 million under the new law, whereas it would have received $625 million under the old law.
Florida, Connecticut, Delaware, Missouri and Ohio reported similar declines in welfare cases, because of a strong economy and aggressive state efforts to put people to work. "The economy is the biggest factor," said Don Winstead, the welfare reform director in Florida.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Focuses On Georgia And Florida, Talking Taxes

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Sept. 9

 BODY:
With bolts of lightning jabbing the air around him, Bob Dole's effort at showcasing his personal side here today was short-circuited by an electrical storm. But before the charcoal skies opened up and drenched the 300 people who had gathered at a backyard fish fry to hear him, he asserted he was excited about the Presidential race.
"I know the press, 'Why are you so confident, you're behind in the polls?' " he mimicked. "What polls? The poll I take every day, I'm one to nothing ahead." 
 Mr. Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, campaigned today in Florida and Georgia, two Southern states that should be safely in his column two months before the November election. But state polls show him running only slightly ahead of President Clinton, and most national polls show him trailing Mr. Clinton by double digits.
Mr. Dole's task over the last few weeks has been to visit states like these and generate positive local media coverage. The format is dubbed "Listening to America," in which Mr. Dole is to reveal his personal side -- and plug his tax-cut proposal -- with a group of hand-picked supporters who ask friendly questions.
But there were several messages out of the campaign today. Aides put out a statement warning the Clinton Administration not to take undeserved credit for success in Iraq before such claims are warranted -- a statement muted by Mr. Dole's passing up the chance to make it publicly himself.
And he was vocal about a proposal he has yet to firm up, telling his audiences both here and in Georgia that he would soon be announcing an expansion of the G.I. bill.
In addition, William J. Bennett, the former drug policy director, was to travel with Mr. Dole to lend an air of authority to the candidate's proposed drug war and to help convey the moral high ground that the Dole campaign claims in the character war. But floods kept Mr. Bennett from reaching Mr. Dole's plane in Washington, and he arrived here only to be rained out.
As Mr. Dole left here tonight for Baton Rouge, La., he placed a call to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, in Washington for a meeting with President Clinton. Mr. Dole's press secretary, Nelson Warfield, said the call was just between "old friends touching base."
In Florida, Mr. Dole promoted his tax-cut plan as being aimed at "Main Street, not Wall Street." He spoke in the backyard of a house assessed at $425,000, according to The St. Petersburg Times, in the Snell Isle area.
Mr. Dole's campaign is looking ahead to the Presidential debates, which the two campaigns plan to discuss on Thursday. Mr. Dole told reporters he was pleased that the White House had signed up former Senator George Mitchell of Maine to play him in practice sessions with Mr. Clinton.
"We're pretty good friends," Mr. Dole said of the former majority leader. "Maybe he'll help me out."
The Dole campaign has asked Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, a jolly Southerner and former actor, to play the part of Mr. Clinton.
At a "listening" session in Fayetteville, Ga., about 30 miles from downtown Atlanta, Mr. Dole said, "I believe education must be the centerpiece, or the keystone, or call it what you will, of the new Dole-Kemp administration."
But the specifics of his plan for a new G.I. Bill were for another day. Standing on a dusty platform in front of a $129,000 house under construction, Mr. Dole's setting was to reinforce his theme that his tax-cut proposal would help "Main Street America" buy houses by keeping interest rates "low and stable."
Aides said the idea behind the "listening" sessions was to show Mr. Dole not in a blue suit and not in front of a podium -- his standard portrait for the last three decades as he represented Kansas in the Senate. But as he took questions from about a dozen of the 60 supporters, he seemed preoccupied with his Senate career, suggesting at one point that he left Capitol Hill in June because voters no longer trusted politicians.
Mr. Dole recalled his tenure as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in trying to create enterprise zones. He then veered to farming and noted that he had served on the Senate Agriculture Committee longer than anyone else, leading him to conclude, "So I understand a little about peanut programs and other things I know are very important."
Mr. Dole also painted a bleak economic outlook in his continuing effort to convince voters that, despite relatively positive economic indicators, they are not as well off as Mr. Clinton would have them believe.
"What we have now is stagnating wages, we have job insecurity, the slowest expansion since the last century," Mr. Dole said. "We've had over 270,000 layoffs in the first half of 1996 -- that's 20 percent higher than the same period a year ago and the biggest job loss of this decade."
Afterward, as he shook hands with people in the crowd of about 150 who were roped off to the side of the platform, a man asked him why interest rates were the lowest they had been in seven years. Mr. Dole did not respond.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE THIRD PARTY;
Perot Attacks Political Process as 'Destructive'

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Beleaguered by low standings in public opinion polls, Ross Perot blasted American politics today as "negative, bitter, mean-spirited and destructive."
"I ask the American people to refuse to be manipulated by dirty negative politics and propaganda in 1996," Mr. Perot, the Reform Party Presidential candidate, said in his bitterest attack yet on politics in the campaign. 
 On arriving here today from Texas, Mr. Perot was greeted with a local poll that matched his nationwide decline during the last two months. Conducted by EPIC/MRA, the poll indicated that Mr. Perot's support among Michigan voters had tumbled from 19 percent in July to 10 percent in August to 4 percent last week. In the latest New York Times/CBS News trial heat, which was conducted Aug. 10-18, Mr. Perot stood at 8 percent.
"It doesn't appear that Perot is catching on the way he was four years ago," said Karlyn Bowman, a resident fellow in public opinion at the American Enterprise Institute. "He may get a bounce when he announces his Vice President, but I doubt it."
Mr. Perot said today that he would announce his Vice-Presidential selection on Tuesday, in a 30-minute "infomercial" that will be broadcast on CBS at 8 P.M. Eastern time.
That candidate "has the background, the experience and the qualifications," Mr. Perot said after his speech here before the Economic Club of Detroit.
Returning repeatedly in the speech to lambaste the American political process, Mr. Perot used harsh language to contrast his sharply differing views of the world of business and of politics.
"Business is conducted on a rational basis and has generally accepted ethical standards," the self-made billionaire said before a generally supportive audience of about 1,000 business people. "Politics is not conducted on an ethical basis, and there are no rules of conduct or ethical standards. War has rules. Mud-wrestling has rules. Politics has no rules. If you question that, watch television."
"In business, you have to deal with reality," Mr. Perot said, his voice rising. "In politics, you don't deal with reality. You have a blend of magic acts and illusions. Now you see it, now you don't."
"In politics, people get selected and promoted on the basis of their acting ability and their appearance," said Mr. Perot, who has been repeatedly caricatured by cartoonists this summer as a jug-eared bantam running for President. "In business you select the best-qualified people to deliver results and you promote them based on performance."
While the major party politicians sing and dance at their conventions, Mr. Perot said, Americans face "the mother of all bankruptcies."
Rattling off statistics, Mr. Perot said the Federal Government has $1.7 trillion in unfunded pension liabilities and a mushrooming debt that was last clocked at around $5 trillion.
"If a fighter pilot saw these numbers on his instrument panel, he would eject -- we cannot eject," Mr. Perot said solemnly, re-using a laugh line that drew applause last week at an American Legion convention.
"Think about where the Mississippi River is, way over there on the east side of the United States," said the candidate, who spoke at a convention center on the shores of the Detroit River. "All the Federal income taxes collected west of the Mississippi River go just to pay interest on the debt.
"Neither of the two parties has the will to deal with these problems. Asking the Democrats and the Republicans to solve these problems is like going to a heart surgeon that just lost his last 32 patients and suggest that he do heart surgery on you."
Mr. Perot's message of fiscal responsibility struck a favorable note among many at the luncheon.
"This is the first political candidate that I've ever been excited about," said Suzanne Meyer, the owner of an engineering and architectural firm. "The main problem facing our nation is our deficit. We will go bankrupt at this rate."

HEADLINE: Netanyahu Needs Arafat as a Partner

BYLINE: By Stephen P. Cohen; Stephen P. Cohen is president of the Institute for Middle East Peace and Development.

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
The next time President Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet -- as they did yesterday in Washington -- Yasir Arafat should be present. The partnership for peace must be forged.
The handshake between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat last week on the Gaza border was admittedly more symbol than substance. But the meeting was a highly significant event in Israeli political life, in the history of Mr. Arafat's movement and in the peace process itself. 
 When the main Israeli opponent of the 1993 Oslo accords meets the treaty's main Palestinian beneficiary, a new legitimacy emerges not only for the two leaders but also for the treaty itself. The debate that defined Israeli politics for 20 years has concluded: There is a Palestinian interlocutor, and it is Yasir Arafat.
For Mr. Arafat, who flashed a grin of satisfaction when he shook Mr. Netanyahu's hand, the meeting asserted the permanence of the change of Israeli-Palestinian history he made with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. For Mr. Netanyahu, whose face showed grim discomfort, the encounter was a price of taking over the stewardship of the Rabin-Peres peace. He required the handshake to complete a transfer of power not to be fully achieved until he assumed the mantle -- and burden -- of this most fateful of Israel's relationships.
Criticized by all and for whom no one has an alternative, Mr. Arafat rallies from one apparent defeat to the next. Throughout, he holds to his "independence of decision," as he puts it, while changing tactics to keep the Palestinian movement alive under his leadership. He and the extremist Hamas have avoided crossing the fine line that separates vicious politics from civil war.
There is victory here as well for Mr. Netanyahu. American pressure, Egyptian warnings and Jordanian worries, even the dire assessments of his security establishment, cannot fully explain his decision to meet Mr. Arafat. Nor does the threat of another intifada, this one of despair, rather than of defiance. The decision flowed from the instincts of a Likud outsider who captured the party first, then the election.
He has now captured the flag of peacemaking for the Israeli right, whether it wants it or not. All the pressures made it easier to justify the handshake that helps solidify his own leadership. His ambition would not sustain a policy of inaction in which peace remained the property of his predecessors. He wants ownership of the process, and that means engaging Mr. Arafat.
But an interlocutor does not a partner make. Not yet. Not until the interlocutors can agree on more than an agenda and a procedure for meeting. Not until there are some first common steps and a strategic direction to the discussions. No doubt, Mr. Netanyahu will delay decisions and emphasize how different his way is from Rabin-Peres. Still, for Israel, and for the United States and the Arab world, there are no other options to progress in peace. Whenever peace seems moribund, the vacuum is filled by new instability.
The challenge now is to recognize that the deal required is not "land for peace" but "sovereignty for security." Can the Israeli right be persuaded to accept the emergence of a Palestinian nation led by Yasir Arafat, not only as interlocutor but as a partner in peacemaking?
It will surely be a kind of Zeno's paradox. Half of the half will go along, then half of that half, but never everyone. Some people most supportive of Mr. Netanyahu were hoping that he would destroy the Oslo pact with sweet words and sharp actions. They will feel betrayed, and the betrayed are the most implacable of opponents. The Prime Minister will require more than the skills of political maneuver. He will require the strength to change and to declare this change.
He starts his stewardship of the peace process with the conviction that he can find a form of Palestinian self-governance in the West Bank and Gaza so tempting that the Palestinians will forgo statehood and Jerusalem for it. Part of the temptation will be economic. Mr. Netanyahu has the opportunity to do much better than his predecessors here.
If he and Mr. Arafat can do without the closure of the West Bank and Gaza as a security and punitive measure, he will be way ahead in assuring peace under the accords. If he permits safe passage from Gaza to the West Bank, allows Palestinian seaport and airport development, the Palestinians will breathe more easily.
Still, that is not the essence. It is true that Israeli leaders are elected to serve the Israeli people, as Mr. Netanyahu says, paraphrasing Menachem Begin. But it is no less true that they also rule the Palestinian people. If Israel, for its own sake and its own interest, needs to relinquish that rule, its leaders will have to face up to the needs of that second nation. The partnership will have to be that Mr. Arafat rules the Palestinians.

HEADLINE: Out of the Rat Race and Into the Kitchen

BYLINE: By SUZANNE KAPNER 

 BODY:
AS a foreign equity trader at a Wall Street firm, Laurie Bloom often worked until 4 A.M. in the international markets. Today, as an apprentice at the Ryland Inn, an acclaimed restaurant in Whitehouse, N.J., she is learning how to cut onions.
After working as the director of engineering for the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, Joe Mullady attends cooking classes at night at the New York Restaurant School in Manhattan. His goal is to open a bed and breakfast with his son, Daniel, 21, who is also a student there. 
 Ms. Bloom and Mr. Mullady are among the growing number of people who are trading the corporate world for the kitchen. They seek creative fulfillment, satisfaction in their work, greater mobility and, if they start their own businesses, control over their lives. All would rather cook or work with food than do anything else.
Most make the switch at considerable financial and personal sacrifice. They either dip into savings, take out student loans or live off a spouse's income for the time it takes to earn a culinary degree and find a job.
And jobs are plentiful. In the next 10 years, restaurants and hotels will need an additional 500,000 chefs, cooks and other kitchen workers -- an increase of 16 percent over current needs, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"Each year we list 8,000 jobs," said Douglas Zander, the dean of enrollment and planning for the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. "We only have a student population of 2,000. That's four times as many jobs as students."
The first job often means long hours, grueling labor and low pay. Still, those who have made the switch say working 60 hours a week for $8 an hour is worth the sacrifice if they can own their own business or advance through the ranks of the kitchen.
"People are tired of accommodating themselves to the traditional workplace," said Paula Rayman, an economist at Harvard University. "They may take a passionate hobby like cooking and turn it into a career."
Until recently, cooking was hardly considered a serious career move. Wayne Nish, the chef and owner of March on the East Side of Manhattan, remembers working as a cook while studying architecture at Cornell University in the 1970's.
"The only high-end restaurants I knew were French, and they didn't hire Americans," he said. Most cooks at the time fit the hash-slinger stereotype, he said, adding, "I couldn't imagine going into a career like that." He was a printer for five years until he could no longer resist the lure of the kitchen and enrolled in the New York Restaurant School in 1982.
During the 1980's food took a place somewhere between fashion and entertainment, spawning its own celebrities like the chefs Wolfgang Puck and Paul Prudhomme. Culinary studies began to be taken seriously.
"The power of advertising didn't hurt," said Douglas Friedman, who quit a 14-year career in the chorus of Broadway musicals and used his savings to attend the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan. Now in his first job, he is an assistant chef at Petrossian at $300 a week.
"They do a very good campaign," he said of the school's ads, which feature such well-known chefs as Andre Soltner, who teaches there.
But it doesn't take long for an aspiring cook to learn that the kitchen is anything but glamorous.
"It's a real eye-opener," said Jude Quintiere, a former television producer who took out a home equity loan to study at the French Culinary Institute in 1991. He went on to study pastry at Peter Kump's New York Cooking School, and then started a bakery, which he later sold.
His annual salary at first was about two-thirds the $52,000 he made in television, and he paid $500 a month in student loans. He and his wife, a doctor, depended on her salary for living expenses. Mr. Quintiere now earns $40,000 a year as head pastry chef at Firebird, a new restaurant in midtown.
Anne Rosenzweig was an anthropologist before she became a chef and opened Arcadia and the Lobster Club in Manhattan. Learning about food in other cultures sparked her interest, and led to apprenticeships in several New York kitchens. She agrees that the glamour factor is overrated.
"When it's 100 degrees in the summer and the air-conditioning in the kitchen blows and the waiter spills a bottle of wine on a customer, it sure would be nice to be out in the bush in Kenya doing field research," she said. "But I still feel it's one of the great all-time jobs. You get a chance to remake yourself every day. You can try new things, you're not limited and you have the instant gratification from the customer. How many people have a job like that?"
If culinary school enrollment is any indication, more people want jobs with those criteria and are willing to pay thousands of dollars to attend prominent schools in the hope that it will lead to the kitchen of a notable chef.
Geoffrey Silagy, who left his job as a foreign correspondent for Australian radio, paid $18,000 for a nine-month certificate in culinary arts from the French Culinary Institute. A two-year culinary arts degree at a state school would have cost him $16,000.
"What you pay for is their network," he said, which he credits for placing him at Verbena, in the Gramercy Park area, as an unpaid apprentice.
Newcomers to the kitchen often work for nothing for a few months to gain experience with prominent chefs, said Molly Chang, the school's director of marketing. From there, they often become prep cooks, working for an hourly wage. Low-level chef positions pay about $22,000, and with a few years' experience sous-chefs can earn $35,000 to $70,000. Executive chefs have earning potential in excess of $80,000.
"I'm willing to suffer for a few years to have my own place," said Mr. Silagy, who relies on his wife's salary and health benefits.
He was among 325 graduates this year, three-quarters of whom were embarking on a second career, said Sarah Cirrincione, the director of admissions at the French Culinary Institute.
At the New York Restaurant School, about 60 percent of the new students are switching careers, compared with about 40 percent four years ago, said Stephen Tave, director of admissions. They will pay $15,000 for a nine-month certificate in culinary arts, or $10,000 for a pastry arts certificate. Students who continue for another seven months can earn an associate of occupational studies degree, for a total of $25,000.
The Culinary Institute of America added a four-year program to its two-year degree in 1994, in response to the demand for chefs skilled in management and accounting. About 1,200 students enroll each year and pay $24,000 for a two-year program in culinary or pastry arts. About 150 go on to enroll in the four-year program.
Culinary Institute programs are full time, which can require students to give up jobs, take out loans and, in many cases, leave friends and family to move into dormitories. It's that type of commitment that often enables career changers to excel in their new field.
"The shining stars, the ones who got the highest grades and go on to successful careers, are often career changers," said Mr. Zander, the Culinary Institute dean. "They're serious about their purpose. They have to give up something to come here."
After 12 years in the computer business, Mark Metcalfe is finishing a two-year degree at the Culinary Institute, but has commuted almost every weekend to Virginia, where his wife lives. He could have gone to a less expensive school in Virginia, but he was attracted to the Culinary Institute's facilities, which include 36 kitchens, and its 50-year-old reputation.
"Leaving my wife was the hardest part about the whole thing," he said. "But we talked about it for six months first."
Some chefs, like Ms. Rosenzweig, forgo classes and head directly to the kitchen. Ms. Bloom, who works as an unpaid apprentice at the Ryland Inn, taught herself to cook and then convinced Craig Shelton, the Ryland chef, that she was proficient enough to be of use in the kitchen.
But it is difficult to land apprenticeships without some formal training. "Chefs want people who've gone to cooking school and have some experience," Mr. Friedman said. "Otherwise, you're worthless to them. How much time can they spend teaching you?"
But after cashing in 401(k)'s or dipping into savings, many career changers find that a smaller salary is only one adjustment in their lives. After coming close to the apex of their first career, it can be hard to adjust to life at the bottom.
Ms. Bloom said that as a trader, her word was law. "Now, if I say something in the kitchen, I'm nobody," she said. "You think cutting an onion is a basic thing. There are 100 ways you could cut it."

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
High-tech features bring a turnaround to a downtown building, after five vacant years.

BYLINE: By Mervyn Rothstein 

 BODY:
A LITTLE more than a year after the Rudin Management Company began spending $15 million to renovate a vacant 400,000-square-foot office building at 55 Broad Street, installing the latest telecommunications equipment, more than 60 percent of the downtown building, now known as the New York Information Technology Center, is spoken for.
William C. Rudin, president of Rudin Management, said that 37 leases had been signed and that 12 leases were out for signing, for a total of 250,000 square feet. Half the signed tenants have moved in, Mr. Rudin said. 
 These are among the most recent leases:
Sun Microsystems Inc., the developer of the Java computer language, has taken 7,000 square feet on the third floor for its professional services group -- its customer-assistance unit. Sun also has space in Manhattan at 1 New York Plaza, between Park and Broad Streets downtown, where it has recently completed an expansion. Kathryn Ridley of the real estate group at the company's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., said 55 Broad Street had been chosen "because of its high-tech emphasis."
Cornell University has leased 5,541 square feet on the third floor for a Theory Center office, which Mr. Rudin said would be linked by fiber optic cables to the Cornell Theory Center in Ithaca, N.Y., home of the world's fastest general-use supercomputer. Larry Bernard, a Cornell spokesman, said the Manhattan space would be used to create an environment for virtual reality and to demonstrate to the Wall Street community the various uses of the supercomputer.
Prosoft, a company based in Buena Park, Calif., that specializes in Internet training, has leased 5,500 square feet, also on the third floor, for a training center. "New York City's Economic Development Corporation guided Prosoft to the building and was very supportive," Mr. Rudin said.
Mr. Rudin has frequently credited Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Downtown Revitalization Plan -- which provides tax abatements to encourage development -- for contributing to the leasing success. The building is eligible for the abatement, so tenants will save thousands of dollars in taxes.
Mr. Rudin said the five-year leases had average annual rents "in the high teens" a square foot, "with no free rent."
The 30-year-old building, at Beaver Street south of the New York Stock Exchange, had housed the offices of Drexel Burnham Lambert. But after that investment banking concern went bankrupt, the building remained vacant for more than five years and a moribund downtown real estate market had diminished hope that it would come to life again.
Now, Mr. Rudin said, the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council has leased 2,000 square feet on the third floor. "The council has created Thunder Gulch, a consortium of artistic not-for-profit organizations, providing a residence facility for artists to become facile in new-media technology so they can provide on-site artistic content to tenants," he said.
In addition, he said, two current tenants, N2K and K-2 Design, have signed up for additional space. K-2, which has 5,700 square feet, is taking 2,500 more. And N2K (for Need to Know), which operates a music-entertainment site on the Internet and was the building's first tenant, "has already doubled its space to 21,000 square feet and is negotiating to double it again," Mr. Rudin said.

Kaplan Not Straying Far
After considering moving its United States corporate headquarters out of Manhattan, Kaplan Educational Centers, the test-preparation and educational services company, has decided to stay.
Kaplan, a subsidiary of the Washington Post Company, has leased about 46,000 square feet, part of the 21st and all of the 22d and 23d floors, at 888 Seventh Avenue, a 45-story, 866,000-square-foot office building at 57th Street. Kaplan will be moving from 810 Seventh Avenue, at 52d Street, and 444 Madison, at 49th Street, where it occupies a total of about 38,000 square feet, and is relocating down the block from Newsweek, another Washington Post subsidiary, which is at Broadway and 57th.
Financial details of Kaplan's new 10-year lease were not disclosed, but the asking annual rent for the space was $29 a square foot.
"The people who own Kaplan really wanted to take a hard look at moving outside New York," said Scott Gottlieb, who represented Kaplan with Michael Laginestra and Alan Desino, his colleagues at the Edward S. Gordon Company, and with Peter Riguardi and Edward DiTolla of Colliers ABR. "They didn't feel that New York was necessarily the right place for them, so they looked at New Jersey and Westchester."
But after going through the process, Mr. Gottlieb said, "they realized that the depth of talent they require wasn't easily accessible in New Jersey and Westchester, and they decided -- based on the talent pool in New York, the variety of people and backgrounds -- that they belonged here and wanted to stay in midtown."

A Midtown Space Half Full
Almost 40,000 of nearly 80,000 square feet of space formerly occupied by Dow Jones & Company at 420 Lexington Avenue, the Graybar Building at 42d Street, has been sublet. The space became available when Dow Jones moved several divisions, including the advertising departments of Barron's Financial Weekly and The Wall Street Journal, to 1155 Avenue of the Americas, at 44th Street.
Dimac Direct, a mail-order company, sublet 21,086 square feet; Akam Associates, a residential property-management concern, took 8,640 square feet; Quantum Management, an executive recruiting company, leased 6,415, and GRS Systems, a video production company, took 3,730. Financial details of the leases, which expire in July 2001, were not disclosed, but asking annual rents for the space were $26 a square foot.
James P. Quinn of Cushman & Wakefield, who represented Dow Jones, said "serious discussions" were under way for the rest of the space.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Reaches 8-Week Highs Against Both Mark and Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar hit eight-week highs against both the German mark and Japanese yen yesterday, rising for the third consecutive session on continued expectations of an interest rate increase in the United States.
The dollar's strength was derived indirectly from a falling mark, which suffered from speculation that the German central bank would lower rates again. 
 The mark also fell against the French franc, the Japanese yen, the Italian lira and the British pound as expectations grew that formation of the European monetary union would meet its timetable.
Traders had favored the mark, Europe's strongest currency, when expectations were low on progress toward creating a single European currency.
But a German monetary official said yesterday that his country would meet budget expectations in 1997, which would help it meet strict criteria for joining the monetary union by 1999.
"You had profit taking on the mark, making it a good opportunity to get into the dollar," said Margaret Kudarauskas, a senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data in Boston.
In late New York trading, the dollar traded at 1.5112 marks, up from 1.4995 marks Monday. The dollar also traded at 109.80 yen, up from 109.26 yen.
In intraday trading, the dollar reached 1.5117 marks and 109.95 yen. It was the highest level for the dollar since July 16, when it hit 1.5158 marks and 110.26 yen.
The British pound traded at $1.5545, down from $1.5570.
Traders said the dollar benefited from the strong United States jobs data issued Friday, which raised prospects for higher American interest rates, something that could increase demand for American assets.
The dollar also gained from comments by Germany's chief central banker Monday in favor of a stronger dollar and from indications on Monday that France would also meet the budgetary requirements necessary to join the monetary union.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, were: 1.2359 Swiss francs, up from 1.2228; 5.1555 French francs, up from 5.1110; 1,520 Italian lire, up from 1,510; 1.3700 Canadian dollars, unchanged.

HEADLINE: Gas Tax Could Help Our Cities

BYLINE: By Felix G. Rohatyn; Felix G. Rohatyn, a managing director at Lazard Freres, investment bankers, was chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation from 1975-93.

 BODY:
A decade ago, in response to the abysmal state of New York City's public school buildings, the Municipal Assistance Corporation, with the support of Mayor Edward I. Koch and Gov. Mario Cuomo, committed $400 million of its surplus funds to creating a new School Construction Authority. This became the cornerstone of a five-year, $4.5 billion construction program aimed at providing decent schools and allowing for increasing enrollments over the next few years.
Yet today the system is more overcrowded than ever. The buildings are often decrepit and, in many cases, dangerous for the children and the teachers. In part, this is the result of poor management by the construction authority, and could be helped by holding year-round classes and moving students to less-crowded schools around the city. 
 But most of the problems are the result of the city's and the state's budgetary constraints and their limits on the ability to issue additional debts.
In 1994, Ramon Cortines, then the Schools Chancellor, and the city's Commission on School Facilities and Maintenance Reform, led by Harold O. Levy, submitted a $7.5 billion five-year capital request. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, struggling with the city's budget gap, gradually reduced this to $2.9 billion.
This summer, Mayor Giuliani and Peter Vallone, the speaker of the City Council, agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion to schools over the next five years. This will help, but there will still be a significant shortfall.
Such problems are not limited to New York City or to schools. Practically every large city and state face deteriorating schools, roads, bridges, mass transit systems, sewers and pollution-control plants. Few have the money to make repairs or build anew, and many have legal restrictions on their debt capacity. They need Federal assistance -- specifically, a program that would return an existing source of Federal revenue over to state and local governments.
During the Presidential campaign, the 4.3 cent-a-gallon increase in the gas tax that was included in President Clinton's 1993 budget package has come under attack. Repealing it would be bad energy policy and bad economic policy. But it is worth considering a better use for the gas tax than Federal deficit reduction: making it available to state and local governments for public investment.
Localities could spend the money directly on construction and renovation, or leverage the funds with secured borrowing. State and city governments have been cutting back on public investment because of budgetary problems and legal limits on their abilities to issue bonds.
The income from a 4.3 cent Federal gasoline tax has the benefit of being highly predictable. It would provide about $5 billion to states every year, making it ideal for very long-term bonds issued for public investment.
Nationwide, this could comfortably support from $75 billion to $100 billion in new programs by state and local governments over five years, assuming that they would pay an additional 20 percent to 25 percent of the cost beyond their take of the gasoline tax.
With its share, New York State could generate $5 billion to $7 billion over the period. Each state would decide how best to use the money, but a significant portion would be committed to new schools and education technology.
Such a program could result in more than buildings. It could create at least two million new jobs, public and private. Most would likely be well-paying jobs related to construction; others would be less-specialized jobs that could be opportunities for young people who need a chance to break the cycle of welfare.
Under the new Federal law, finding work for welfare dependents is a hidden time bomb for state governments.
 Yes, the money will be lost to the Federal Treasury. But replacing $5 billion each year in a $1.5 trillion Federal budget is a small challenge compared with the benefits of $100 billion of additional investment in cities over five years. The program would undoubtedly receive strong support from mayors and governors, Republicans and Democrats, business and labor.
A program that would give city and state governments $75 billion to $100 billion would provide only a fraction of the more than $2 trillion needed nationwide for public improvements. But, if successful, the program could be extended and increased over time.
President Clinton has recognized the need for Federal assistance to state and local governments by signing a bill sponsored by Senator Carol Moseley Braun, Democrat of Illinois, providing interest rate subsidies for local school construction. This was a good beginning, but it is not nearly enough.
Mr. Clinton has long called for greater public investment, yet neither party has put forward a program to meet the challenges facing urban America.
Turning the revenue from the gas tax into schools and other badly needed public buildings would be a large part of Bill Clinton's bridge to the 21st century.

HEADLINE: A Watershed Agreement

 BODY:
The formal agreement announced yesterday to clean up the 2,000-square-mile watershed that supplies New York City with its drinking water is a triumph of good sense over seemingly insurmountable grievances. The agreement ends years of upstate-downstate hostility, and if all goes well it will spare the city the need to build a $6 billion filtration system it can ill afford.
Under the plan, the city will spend about $275 million to acquire thousands of acres of land from willing sellers to serve as buffer zones around its reservoirs. It will spend an additional $1.2 billion to upgrade or build sewage treatment plants near streams that feed the reservoirs, repair many of the region's 128,000 septic tanks and underwrite innovative conservation programs. 
 To appreciate the importance of the agreement -- and why it took so long to achieve -- it is necessary to recall some complicated history. New York City has long had the power to regulate development around its 19 upstate reservoirs. But the city did not exercise that power for many years, and local residents naturally got the idea that they could do whatever they wanted. Commercial development proceeded rapidly, water quality declined, and in 1989 the Federal Environmental Protection Agency ordered the city to clean up the watershed or build a filtration plant.
When the city then decided to use its powers to control land use, outraged upstate residents filed a series of lawsuits that effectively blocked any efforts to improve water quality. Enter Gov. George Pataki, who convened all the players -- city officials, environmentalists and representatives of the Coalition of Watershed Towns, which deeply resented what it regarded as the city's highhanded ways. Seven months of hard bargaining were required to reach a conceptual framework, 10 months more to iron out the details.
The agreement, which will be administered by essentially the same coalition of forces, is not wholly satisfactory to some environmentalists, who complain that it allows for too many new sewage treatment plants, thus inviting harmful new development. On balance, however, it is hard to see a serious downside to this deal. The city's huge investment in pollution control will give upstaters an economic transfusion. New Yorkers will continue to receive inexpensive, high-quality drinking water. Water rates might rise a bit, but the ultimate cost to consumers and taxpayers will be far less than the cost of building a filtration plant.
Governor Pataki deserves a lot of credit, as do various environmental groups, city officials and the E.P.A., which kept the pressure on. The watershed residents themselves merit a special bow for sacrificing local commercial ambitions to the larger goal of environmental quality.

HEADLINE: The New Clinton Health Panel

 BODY:
President Clinton had a transparent political motive in announcing that he would appoint a commission to examine how well modern health-care plans treat patients. Florida, where he made the announcement, is full of elderly voters nervous about what health-care reforms mean for them. But whatever the President's motive, the commission is a constructive idea.
The spread of health maintenance organizations, which now cover more than 60 million Americans, has slowed the increase in health-care costs. But the growth of the managed-care approach has created anxiety about whether patients are being denied treatments in order to lower the costs of health-care companies. By riveting attention on quality of care, an impartial commission can calm needless fears and weed out bad practices. 
 Managed care, by charging a fixed fee no matter how much or how little is done for the patient, builds a wedge of distrust because the plan profits, in the short term, by doing less for its patients. So far, studies show that typical managed-care programs have not compromised on quality of care, and in fact have brought forth quality-improving innovations. But some plans have fueled distrust by devoting more attention to managing costs than care. Indeed, there have been cases of egregious shortcuts. State legislatures in turn have overreacted by shackling managed-care plans, driven by potent lobbying by physicians and insurers who profit from traditional systems.
A properly organized commission can prevent the rush to needless legislation and unnecessary regulation, and can help eliminate abuses. Equally important, it can help educate citizens about changes in the health-care system already made or needed in the future. One lesson of the failed Clinton effort at health-care reform was that constructive change cannot take place without wider public awareness and involvement.
Some opponents of the commission have argued that there are already responsible organizations monitoring quality. But most are controlled by the very industry they purport to monitor. Besides, quality assessment is in its infancy. The commission can bring impartial judgment to the task and propel both industry and government to make faster headway. It could also prod all health plans, whether traditional or managed-care, to assume the responsibility of collecting easy-to-compare data on their treatment practices and health outcomes.
The President was thinking about Nov. 5 and Florida's electoral votes when he decided to appoint a panel. But if he appoints the commission judiciously, it could help renew the chances of building an effective and economical health-care system.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Corporations are spending travel dollars cautiously these days.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
AFTER the usual summer slowdown, business travelers will soon be back in force at airports, hotels and rental-car offices -- but apparently not in the record numbers that have marked business and leisure travel throughout 1996. Business travel this fall is projected to drop to its lowest level in at least five years, according to a forecast from the Travel Industry Association of America, based on a telephone survey of 1,500 adults in the United States.
Only 24 percent of travelers said they were somewhat or very likely to travel for business this fall, compared with 26 percent last fall and 29 percent in 1992, the highest level since the association began tracking business travel. 
 "This is the result of a cautious corporate climate," said William S. Norman, the president of the association, "characterized by leaner staffs and executives who have saturated schedules, compounded by the fact that they have absorbed more of the business travel demands since downsizing began."
But with 60 percent of American travelers likely to take a pleasure trip this fall, the same as last fall, airlines, hotels and travel agents warn that he who hesitates in making reservations may have to settle for a second choice.
 
Gains for T.W.A.
The crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 on July 17, which killed all 230 people aboard, appears to have had little if any adverse economic impact on the airline. Not only did average seat occupancy, or "load factor," rise to 74.5 percent in July from 71.8 percent in July 1995, the number of miles flown by paying passengers also increased 12.8 percent. And August was similarly strong for T.W.A. Passenger volume last month increased 9.8 percent over August 1995, while the carrier's 74.2 percent load factor was up slightly from 74.1 percent over August 1995.
Even though Flight 800 had been Paris-bound, T.W.A.'s international traffic increased by 10,200 last month, to 225,400 passengers from 215,200 the previous August.
While T.W.A. lags well behind AMR's American Airlines and UAL's United Airlines in the percentage of business travelers, in large part because of its smaller route system and fleet, many business travelers to the Midwest fly T.W.A., which has its main hub in St. Louis. And a T.W.A. spokesman, John McDonald, said the carrier had not noticed any falloff among business travelers since the July crash.
Jack O'Neill, corporate vice president of airline partnerships at Maritz Travel Company in Fenton, Mo., the nation's fifth-largest travel agency, said Maritz's bookings on T.W.A. rose almost 10 percent last month over the previous August. The reason, he said, was that there had been a strong demand for travel all this year. "But the business community also realizes that T.W.A. has always had a strong record on safety and maintenance," he added.
Meanwhile, T.W.A. recently added nonstop flights between its St. Louis hub and Austin, Tex.; New Orleans, and Hartford. In each case, flight times are designed primarily to enable travelers to get to those cities and back on the same day.
 
Confess, and Win
It is not every day that honesty about one's dishonesty can result in a free round-trip ticket for two to Rio de Janeiro, plus a five-day stay at a luxury Rio hotel. And in this case it is not even necessary to return the loot. Read on.
To celebrate its 50th anniversary, the Saison Group's Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts is declaring an amnesty and a contest for guests who may have taken a keepsake from any of its hotels from April 1946 to April 1996. Keepsakes range from the familiar ashtrays, towels and tableware to patio furniture, art work and a large carved wooden Tiki, a representation of a Polynesian god, that once guarded the swimming pool in a South Pacific hotel.
Guest must enter by Dec. 31 and need only submit a photo and brief description of their ill-gotten gains, along with the approximate date, place and circumstances. For a copy of the official rules, write to: Souvenir Sweepstakes Rules, Suite 2120, 380 Lexington Avenue, NewYork, N.Y. 10168.
 
Airlines Update
Western Pacific Airlines, the low-cost airline whose 15 planes are adorned with the logos of gambling halls, hotels, rental cars, the Simpson cartoon characters and Colorado Technical University, recently inaugurated nonstop service between Colorado Springs and Orlando, Fla. The carrier, which has been operating for a year and a half, serves 22 cities and has nonstop service between Colorado Springs and Newark, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
On Nov. 15, America West Airlines will begin daily nonstop service between Phoenix and Miami and Las Vegas, Nev., and Miami.
In an effort to beef up its schedule for business travelers, Continental Airlines will begin three nonstop flights a day on Oct. 1 between Houston and Chicago's Midway Airport, and will add a fourth daily flight on Oct. 27. Also on Oct. 27, Continental will add another daily flight between Houston and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, bringing its total on that route to 11.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Fall as Yield Hits 7.11%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities sagged yesterday after comments by Federal Reserve officials led to heightened anxiety over how much the Fed is likely to increase rates.
With inflation and retail numbers only a couple of days away, traders were doubly apprehensive. The price of the 30-year bond dropped 15/32, to 95 19/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, climbed to 7.11 percent, from 7.07 percent on Monday. 
 Traders said that the gains by the market over the last two sessions had left it ripe for consolidation, and comments made by Janet L. Yellen, a Federal Reserve governor, in a Reuters news wire interview yesterday, supplied an excuse for some to take profits. Ms. Yellen basically said that the economy had entered an inflationary danger zone, with the labor market quite tight. While she did see economic growth slowing, she said the timing and the extent of the slowdown were uncertain.
Her comments reinforced beliefs that the central bank is likely to raise interest rates when its policy-making committee meets in two weeks. Later she was on the wires again saying that her mind was not made up as far as tightening credit and that her earlier comments did not represent a change in her view. But some analysts said the anxiety raised by the first remarks remained.
Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a market research analysis firm, said that Ms. Yellen's comments afforded the market an excuse to sell after two strong days.
Mr. McCarthy also noted that another Fed governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, was also quoted on the wires yesterday afternoon; he said that the jury was still out on an interest rate increase.
"He left the impression that he's not convinced that inflation is a problem," Mr. McCarthy said. "Right now the market is trading technicals and waiting for Thursday and Friday's releases of economic numbers, with the focus on Friday, when August consumer price and retail sales data are due.
"I sort of got the feeling on Monday that market sentiment had moved from a 50-basis-point rate increase to maybe 25 basis points after last Friday's employment report," Mr. McCarthy continued. "But with comments by Yellen and Lindsey, a number of people are again beginning to think 50 basis points. Personally, I don't think the Fed will move on Sept. 24, when the Federal Open Market Committee meets. I still don't think there is enough evidence of inflationary pressures." A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent point.
Economic data released yesterday included the July wholesale trade report, which showed huge sales increases in both nondurable and durable goods. The upward revisions to productivity and the downward revision to unit labor costs provided signs that wage costs were not as big a threat in the second quarter as had been originally perceived.
Other data yesterday included the Lynch, Jones & Ryan Inc. Redbook retail sales report. Many expected to see the index up between half a percent and nine-tenths of 1 percent for the first week of September. The index came in lower than expected, up one-tenth of 1 percent from August, but it was not enough to halt the selling pressure.
The Chase Manhattan Bank priced $1.52 billion of asset-backed securities yesterday. Divided into two parts, the triple-A rated securities, which are backed by auto loans, were priced by a group of underwriters led by Chase Securities.
The largest portion of the offering includes $1.478 billion of class A securities that are priced with a 6.61 percent coupon to yield about 6.72 percent, 42 basis points over a comparable Treasury. The remaining $45.73 million of class B securities, rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by Standard & Poor's, with a 6.76 percent coupon, were priced to yield 6.87 percent, or 57 basis points above a comparable Treasury.

HEADLINE: Tax Money Flowing Again, California Pares Class Size

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 10

 BODY:
While overcrowding in classrooms has characterized the start of the school year across the country, California is bucking the trend by rushing to pare class size by next semester.
Financed by a windfall of tax money from an improving state economy, California is asking its 5,000 elementary schools to cut the size of the classes for one teacher in the primary grades, kindergarten through third, to 20 pupils from the state average of 30 by next February. If they do, they will qualify for an extra $650 per child. 
 The $1 billion program, signed into law in July by Gov. Pete Wilson, is the result of a 1988 voter initiative that requires additional money be spent on education during periods of state budget surplus. This year's was the first surplus since then.
"Putting fewer students in classes is a very exciting change for California," said Delaine Eastin, the state superintendent of schools. "It's what the people have wanted for a very long time and I honestly think it is the best investment for this money at this time."
The biggest obstacles are recruiting about 20,000 new teachers and finding enough empty classroom space in schools already crowded.
The first classes to be reduced in size are first and second grades; educators say the importance of individual instruction in reading is paramount for later success in school. Once those classes are cut, schools can then reduce teacher loads in kindergarten and third grade.
California's initiative follows years of shrinking education budgets and years of declining student performance. The state dropped from the fifth highest spending per pupil in the nation in the mid-1960's to 42d last year. And, with an influx of students who speak English as a second language, the state saw its fourth graders tie with Louisiana for last place in the reading test given as part of the 1994 National Assessment of Educational Progress.
Here in the sprawling 650,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District, all 425 elementary schools are scrambling to meet the deadline.
Gledhill Elementary School, a predominantly Hispanic and Asian school with a large contingent of nonnative English-speaking students in the North Hills section, has already cut the size of many classes.
On a recent day, Luiza Cazazian, a second grade teacher, was leading her students in a writing exercise about why summer is fun. She moved without haste among the raised hands, offer spelling help on things like on Sea World to one child, and then she beamed about how much easier it was to deal with 20 students, instead of 32.
"Last year, I remember doing an assignment like this and I would be at that round table and I would have a line of kids coming to me asking questions, rather than me being able to circulate," Ms. Cazazian said. "It was just too hard. They would just follow me around."
One difficulty with meeting the plan is finding new teachers. The state education department estimates that while nearly 20,000 additional instructors are necessary to meet the goal the state's colleges graduated only 5,000 credentialed teachers last year.
Recruiters in the Los Angeles district have advertised in out-of-state newspapers and held job fairs in Oregon and Ohio. But recognizing that troubled urban schools are tougher to staff than the neighboring schools in affluent communities, the district is expanding an internship program for people with college degrees but no formal classroom training. Gledhill hired five instructors this year under the program.
Among them is Annette Jensen, 38 years old, who had been laid off from her job with a food manufacturer. She now teaches first and second grades, sharing a classroom with another instructor. In her previous job, she developed tomato sauces for Nestle, and she looks forward to the time when she can use her science background to teach lessons on seeds, nutrition and plants.
"I had a three week intern-training program in classroom management during the summer, and I'm starting school-year courses next week," Ms. Jensen said, referring to the district's once-a-week night classes for interns. "Certainly this is not an occupation that is easy to go into, but there is great support."
Another obstacle size is the lack of vacant schoolrooms.
At Gledhill, a first grade class and special education course meet simultaneously in a tiny auditorium, with a a chalk board and bookcase temporarily serving as a room divider.
To cope, California schools have ordered nearly 8,000 prefabricated classroom structures, financed under a $200 million school expansion plan. But with such limited notice, many new buildings will not arrive until well after the February deadline, and perhaps not until summer.
In meantime, many schools are converting teacher lounges and cafeterias into classrooms or pairing teachers together. A few schools like Woodlawn Avenue School in Bell, Calif., southeast of downtown Los Angeles, have neither extra rooms or a grassy field for a portable classroom, and may need a waiver to reduce their tiny playgrounds beyond the size mandated by the state.
There is some debate over the costs of reducing class size. In 1988, a report by the Federal Department of Education said that money could be better spent on things like improving teaching methods.
But more current research contradicts this assertion, said Barbara Nye, the director of the Tennessee State University Center of Excellence, in Nashville, and the principal investigator on a study of the effects of reducing class size. The Tennessee study was conducted from 1984 to 1989 and compared student achievement in classes with 25 pupils against those with 17, between kindergarten and third grade.
It showed that by the third grade, students in small classes scored at the 62d percentile on a reading achievement test, seven points higher than children in the larger classes. By eighth grade, students who began their career in smaller classes passed the state's competency test at a higher rates, three percentage points, than students from larger elementary school classes.
"When people say reducing class sizes is expensive, I say it is an inexpensive replacement for remediation and learning difficulties," Ms. Nye said. "It is one of the most cost effective move to reduce educational costs."

HEADLINE: Not Perfect, but Right

BYLINE: By Anthony Lake; Anthony Lake is President Clinton's national security adviser.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
This Saturday, the people of Bosnia will go to the polls to elect their national representatives. These elections are an essential step in bringing democracy to Bosnia. They are what the people want, and what Bosnia needs, to help its hard-won peace endure.
We should not, and we do not, expect the election to be perfect. Bosnia is only beginning to recover from four years of devastating war. But Bosnians, with the help of the international community and the NATO-led military force, have made important progress in creating the conditions for successful elections. 
 Freedom of movement is improving. Last week in the American sector alone -- the area around Tuzla in the north -- more than 100,000 people crossed the internal boundary between the Serb Republic and the Muslim-Croat federation, bringing the six-month total to more than 1.3 million crossings. And to allow more voices to be heard, a wide range of media outlets are operating, including more than 100 independent newspapers, dozens of radio stations and a nationwide independent television network.
Thirteen major parties representing all views are running slates of national candidates, and dozens more are taking part in individual races. Local election committees have been established to oversee voter registration. Some 70 percent of Bosnian refugees living outside the country have cast absentee ballots.
The overwhelming majority of Bosnians, whether Serb, Croat or Muslim, believe the elections are important. In a recent United States Information Agency poll based on nearly 4,000 face-to-face interviews throughout the country, more than 90 percent of respondents in each ethnic group said they intend to vote. Some 96 percent in each group said they believed they could vote for the party of their choice without fear of intimidation. And 83 percent of Muslims, 65 percent of Croats and 89 percent of Serbs said they believed it was better to vote now than to wait for improved conditions, because delay would only strengthen the forces of separatism.
These people know that the elections will allow the structure of a unified Bosnian state to come to life -- a parliament, a presidency and a constitutional court that will represent the interests of all Bosnians, including the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced people.
The elections will enable government agencies to operate again, hastening the day when Bosnia will function as a normal, stable nation. These institutions will require practical, daily interaction among Bosnia's Muslims, Croats and Serbs. That is the best way to break the status quo of division, weaken the forces of extremism and bring Bosnians together to rebuild their land.
Those who argue that elections would hasten partition fail to explain how delaying elections could make things better. Besides, those of us who wave democracy's banner around the world cannot say that if you fear the results of an election, you should not hold it.
Of course, the elections are just one part of the hard work needed to create a unified, peaceful, democratic Bosnia, and the Bosnians still have a long way to go.
Democratic institutions like the parliament and courts must be nurtured with the help of international advisers. A military balance of power must be achieved through the American-led program to equip and train the armed forces of the Muslim-Croat federation. A civilian police force must be trained. Refugees who fear returning to their homes, or who have no means to get back, must be helped, and economic reconstruction must be fostered.
The United States is committed to these efforts. As we continue to do our part to help realize the promise of the Dayton accords and to overcome the remaining serious challenges, we should not undervalue how far we have come. One year ago, war was raging in Bosnia, the worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II. Today, there is peace. Marketplaces are full of life, not death. Playgrounds belong to children, not to snipers. Women are no longer prey to mass rape and terror. Once-divided families are being reunited, and some refugees are slowly making their way back. Basic services -- running water, electricity and shelter -- are steadily being restored.
 But just as voters in a democracy are free to make their own choices, so must the people of Bosnia choose their future for themselves. In sending American troops to Bosnia, President Clinton made clear the point of this extraordinary international effort: to give the Bosnians breathing room to rebuild their lives and their land -- and to give peace a life and logic of its own. He made equally clear what is not the point: to take on responsibilities that are not ours or to create in Bosnia an unsustainable dependence on the United States or other outsiders.
After so much bloodshed and loss, there can be no guarantee that Bosnia's Muslims, Croats and Serbs will join together, and stay together, as citizens of a shared state with a common destiny. The whole point of the Dayton accord was to give them a chance to try. This weekend, the Bosnian people are putting their faith in the ballot over the bullet.

HEADLINE: Watershed Protection Agreement Is Praised

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Federal officials yesterday strongly endorsed a comprehensive water-protection agreement reached by New York City, the state, and dozens of communities ringing the city's upstate reservoirs, saying the agreement would put off until at least 2002 a threatened Federal order to build a multibillion-dollar filtration plant.
At a news conference with Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a host of regional politicians, Carol M. Browner, the administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, said the agreement "offers the promise of protecting public health while saving billions of dollars for ratepayers." 
 The prospect of a Federal order to build the filtration plant, projected to cost New York City up to $6 billion, has been a financial sword of Damocles dangling since 1993, when the E.P.A. began to grow concerned with rising development and pollution threats around the city's biggest reservoirs, in the Catskills and the Delaware River Valley.
The city is already under a Federal order to build a smaller $600 million plant for water from reservoirs east of the Hudson River. No other large American city has an unfiltered water supply, but the natural filtering properties of New York City's watersheds had long been considered ample protection.
Standing shoulder to shoulder, Mr. Pataki, the Mayor and officials from several upstate counties and a coalition of tiny rural towns pledged to press their constituents to embrace the plan. They said the benefits would far outweigh the burdens.
The agreement would force upstate communities to abide by new rules imposed by New York City, but would also commit the city to spending more than $260 million to buy thousands of acres within the watersheds and $396 million to support economic development in the Catskills and stanch pollution from sewage plants and other upstate sources.
The agreement -- far thicker than the Manhattan Yellow Pages -- was the result of 10 months of negotiations involving the city, state, Federal officials and lawyers for upstate communities. It mushroomed from a 10-page agreement in principle that was released with much fanfare last November. At that time, it was thought that details could be ironed out in six weeks, said Michael C. Finnegan, Mr. Pataki's counsel and the chief shepherd of negotiations.
Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani said the deal -- after 60 days of public review -- would free the city to buy thousands of acres to serve as a buffer to pollution. The state had previously opposed city plans to buy land, saying they did not preserve the rights of landowners and upstate communities.
The agreement also includes the first changes in 43 years to rules controlling development in the watersheds. When a draft of proposed changes was first released by the City Department of Environmental Protection six years ago, a firestorm of protest -- and a host of lawsuits -- erupted in watershed towns, where the rules were seen as an attack on home rule and a burdensome intrusion. More than a dozen lawsuits would be ended by the pact.
Yesterday, as the plan was unveiled in Mr. Pataki's Manhattan offices, representatives from a sprinkling of Catskills towns sat in a large cluster on one side of an aisle -- resembling a family attending an out-of-town wedding. After decades of fighting New York City in individual battles over land condemnation, a lack of taxes from city-owned land, the deterioration of city-owned sewage plants and bridges, the decision of 34 towns to band into a coalition in 1993 had clearly paid off, said Georgianna Lepke, the Town Supervisor from Neversink.
Deep in the details of the plan were several points that would help her community, Ms. Lepke said. The city's plans to acquire up to 350,000 acres would be limited to "willing buyer, willing seller" purchases, she said, in contrast to decades past, when the city acquired whatever it wanted, flooding dozens of towns and relocating homes and cemeteries.
Several environmental groups joined yesterday in endorsing the plan, including the Hudson Riverkeeper Fund, represented by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer. Standing next to Mr. Kennedy, Perry Shelton, the Town Supervisor from Tompkins, marveled at the breadth of support for the plan.
"I remember when I said I wouldn't sit next to an environmentalist," Mr. Shelton said.
Other environmental groups remained skeptical of the plan yesterday, saying that it may still allow too much development in the hills draining into the reservoirs.
"Hopefully, this is the start of meaningful public review," Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said. The private environmental group, not included in the talks, had criticized the evolving plan for allowing the construction of some new sewage treatment plants in the watersheds. Any increase in sewage treatment capacity potentially spurs new development, and eventually new pollution, Mr. Goldstein said.

HEADLINE: Index of Semiconductor Demand Showed a Slight Rise Last Month

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 10

 BODY:
The semiconductor industry's leading indicator rose slightly last month, reflecting a modest increase in orders, the Semiconductor Industry Association said today.
The association said the book-to-bill ratio, which measures new orders against shipments, rose to 0.90 in August from a revised 0.86 in July. 
 The August figure means that for every $100 in shipments, semiconductor makers received $90 in new orders. A ratio above 1.00 normally means demand for computer chips is expanding while a number below that means that demand is slowing.
Industry analysts had expected the ratio to be between 0.86 and 0.92. The July ratio was revised slightly from 0.85.
The association said new orders rose nine-tenths of 1 percent last month, to $2.84 billion from $2.82 billion in July. The gain was offset by a continuing decline in billings, which fell 3.2 percent, to $3.15 billion in August from $3.26 billion in July.
Compared with last year's levels, August chip orders were off 37.8 percent and billings were down 19.9 percent. The book-to-bill ratio in August 1995 was 1.16.
The semiconductor industry has been hurt this year by a glut in computer chips, particularly in the memory market.
In recent months a number of chip makers have scaled back expansion plans or halted construction of new plants until the market improves.
Analysts say August is usually the weakest month of the year because many manufacturers shut down for vacation. Thus, an increase in orders during August could signal the beginning of a cyclical upturn.
Many PC makers start shipping their products for the holiday season during the last two weeks of September, and most of them practice "just in time" inventory management, ordering semiconductors only days before they are needed on the assembly line.
The association said book-to-bill numbers in the other leading markets -- Japan, Asia and Europe -- remained higher than in North and South America. The final worldwide book-to-bill ratio for July, the latest period available, rose to 0.95 from 0.93 in June. Japan's book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1.02 in July.

HEADLINE: Who's Punishing Whom?;
Trade Bans Are Boomerangs, U.S. Companies Say

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Corporate America is beginning to grumble. Allied Signal Inc. says the latest sanctions against Iran are costing it several million dollars a year in lost sales of aircraft parts. Caterpillar Inc. is circulating a map that spotlights countries where, it says, American sanctions throw up obstacles to the sale of Caterpillar's yellow tractors and earth-moving vehicles.
Trade sanctions have become ever more difficult to enforce in the world's huge and fluid marketplace, but the United States is invoking them with increasing frequency anyway. It is even adding an onerous new twist: punishing foreign companies for breaching American sanctions. 
 Now corporate America, usually unwilling to go against the nation's foreign policy, is preparing a rare formal protest against the latest trend. What worries many companies is not only the potential loss of customers in the sanctioned countries but also the possibility of retaliation by foreign governments and companies facing penalties under the new strategy of punishing foreigners.
An organization representing 500 of the nation's largest multinational corporations, the National Foreign Trade Council, has been meeting this week on the best ways to reverse or water down the latest sanctions. "We would like to see a more sober consideration of the consequences," said Daniel O'Flaherty, vice president of the council.
The embargo against Iraq is not at issue. Although instigated by the United States, this is an embargo sponsored by the United Nations, in which nearly every nation has agreed not to do business with Iraq until Saddam Hussein bends. American companies lose a market, but so do their foreign competitors, and the playing field remains level.
The issue is unilateral sanctions against a number of countries, like Iran, Libya and Nigeria, under which the Clinton Administration and Congress have closed off a market to American companies, but no other nation participates. As a result, foreign suppliers replace the Americans.
"All of a sudden unilateral sanctions are in vogue again," said Timothy Elder, Caterpillar's manager of governmental affairs, ticking off a half-dozen new ones in the last year. "I have no notion of how much we have already lost in sales, but we will probably crunch the numbers as we get engaged in a public policy campaign against this type of sanction. And we will get engaged."
The United States, as a superpower, has been the world's most frequent user of unilateral sanctions. The practice has been invoked more than 70 times since 1941, when the Roosevelt Administration halted oil and scrap metal shipments to Japan, hoping to curb that nation's military expansion. Pearl Harbor soon followed.
The heyday of the unilateral sanction came in the immediate postwar years, when the American economy was so mighty. But while sanctions against Iran in the early 1950's brought down the nationalist Mossadegh Government, and those against Britain and France in 1956 helped force their withdrawal from the Suez Canal region, such actions gradually lost their effectiveness as other countries became able to supply goods, credit, foreign aid and a marketplace for an offending country's products.
President Jimmy Carter, for instance, embargoed grain sales to the Soviet Union in 1980, hoping to force a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. But other nations broke ranks and sold grain to the Soviets, and the Afghan war continued. Like President Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush used unilateral sanctions frequently -- ineffectively more often than not, according to the Institute for International Economics in Washington, which compiled a study of their use.
When sanctions were successful, they were rarely unilateral. The ones against South Africa played an important role in ending apartheid, but mostly because other nations followed the American lead. The American ban on sales to the Soviet bloc of high-technology equipment used in advanced weaponry was largely successful, but mainly because the United States was the only source of much of this technology.
Nevertheless, the Clinton Administration, with bipartisan Congressional support, has made the unilateral sanction an important foreign policy tool once again.
"Therein is the great paradox," said Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, who led the study of economic sanctions through the decades. "While unilateral embargoes are less and less of an effective force in an integrated world economy, American enthusiasm for them has not diminished."
Current or recent targets include Iran, Libya, Serbia, Cuba, China, North Korea, Nigeria, Rwanda and Colombia. Legislation now before Congress would ban American investment in Myanmar, formerly Burma, because of its military dictatorship. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fear is gone that the Soviets could use an unpopular embargo to gain a foothold in a country like Myanmar, many experts say. And domestic politics clearly plays a role. "Sanctions can provide a satisfying theatrical display, yet avoid the high cost of war," Mr. Hufbauer wrote.
Two recent Government moves have angered American companies by taking the unilateral embargo a step further. Recent acts passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton have upgraded the embargoes against Cuba, Iran and Libya, banning not only American companies from these countries, but also punishing foreign corporations.
Foreign companies could be kept from doing business in the United States or with American companies if they invested more than $40 million in Iranian or Libyan oil or gas ventures. Or they could be sued for damages in American courts if they occupied Cuban properties once owned by American companies. The ban would apply only to properties occupied since the bill's passage, not in the 35 years since Fidel Castro nationalized American operations and the Eisenhower Administration responded with an embargo that applies to Americans to this day.
"The new extraterritorial sanctions may be more effective," a senior Administration official said, explaining the reason for President Clinton's support. "If a French company has to decide between doing business with Iran or the United States, it may prefer the United States."
But American companies are not so sanguine. Some multinationals worry that they may be cut off from further sales to, say, German or Turkish companies if those companies do business in Iran or Libya. That issue came up at a recent gathering of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Other American companies wonder what might happen if a subsidiary abroad somehow breaks the new laws, or foreign governments retaliate against American-owned subsidiaries in their countries.
"What the politicians forget," said Willard Workman, international vice president for the United States Chamber of Commerce, "is that these foreign companies are our customers and suppliers, or they invest in America. We are cutting off our nose to spite our face, presenting ourselves as capricious and unreliable."
So far, the sanctions have had only a modest effect on American business. Unilateral sanctions, by various estimates, have deprived the American economy of less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the nation's annual income in recent years. Like Caterpillar, individual corporations have refrained from publicly estimating the lost revenue from sales and investments that they could not engage in. Few companies, in fact, will attach their names to criticism of sanctions intended by the Administration and Congress to halt terrorism, restore democracy or reinforce human rights.
"We don't lobby against the embargoes, because we understand there are public-policy reasons that go above and beyond the corporate interest to the national interest," said Mark Greenberg, an Allied Signal vice president.
Still, Allied Signal used to supply replacement parts for Boeing 747's owned by Iran, and the company helped with the overhaul of those planes, so the embargo has cost it several million dollars in sales. That is a drop in the bucket for a corporation with $14 billion in annual revenues, but a sting nonetheless -- and one that might prevent Allied from regaining the business if the sanctions are lifted.
"Either the aircraft are not being maintained," Mr. Greenberg said, "or someone else is supplying Iran with the replacement parts. Probably the latter."
Rather than lobby themselves, corporations are turning to their trade associations. The Chamber of Commerce is outspoken. Officials at the National Association of Manufacturers say the organization is "formulating a strategy for dealing with the proliferation of sanctions." President Clinton's Export Council, made up of corporate executives acting as an advisory group, has warned that the costs to the United States in lost business "are clearly quite large."
The National Foreign Trade Council is taking the lead in lobbying against unilateral economic sanctions. Meetings are now in progress to develop a strategy, Mr. O'Flaherty said, and there should be a public announcement soon.
Caterpillar, among the nation's half-dozen largest exporters, is speaking out on its own, rather bluntly. "It is clear the world is not a more dangerous place than in the mid-80's," Mr. Elder said. "But policy makers have kind of decided they like unilateral sanctions. It is a quick and easy thing to do."
Caterpillar's map spotlights not only those countries subject to sanctions but also those denied export aid from the Export-Import Bank and similar help from other agencies. Donald V. Fites, Caterpillar's chairman, in an as-yet-unpublished opinion article, wrote of unilateral sanctions: "The real pressure is on the U.S. companies that not only must cede American jobs to foreign firms, but also risk being branded in other markets as unreliable suppliers."


GRAPHIC: Using economic sanctions to influence the behavior of other countries has a long history, dating back to ancient Athens. But sanctions have had decidedly mixed results. Here are examples from the last four decades.
 
U.S.TRADE EMBARGO OF CUBA (1962-present)
Chart: "Sanctions, Then and Now"
 OBJECTIVE -- Isolate and weaken Fidel Castro's Communist Government and bring about its downfall.
 RESULT -- Cuba's economy is in shambles, but Castro is still in power.
 
ARAB OIL EMBARGO OF U.S. (1973-74)
 OBJECTIVE -- Retaliate for United States support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War.
 RESULT -- Gasoline prices soared as shortages developed. Afterward, the United States continued to support Israel, but also became more attuned to Arab concerns.
 
U.S. GRAIN EMBARGO OF THE SOVIET UNION (1980-81)
 OBJECTIVE -- Force Soviet Union to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.
 RESULT -- The embargo was lifted by President Reagan after it proved ineffective. The Soviets eventually withdrew, but not because of the embargo.
 
U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA (1986-91)
 OBJECTIVE -- End apartheid, the policy of racial segregation.
 RESULT -- Congress formalized South Africa's isolation by passing strict curbs on doing business there. Though not the only factor, sanctions contributed to the election of a black-led Government.
 
WORLDWIDE SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ (1990-present)
 OBJECTIVE -- Force Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and weaken the Government of Saddam Hussein, Iraq's leader.
 RESULT -- Kuwait was freed, but only through military force. Sanctions have hurt Iraq, but Hussein is still in power.
 
U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST FOREIGNERS DOING BUSINESS IN CUBA (1996)
 OBJECTIVE -- Discourage foreign companies from investing in Cuba, and so further weakening Castro's Government.
 RESULT -- Too early to tell.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Session Mixed; Dow Slips 6.66

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday, holding steady against rising interest rates in the bond market while enduring some profit taking from a two-session rally in blue-chip shares.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.66 points, to 5,727.18, with investors securing some profits from a combined jump on Friday and Monday of 126.88 points. That 2.2 percent advance had put the Dow within 45 points of its closing high of 5,778.00, set in late May. 
 Most broader measures closed slightly higher yesterday, but the market's moves were restrained by caution in advance of the release later this week of some key readings on inflation.
"The bulk of the market is stepping back and saying, 'Maybe I'll take a little money off the table and see what's going to happen with the inflation numbers,' " said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Van Kampen American Capital in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.
Stocks were pressured throughout the day by the bond market, where prices fell after two strong sessions.
Bonds had been improving amid optimism that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates sharply to slow economic growth and keep inflation in check. Part of that enthusiasm was generated by Friday's report on August employment, which showed continued upward pressure on production costs, but fell within the range of expectations.
"The employment numbers weren't high enough to guarantee rates would be increased by the Fed, but it wasn't low enough to say we dodged the bullet completely," Mr. Froehlich said.
Rapid inflation makes the fixed-income payments on existing bonds less worthwhile, forcing down prices to create a bigger yield. As bond prices fell yesterday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, a key determinant of borrowing costs, rose to 7.11 percent from 7.07 percent on Monday. Whether rates are pushed up by the Fed or by anxious traders, the increase can hurt stocks by slowing consumer spending and raising corporate operating costs.
There was little market reaction to a report showing that the annual rate of workplace productivity rose a half-percent in the April-June quarter. That was a better performance than forecast, but down from a much stronger 1.8 percent advance during the January-March quarter. Greater efficiency means businesses can increase wages without raising prices.
Analysts, though, said investors seemed more concerned with the reports due tomorrow and Friday on the pace of inflation at the wholesale and retail levels during August.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slim margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 373 million shares, up considerably from Monday's listless pace, which may have exaggerated that session's advance.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 0.21 point, to 356.49. The Standard & Poor Corporation's 500-stock index rose 0.05 point, to 663.81.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.72 point, to 1,149.43, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 3.27 points, to 565.23.
The Dow's biggest decliners were economically sensitive issues, which endured profit taking after strong gains in the last two sessions. Caterpillar slipped 1 a share, to 72 1/2, and Alcoa fell 3/4, to 61 7/8.
Among stocks of Dow component companies, AT&T rose 5/8 a share, to 53 5/8; General Electric rose 3/8, to 86; I.B.M. rose 1/2, to 118 1/8, and Merck rose 1/2, to 67.

HEADLINE: Ex-Reagan Economic Aide Criticizes Dole Plan to Cut Taxes

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
A major architect and defender of Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts broke ranks with Republicans and warned today against the much smaller reductions proposed by Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee.
"I always worry that proposed tax cuts will not be offset by new expenditure cuts," said Murray L. Weidenbaum, who was President Reagan's chief economic adviser during his first two years in office. Ruefully alluding to his own role, Mr. Weidenbaum acknowledged that it was far easier to persuade Congress to cut taxes than to reduce spending, contributing to a very sharp expansion of the budget deficit. 
 "We learned it the hard way," Mr. Weidenbaum, now a professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis, said in a speech.
Mr. Weidenbaum appeared at the annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists being held at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel. His remarks, which also included some very pointed criticism of groups representing the elderly for their role in defending Social Security, brought prolonged applause.
Mr. Weidenbaum, an elder statesman among conservative economists and a former adviser to Mr. Dole, said in an interview that he had no role in drafting the candidate's current plan. "My days in politics are behind me," he said after his luncheon address.
Asked about the $500 tax credit for children under 18 contained in the plan, Mr. Weidenbaum said he had taken no economic "notice" of it, regarding this provision simply as an item of "social" policy.
Other conservatives have complained that the child credit does nothing to encourage savings and investment.
But though he did not refer specifically to Mr. Dole's plan in his prepared text, Mr. Weidenbaum left little doubt that he considers the main element a poor idea.
"Surely cutting income taxes alone is not going to energize the economy sufficiently to prevent a rise in the budget deficit," he said. "On the basis of experience -- I also bear the scars of the 1981-1982 cycle -- those deficits can lead to a variety of negative effects. These range from a diminution of investment capital available for private business expansion to scaring the Federal Reserve into tightening the flow of money and credit."
Mr. Dole says that about one-quarter of his tax cuts will be made up by higher economic growth.
Mr. Weidenbaum said cutting taxes, like printing money, was ill advised. "Both responses are clear, simple and -- in today's circumstances -- inadequate or inappropriate. Both are kissing cousins, quick-fix variants of the age-old desire to pump up the economy," he said. Similarly, cutting taxes alone as a means of raising long-term economic growth, Mr. Weidenbaum argued, is just as futile as adding air to a flat tire without first "patching up the holes that are the basic cause of the problem."
Serious efforts to improve the economy, Mr. Weidenbaum contended, include regulatory reform, shifting to a consumption tax in place of the income tax, and slashing unneeded subsidies to business and middle-class consumers.
Mr. Weidenbaum charged in particular that the elderly had been "misled to believe that they have earned the money they receive."
Social Security taxes paid by workers and their employers -- even after an allowance for interest -- "does not begin to cover the monthly benefit payments" for the average retiree, he said. The balance is "a gift" from those still working.
"There's a large but hidden welfare component in the major middle-class entitlements," Mr. Weidenbaum said.

HEADLINE: Productivity Is Revised Modestly Upward

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Companies churned out goods more cheaply and efficiently during the second quarter than first thought, the Government said today, largely because wage costs were not rising as rapidly as estimated.
The Labor Department said productivity outside the agricultural sector rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, instead of falling by one-tenth of 1 percent, as was first reported. The revised rate was still well below the 1.8 percent pace of the first quarter. 
 Production was higher than originally estimated and employees worked longer hours. Most important, unit labor costs that account for two-thirds of businesses' production costs went up at a lower 3.2 percent rate instead of the 3.8 percent initially reported.
But the gain in productivity, usually a positive indicator for the financial markets, did not help them yesterday. The bond market slumped after a Federal Reserve policy maker warned that the economy had entered a danger zone, noting labor markets were tight and there was risk of rising inflation. Investors feared that the central bank might raise interest rates in an effort to quell inflation fears.
In an interview, Janet L. Yellen, a Fed governor, said wages and salaries were picking up but that overall compensation, which includes benefit costs, so far were rising moderately.
"We're beginning to see a little bit of an increase in the growth of compensation," Ms. Yellen said, though it was unclear how much growth would slow in the second half and how that might restrain inflation pressure.
But, she warned, "There's definitely a chance inflation will rise."
With the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee set to meet on Sept. 24 to decide interest-rate strategy, many private economists have been warning that strong growth was causing wage-driven inflation risks to heat up.
"The August canvass suggests that tight labor markets are gradually escalating wage pressures, and that the economy remains on a solid, indeed unsustainably strong growth track," the Mellon Bank said in an economic commentary.
Separately, the Commerce Department said business sales at the wholesale level jumped at the strongest rate in nearly two years during July. That left only a small addition to inventories and created more room to bolster output in the face of strong demand. Stocks of unsold goods on wholesalers' shelves edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent in July, to a seasonally adjusted $259.5 billion after a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent in June.
Sales by wholesalers soared 2.4 percent, to $203.2 billion, in July, the strongest monthly gain since a 2.7 percent jump in August 1994, after a slight June gain of one-tenth of 1 percent.
The economy is generally expected to lose some steam in coming months after expanding at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter, which was its most vigorous quarterly growth in two years. But the timing and extent of the slowdown is uncertain.
A third report, issued by the Commerce Department, suggested some drag on the economy from a weaker foreign trade performance in the second quarter.
In the three months from April through June, the current account deficit widened to $38.78 billion from $34.87 billion in the first quarter. The main reason was that the overall deficit on goods and services increased to $27.9 billion in the second quarter from $24.2 billion in the first quarter. But measured on a year-to-year basis, the current account deficit declined in the first half of the year by about 8 percent.
The current account is the broadest measure of trade and includes, in addition to hard goods and services, items like investment flows between countries and United States aid and grants.
During the second quarter, investments shifted to a deficit of $1.6 billion from a small surplus of $300 million in the first quarter, as more money flowed out to foreign investors than returned to Americans in the form of profits and dividends from overseas investments.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Is Moving To Add Spark To Campaign

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: MURFREESBORO, Tenn., Sept. 10

 BODY:
Bob Dole moved on three fronts today to reignite his campaign, scheduling a meeting to pacify Congressional Republicans who are fearful of losing their majority, trying new ways to present his economic message and enlisting Colin L. Powell in a new push on the character issue.
Trying to break out of his trailing position in the polls, Mr. Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, unveiled a new two-minute biographical advertisement that declares there is a "moral crisis" in America and shows Mr. Powell, the popular former general, vouching for Mr. Dole's character. "Bob Dole is the candidate most qualified by virtue of his beliefs, his character and competence to be the next President of the United States of America," General Powell says in the commercial. 
 In his speeches, Mr. Dole is still emphasizing his tax-cutting plan. But in a tacit acknowledgment that it has not inspired voters, he is reaching for new ways to explain it.
In Louisiana this morning, he tried to demonstrate how easy it would be for him to cut taxes and balance the budget, telling an audience that it was a simple matter of trimming 5 or 6 cents from every dollar spent on Government. Still, he admitted this might not sound very interesting, and he said he was going to speak slowly because "it will make your eyes glaze over."
And the former Senate majority leader scheduled an unusual visit to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to quiet Senate and House Republicans, who are starting to talk about their fears of a Dole loss. Congressional Republicans are also plainly concerned that a continuing lackluster Dole campaign will depress Republican turnout and endanger their control of the House and the Senate.
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, for example, was quoted in The Wall Street Journal today as saying, "If we have a meltdown, then I'm going to get worried."
Since the week after the Republican National Convention in mid-August, Mr. Dole has been struggling to get himself on the network news. Part of his problem has been that major events like fighting in Iraq and various hurricanes have blotted out political news coverage, much to the frustration of his staff.
But the Dole campaign has neither been staging big events nor making bold or broad pronouncements that would bring it more attention. Rather, it is putting on small events in small towns, generating local headlines but not national news.
In part, that is because Mr. Dole is trying to stay "on message," drilling his economic plan into each new audience, who, polls show, are largely skeptical of his promise to both balance the budget and cut taxes.
"We're sticking with the economic plan as the backbone of our message," Nelson Warfield, Mr. Dole's press spokesman, said today. "But there are obviously different parts of the package."
The rest of the package is chiefly the character issue. Mr. Dole consistently outpolls President Clinton on matters of trust, but he has also been unable to convert this advantage into any progress in his overall standing in the polls, where he struggling to overcome a double-digit deficit.
"In an era of too much salesmanship and too much smooth talking, Bob Dole is a plain-spoken man," General Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says in the new advertisement.
Taking a more direct tack on this, the ad goes on to warn: "There is a moral crisis in America. Drug use is up. The wrong messages are being sent to our youth."
Mr. Dole picked up on the theme here as he addressed a crowd of nearly 1,000 supporters at an open-air plaza this afternoon.
"It all boils down to one word," he said. "Trust. Who do you trust? Who do you trust to lead America? Who do you trust to cut your taxes? Who do you trust to reduce regulation? Who do you trust to reduce drug use in America? Who do you trust to protect our liberty and our freedom and keep our defenses strong? That's what the election is all about. Trust."
(Of course, in typical Dole fashion, he went on to list several other things the election is about: "It's about leadership. It's about family. It's about business. It's about the next century.")
He was introduced to the crowd by Gov. Don Sundquist, who said Mr. Dole "makes decisions on convictions and not convenience."
The new push on character is also evident in the person of William J. Bennett, the former anti-drug chief, Education Secretary and self-described keeper of the nation's values, who has been traveling with Mr. Dole this week. Today at a rally in Baker, La., Mr. Bennett told a crowd of about 300 people sweltering under a blazing sun on the site of a former plantation, "What is more important than the character of our President?"
Mr. Bennett, the author of "The Book of Virtues," plopped himself down earlier with reporters on Mr. Dole's campaign plane. "Virtue is here," he pronounced, going on to describe President Clinton as "one of the most unprincipled major public figures of recent history."
Typically, Mr. Dole tells audiences that the Clinton campaign is misrepresenting his economic plan because it is trying to frighten people. Today in Louisiana, Mr. Dole used the same tactic, warning that a second Clinton term would mean "higher taxes and more teen-agers using drugs, a Government-run health-care system, more liberal judges, an economy producing too few jobs and more and more and more and more government all the way down the line."
He added: "They're going to tax everything, everything, everything! They've got hundreds of ideas that you haven't even heard about on how to get more of your property, more of your money, more authority, and I say, it's time to stop. Let's build a bridge to Little Rock, Ark., and send Bill Clinton back."
But whether Mr. Dole takes up the character charge as directly as Mr. Bennett would like is another question. "You've heard him," Mr. Bennett told reporters. "He says these are not our enemies, these are our opponents." He lamented: "he's not going to do it. I don't think, at all."
Mr. Bennett's presence has also brought to the surface the example of Dick Morris, the President's wayward strategist. While Mr. Dole never mentions Mr. Morris, who resigned after reports that he shared White House details with a prostitute over the last year, it is too tempting for others to resist.
Mr. Bennett, for one, mused on the plane about why the scandal had not agitated the public more, suggesting he might look for ways to stir the pot. And in Louisiana this morning, Gov. Murphy J. Foster noted that the Clintons and Vice President Al Gore called Mr. Morris to console him. "Did they call the man's wife and say we're sorry?" said the Governor. "No. They called him and said we're sorry this happened to you."

Excerpt From Writings of Nominee

 BODY:
Following is an excerpt from a 1990 article by Pat Choate in the Harvard Business Review. The article was based on Dr. Choate's book, "Agents of Influence" (Knopf, 1990).
Japan's campaign for the United States is completely legal. It plays the American economic game by American rules. It uses the campaign tactics and methods of American politics. It hires Americans to lobby, educate and influence other Americans. It is the highest-stakes political-economic game in the world today, affecting whole industries, billions of dollars, millions of jobs, and, ultimately, the wealth and power of nations. 
 It is also deeply corrosive of the U.S. political and economic system. The revolving door of Washington, D.C., breeds cynicism and mistrust. It ultimately represents a form of political corruption -- completely legal, completely unethical. The problem, of course, is not in Tokyo, but in Washington, D.C.
Americans have all but lost sight of some of the most basic lessons of civics -- chief among them the guiding concept of civic virtue. The value of national service -- for an individual to be of service to the country and to work on behalf of the country's interest -- has been cheapened by a more mundane coin of the realm: personal advancement, self-interest, big money. As a consequence, the United States is not only selling corporate assets and real estate to foreign bidders; also for sale is U.S. integrity and national honor.

HEADLINE: Nation's Capital Ponders A Broken School System

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The problems of the District of Columbia's school system mirror those of Washington itself, which is struggling to overcome a fiscal crisis created by poor management and its dependence on Federal financing. And the school system is mired in investigations of poor management and potential mismanagement.
The dropout rates at the District's schools are among the nation's highest, and the student achievement rates are routinely lower than the national average. School buildings are so dilapidated that six of them could not open this week because of fire code violations. And school officials have been accused of improperly diverting millions of dollars into other programs. 
 But in a city that is in the throes of an acute financial crisis, and where half the students' families receive welfare, solutions to such problems have been hard to find.
At a hearing on Wednesday on the school system's problems, Andrew Brimmer, chairman of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, said, "The system as it currently exists is clearly broken."
The financial control board has watched over the fiscal management of the nearly bankrupt city since last year, when it was created by Congress.
Abdusalam Omer, the school system's chief financial officer, said at the hearing that bad management over the years had left the system's finances in disarray and the system itself "in a state of crisis."
Mr. Omer, who was appointed by the city's chief financial officer a month ago to bring order to the schools' financial management, said shoddy fiscal practices over the last three years made tracking dollars extremely difficult. He said school officials had diverted more than $12 million from food programs to pay for other things, including salaries for special education personnel, but some of that money could not be accounted for.
Mr. Omer also criticized school officials for what he said were improper priorities. He cited, for example, improving science laboratories when school roofs needed repair.
Franklin L. Smith, the superintendent who was appointed by the school board five years ago, has been accused of mismanagement, and a contract he approved last year is the subject of a grand jury investigation.
Under that $875,000 contract, a 26-year-old insurance broker who was a friend of a school board member ran a program for emotionally disturbed students. Mr. Smith canceled the contract after the program encountered major financial difficulties.
Mr. Smith has also been criticized for failing to have all the schools ready to open this year. Six of the District's 164 schools could not open on Tuesday because they had not met fire code standards. So 3,000 children were diverted to classes in churches, school cafeterias and Southeastern University.
At St. John's CME Church in the southeastern section of Washington, second graders attended classes in surroundings that were in many ways much nicer than their closed school around the corner.
Today, Judge Faye K. Christian of the District of Columbia Superior Court ordered three of the schools to be reopened.
Members of the financial control board have made it clear that they are just as dissatisfied with the District's school board as they are with Mr. Smith. And frustrated parents maintain that the District government, Congress and uninvolved parents all share the blame.
"I just wish they would stop all this confusion and start dealing with the issues," Bessie Best, whose two children attend schools here, said at the financial control board's hearing on Wednesday. "The question should be, 'What about our children?' "
There are bright spots in the District's public schools. Students at Alice Deal Junior High School routinely score high on national standardized tests. The acclaimed Dunbar High School has a strong engineering program. And, under a partnership with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, students at Hart Junior High School in Southeast Washington wrote a play.
But in general, the District's 80,000 students -- a figure that is itself in dispute -- lag behind national rankings on standardized tests. Nearly 40 percent drop out, one of the highest rates in the country.
Many of the schools they attend are aging and dilapidated. Mr. Smith estimates that it will cost $1.2 billion just to make necessary repairs at all the schools. Although some control board members have questioned that figure, no one doubts that the buildings are in terrible shape.
Mr. Smith himself has been the focus of most of the complaints about the school system. But he says many of his critics are upset that he has challenged the status quo by, among other things, dismissing many principals and insisting that teachers be evaluated according to their students' performance.
He has his defenders, too. Nathan Howard, who works for the Department of Labor and has six children in District schools and two who have graduated, praised Mr. Smith for creating school-based management teams that give principals, teachers and parents more power to make decisions.
"The way to improve schools is to empower parents," Mr. Howard said, "and to have the extended family of the community as support."
Karen Shook, president of the school board, said a lack of money was the school system's biggest problem. The school budget has shrunk to $482 million in 1997, from $517 million in 1991, she said.
But members of the control board said it was how the schools' money was managed, not how much they had, that was the primary issue.
"I'd want to know that any additional money was going to be spent as prudently as possible," said Joyce Ladner, a control board member. "I don't have that sense right now."
At Wednesday's hearing, Mr. Brimmer, the financial control board chairman, chastised Ms. Shook, saying the school board had abdicated its responsibility to supervise the superintendent and to monitor spending and contracts.
The control board can ask the school board to dismiss Mr. Smith and replace him with a manager who would have broad powers to change the system. If the school board does not agree, the control board could carry out the plan after consulting with Congress.
Since most of the District's voters do not have children in the public schools, officials feel less pressure to come up with a real solution, said Delabian Rice-Thurston, executive director of Parents United for the D.C. Public Schools, a community group.
"There's a constituency for the police and a constituency for the trash collectors," Ms. Rice-Thurston said. "But there's no constituency for the children."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE COMMERCIALS;
Dole Campaign Says It Has Hardly Begun to Fight as Clinton Storms the Airwaves

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The broadcast advertising war between the two major Presidential campaigns is looking more and more lopsided.
The Clinton campaign is relentlessly hammering away at Bob Dole with harsh and repetitive commercials directed squarely toward pivotal voters in critical states. But the Dole campaign has not advertised in three important Midwestern states for two weeks, and it continues gauzily promoting the candidate's biography over his ideas in national spots. 
 Just wait, Dole campaign strategists say. They say they are planning an unconventional advertising blitz in October, promoting Mr. Dole on the economy and attacking President Clinton on crime and drugs -- "burning in our message," in the words of one Dole official.
Another cautioned that "the great majority of the money is budgeted for October." As a result, he said, "the fact that we're not up in a given market or a given state in one week in September should not be taken as a de-emphasis of that state."
Still, counting on a blitz next month amounts to a gamble that the commercials being created by Mr. Dole's newly assembled advertising consultants will be able to overcome months of repetition of basic themes by the Clinton campaign in advertisements that often seem stamped from a single die.
And the Democrats say they do not think the Dole campaign will have much more money than they do to spend in October.
"We're only spending about $100,000 more a week than they are," a Clinton strategist said.
Underscoring its hardball tactics, the Clinton campaign today released a tough 30-second commercial, intended for the female voters who have provided Mr. Clinton with his double-digit lead in the polls. The commercial is being shown in state markets around the country.
The advertisement, produced after Mr. Dole said on Saturday that he opposed the Family and Medical Leave Act, features a couple recounting time spent with their young daughter before she died. A narrator explains how the law enables families to stay home with a sick or newborn child without losing their jobs.
"Bob Dole led a six-year fight against family leave," the narrator says. "Twelve million have used leave, but Dole's still against it."
The mother then provides the closing words: "President Clinton understands the struggles that families go through."
Without addressing the law, the Dole campaign attacked the commercial.
"To imply that Bob Dole would let a child die without her parents at her side shows a moral hysteria so outrageous, so grossly offensive, that it defies description," Christina Martin, a spokeswoman, said.
Clinton officials said they intended to broadcast the spot for up to a month, rather than the usual one or two weeks, running it during daytime programs that appeal to women.
In sharp contrast, looking at the same female voters, the Dole campaign today released a new two-minute commercial that criticizes Mr. Clinton only by implication, never by name. And the commercial, while it tries to raise values as an issue, once again introduces Mr. Dole to voters, sketching him as a war hero. Gen. Colin L. Powell is shown in his speech at the Republican National Convention last month, praising Mr. Dole's "character and competence." The two-minute commercial is scheduled to begin appearing on Thursday on broadcast and cable networks.
It is the second week in a row that Mr. Dole has bought time on a network. National political advertising can be seen as a sign of a weak campaign, because such promotion can be inefficient compared with state-by-state advertising targeted at wavering voters. By advertising nationally, Mr. Dole spends money to promote himself in states like South Carolina that are securely his.
As such states dwindle in number, Clinton strategists say, Mr. Dole may have concluded that a national approach is more effective. Indeed, for two weeks in a row, the Dole campaign has not bought broadcast time in Missouri, Illinois or Wisconsin.
But a Dole campaign strategist said the campaign was not conceding states.
"We're not at the stage of a campaign where you do a real triage," the official said. When a campaign is trying to reach more than 35 percent of the population, he said, a national approach is most efficient.
The Dole campaign will have to overcome images broadcast for months. With no pretense at subtlety, the Clinton commercials have painted Mr. Dole as an aged Washington insider and a lackey of Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Over and over, the Clinton campaign has used an image of Mr. Dole standing with Mr. Gingrich before wallpaper bearing a washed-out image of the Capitol. The two men are shown in slow motion, while jarring piano music plays.
"You'll see it again," a top Clinton strategist said. "It's the only way, in a media-saturated environment, where people can flick to a hundred different channels."
Throughout the campaign, the Clinton advertising team has turned the appearance of defense into fierce attacks on Mr. Dole. One advertisement in July began: "The same old politics -- Dole attacks Clinton." It ended: "The real Bob Dole -- 35 years of higher taxes."
A new 30-second advertisement on the economy, which was also released today, begins: "Bob Dole, attacking the President." It ends: "Bob Dole. Thirty-five years in Washington. Thirty-five years of higher taxes."
Similarly, the Clinton campaign recently turned its defense to a Dole advertisement on drugs into an attack. Since the Dole commercial, was broadcast in only two cities, CNN reported last week that the Clinton campaign had been apparently snookered into a wasteful, disproportionate response.
But campaign officials said they were delighted that Mr. Dole had provided them with a pretext for what they called an effective commercial. The advertisement, among other things, points out that "Bob Dole even voted against creating the drug czar."
Two weeks after it was first broadcast, the commercial was still on the air today.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CHOICE -- Man in the News;
Economist With a Passion for Policy -- Pat Choate

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
Dr. Pat Choate, whom Ross Perot named yesterday to be his running mate, is more accustomed to being the behind-the-scenes adviser whose briefcase is crammed with position papers, whose Rolodex is crammed with important names and numbers and whose job it is to tutor V.I.P.'s on ideas. His ideas.
Dr. Choate (it rhymes with "coat") has had spectacular success pushing his ideas into the mainstream in Washington in the last 15 years. But in his debut as a debate coach, he had only so-so results. The debate was against Vice President Al Gore, and the subject was the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Perot, advised by Dr. Choate, was said to be furious at the way the November 1993 face-off went, and Dr. Choate's star in the Perot firmament was thought to have faded, at least briefly. 
 Before the debate, Dr. Choate had written a book with Mr. Perot that explained why Nafta opponents like Mr. Perot believed that the agreement would lower American workers' wages. The royalties from the book, "Save Your Job, Save Our Country" (Hyperion, 1993), were divided between Mr. Perot's group, United We Stand America, and Dr. Choate's research unit in Washington, the Manufacturing Policy Project.
Dr. Choate is an economic nationalist and almost an economic isolationist; he is suspicious of foreign entanglements. Before fighting Nafta, he attacked Japan's influence on economic policy in this country. As early as 1981, he argued that big public-works programs should be presented to the public as "investments in infrastructure," an approach that was eventually picked up by Democrats.
Dr. Choate is also credited with propelling the idea of competitiveness to the forefront of the policy debate in Washington in the 1980's by drafting speeches for Democrats and bills for Republicans. In the dry-as-a-theorem world of economic policy, he is a rarity; he lectures people with unconcealed passion.
Dr. Choate was born on April 27, 1941, to a sharecropper's family in Maypearl, Tex., about 40 miles south of Dallas. He attended college on an R.O.T.C. scholarship and earned a doctorate in institutional economics at the University of Oklahoma. His research focused on the role of governments and industries in guiding economic development. He was commissioned as an Army officer in 1963 and was discharged into the reserves in 1965.
Oklahoma's first Republican Governor, Henry Bellmon, hired Dr. Choate as an economic planner in 1965. He worked briefly as a regional administrator for the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration, then left to head the Department of Economic and Community Development in Tennessee. He argued that Tennessee needed foreign investment, which made him some political enemies.
He moved to Washington in 1975 as the director of the Economic Development Administration's Office of Economic Research. "It was like falling into a pot of gin," he said, for he had an $11 million budget and a staff of nine economists. He was ousted in a bureaucratic shuffle during the Carter Administration. After working briefly at the Office of Management and Budget, he went to TRW, the defense contractor.
Dr. Choate lives in Washington with his wife, Kay, and has two stepsons in college. He teaches at George Washington University and has written six books and more than 200 articles. He has a weekly radio talk show called "The Week Ahead," carried on the United Broadcasting Network, which he helped found.
Until yesterday, Dr. Choate was a kind of ambassador without portfolio for Mr. Perot's campaign. Last month, during an appearance in South Carolina, Dr. Choate predicted that Mr. Perot would be in second place in the polls by mid-October.
"The race will be between Clinton and Perot," Dr. Choate said, "and we can say, 'To vote for Bob Dole is to throw away your vote.' "

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Clinton Talks of Welfare and Family Leave

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Sept. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton brought his campaign caravan to the Show Me State today to show off an experimental program that helps former welfare recipients move into work and to defend the Federal law that lets families take time off from work for medical emergencies.
The double-barreled day highlighted the two sides of Mr. Clinton's approach on work issues: the hard-headed new law he signed last month overhauling welfare and forcing people to find jobs or lose benefits, and the soft-hearted bill he signed in 1993 that lets employees take leave from work when a child is born or a parent is sick. 
 And though he never mentioned them by name, in both cases Mr. Clinton's targets were clear. The President contended that by signing the welfare bill, he had ended partisan arguments on the topic with the Republicans, and he vigorously defended the Family and Medical Leave law against recent criticism by Bob Dole that it amounted to heavy-handed Government meddling in the workplace.
"I come here today to say to the governors, you asked for this and now you've got it," Mr. Clinton said at a meeting of the bipartisan Southern Governors' Association in Kansas City, Mo., referring to the welfare bill that ends the Federal guarantee of assistance to the poor in favor of block grants to states with wide flexibility to administer programs as they see fit.
But he was quick to add that the bill was only a first step and that it was up to employers to pitch in and help create jobs for welfare recipients who will need them.
"We have to prove all the skeptics wrong," he said, in implicit acknowledgment of the criticism he endured from liberals for signing the Republican-drafted bill. "But one thing I know: I know that the employers of this country want to do this. I believe that every employer who has ever said a disparaging word about the welfare system -- which includes every one of us, including me -- should be challenged to assume the responsibility to help be a part of the solution to this problem."
In an effort to make his point, Mr. Clinton also held a round-table discussion with a group of women formerly on welfare who now hold jobs under a Missouri program that consolidates benefits that would have gone to welfare recipients to instead provide subsidies to employers who hire them. The Administration made the program possible by granting Missouri a waiver from the old welfare law before Mr. Clinton signed the new one.
"I'm convinced that the only way the states are going to be able to really move large numbers of people to work in a short time is with a partnership with the private sector, doing what Missouri has done, using what used to be the welfare check or a food stamp check as an income supplement to a private employer, who can then engage in training and work," Mr. Clinton told the group.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton defended the family leave law, which was the first bill he signed on taking office, and said at round-table discussion that it was "one thing that's become, unfortunately, controversial again in the last couple of days."
On Saturday, at a discussion with Republicans in Pittsburgh, Mr. Dole responded to a question about the problems of small businesses by attacking the leave law, which Mr. Clinton now wants to expand to cover parent-teacher conferences and doctors' appointments with children.
"My view is, why should the Federal Government be getting into family leave?" Mr. Dole said then. "I believe in compassionate leave if there's a birth or a death or there's something that happens in the family, obviously. But I again wonder about the long arm of the Federal Government."
Mr. Clinton took strong issue today with those remarks, saying the law "plainly isn't hurting the economy.
This evening, at a rally in the Gateway Educational Park here, the President asserted: "All the bill says is if you work in a business with 50 or more employees and your spouse is about to have a baby, or you are, or your mama or your daddy's real sick, or your baby's real sick, you can take just a little time off from work without losing your job.
"Now, you tell me, is that anti-business? If it's anti-business, how did this economy produce 10.5 million new jobs? That's more jobs, more job growth, faster rate, than any Republican administration in 70 years."
And his campaign released a new television advertisement attacking Mr. Dole for opposing the bill and featuring emotional testimony from a family that took advantage of it.
Mr. Clinton's ability to blend a carrot-and-stick approach on issues like welfare and work appears to be part of the reason he is running ahead of Mr. Dole in Midwestern swing states like Missouri, which Mr. Clinton won in 1992, and where Mr. Dole must make strong inroads to have a chance of winning.
The President used his stop here today -- part of a three-day trip that will also take him to Colorado, Arizona and California -- to raise more than $1 million for the Democratic National Committee, $500,000 at a luncheon in Kansas City and $600,000 at a dinner in St. Louis tonight.

HEADLINE: Israeli Prime Minister Pays Visit, and a Political Debt

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
The new Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, paid back a crucial political debt in New York City yesterday when he visited the grave of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitch leader whose followers in Israel worked diligently toward Mr. Netanyahu's narrow victory in late May.
In a brisk 27-hour visit to New York -- part of his second trip to the United States since his election -- Mr. Netanyahu reached out on several fronts, giving media interviews, seeking investment in Israel and joining Vice President Al Gore and Jack Kemp, the Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, for a glittery event last night in Manhattan with a prominent Jewish-American group. 
 But nothing in his brief visit reverberated so soundly as when he slipped off his shoes in a cemetery in Queens to say silent prayers at the grave of Rabbi Schneerson, the rebbe, or spiritual leader, who died in 1994 at 92. Mr. Netanyahu called the rebbe, whose counsel he had sought several times, "the most influential Jew of our time."
The Lubavitchers are a relatively small group of some 200,000 Jews worldwide whose unity in devotion to the rebbe, whom some considered the Messiah, has given them an influence that outstrips their numbers.
"The rebbe's capacity to unite great learning, great sagacity, great understanding with a warm Jewish heart, with a grounding which is unmatched in the Torah -- this unique combination made him, in fact, a unique figure," Mr. Netanyahu said after his visit to the grave in the Old Montefiore Cemetery in Cambria Heights, where he read from the Book of Psalms and lit a candle.
His public bow to Rabbi Schneerson, who led the Lubavitch movement for 44 years, seemed twofold: to thank the Lubavitchers specifically for their get-out-the-vote effort, and to give a more general nod to the ultra-Orthodox factions in Israel from a Prime Minister who is not particularly religious himself.
But his choice to honor the rebbe roiled contention among some American Jews, who saw it as pandering to a group that takes a hard line on peace in the Middle East as well as on other forms of Judaism.
Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch, the executive director of the Association of Reform Zionists of America, which represents 1.5 million Jews, said he had tried repeatedly to arrange a meeting with Mr. Netanyahu. The Prime Minister's refusals, he said, underscore the deep divisions on issues of religion and how to proceed on peace that have not healed since the election.
"We hope that now he appears to have time to visit graveyards that he would also have the time to discuss issues with those of us who are alive and well," said Rabbi Hirsch, who is based in New York.
Several Lubavitchers said Mr. Netanyahu's trip increased the influence of their movement, already powerful politically in Israel.
"This is a very powerful statement to the world," said Rabbi Jacob Z. Goldstein, who is president of Community Board 9 in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where the Lubavitchers are based.
Mr. Netanyahu began his trip on Monday in Washington, where he repeated in a meeting with President Clinton that he would not cede the Golan Heights to Syria as a starting point for peace talks. In his remarks yesterday at Rabbi Schneerson's grave he echoed the hard-line oratory of Lubavitch speakers -- a view espoused by Rabbi Schneerson -- for retaining Jewish communities in the West Bank.
He said he first met Rabbi Schneerson after he was Israel's delegate to the United Nations in the 1980's, and sought his counsel on several occasions. He remembered especially what he called the rebbe's "penetrating gaze," which he said went right to the essence of things. "The rebbe was able to see the important things in our lives as human beings and as Jews," he said.
Mr. Netanyahu began his day addressing the Association for a Better New York, a coalition of business, labor and political interests. There, he made the case for investment in Israel, saying that he was working to dismantle the state control of businesses that he said had helped strangle economic growth.
In the evening, he was honored at a three-hour gala dinner celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, an umbrella group of virtually every influential Jewish group that is a constant forum for Israeli politicians. In a measure of the group's sway, the event at the New York Hilton in mid-Manhattan was attended by politicians ranging from Mr. Gore and Mr. Kemp to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Kemp peppered their speeches with Hebrew expressions and stressed the close bond between Israel and the United States.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Flatley Begins His Ranger Metamorphosis

BYLINE: By JASON DIAMOS 

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., Sept. 10

 BODY:
For 13 seasons, Patrick Flatley was an Islander mainstay. Toward the end, some might say he was the Islanders. In all that time, from his rookie season through his maturation into a respected veteran, Flatley was conditioned to despise the sight of a Rangers uniform.
So it may be unthinkable to some that he will soon be wearing one -- as the first former captain of the Islanders to play for the Rangers. 
 "I think when camp gets closer to coming to an end and playing there becomes more of a reality, then I'm sure it will be a little unusual," the 32-year-old Flatley said today, the second day of Rangers training camp. "I think it's going to be exciting on both counts. I don't know what to expect, to be honest with you."
Flatley in anything but an Islander sweater is hard to imagine. And yet here he is, still striving for the one thing in his career that he has always wanted: the Stanley Cup.
The closest he has come was as a 20-year-old rookie. Flatley joined the Islanders after the 1984 Winter Olympics, had a huge playoff run, then watched as Mark Messier, Wayne Gretzky and company ended the Islanders' four-year dynasty and began one of their own in Edmonton.
Those first few years with the Islanders remain the fondest, Flatley said today. Those years and the team's Cinderella run to the conference semifinals in 1993. Flatley was the last link to the Islanders' glory days as the once-proud organization fell to the depths it is currently mired in. Flatley's body seemed to begin to fall apart, too, although he disagreed.
"Look at the injuries I've had," he said. "I don't think broken bones are your body breaking down. That's just bad luck. Last year was a groin. But look around the league. Eighty percent of the league had groin injuries last year."
Flatley wanted to come back to Long Island -- even though the Islanders have absolutely no shot at winning the cup. The Islanders did not want him back. They tried to get him to retire. They bought out the final year of his contract for $700,000. Youth movements have little room for thirtysomethings, especially after 8-goal, 17-point, 56-game seasons.
Then again, the Rangers, with all their talk about youth over the summer, did not figure to have a place for Flatley, either. It was something of a surprise last Friday when the Rangers signed him for one year at between $200,000 and $300,000.
Money, of course, had a lot to do with it. That and the fact that the Rangers are short on right wings.
"We didn't have a lot of depth as far as a guy like Patrick Flatley is concerned," said Coach Colin Campbell. "He comes highly recommended by a number of people we contacted. And in these days of economic restraint, the price was right."
And, Neil Smith, the Rangers' president, said last weekend: "It's not as if he's taking somebody's job. He's got a lot to prove."
Flatley said today that anything he has left to prove is to himself. And he added, "I want to decide when I want to retire."
Somewhere in his heart, he hopes it will be after he has had his opportunity to skate around the ice with the Stanley Cup raised over his head -- whatever uniform he is wearing.

SLAP SHOTS
MIKE MILBURY resumed his hard line with the restricted free agents ZIGMUND PALFFY and TRAVIS GREEN on Tuesday, saying he was prepared to let both players sit out the season. Milbury said Tuesday night that he was annoyed that neither player's agent had returned his phone calls from late last week, although later that night Green's agent, DON MEEHAN, did leave a message for Milbury. "It's not only me," Milbury said, "the ownership is ready to let them sit." . . . After Tuesday's session, Coach COLIN CAMPBELL headed to Philadelphia to watch Canada's 4-3 overtime victory in the World Cup of Hockey finals. Campbell said that from what he had seen so far in the World Cup WAYNE GRETZKY "still has it" after "a lot of people thought he was finished last year."

HEADLINE: Minnesotans Decide to Hold Rematch of 1990 Senate Contest

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Minnesota voters yesterday set up a rematch between Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat, and Rudy Boschwitz, the two-term Republican he ousted from office six years ago.
In Rhode Island, where Senator Claiborne Pell, a Democrat, is retiring after six terms, State Treasurer Nancy Mayer easily won the Republican primary, and Representative Jack Reed won the Democratic nomination to succeed Mr. Pell. 
 In the third Senate contest on a busy primary day, former Representative Dick Swett narrowly defeated John Rauh, a businessman, for the Democratic nomination in New Hampshire. Mr. Swett will challenge Senator Robert C. Smith, a first-term Republican viewed as vulnerable by the Democratic Party.
The voting came as Democrats, riding high on President Clinton's double-digit lead in the polls, have set their sights on recapturing control of Congress. Republicans hold at 53-to-47 Senate majority.
In other primaries, two New England governorships were at stake, while Arizona and Wisconsin chose Congressional nominees.
In Minnesota, Senator Wellstone swamped three rivals with 88 percent of the vote, while Mr. Boschwitz drew 80 percent against four challengers.
The Republican National Committee has already jumped into the race, running an advertisement featuring photographs of the Senator mixed with those of criminals. Mr. Boschwitz has disavowed responsibility for the ads, but Mr. Wellstone said it shows where his challenger's support comes from.
"When I think of all the big interests that are lined up behind Rudy Boschwitz, it will be a tough race," Mr. Wellstone said in a telephone interview from Washington.
Mr. Boschwitz, at a victory party in a Minneapolis hotel, said his campaign is "about the farmers of Minnesota who have the capacity of feeding the world. It's about the single mother in Minneapolis who wants work, not welfare."
Mr. Wellstone is the only Senator seeking re-election who voted against the welfare bill signed by Mr. Clinton last month.
In Rhode Island, Ms. Mayer has also received help from the Republican National Committee as she seeks to become the state's first female member of the United States Senate. The committee has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on television ads labeling Mr. Reed an "ultraliberal" who has failed to back balanced budget and welfare measures.
Mr. Reed, in his third term in the House, has called the ads distortions and has demanded that Ms. Mayer ask the committee to stop broadcasting them, but she has refused.
"I have been trying to talk about the real issues, providing opportunities for working families, making sure our economy works for those families," Mr. Reed said after his primary victory.
Ms. Mayer, the state Treasurer for four years, said she planned to run on her record of "getting things done, of being a fiscal watchdog, of treating everyone's money as if it were my own."
Mr. Reed won 87 percent of the vote to beat one rival, while Ms. Mayer got 77 percent against two challengers.
It is Rhode Island's first open Senate race in two decades; the state's other Senator, John H. Chafee, a Republican, has been in office for nearly 20 years.
In New Hampshire, with 86 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Swett had 28,426 votes or 53 percent, and Mr. Rauh had 25,460 votes or 47 percent.
New Hampshire has not elected a Democrat to the United States Senate since 1975, when John A. Durkin defeated Louis C. Wyman in a special election. But Mr. Smith has drawn heavy criticism for such displays as holding up a plastic fetus and graphic photographs during a speech against partial-birth abortions.
In Vermont, Republicans gave John Gropper, a businessman, the task of challenging Gov. Howard Dean, a popular Democrat whose approval rating hovers at nearly 70 percent. With 49 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Gropper had 66 percent of the vote, and Tom Morse, also a businessman, had 34 percent.
In New Hampshire's gubernatorial race, state Senator Jeanne Shaheen won a lopsided Democratic primary victory, racking up 88 percent of the vote against two rivals. In the Republican primary, Ovide Lamontagne, chairman of the state Board of Education, won a five-way race, outpolling Representative Bill Zeliff by 48 percent to 43 percent. Gov. Steven Merrill, a Republican, decided not to run again after two two-year terms.
In the Republican primary to succeed Mr. Zeliff, John E. Sununu, son of former Gov. John H. Sununu, who later became President George Bush's first White House chief of staff, led a field of seven; he had 28 percent of the vote, with 91 percent of precincts reporting. The Democratic nominee is Joe Keefe, a Manchester lawyer and state party chariman.
In other contests, James Harsdorf, a Wisconsin dairy farmer and former state senator, won the Republican nomination for the seat held by Representative Steve Gunderson, who is retiring. Supporters of Mr. Gunderson, one of two openly gay House Republicans, mounted a write-in effort but the Congressman did not back it.
Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the other openly gay House Republican, was drawing 75 percent of the vote against one rival in early returns. Mr. Kolbe disclosed his homosexuality this summer when a gay magazine said it planned to "out" him because of his vote against recognizing same-sex marriages.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE THIRD PARTY;
Perot Chooses An Economist For His Ticket

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
For the second time in four years, Ross Perot has chosen a political unknown -- this time, Pat Choate, a Washington-based economist and author -- as his running mate, preparing for what is emerging as a far more difficult bid for the Presidency than Mr. Perot's first race of 1992.
Mr. Perot announced his selection of a running mate, characteristically, on a 30-minute paid television appearance on the CBS television network tonight. Mr. Choate then proceeded to appear alone on Mr. Perot's favored venue, "Larry King Live," the CNN talk program. 
 In selecting Mr. Choate, Mr. Perot turned to someone with a long history of advocating protectionist trade policies. Mr. Choate drew wide and sometimes unfavorable attention with a book, "Agents of Influence" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1991) that offered a harsh depiction of Japanese influence on the American economy.
Mr. Perot introduced Mr. Choate to the nation tonight in the last segment of his televised commercial, first with a video presentation that reviewed Mr. Choate's political resume, and then with a five-minute chat, with each of them settled in brown leather armchairs.
"In Washington today, too many people profit too much from private gains at the public expense to permit real reform," Mr. Choate told Mr. Perot and television viewers. "The only real hope for genuine reform of our government and its policies is this party, the Reform Party."
Beaming at Mr. Choate, Mr. Perot pronounced himself pleased with his running mate's presentation. "Thomas Jefferson," he said, "must be looking down from Heaven and smiling at you tonight."
Mr. Choate's selection came after at least three people, current and former officeholders, turned down a request to join Mr. Perot in his second run for the Presidency. They included David L. Boren, the former Senator who, like Mr. Choate, is from Oklahoma, as well as Representatives Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio, and Linda Smith, a Republican of Washington.
Mr. Perot met Mr. Choate in 1991, after Mr. Perot repeatedly and approvingly displayed copies of Mr. Choate's book while campaigning. Since then, Mr. Choate has become Mr. Perot's primary adviser on the subject of trade. The two worked together to produce a quick paperback arguing against United States ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The selection of Mr. Choate suggests that Mr. Perot -- who has seen his signature advocacy of deficit reduction seized by President Clinton and Bob Dole during this election -- will emphasize trade issues as he seeks to carve out political territory in an election that, so far at least, has often seemed to exclude him. The issue of protectionism accounted for a large part of Mr. Perot's appeal in 1992. Its continued political potency was evident in Patrick J. Buchanan's strong showing in the Republican primaries this time around.
But trade issues have not been prominent in the general election campaign. Both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole favored Nafta, the trade agreement that has become the rallying point for protectionist sentiment in the United States.
Mr. Perot's selection of Mr. Choate comes at a particularly difficult time in his campaign. While Mr. Dole enjoyed extensive network coverage of his selection of Jack Kemp as a running mate in August, Mr. Perot had to pay CBS for a half-hour of network time to announce his choice.
Mr. Perot's first extended television commercial, which appeared last Sunday on ABC, ranked 103d of 107 programs broadcast in prime time that week, according to Nielson Media Research.
In the latest New York Times/CBS Poll, conducted last week, 5 percent of the registered voters who responded said they supported Mr. Perot, compared with 50 percent for Mr. Clinton and 35 percent for Mr. Dole. In the same poll, only 11 percent of registered voters expressed a favorable opinion of Mr. Perot, while 60 percent viewed him unfavorably.
Mr. Choate has fairly extensive experience as a television commentator and as a weekly radio talk-show host.That gives him an edge over Mr. Perot's last running mate, James B. Stockdale, a former Navy pilot who was a prisoner of war.
He displayed that ability today on CNN. Mr. Choate, who has worked for Republican and Democratic Presidents, was never asked, and did not say, whether he was a registered member of a political party, and attempts to reach him tonight were not successful. He handily fielded questions on topics like abortion. ("I have Ross's position," he said. "Let the women decide.")
Still, the selection of Mr. Choate (his name rhymes with "vote") is unusual for a number of reasons, at least as far as traditional politics go. He has no experience in elective politics and a relatively unexplored personal history, which could change should Mr. Perot emerge as a competitive force in the race.
For example, Mr. Choate was dismissed from his job as a vice president of policy analysis at TRW Inc., an industrial conglomerate, after the storm unleashed by the publication of his book about Japan.
Over the years, he has made a series of potentially unpopular observations. "Unless we change things, I think America risks becoming a Japanese economic colony," he told one interviewer in February 1991.
When informed that some Japanese considered his attacks on the country racist, Mr. Choate responded: "For the Japanese to accuse anyone of racism is like a frog calling someone ugly."
Whatever electoral benefits Mr. Choate might ultimately bring to the ticket, his appearance violates a standard that Mr. Perot set for his own employees. Mr. Perot's Electronic Data Systems barred employees from growing facial hair, although it has since dropped that policy, a company official said tonight. Mr. Choate has a beard.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 13, 1996, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about Ross Perot's choice of Pat Choate as his Vice-Presidential running mate referred imprecisely to Mr. Perot's relationship with Electronic Data Systems. He sold the company in 1984 and has had no role in it since 1986.

HEADLINE: Business Districts Require Check on Power

 BODY:
To the Editor:
When Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter states that business improvement districts are "creating public policy . . . in a way that is so independent that it can become harmful" (news article, Sept. 5), she makes a colossal understatement. Neither the governor, the mayor, nor the residents who live within a district can stop the property tax revenue that a B.I.D. collects every year. 
 No other entity in our political or economic system has an automatic income stream with virtually no oversight from an outside agency or body. Politicians must answer to the electorate. Commissioners of public agencies must justify their budgets and practices to the elected officials. Even private corporations are accountable to their stockholders.
Further, in a situation without parallel in American history, to dismantle a business improvement district, 51 percent of the actual property owners (not just those who vote) must step forward and vote to repeal the district.
In our day of low voter turnout, such a feat would be equivalent to a candidate's receiving the vote of every voter. Short of this step, or new legislation, B.I.D.'s will continue to take advantage of an unfettered income stream.
To avoid the abuse that results when money and power are concentrated and unaccountable, we must add an effective political check to the legislation that established these entities.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Await U.S. Price-Index Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar reached an eight-week high against the Japanese yen and was mixed against other major currencies yesterday as some traders took profits after a three-day rally, while others waited for fresh data on price increases in the United States.
Analysts said the dollar traded in a tight range in advance of the release today of the Producer Price Index and of the Consumer Price Index tomorrow. 
 A sign of higher-than-expected inflation in the reports for August could prompt the Federal Reserve to increase short-term interest rates, as many now expect. Higher rates generally lift the value of the dollar by making returns more attractive on assets in the United States. The Fed's next rate-setting meeting is on Sept. 24.
In late trading yesterday in New York, the dollar sold for 1.5105 German marks, down from 1.5112 marks on Tuesday. The dollar traded at 110.20 yen, up from 109.80 yen and the highest since mid-July. The British pound fetched $1.5550, up from $1.5545.
"Trading was choppy," said Jack Griffin, vice president at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York. "It seemed like people were unwilling to hold positions for a long time and were looking to take profits fairly quickly."
Some of the dollar's weakness against the mark resulted from a move to that currency by European traders. Kevin Lawrie, vice president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said many dealers also sold Italian lire to buy marks.
There is continuing concern that Italy, Spain and other countries may have trouble meeting the budgetary and inflation criteria in the plan for participation in the first stage of a single European currency system.
Karl Otto-Pohl, former president of the Bundesbank, was quoted in a German business magazine as saying that inflation in Italy and Spain was too high for those countries to be initially permitted to join the currency union. If they were, he said, interest rates might rise across Europe.
Other late dollar rates in New York yesterday, compared with those late Tuesday, included: 1.2351 Swiss francs, down from 1.2359; 5.1589 French francs, up from 5.1555; 1,524 Italian lire, up from 1,520, and 1.3712 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3700.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
City Schools Learn Harsh Economic Lessons

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
The point is made early and often in "Children in America's Schools": Poor children's schools are worse in every respect, or disrespect, than the schools of the well-to-do.
The camera drives home the argument of Jonathan Kozol's 1991 book, "Savage Inequalities." The focus, tomorrow night on PBS, is on Ohio, but the stark and painful contrast can be found everywhere: There are the suburban schools with well-equipped laboratories and a computer for every child, with art and music programs and plenty of sports, with pleasant lunchrooms and prospects of success. And there are the inner-city and rural schools with peeling plaster, leaking roofs, broken windows and cockroaches, with jammed classrooms, outdated textbooks, equipment that seems to have been picked up in a garage sale and hard-pressed teachers, in an atmosphere choked with coal dust and failure. Graffiti on the wall of a beat-up building sends the message from more than one student: "I hate this place." 
 The reason for the difference, in case anybody has not heard, is money. As the middle class has fled the cities and big companies have moved out of communities where they once paid taxes, the children who remain must make do with the leavings. And as long as education is paid for by local property taxes, the disparities promise to continue and probably worsen as growing numbers of children begin school. In Ohio, it is reported, spending for each pupil ranges from $13,752 for the luckiest down to $3,088 a year for the least lucky. If you're poor, get back.
The consequences are predictable: demoralization, dropouts and youngsters graduating without the knowledge or skills for a decent job. The suggestion put forward here that better schools can compensate for single-parent homes and other afflictions may be wishful, but smaller classes and more computers couldn't hurt. So the documentary portion of this two-hour production is welcome for sounding a challenge that is receiving bipartisan inattention in this campaign season.
Unfortunately, it is also a repetitious program, filled with school administrators, teachers and students decrying existing conditions and echoing what Mr. Kozol, also on screen, says with the eloquence of outrage. The producers must assume PBS viewers are slow learners. Critics of the Kozol argument -- yes, they exist -- are not heard from.
The second hour, a sort of town meeting presided over by Bill Moyers, brings together students, teachers, parents and legislators. No tape of their meeting was available for review.

Schools are also at the center of this first of seven weekly reports on campaign issues. Kathy Slobogin, the reporter, finds rural and urban schools that are doing serious and successful teaching, an argument for the proposition that most children, poor and rich, black and white, can learn. Not that a little more money wouldn't help.
Forthcoming programs in CNN's ambitious election-season series will address Americans' feelings of economic insecurity and offer a look at the Presidential candidates and their wives.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Union to Lower, Then Freeze, Service Rates for Gas

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Union Gas Company said yesterday that it would lower its service rates for natural gas use next year for many of its 1.1 million customers and then keep the rates unchanged for five years.
It is the first time in the country that a large utility has committed itself to freezing rates for more than three years. 
 The rate decreases next year, totaling about $3 million, will mostly affect larger natural gas users like apartment and commercial buildings and stores. Most residential customers will see only a slight decline at most in their monthly bills. And, the utility said, customers who use only small amounts of gas for cooking and heating water would see their bills go up slightly because it is more expensive to service them.
The rate reduction is part of a plan approved by the New York State Public Service Commission that would allow Brooklyn Union to reorganize its gas-distribution operations into a holding company, to be called the KeySpan Energy Corporation, enabling it to increase its investments outside the utility business.
The reduction is aimed at encouraging more customers to switch to natural gas from oil for heating.
It also reflects how utilities throughout the nation are taking steps to lower their rates as states, seeking to open their utility markets to competition, are allowing customers to choose their own suppliers.
Other utilities, including the Consolidated Edison Company, have frozen rates for up to three years on delivering natural gas, but none have made as long-term a commitment as Brooklyn Union, which had already frozen its rates voluntarily for the last two years.
Craig G. Matthews, the president and chief operating officer of Brooklyn Union, acknowledged that its rates had reached levels that made it increasingly difficult to persuade residents and potential larger customers in its service area in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island to convert to gas heating from oil.
"If there is no economic incentive," he said, "no customer will switch from oil to gas."
About 77 percent of the one- and two-family homes in the utility's service area now use natural gas for heating, compared with about 70 percent in 1985. About 45 percent of larger customers like apartment buildings, retail stores and commercial buildings now use natural gas.
Brooklyn Union projected that the average monthly bill for an apartment building would drop next year to $5,917 from $6,827. The bill for a one-family house using gas heat would stay at about $80. But the bill for a small customer who used gas only for cooking would rise to $13.30 from $12.15.
The rate reduction and freeze affect only the service charges by the utility. The cost of gas varies and is passed through to the customer. Thus, customers could still see their total bills go up or down if the cost of gas changes.
Under the plan approved by the Public Service Commission, the utility will also be able to offer new services to its customers, including guarantees on parts contracts and reading gas meters from a central office, and it will be able to charge fees for such services.
John Maniscalco, the executive vice president of the New York Oil Heating Association, an industry trade group that represents sellers of heating oil in the area, said Brooklyn Union's new rates "are going to favor the larger consumer. It's just not fair."

HEADLINE: A Renewed Challenge From Iraq

 BODY:
With the Pentagon reinforcing United States air power in the Persian Gulf, events in Iraq seem to be moving toward an escalation in American military operations. Though Saddam Hussein started the latest conflict, President Clinton owes Americans a clear explanation of how he means to deal with the complex political and military equation in the Persian Gulf before sending more forces into combat. He has not yet made a convincing case for intensified air strikes against Iraq.
Some retaliation against Iraq was justified after its armored thrust into the internationally guaranteed Kurdish region, and its ground fire at American aircraft overflying northern Iraq yesterday should not go unanswered. 
 While we supported Mr. Clinton's actions last week, he does not have a blank check from Congress or the American people to mount military operations without demonstrating that America's national security interests are threatened. It is not clear what would justify the "disproportionate" response that Defense Secretary William Perry ominously threatened yesterday.
Exchanging fire with Iraqi forces is not a policy. In the absence of a clear strategy for dealing with Mr. Hussein and the gulf region, and in the heat of an election campaign, retaliatory strikes could quickly escalate into a confrontation that ultimately damages American interests.
Circumstances in Iraq and the Middle East have changed since an American-led coalition drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991. Iraq's conventional military forces, while much reduced from their prewar level, have been rebuilt and could once again pose a credible threat to neighboring countries. Many gulf war allies have seen their resolve to resist Mr. Hussein's belligerence eroded by domestic politics, economic considerations or the passage of time.
Saudi Arabia, a centerpiece of the coalition, faces internal unrest and anti-American terrorist threats under an ailing King Fahd. Turkey is now led by an Islamic Prime Minister eager to improve relations with Iraq. France, Russia and China no longer support military action against Baghdad. Iran, as always, waits to exploit weaknesses in Iraq.
All of this limits what the United States can and should do on its own to deal with Saddam Hussein. The vital American interest in the area is oil. Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed, through conquest or intimidation, to determine the availability or price of much of the global oil supply.
The challenge for Washington is to devise new policies that adequately protect American interests in the region but do not recklessly commit American military forces to combat or inadvertently destabilize other countries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Turkey, where the presence of American forces is a sensitive issue.
So far, Iraq has not threatened Saudi Arabia or Kuwait in its latest military maneuvering. Last week's American cruise-missile strikes against antiaircraft installations in southern Iraq, and the expansion of a no-flight zone there, make it much harder for Mr. Hussein to turn his forces south anytime soon. In that sense, Mr. Clinton has accomplished what should be the primary American objective in the region.
American interests in northern Iraq are far less clear at this point. President Clinton inherited a commitment from the Bush Administration to shield the Kurds from Baghdad's abuses. Mr. Hussein's recent military campaign against one faction of Kurds required a measured response, which Mr. Clinton delivered last week, but America's role must be circumscribed in the tangled world of Kurdish internecine fighting.
Mr. Hussein should be checked when he threatens his neighbors, abuses his countrymen and defies Security Council resolutions. But the American response should be proportionate to the danger and determined by a careful calculation of American interests. Saddam Hussein would like nothing more than to draw the United States into a conflict that could strengthen his hold over Iraq and destabilize the region.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid to World Birth-Control Efforts Faces Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Three years after the Clinton Administration lifted a ban on aid for international birth control efforts that include abortion and abortion counseling, the House, the Senate and the White House are at loggerheads over Republican attempts to revive the ban, a dispute that could block passage of the $12 billion foreign aid bill.
If an end to the impasse is not found by this week, foreign aid spending will be conducted under a stop-gap spending measure called a continuing resolution. Besides maintaining a 35 percent reduction enacted earlier this year in American aid to population control worldwide, that measure would sharply reduce American contributions to the World Bank and aid to North Korea that is supposed to keep that country from developing nuclear weapons. 
 As is often the case in family planning programs, the issue in the latest fight is abortion, or more precisely whether American aid can go to private international family planning organizations that use their own funds either to provide abortions in developing countries or to counsel women on how to end their pregnancies.
Last February anti-abortion forces in the House, unable to gain an outright ban on American aid to such organizations, succeeded in slashing contributions from $547 million to $356 million in the 1996 fiscal year budget. The House also won approval of legislation that said American contributions to these family planning programs could not begin until July 1, 1996 -- a nine-month delay -- and that once the programs started, the Government could give out only 6.7 percent of the funds each month over a 15-month period.
The result was an effective 87 percent cut in American family planning aid to international programs and a sea of red tape for American agencies doling out the aid.
"It's really strangled the program and caused enormous administrative burdens," said Dr. Nils Daulaire, deputy assistant administrator for policy at the Agency for International Development, which administers foreign aid. "It's probably been the biggest single cause of increased paperwork on A.I.D. over the last decade."
Mr. Daulaire said the new system has added about $1 million in administrative costs for his agency.
A study conducted this spring by the Alan Gutmacher Institute, the research arm of the Planned Parenthood Federation, estimated that the 35 percent reduction in American family planning contributions would lead to 4 million more unintended pregnancies worldwide, and to1.6 million more abortions.
In June the House passed a version of the foreign aid bill that cut financing by 50 percent to any international family family planning group that conducts abortions, advises on their availability or provides information that could lead a country to change its abortion laws. In July the Senate passed a measure that contains no such restrictions, and so far a House-Senate conference has failed to resolve the differences.
President Clinton has vowed to veto any bill containing the abortion restrictions, but so far the House leadership, pressed by anti-abortion groups like the National Right to Life Committee and the Christian Coalition, has been holding firm.
"What we're trying to get back to is the policy that was enforced for over 10 years under Republican Administrations, under which the U.S. provided almost half of the family planning money in the entire pool, but only gave to groups that stuck with family planning and sterilization and did not promote abortion," said Douglas Johnson, the director of government relations for the National Right to Life Committee.
The fight over funds for family planning organizations that provide abortions or abortion counseling began in 1984 when the Reagan Administration announced at a population conference in Mexico City that the United States would no longer contribute to family planning groups it felt were promoting abortion. That policy was reversed by President Clinton on his second day in office in 1993, and now the Administration and family planning groups are fighting attempts by anti-abortion forces in Congress to reinstate it.
Population stabilization advocates say attempts by anti-abortion forces to reduce funds for international family planning efforts are causing the United States to relinquish its leadership in this area at a time when increased education and family planning efforts are beginning to slow the growth in the world's population.
"The projections right now are that if these family planning efforts can be maintained over the next decade, we will for the first time in human history see an absolute decline in the rate of growth and possibly get to zero growth sometime in the next century," Mr. Daulaire said. He added that restrictions being imposed on family planning programs "put that goal very much at risk."
Two years ago, at a United Nations population conference in Cairo, the United States and 150 other countries pledged to increase global spending on population stabilization to $17 billion by 2000, from about $5 billion. American contributions to international family planning efforts rose steadily during the Bush Administration and in the first two years of Mr. Clinton's term, before being cut in the last fiscal year.
"U.S. leadership is absolutely imperative on this," said Timothy Wirth, Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs. "If you think about the issues that are going to be resounding issues in the 21st century, this is one of the top two or three, if not the biggest."
For their part, anti-abortion lawmakers say these programs promote abortion and represent an attempt by the United States and the Western countries to impose their values on the Third World.
"A lot of this is about cultural imperialism," said Grover Joseph Rees, an aide to Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is a leader of the anti-abortion forces in the House. "It's about using funds that should go to child survival programs or increased education, and instead using them to try to persuade people that they ought to have the number of children we think they ought to have, rather than the number they think they ought of have."

HEADLINE: Adelphi Provost Defends Officials at Regents Hearing, Telling of a 'Survival Mission'

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Adelphi University was barely muddling along a decade ago, poorly organized and in need of revitalization, a top official of the university testified yesterday.
"The most frequently articulated mission was survival," said Dr. Igor M. Webb, Adelphi's provost and senior vice president. 
 Dr. Webb was recruited in 1986 by Adelphi's president, Dr. Peter Diamandopoulos, to aid in his effort to revive the university. And Dr. Webb was Adelphi's leadoff witness as the school began its defense against allegations of mismanagement.
The New York State Board of Regents is holding hearings in Manhattan on a request to remove Adelphi's trustees, including Dr. Diamandopoulos. The request was made by the Committee to Save Adelphi, a coalition of faculty members, former trustees, administrators, alumni and students, which presented its evidence during 15 days of testimony.
Dr. Webb, citing a 1982 study by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Company, said Adelphi had an inadequate central administration, "weak faculty self-image," "weak student self-image" and weak trustees.
As a newcomer, he said, "It was hard for an outsider like me to figure out how things got done." Even the Provost's files were not alphabetized, he said.
Among the other problems he said he found were that there was no orientation for students, documentation of peer review for tenure and promotion was "extremely skimpy," there was little evaluation of teaching and "the institution was inbred."
His attempts to make changes soon met resistance, Dr. Webb said.
"There was a somewhat defensive attitude toward an outsider," he said. In trying to impose more evaluation of teachers, he said, "I was absolutely met by a stone wall, and it remains an issue at the school."
In 1989, the faculty voted no confidence in Dr. Diamandopoulos and Dr. Webb, and more recently have called for the resignation of the president and trustees..
The faculty "believed the quality of teaching was high," Dr. Webb said, but he did not. He said the faculty awarded students inflated grades. The students averaged B, but their scores "on all the national examinations is below average," he said.
Dr. Webb also faulted the faculty for a drop in writing scholarly works around 1980 that he termed "striking." To help counter that problem, he said, Adelphi gave the faculty more time by cutting the teaching load to three courses from four.
Dr. Webb said Dr. Diamandopoulos sought to instill in Adelphi "a unifying mission -- the view was that the university didn't have an image."
Dr. Webb extolled as major innovations the creation of the honors college and the adoption of a core curriculum that seeks to give Adelphi undergraduates a cross-disciplinary view of modern issues, knowledge and values. The faculty endorsed the curriculum but has differed with the administration on the honors college by insisting that the faculty continue to play a role in selecting the professors.
Dr. Webb's testimony is to resume today. His cross-examination may return to parts of the Peat, Marwick report that he did not mention. That report called Adelphi "a good regional institution" and counted among its strengths the "academic quality of several of its programs" and the "humane and personal style of its organizational culture."
The report also praised the president at the time, Dr. Timothy W. Costello, for "increasing and maintaining student enrollments" and "creating a collegial campus culture." Under Dr. Diamandopoulos, enrollment has dropped more than a third, and critics say he has polarized the campus.

HEADLINE: U.S. Veterans Give Vietnam Clues About Hanoi's Missing

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Sept. 11

 BODY:
American veterans of the Vietnam War took another step toward reconciliation with their former enemies today, handing over information about mass graves where 600 North Vietnamese servicemen are thought to be buried.
James Brazee, president of Vietnam Veterans of America, handed his counterpart in Hanoi a North Vietnamese soldier's ammunition pouch and gas mask along with a briefcase packed with papers related to the war that ended 21 years ago. 
 "The issue of those missing is still of primary importance to both sides," Mr. Brazee told Nguyen Trong Vinh, a retired major general and vice president of the Vietnam Veterans Association.
The documents, which included maps pinpointing two burial sites in the central province of Quang Tri, increased to more than 6,000 the number of Vietnamese war dead about whom the American veterans group has provided information.
The group began the drive in February 1994, asking members to turn in battlefield souvenirs to help Vietnam determine the fate of some of its 300,000 missing servicemen.
General Vinh thanked Mr. Brazee for the objects and papers and told him that the body of an American pilot had been recently discovered in Quang Tri, the scene of some of the fiercest battles during the 1968 Tet Offensive.
He said that Vietnamese veterans had provided information that helped the United States clear up 29 cases. He also promised continued cooperation between the two associations.
United States officials list 2,143 American members of the military and civilians still missing in action in Southeast Asia. More than 1,600 of the total were in Vietnam.
More than 3 million Vietnamese and about 58,000 Americans died in the war, which ended in 1975 with a Communist victory over South Vietnam, which was backed by the United States.
The United States and Vietnam normalized relations in July 1995. But economic and strategic ties have been hampered by the festering M.I.A. issue.
Before a visit in July by the American national security adviser, Anthony Lake, Hanoi expressed some irritation in a news briefing over Washington's stress on M.I.A. accounting and said there were other postwar issues that needed to be addressed.
The Vietnam Veterans Association, whose members are on a five-day visit, was due to hold talks in Hanoi on Thursday about the effects of Agent Orange. The herbicide was widely used by the Americans in the war to clear jungles areas used by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks To End Direct Aid For Kurds

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
With the allied relief effort in northern Iraq in disarray, the Clinton Administration is looking for ways to end its direct role in providing food, shelter and other aid to the Kurds, leaving it instead to relief groups and international organizations like the United Nations, Administration officials said today.
The officials insisted that the United States would not abandon its commitment to aid Kurdish civilians in the future. And they vowed that American and allied aircraft would continue to patrol the no-flight zone to restrict President Saddam Hussein's military operations north of the 36th parallel. 
 But with a Kurdish faction allied with Mr. Hussein now controlling much of northern Iraq, giving him his strongest presence in the Kurdish enclave since the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the United States has suspended all of its relief efforts in the region. And it appeared unlikely that the United States would resume the direct help it has provided for five years as part of what is called Operation Provide Comfort.
"We now have to look to the international relief organizations to provide the kind of help that Operation Provide Comfort did in the past -- the economic, humanitarian help," the State Department's spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said today. "But we will continue to run the military mission, which has been so effective in containing Saddam Hussein."
Another Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, went further, saying the United States would not again have as direct or strong a relief role now that Mr. Hussein is wielding greater power over the Kurdish enclave. "It's going to be difficult to have anything like what we did," the official said.
The uncertainty about relief aid underscored the Administration's shifting policy toward the Kurds in wake of the warring between Kurdish factions and the incursion of Mr. Hussein's forces on Aug. 31. Having led the coalition to create a "safe haven" in northern Iraq both as a response to a relief crisis and as a bulwark against Mr. Hussein, the United States has now focused primarily on checking the threat of Iraqi aggression in the south, saying it did not want to intervene in a Kurdish civil war.
"Let's remember what the core of U.S. strategic interests are: to protect Saudi Arabia and Kuwait," Mr. Burns said.
With the Administration shifting its policy and with the balance of power changed in northern Iraq, the rationale for continuing the operations in the north has increasingly become an open question, even for the allies that joined the United States in creating the protected enclave.
In Turkey, which has allowed allied aircraft to operate from Incirlik, Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan met with his Cabinet today to discuss the future of the enclave and the air patrols. "It became apparent that the duties and responsibilities of Provide Comfort have to be looked at again in the light of recent developments," a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Omar Akbel, said today.
Britain, the strongest supporter of the American missile strikes in Iraq last week, has also indicated that the relief part of the operation needed to be reconsidered, though it remained committed to the patrols.
The United States, Britain, Turkey and France created the enclave after Mr. Hussein's forces crushed a rebellion by Kurds, prompting an exodus of refugees into Turkey and Iran.
At the height of the crisis in the spring of 1991, the allies established a military presence in northern Iraq and airlifted more than 1.7 million tons of food, medicines, blankets and other materials to help Kurds return to their homes. Since then the United States has gradually reduced its contributions to relief efforts -- from nearly $600 million in 1991 to $71 million the next year to $22 million so far this year.
According to the United Nations, about 650,000 of the more than 3 million Kurds in northern Iraq receive some form of help, mostly food or medicine. The United States oversaw the relief aid, but generally left the delivery of it to organizations like Unicef and to private relief groups.
The operation included the air patrols, a small military force serving as observers in Zakho, Iraq, on the border with Turkey, and the relief aid. When Iraq's forces seized the Kurdish city of Erbil, the distribution center for most of the assistance, the relief aid and the military presence on the ground in Iraq ended. About 15 people working for the United States Government and another 50 Americans working with relief organizations left Iraq.
One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had already planned on phasing out its direct control over the relief assistance. Iraq's incursion, the official said, forced it do so more abruptly than planned.
Mr. Burns said the United States would continue to offer money to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. But there will be an interruption of relief assistance as the Administration looks for "a way to do it without a physical United States presence," as one senior official put it.
A White House official said that the United States would shift responsibility for food and medicine, but that one program to rebuild destroyed villages would be discontinued indefinitely.

HEADLINE: Private Program for Troubled Students Echoes Catholic School Plan

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
Two years ago, Sean Kendell Winn was the kind of student who is at the heart of the plan advocated this week by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to send some public school students to Roman Catholic schools.
A Bronx student who would get into fights and end up suspended, Sean was accepted by a Catholic school in his first year of high school. Almost all expenses were paid by private donors. 
 "My life," Sean said yesterday, "is much nicer now."
Sean, now a 16-year-old junior at All Hallows High School with an 85 average, is a beneficiary of a 10-year-old private program, Student-Sponsor Partnership, which was created for students in grades 9 through 12 by Peter M. Flanigan, an investment banker at Dillon, Read & Company.
The partnership, which has helped 825 students enrolled in 18 Catholic schools to graduate since 1986, bears striking similarities to a proposal recently made by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and, since Sunday, backed by the Mayor.
Under the archdiocese's plan, Catholic schools would educate 1,000 of the city school system's worst students, providing both secular and religious instruction. Their tuition would be paid by private businesses.
After some board members cited constitutional concerns about having school employees acting as admissions counselors for Roman Catholic schools, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said yesterday that the Board of Education would not compile lists of eligible students for the program advocated by Mr. Giuliani -- a decision the Mayor says he understands.
But the Chancellor's spokeswoman said that guidance counselors would continue to advise students to seek scholarships to private schools and would release school records for those who do, much as they have been doing for the Student-Sponsor Partnership for the last 10 years. In that way, the Partnership sees itself as a model for the Mayor's plan.
"We hope that what we are doing could serve as a blueprint for what the Mayor is proposing," said Mayree Clark, the chairwoman of the partnership's board and director of global research at Morgan Stanley.
Ms. Clark said 75 percent of the program's students graduate in four years and 90 percent go on to college. Omar Antigua, a 20-year-old junior at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, is one of them.
"They opened up so many doors for me, I couldn't even begin to count them," said Mr. Antigua, the third child of an unemployed immigrant who reared three boys by herself in a tough Bronx neighborhood. "Where I come from, I'm a rarity."
Mary Grace Eapen, the partnership's executive director, said the program works to make students feel special. "They want discipline, they want order," she said. "They want to have someone in their lives who expects great things from them, and we do."
Applicants learn of the program through their eighth-grade guidance counselors or community leaders, Ms. Eapen said. Once a student decides to apply, school counselors or teachers supply test scores, a list of the student's weaknesses and strengths and an analysis of why the student would probably not succeed were he or she to continue in the public school system.
"Counselors are very vigilant at spotting the kids that could benefit the most from our help," Ms. Eapen said. "They want what's best for their kids and they know we provide it."
Of the thousands of students who apply every year, several hundred are accepted. This year, 345 new students entered the program.
Although the partnership program is similar to the one advocated by the Mayor, it differs in two ways.
First, its eligibility requirements are broader: It considers poverty, poor grades and disciplinary problems as qualifications for entry, not simply whether a student has been identified as one of the school system's worst. Second, it provides mentors to guide students in addition to paying their tuitions.
The partnership has 1,030 students but is short 150 mentors.
Sponsors pay at least $850 in tuition a year for four years. The rest of a student's tuition, which could be as high as $3,800, is paid by parents, who contribute $30 a month, and money raised from foundations and private businesses.
The idea for the partnership came about when Mr. Flanigan realized that it took more than the promise of a bright future to make students finish their education, Ms. Eapen said. More than a decade ago, he promised a class of sixth graders that if they finished high school, he would pay for their college education. Despite the incentive, many students dropped out of school.
The schools, he concluded, were failing the students. About the same time, Mr. Flanigan learned that Roman Catholic schools were more successful in keeping students in the classroom, so he shifted his focus and decided to encourage public school students to attend those private schools.
The partnership tries to match sponsors with students based on shared interests or experiences, sometimes a difficult goal because most of the students are black or Latino while 88 percent of the sponsors are non-Hispanic whites.
But most of the time, despite cultural and economic differences, a bond is forged. It happened to Sean and his sponsor, James C. Jurney, a 26-year-old who went to boarding school, lives at Central Park West and works at Morgan Stanley. Their bond is theater. Sean wants to be an actor; Mr. Jurney is interested in television and films.
"We go to the theater." Mr. Jurney said. "we talk. He tells me about his girlfriends. I'm his big brother. He's a good kid."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 27.74 Points, Aided by Oil Stocks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as heightened tensions in the Middle East drove up the price of crude oil and the shares of oil companies like Exxon and Texaco.
The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 43 points during the day and within 11 points of its closing high, closed at 5,754.92, up 27.74 points. The Dow, which includes four oil-related companies among its 30 blue-chip issues, is up 12.5 percent this year, a far stronger gain than the 8.4 percent increase on the broader-based Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
 "The Dow has clearly been leading the S.& P., and oil is heavily weighted in that average," said Dirk van Dijk, chief investment strategist at Dean Investment Associates, which manages $4 billion.
The S.& P. 500 jumped 3.47 points, to 667.28, lifted by energy, health care and bank shares. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 4.52 points, to 1,153.95.
Oil-related stocks, which accounted for 15 points of the gain in the Dow, rose as investors expected that higher prices for crude oil would translate into profit gains.
Texaco gained 1 7/8 a share, to 94 5/8. Exxon rose 1 1/2, to 84 7/8; Chevron climbed 1 1/8, to 61 1/2, and Du Pont, which owns Conoco, rose 7/8, to 85 1/4. Amoco jumped 3/4 a share, to 70 3/8, and Mobil rose 1 7/8, to 118 3/8.
The Pentagon confirmed that Iraq had launched a missile at two American jet fighters, missing both targets. The United States moved more warplanes into the region yesterday, raising concern that escalating military activities in the region could disrupt the shipment of oil.
Higher prices for crude oil were also expected to benefit oil drillers, as the potential gains from costly new exploration increased. Reading & Bates jumped 1 1/4 a share, to 26 3/4; Global Marine climbed 5/8, to 16 1/8, and Halliburton, a provider of oil services, rose 1 1/2, to 55 7/8.
Motorola, the day's most actively traded stock, sank 1 3/8, to 49 1/4, after warning that slow chip sales and a price slump could result in disappointing earnings for a second straight quarter.
But other chip shares shrugged off Motorola's woes, focusing instead on a report on semiconductor sales, released late on Tuesday, which suggested that orders had rebounded in August. The book-to-bill ratio, which measures new orders for chips in North America against deliveries, rose to 0.90 from 0.86 in July.
Intel, the largest chip maker, rose 3/4 a share, to 85; Micron Technology climbed 1/2, to 21 1/2, and Xilinx jumped 1 5/8, to 32 1/4.
United Healthcare rose 1 1/2, to 40 1/8, after being named the leader of three companies picked to negotiate to provide nearly $4 billion in insurance services to the American Association of Retired Persons. The other two companies are the ITT Hartford Group, which rose 1 1/8, to 54 1/8, and Metropolitan Life Insurance, which is closely held.
Those companies' new business came at the expense of Prudential Insurance, whose exclusive contract with the association made up about 10 percent of Prudential's revenue. Prudential, which, like Met Life, is owned by its policyholders, said it would cut 3,500 jobs in the wake of losing the business.
Itron slumped 8 a share, to 21, after it surprised investors by saying that it expects to report a loss in the third quarter because utilities are ordering fewer of its electronic meter readers.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investment Agency Is Rebuffed in House Vote

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The House dealt a sharp blow today to a Federal agency that provides insurance and loan guarantees to American companies that invest in developing nations.
By a vote of 260 to 157, the House rejected a bill to renew the lending and insuring authority of the agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The agency's current authorization expires Sept. 30. 
 If the agency's authority is not renewed by then, OPIC will still be able to service its existing portfolio, but it will not be allowed to write any new insurance policies or underwrite new investments. OPIC's most strident critics say they are not ruling out a last-minute compromise, but they also say it is unclear what happens next.
"This was totally unexpected," said Representative John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, who is head of the House Budget Committee and a leading OPIC critic. "I can't tell you how it gets resolved."
OPIC's chief executive, Ruth R. Harkin, said she regretted the outcome, but she promised that "we will continue to work with Congress on a measure that will preserve OPIC's ability to create American jobs and U.S. exports."
At issue is how much OPIC should grow, if it should grow at all. Today's surprisingly decisive vote will give the agency's critics great leverage over its future.
OPIC supporters, including many of the nation's top corporations and most powerful labor unions, sought to extend the agency's authority by five years, expand its financing authority to $20 billion from $9 billion, and raise its insurance ceilings to $25 billion from $13 billion.
Proponents say that OPIC pays for itself with fees and premiums -- it is expected to bring in $189 million a year to the Treasury Department -- and that it helps United States exports, creates jobs here and promotes the nation's foreign policy goals in places like Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America.
But OPIC supporters badly underestimated the influence and anger of an unlikely coalition of critics that included budget-cutting conservatives like Mr. Kasich and the House's only independent, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont.
These critics argued that OPIC practiced "corporate welfare" by underwriting the third world investments of such large corporations as Citicorp, the Union Carbide Corporation and the Ford Motor Company. Critics have also contended that private insurers can protect American companies from political risk overseas more efficiently than a Federal agency can.
"With the destabilizing effects of corporate downsizing on American workers and their families, we should not be providing incentives for America's corporate giants to invest abroad," Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois, said in a lively floor debate Tuesday.
Opponents criticized as too risky several OPIC projects, including a soft-drink bottling company in Poland, a travel agency in Armenia, a shrimp farm in Ecuador and a camel-hair processing plant in Mongolia.
Proponents countered that without OPIC, American companies would cede growing markets in developing countries to foreign competitors, a loss that would hurt American exports and undermine Washington's foreign policy. In OPIC's 25-year history, its risk-insurance program has had to pay only 1 percent in claims.
OPIC coverage has become a staple for multinational corporations investing abroad, and last year the agency sold policies covering $8.6 billion in investments.
"This bill will support billions of dollars of U.S. exports and the creation of thousands of jobs at minimal cost to the taxpayer," said Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York, who heads the House International Relations Committee.
Reflecting the shortage of time for this Congress, the sponsors of the bill offered it under an expedited procedure that suspends normal House rules but requires two-thirds approval of all those voting.
In today's vote, 173 Republicans, 86 Democrats and one independent voted to reject the extension; 53 Republicans and 104 Democrats voted in favor of the bill.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Draws on a Personal Victory to Assure His G.O.P. Colleagues of Political Victory

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Bob Dole returned to Capitol Hill today to reassure those he called "the faint-hearted" that he had the determination to raise himself from the political near-dead because he had once raised himself from the literal near-dead.
Addressing about 120 of his former House and Senate colleagues, Mr. Dole spoke of his 39-month recuperation from paralyzing combat wounds in World War II. He read a letter written in 1945 to his father by an official at the Army hospital in Michigan where Lieut. Bob Dole lay motionless. 
 "At the present time," the official wrote, "it would appear that his recovery is somewhat questionable."
Mr. Dole fought back to become the longest-serving Republican majority leader in Senate history and is now one election away from either becoming President or closing out his life in politics.
Mr. Dole, who is trailing President Clinton by double-digits in the national polls, contended today that he had emerged from "tough spots" before and would do so again this Election Day.
"I want to say to the fainthearted people in this audience -- though there are probably not very many -- don't worry about this election," he said. "We're going to win, we're going to win, we're going to win."
There was also a pragmatic edge to the message from this campaign warhorse, who has been winning elections for nearly half a century. Mr. Dole acknowledged up front that his coattails, if any, might be very short indeed.
"Wherever we can help -- or if we can't help, you can tell us that -- but wherever we can help, we're going to be there," he said.
And he opened a small window onto his view of his responsibility at the top of a flagging ticket, saying that his duty was to remain optimistic.
"Each of us have been in close races, tough races," he said. "The polls go up and down, and people get discouraged. But the candidate can never get discouraged. The candidate has to be optimistic."
Reprising a phrase from his acceptance speech last month at the Republican National Convention in San Diego, he said, "I'm the most optimistic man in America."
Mr. Dole was greeted warmly by the Republican senators and House members who had responded to the campaign's urgent fax message, sent with only one day's notice, to turn out this morning for a display of unity with the top of the party ticket.
Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, hailed Mr. Dole and his running mate, Jack Kemp. Mr. Lott led the cheerleading, telling Mr. Dole that it was not until he and other Republicans dined with Mr. Dole last Saturday that he realized "there was an aura around Bob."
But in interviews after Mr. Dole's speech today, some of those in attendance expressed concern about the Dole campaign and how to mesh their own campaigns with it.
"I'm assuming our basic message is correct," said Representative Mark E. Souder, a freshman from Indiana, "but the messenger is not connecting."
Mr. Souder said today's event was staged for the media because the Dole campaign and the Republican National Committee were "concerned that Congressional candidates are drifting into independence."
"They know we see the polls," Mr. Souder said.
Mr. Dole smiled through it all, and later on his plane he shrugged off questions about Republicans being worried that he might drag them down in November.
"They're all my friends, you know," he said. "I've lived there for a long time. I didn't see any anxious people there."
As Mr. Dole headed back to the campaign trail after his speech, he found more bad news.
He landed first in Connecticut, where a new state poll by the University of Connecticut and The Hartford Courant showed him trailing Mr. Clinton by 29 points. In neighboring Massachusetts, a new poll by The Boston Globe put Mr. Clinton ahead by 19 points.
In Delaware, where Mr. Dole was defeated in the Presidential primary by Steve Forbes, it was Mr. Forbes was led Mr. Dole's "Listening to America" session today.
Mr. Forbes, who is now an economic adviser to the Dole campaign, said at the outset that he would take all of the questions before Mr. Dole would answer. Several in the audience asked questions, most of which Mr. Forbes answered while Mr. Dole stood to the side. At one point, when Mr. Forbes told one questioner, "Bob will be responding later," Mr. Dole interjected, "Not much later."
After 33 minutes, Mr. Forbes finally yielded the floor to Mr. Dole, who began by referring twice to the fact that by now, it was "dinner time."

HEADLINE: A Backlash-and-Forth Smog War;
Radical Swings in Clean Air Plan in Los Angeles Area

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Flash back to 1992, when hundreds of business executives and union officials joined in a candlelight vigil on the steps of Southern California's pollution-control agency to protest air-quality standards that they said were strangling the economy and killing jobs. Their rare show of unity helped prod the agency to roll back some of the nation's strictest environmental regulations.
Now fast-forward to the hot, smoggy summer of 1996. The Los Angeles area still has the foulest air in the United States. Yet, the once-feared South Coast Air Quality Management District is now bending over backward to be business's best friend, with its "green carpet service" to help companies get permits more quickly and its program to educate violators of the laws instead of fining them. And even though the agency's budget has been cut to $93 million from $113 million four years ago, Jon D. Mikels, its chairman, wants to cut the staff in half over the next decade and eliminate permits required of most small businesses. 
 If it seems to be too good to be true for California industry, it probably is. For, just as a backlash built up in the early 1990's against the state's all-out war on smog, today, a growing chorus of critics is sounding the alarm about the dangers of retreating too far. Last month, leading opponents of the policy change staged a protest that matched the symbolism of the 1992 business-labor march. In response to proposals in the agency's latest long-range plan for a further watering down of air-pollution rules, nine of the 11 members of its scientific advisory panel resigned en masse.
"They've been losing their commitment to meeting air-quality standards," declared Jane Hall, an economist who had served on the panel for 10 years. "It's a pattern that's been building up for the past 18 months to two years, and then this proposed plan was the straw that broke the camel's back. We weren't just going to watch that happen."
The environmental debate here is more than just a local dispute over industrial emissions. California and Los Angeles in particular have long been models for air-quality regulations in other states. For instance, when California adopted its tough rules mandating that auto makers put large numbers of electric vehicles, or "zero emission vehicles," in showrooms, several states adopted similar rules -- and are now expected to follow California's subsequent decision to relax those restrictions.
Similarly, California's proposed rules cutting emissions from architectural coatings and certain solvents are likely to influence regulatory decision making in other states -- and, ultimately, on the kinds of products that reach consumers.
More broadly, the same forces that have been lobbying environmental officials in Southern California are active across the country. As governments struggle to achieve the often incompatible goals of protecting the environment and promoting economic growth, similar skirmishes are bound to break out elsewhere.
In California, the policy battle is far from decided. But in the view of James M. Lents, the air quality district's executive director, the tide may be turning in favor of the environmental purists. "Suddenly, the business climate is getting good again," Mr. Lents said. "People are looking out the window, and the air quality is awful. And they're saying, 'We wanted things easier, but we didn't mean stop cleaning up the air.' We're starting a new cycle."
Even business interests are showing a new environmental consciousness. Robert Wyman, a lawyer who helped lead the charge by major corporations like Unocal, Chevron, Hughes Aircraft and Rockwell to ease the regulations a few years ago, said he thought the scientific advisory council might have been justified in its action. "I think the resignations caught people by surprise, but they were probably right," Mr. Wyman said. "This group of experts had been underutilized."
And Nader Monsour, head of environmental affairs at Southern California Edison, a big utility company, acknowledged that further progress must be made and that some price must be borne. "The air quality has improved, but it really has to improve a lot more; we understand that," he said.
To a large extent, business's concerns are based on practical considerations. The Los Angeles basin -- a region of 13 million people in Riverside, San Bernardino, Los Angeles and Orange counties -- is finding it increasingly difficult to attract companies and good jobs at its eastern end because of heavy pollution, creating fears that the area is doomed to a substandard quality of life.
"The higher paying jobs are going elsewhere because of the air out here," complained Ron Loveridge, the Mayor of the city of Riverside and a member of the agency's board. "The mid- to higher-paying jobs are a real problem for us."
Mainstream environmental groups, emboldened by the panel's mass defection, are warning that the agency's probusiness tilt is threatening the region's long-term environmental health. "For two decades this district was moving forward," said Gail Ruderman Feuer, a senior lawyer here with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Now we're moving in the opposite direction. It's not subtle."
Some local newspapers have also weighed in with editorials questioning the agency's course. The mass resignation "strikes a blow directly to that agency's credibility," said The Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, a newspaper based in Ontario, 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. "The clear, though unstated, implication is that political pressure, not air quality needs, shaped the new plan. That's a question of integrity."
All the criticism seems to be giving the largely pro-business environmental agency's board second thoughts. Several members have appointed an ad hoc panel of specialists to re-examine the new long-term plan.
But the opponents of regulation are, if anything, more vocal than ever. Mike Antonovich, a pro-business Los Angeles County Supervisor who sits on the agency's board, described the departing advisory panel members -- all highly regarded specialists in areas like health care and engineering -- as extremists bent on "shutting down our economy," and he welcomed their resignations as a "breath of fresh air." And Curt Pringle, the conservative Republican Speaker of the State Assembly, has denounced the agency as "the No. 1 job-killing machine in this state" and announced his desire to dismantle it.
Environmentalists complain that the agency has already lost its teeth. It is in the process of reducing the number of stations monitoring air quality to 22 from 35. It has also imposed a hiring freeze, and left the job of chief prosecutor, responsible for finding and citing offenders, vacant since 1991. The number of inspections of businesses has declined to about one-third their level six years ago. Rules on car pooling have been relaxed and other regulations that would have restricted the number of cars entering big shopping centers, theme parks and the like were dropped. Indeed, the burden of cleaning up the air still falls heaviest on industry rather than motorists, even though autos produce most of the harmful emissions.
The long-term air-quality plan unveiled last month strikes many as a boon for business. The plan eliminates 36 regulations proposed in its 1994 plan, cutting the cost to business by more than two-thirds, to $1.7 billion a year from $5.4 billion, by the agency's estimate.
One reason for the reduction is a key change the district's technical experts made in their computer models for estimating future emission levels. In the 1994 plan, they had used as the base for their projections a particularly smoggy day in 1985; in the new plan they changed to a less choking day in 1987.
Mr. Lents, the agency's executive officer, acknowledged that the decision had a big impact on policy-making. "I probably had an intuitive sense that it would come out a little bit easier if we did that," he said.
That computing change was particularly disturbing for Akula Venkatram, one of the scientific advisers who resigned. Mr. Venkatram, an expert on computer modeling at the University of California at Riverside, said: "If it's a new kind of model, that's important, and it should not be presented without extensive peer review, which they never did. I never saw it. Without a review, I'm skeptical."
Among the results of this and other changes in the computer models was a determination that emissions levels did not have to be reduced as much as had been previously estimated. Mr. Lents denied, however, that the changes had been influenced by politics or businesses. He said they simply reflected better science and more accurate measurements.
For all the soul-searching going on, Southern California still has some of the toughest air-pollution standards in the country. The air quality management district enforces three volumes of regulations that cover everything from the grittiest industrial smokestacks to charcoal broilers and printing shops. Restriction on emissions from paints and other kinds of industrial coatings are so strict that McDonnell Douglas must ship some of the commercial jets that it builds at Long Beach, Calif., to Arizona to be painted.
As a result, the quality of the air is improving, albeit from a dismal previous state. The Los Angeles basin failed to meet Federal ozone standards on a total of 98 days last year, a poor record but better than the 158 days that it fell short a decade ago.
Emissions still must be cut by another 60 percent -- at a time when the population is expanding rapidly -- to meet minimum Federal standards by 2010. And the Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that some 8,000 Southern Californians a year die early deaths because of the poor air quality.
To visit the area is to see why. Mr. Lents, the head of the air-pollution control agency, looked at the pall outside his office window in Diamond Bar, a suburb in the heart of the smog belt. He reflected on the ups and downs in the regulatory environment and then observed of the wonderful, craggy but barely visible shapes in the distance: "Many times, I can't even see the outlines of those mountains."

 In 1974, lead-free gasoline was introduced in California, and in 1975 the first catalytic converters were installed in new cars and light trucks. Those and subsequent measures helped push down ozone levels substantially, but some anti-smog rules were eased in the 1990's in response to a sharp economic decline and a loss of jobs.

THE STATES AND THE ISSUES

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

 BODY:

California
Democrats Like Look of House Races
Like the outcome of the Presidential race, control of Congress depends in a big way on what happens in California, home to one of every eight members of the House. The Democrats hold an edge of only 27 to 25 in California's 52 House seats, and seldom have so many of those seats been in play this late in the campaign. 
 Democrats think they can pick up half a dozen seats, which would get them nearly a third of the way toward regaining control of the House. Republicans say the Democrats are California dreaming. But the Republicans' own best scenario, a gain of three seats, points to an optimism gap.
Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to campaign today in the 22d Congressional District, where the Democrat, Walter H. Capps, a professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, is in a tough rematch with Representative Andrea Seastrand, a freshman Republican. The race is considered a good barometer of feelings toward the first Republican Congress in 40 years.
Another tight race is in the 46th District, where the seat has been held for the last 12 years by Representative Robert K. Dornan, the Republican firebrand who ran for President this year. Mr. Dornan, behind in fund raising, says this may be the toughest race of his career.
Mr. Dornan has called on an old Hollywood pal, Charlton Heston, to help him campaign. But Democrats think they have the edge, in part because their nominee, Loretta Sanchez, a financial adviser, more closely matches the demographics of a district that is now 50 percent Hispanic.
Those are only two of the up-for-grabs races in a state where, political strategists say, the environment is much more of an issue than in other places and where the economy has recovered, briskly, and geologic misfortunes are in the rear-view mirror, at least for the moment.
The latest statewide party preference poll gave Democrats an edge of nearly 10 points, and Bob Dole is 22 points behind in a week-old California Field poll. "The only reason Dole is spending money here is because the Republicans are now worried about losing so many Congressional seats," said Julie Buckner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Party in California.
Republicans are playing down social issues and playing up tax relief and regulatory reform. They remain upbeat, vowing not to lose a single California seat on the way to what Representative Bill Paxon of New York, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, says will be the first re-election of a Republican House majority in 70 years.
 
Gay Candidates
One Barometer Of Changing Times
Not so long ago, an openly gay candidate running for office in the Bible Belt or any rural area could expect to end up as political road kill. Times may be changing.
In Oklahoma, the Democrats have nominated Paul Barby, a wealthy oilman, rancher and member of the Board of Regents of Oklahoma Colleges, to face Frank D. Lucas, the incumbent Republican in the Sixth Congressional District. Just before Mr. Barby announced his candidacy, he told Democrats by letter that he is a homosexual.
The district is largely rural, taking up the western half of the state, and is full of socially conservative Southern Baptists. But, to the surprise of many of Mr. Barby's supporters, no one has yet made an issue of his sexual orientation. And Mr. Lucas says he will not make any fuss over it.
"Paul Barby has been campaigning all over the district," said Keith Smith, the Barby campaign manager, "and the worst thing that people have said to him is that they are going to vote for him but keep it secret."
Compare the current reaction with that of 1978, when David L. Boren of Oklahoma first ran for the Senate. After his opponent had brought up rumors, Mr. Boren felt compelled to swear on a Bible that he was heterosexual.
In Arizona, meanwhile, there has been no great talk-radio clamor or stump-speech vitriol directed at a six-term Congressman, Jim Kolbe, since he acknowledged a few weeks ago that he is homosexual. Mr. Kolbe, a Republican from the Tucson area, just won renomination with 70 percent of the vote and now has a wide lead in general-election polls.
"In terms of harm, I think it's really negligible," said one Republican official, Michael Hellon, a Tucson businessman. Campaign money, with notes of congratulations for Mr. Kolbe's acknowledgment, has come in, and his decision spurred another Arizona officeholder, Neil Giuliano, the Republican Mayor of Tempe, to announce late last month that he too is gay.
"Thirty or forty years ago if you were divorced, that was a huge issue," Mr. Hellon said. "Now that's not even worth mentioning from an electoral context. I think that is where we are headed on the gay issue."
 
Indiana
Struggling Candidate Blames Dole
Indiana, long known for college basketball and Republican political stripes, appears to be going through a bit of an identity crisis. It's too early to be talking about the fate of Hoosier hoops, but Republicans are in near-crisis mode.
A new Indianapolis Star poll of 1,061 registered voters shows Frank O'Bannon, a Democrat, leading for the first time in the race for governor against Stephen Goldsmith. Mr. Goldsmith, the Republican Mayor of Indianapolis, blames the Dole campaign, saying it has dragged the party down in the state.
"I'm not getting the lift that normally a Republican in a Presidential election year would get," Mr. Goldsmith told The Star. "My numbers are obviously repressed by Dole."
Republicans carried Indiana by wide margins in the last four Presidential elections, but Bob Dole is behind this year. The Star poll had President Clinton leading by 38 percent to 32 percent. TIMOTHY EGAN

HEADLINE: Veto of 'Prevailing Wage' Bill Is Overridden by City Council

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Drawing a clear distinction between its labor and business philosophies and those of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the City Council yesterday voted overwhelmingly to override the Mayor's veto of a bill that would require some city contractors to pay their workers more than double the minimum wage.
The vote, 42 to 5, was only the fifth time the Council has overridden a veto by the Mayor, and it illustrated how much more susceptible to union influence the majority Democratic Council is than the Republican Mayor. Democrats hold 45 of the 51 Council seats. Although the law does not necessarily affect union workers, it was a coalition of nearly 100 labor unions that first urged the Council to adopt the higher minimum wages. 
 The Council's action makes New York one of the first major cities to enact a "living wage" or "prevailing wage" law requiring city contractors to pay workers the standard wage that private-sector workers receive.
When Mr. Giuliani vetoed the bill last month, he contended that it would raise the city's costs and create unnecessary obstacles for companies that want to do business with the city. He has vowed to sue the Council to strike down the law, saying it is inconsistent with the city's general contracting process.
"The Mayor believes this legislation is seriously flawed," said Jack Deacy, a mayoral spokesman. "And he has asked the Corporation Counsel to explore possible legal options for the city."
Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, a Manhattan Democrat and one of the law's prime sponsors, said: "This shows a basic philosophical difference between the Council and the Mayor. We believe that if you prime the pump and put money in at the bottom, it will work its way up into the economy, and he believes in the Republican trickle-down theory."
Many Council members said they hoped that the law, which affects contractors in security, cleaning, food services and temporary office work, would eventually be expanded to cover all city contractors.
Under the law, the required wage for the four industries will be determined by the City Comptroller. But Council officials estimated that minimum wages would be set at $7.25 an hour for unarmed security guards, $9 an hour for food workers, $11.25 an hour for temporary office workers and $12 an hour for janitors. The Federal minimum wage is now $4.25 and will rise to $4.75 next month and $5.15 next September.
Council officials have said that the law would affect only about 3,500 workers and cost the city about $16 million more a year. But the Mayor has said that broadening the law to cover all contractors could add as much as $500 million to the $4 billion the city spends each year on service contracts.

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Trades Found to Cost Institutions More

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
As criticism mounted against the Nasdaq Stock Market in recent years, the cry was that individual investors had gotten a raw deal there compared with the way they were treated on the stock exchanges. But many assumed that institutional investors, who were better able to negotiate deals and more savvy about trading rules, could do equally well on any market.
Now studies are emerging that challenge that conclusion. They argue that the costs of trading on Nasdaq -- including the market impact of block trades -- are substantially higher than on stock exchanges. 
 It is not clear to what extent that situation is likely to be altered by the reforms now being made at Nasdaq, though those reforms should help. To the extent that the studies are persuasive to institutional investors, they might put pressure on companies to move their listings from Nasdaq to the New York or American Stock Exchanges.
One study, to be published in the Journal of Financial Economics, compares the liquidity of the Nasdaq market with that of the New York Stock Exchange and concludes that the Big Board is much more able to handle block trades -- trades of more than 10,000 shares -- either without affecting the price of the stock, or with a smaller effect.
The study, by Chris Muscarella of Pennsylvania State University and Michele LaPlante of Santa Clara University, examined block trades of the 10 largest Nasdaq issues and compared them with similar issues on the New York exchange. It found that the average block trade on the Big Board caused the price to move about 0.18 percent, compared with 0.32 percent on the Nasdaq.
Such a movement is not large. The difference, or 14-hundredths of a percentage point, would indicate that it costs an institution on average about $140 more to place a $100,000 trade on a large Nasdaq stock than it does on a similar Big Board issue. But over the course of many trades, it could affect fund performance.
The other study was financed by the American Stock Exchange, which will formally release it today as part of a marketing effort aimed at wooing companies to list.
That study was done by the Plexus Group, a consultant to institutional investors that was able to use actual trading records from those clients. Based on 1995 trading, Plexus concluded that all the costs of enacting trades for those institutions -- including commissions and market impact -- came to 1.0 percent for Nasdaq stocks, compared with 0.55 percent for trades on the New York exchange and 0.6 percent for trades on the Amex.
The Big Board and the Amex are auction markets, in which all orders come together on a trading floor, with one specialist overseeing trading in each stock. In contrast, Nasdaq is a dealer market, with many competing market makers. It has been argued that those competing market makers effectively provided greater liquidity than did one specialist, so that the real cost of trading for institutions in Nasdaq stocks might be lower. But the studies both conclude that is not the case.
The differing figures for costs reflect differences in the studies. The first used only very large, liquid stocks, and was for 1990 trading. The second, based on 1995 trading, analyzed trades of all sizes. In addition, the Plexus study included commission charges, which were not considered in the academic study.
Dean Furbush, the chief economist of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market, noted that there had been numerous studies comparing the various stock markets. "The weight of the evidence shows me clearly that Nasdaq is a competitive stock market for institutional orders," he said.
For the Amex, a conclusion that it is a better trading place than Nasdaq is especially welcome. It is interested in luring a far larger number of Nasdaq companies than is the Big Board, which focuses mainly on the larger companies that trade on Nasdaq. The Plexus study will provide the Amex with ammunition.
The Nasdaq reforms, including some that are already in place and some that will be phased in during 1997, are expected to narrow the spread between the bid price -- the price at which market makers will buy shares -- and the asked price -- the price at which they will sell them. While institutions have often been able to get within the Nasdaq spreads anyway, partly through using electronic trading systems, the reforms could help them to some extent, and thus narrow the exchanges' advantages as shown in the studies.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Case Against a Rate Rise Attracts a Respectable Crowd

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
With unemployment falling to just 5.1 percent and the pace of economic growth this year easily outstripping the sustainable long-term growth rate, the Federal Reserve looks to be on the verge of stepping on the brakes. "The only question left is how much the Fed will raise interest rates," said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch.
What is missing from the debate, though, is the case for letting the good times roll -- for holding a steady course to see whether the economy can accommodate rapid growth a while longer. And while this remains an outsider's view, it is coming from some very respectable centrist economists. "This is an excellent time to find out how much lower we can push unemployment" without kicking up inflation, argued Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University and a leading researcher on the relationship between employment and prices. 
 Even some experts on Wall Street are starting to take these academic arguments more seriously. "Give growth a chance," Christopher A. Low, senior economist at HSBC Markets in New York, wrote in a recent newsletter, contending that the Federal Reserve should not automatically treat a low unemployment rate as a signal that inflation is about to surge. This view cuts across traditional political lines, attracting support from supply-siders on the right to populists in Congress who have long been suspicious of the Federal Reserve.
Still, most analysts on Wall Street are predicting the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, most likely by a quarter percentage point, at the Sept. 24 meeting of its Open Market Committee. After all, unemployment has apparently drifted below the "natural rate" that computer simulations of the 1970's and 1980's suggested was compatible with a stable level of inflation.
What's more, evidence of incipient cost pressures can now be found in the numbers: "The half-percent increase in wages in August was disturbing," Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said. The Federal Reserve itself, in a report yesterday, cited rising wage pressures even as overall inflation remained tame. [Page D1.]
So if the Federal Reserve raises short-term rates, will that push the economy into recession? As long as the move is modest, probably not. While demand may be slowing without assistance from the Federal Reserve -- retail sales are nothing to write home about -- even the Fed's most dovish policy makers discount this prospect. Indeed, most analysts say the only remaining obstacle to an increase in short rates is the concern of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that this close to the election an increase would be perceived as partisan.
But the more hawkish Fed officials want to go further. Those who perceive 3 percent inflation as a greater risk to the economy and society than 5 percent unemployment see a chance here to seize the moment. They take their ideology from those economists who believe that even current low rates of inflation harm the economy by raising effective tax rates on risky investments.
A couple of turns of the interest-rate screw, they figure, would buy some permanent progress on the inflation front. That, in turn, would lower long-term interest rates, which are now more than a full percentage point higher than the recent nadir at the end of 1995, when rates were slightly less than 6 percent. That, they argue, would ultimately stimulate investment.
Hence the current division within the Federal Reserve, to put it in political terms, is between the neoliberal pragmatists inclined toward a token interest-rate increase and the zero-inflation zealots who see a chance to score with a decisive increase of a half-point.
Where does that leave opponents of any increase in interest rates? Far from the levers of power, but well within the economics establishment. There has long been anecdotal evidence that the sustainable rate of unemployment ought to be falling: unions are weak, foreign competition is strong, corporate downsizing is every worker's nightmare. The number of work stoppages, for example, has fallen from nearly 400 affecting 2.5 million workers in 1970 to just 31 last year involving a mere 192,000 workers.
Now, according to William D. Nordhaus of Yale University, there is statistical evidence to buttress the anecdotes. A labor market with 5 percent unemployment today, he argues, behaves much like a labor market in the 1980's with unemployment of 6 percent to 6.5 percent.
This is a tantalizing prospect because there are still millions of people who want full-time jobs who have either dropped out of the official labor force or been forced to accept part-time work. In addition to the roughly seven million people counted as unemployed, more than four million are working part-time because they say it is the best they can get and about two million "discouraged" workers say they gave up looking because the possibilities seemed so bleak.
Mr. Gordon, too, reckons that the sustainable unemployment rate has been falling. This "manna from heaven," he says, explains why the Federal Reserve has thus far been able to wink at relatively low unemployment rates that would have been inflationary in 1989. Today, he estimates, 5.2 percent unemployment -- close to the current rate -- will not add to inflationary pressure.
With economic growth ebbing, but still strong enough to absorb more workers than are entering the labor force, Mr. Nordhaus sees the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate decision as "a tough call." Mr. Gordon, by contrast, takes a position that is effectively the mirror image of the anti-inflation hawks.
Inflation is so low today, he argues, that it would cost little to find out how many more jobs can be created without causing inflationary wage increases. All the evidence, he says, suggests that inflationary expectations are incorporated very slowly into markets. If the Federal Reserve overshoots by allowing unemployment to fall to less than the sustainable rate, the price would be just a few tenths of a percent higher inflation before the error is identified. Mr. Nordhaus added -- in direct contradiction to the zero-inflation crowd -- that "there is no evidence from other countries' experience that inflation below 10 percent has much effect on long-term growth prospects."
Indeed, in an article published last month in "The Brookings Papers on Economic Activity," the economists George A. Akerlof, William T. Dickens and George L. Perry suggest that very low inflation may actually create wage rigidity that impairs economic efficiency. In a well-functioning economy, relative wages have to change between occupations and regions in accord with changing supply and demand. But workers, who may accept eroding real wages as prices outpace their income, will bitterly resist actual cuts in their nominal pay.
And with inflation of less than 3 percent, the argument goes, it becomes difficult to match real wages to market conditions.
The catch to the test-the-waters view, suggests Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, is that the Federal Reserve would pounce on the first clear sign that it had pushed unemployment below the sustainable rate, increasing rates so quickly that it would make a recession almost inevitable. While the Fed managed to slow the economy in 1994 without pushing the economy into recession, most experience -- including that as recent as 1990 -- shows just how difficult it is to manage a soft landing. And a recession, he argued, "would wipe out years and years of benefits" from taking a bigger whack at unemployment.
A variation on the theme goes like this. If the Federal Reserve does not raise short-term rates by at least a token amount, long-term interest rates will go up in response to lenders' fears that the Fed has lost its determination to contain inflation. Thus the perception that the Federal Reserve is no longer a dependable bulwark against rising prices could itself tip the economy into recession.
So the ultimate question remains: Is the Federal Reserve, casually assumed to be the most powerful agency in the Government, itself a prisoner of the opinion of the markets?

HEADLINE: Ross Perot's Soul Mate

 BODY:
Ross Perot's choice of Pat Choate as his running mate does little to increase his meager Presidential prospects. At least in theory, a Vice-Presidential candidate should be qualified to assume the Presidency. Both Al Gore and Jack Kemp meet that test. But "President Choate"? The words do not ring with plausibility. He was in fact the flinty Texan's fourth choice for the ticket, after three others with broader experience -- a former Senator and two members of the House -- said no.
Even so, Dr. Choate could well enliven the campaign, especially the Presidential debates scheduled for this fall -- assuming that he and Mr. Perot are invited to participate. The nonpartisan debate commission will deliver its judgment on that matter next week. Unlike Mr. Perot's last running mate, the dignified but hopelessly overmatched Adm. James Stockdale, Dr. Choate is the author of six books and a smooth speaker with a string of talk-show credentials. 
 He is especially passionate on two issues that the major candidates are either ignoring or ducking. These issues are, first, the threat to American jobs from multinational corporations and America's trading partners, and second, the destructive influence of big money in Washington.
On both subjects Ross Perot has found himself not only a running mate but a soul mate. Like Mr. Perot, Dr. Choate is an economic nationalist, wary of foreign commercial entanglements, and in 1993 the two men collaborated on a 74-page manifesto called "Save Your Job, Save Our Country," which asserted that the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico would threaten six million American workers. The jobs-vs.-free-trade issue all but vanished when Patrick Buchanan disappeared. With Dr. Choate on board, Mr. Perot is sure to revive it.
Like Mr. Perot, Dr. Choate is eager to confront President Clinton and Bob Dole for their reluctance to address Washington's money-driven political culture -- the influence of lobbyists and big campaign contributors.
In 1990 Dr. Choate combined these two interests in a controversial book, "Agents of Influence," an attack on foreign attempts to manipulate American policy. He was especially rough on former Federal officials who had swung through the "revolving door" and become well-paid lobbyists, particularly for Japan.
The book's suggestion that these lobbyists, whom he named, were behaving unpatriotically earned him many enemies. Its xenophobic tone, combined with his later exaggerations about the dangers of Nafta, also damaged his reputation among economists who had once applauded his earlier and less-fevered writings on the need to shore up America's competitiveness by rebuilding its economic infrastructure.
On balance, it is hard to see what value Mr. Perot has added to his ticket. Dr. Choate's experience is narrow, his name recognition negligible. The most that can be said is that he may sharpen positions Mr. Perot already holds dear. In political and policy terms, he adds no obvious new dimension.

HEADLINE: Fed Report Finds Growth Still Modest

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Wages are rising as the economy across most of the nation continues to grow at a moderate pace, but there is little evidence yet of inflation taking root, the Federal Reserve Board reported today.
The report, based on a survey of businesses by the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, was the latest to suggest that the economy remained finely balanced between a sustainable expansion and the onset of inflation. 
 Although many economists still believe the Federal Reserve will nudge up interest rates when its policy-making body meets on Sept. 24, they said today's report did not provide the Fed with the unambiguous case for tightening monetary policy that it would like to have before raising rates, especially in the midst of a Presidential campaign.
Signs of inflation "were varied and generally inconclusive, although there appears to be greater upward pressure on wages than on prices," the Fed report said. "Business activity in most districts is reported to be good and expanding moderately."
Fed officials have indicated over the last week that while they are on heightened inflation alert, they are still uncertain whether the economy is slowing fast enough from its torrid pace in the first half to avert a destabilizing wage-price spiral.
Both inside and outside the Fed, those economists who think the economy will keep growing at a strong pace see a substantial risk of inflation. Those who see the economy slowing, view inflation as less of a threat despite the low 5.1 percent unemployment rate and upward pressure on wages.
After falling early in the day on fears that the Fed report, known as the beige book, would show rising inflationary pressures, the bond market bounced back when the report was made public, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ending the day about unchanged, at 7.11 percent.
The Fed's stance since July has been to lean toward a tightening, and inflation hawks on the Fed's policy-making body have been agitating for a rate increase for several months, arguing that the time to move is before inflation infects the economy. Many economists think the Fed is likely to raise its Federal funds target rate by a quarter-point this month, to 5.5 percent. A rate increase would reverse a series of three cuts that began 14 months ago. The Fed's last move was to cut the Federal funds rate by a quarter-point on Jan. 31.
"We continue to pick up early-warning signs on the inflation front coming through loud and clear in labor market conditions and rising wages," said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, who forecasts a continued strong growth rate of 3 percent for the second half. "A failure to move at this juncture, with the unemployment rate as low as it is, and with the economy growing well in excess of the inflation-stable growth rate, would really be irresponsible on the Fed's part."
The beige book is based on anecdotal reports from businesses replying to inquiries from researchers at the Federal Reserve Banks.
"Reports of substantial price increases were notably absent" from many areas of the country, the Fed said. In the regions around New York, Boston, Cleveland and Kansas City, consumer prices were reported to be stable or increasing only slightly. There were some price increases in industrial commodities, but they tended to be restricted to a few markets, the report said. Lumber prices, for example, were higher in the regions around Boston, Richmond, Dallas and Chicago.
"Wage gains have tended to outstrip price increases, however," the report said. In Boston, wage and salary increases were running at 2 to 4 percent, while in Cleveland the increase was 2 to 3 percent.
Companies normally try to pass on the cost of wage increases to consumers of their products through price increases. But intense competition has made it hard for companies to raise prices, forcing them to absorb higher wage rates by improving productivity or biting into their profits. The Clinton Administration's economists have been arguing that since corporate profits are robust, companies have plenty of leeway to absorb rising wages without spurring inflation. A number of outside economists dispute that contention.
The report showed few signs that the economy was cooling off as rapidly as the Fed had expected in July when it forecast a growth rate for the full year of 2.6 percent. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent rate in the first half, and would have to slow to a rate of 1.8 percent in the second half to match the Fed's forecast.
Today's report said the economy was expanding "moderately" in most places, with two exceptions being California and the Far West, where growth was characterized as strong, and in the St. Louis region, where it "continued to moderate slightly."

 A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the quarterly beige book report issued yesterday by the Fed.
 
Boston -- Factories and personnel-supply firms reported solid growth. Retailers said sales were stronger than expected in August.
 
New York -- No signs of increased prices or wages. Retail sales rebounded. Real estate strengthened. Demand lowered for commercial loans.
 
Philadelphia -- Factories reported increases in orders and shipments. Auto dealers saw steady sales.
 
Richmond -- Tight labor markets, rising wages and higher consumer prices reported. Factories rebounded.
 
Atlanta -- Merchants were reported having positive outlooks for the rest of the year, but manufacturers were less optimistic. Rents increased.
 
St. Louis -- Tight labor markets remained a concern for many businesses. Retailers reported improved sales from a year earlier.
 
Kansas City -- Factories and construction showed signs of slowing from the brisk pace of previous months. Rising wages were reported.
 
Dallas -- Scattered rising prices and labor costs were reported. Weakness in housing was offset by increases in commercial construction spending. The energy industry continued to gain momentum.
 
San Francisco -- Grocery prices increased noticeably. Labor shortages and rising wages were also reported. Manufacturing was robust but tempered by weakness in the computer chip industry.
 
Minneapolis -- Commodity prices fell. Intermediate and final goods prices were stable. Construction, oil and mining activity were strong.
 
Chicago -- Wage pressures subsided though labor markets were still tight. Retailers reported improved back-to-school sales.
 
Cleveland -- The cost of new hires accelerated at some companies, leading to concerns about future labor pacts. Wages for existing employees gained 2 to 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Motorola Warns Quarterly Profits Will Shrink

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Motorola Inc. warned Wall Street today that disappointing sales of semiconductors, cellular phones, and paging products were taking a much bigger toll on its earnings than analysts had been projecting for the third quarter.
Motorola, which earned $326 million or 54 cents a share in the second quarter, said that earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 28 could be down "significantly," a word the company has used in the past only to refer to changes of 25 percent or more. Wall Street had been expecting a modest decline to 50 cents a share, based on the consensus of projections reported to First Call. 
 Motorola's shares fell $1.375 to $49.25 as the most active stock on the Big Board today, although most technology shares were modestly higher.
In a conference call with analysts this morning, Motorola said that it had not yet seen an increase in new orders for semiconductors, contrary to the industry trend in August, reported this week by the Semiconductor Industry Association. The trade group said that new orders, while down 38 percent from a year ago, had edged up to $2.84 billion, or 0.9 percent, from the previous month.
The steeper than average slump expected for Motorola's semiconductors reflects the woes of Apple Computer, its major customer in the PC industry, and weaker-than-expected demand for chips from Motorola's own cellular and paging businesses. Up to 20 percent of Motorola's semiconductors are used internally.
Motorola said it expected the semiconductor industry's book-to-bill ratio to be below 1 for the third consecutive quarter. A ratio of less than 1 means that for every $100 of chips sold, chip makers received less than $100 of new orders. In August, the book-to-bill ratio rose to 0.9 from July's revised 0.86 as demand for new chips picked up.
In addition to the industry-wide slump in semiconductor sales, Motorola's earnings decline reflects a persistent price war in several of Motorola's communications markets, and a raft of company problems like delays in getting important new products to market.
"The market is really struggling now to figure out just what Motorola's earning power will be over the next two years," Lior Bregman, who follows the company for Oppenheimer & Company, said.
The warning was an extraordinary move for Motorola, which is based in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg, Ill. The company prides itself on paying little attention to Wall Street's fascination with quarterly fluctuations in earnings. However, having upset investors in July by announcing second-quarter earnings that were well under projections, the company wanted to avoid a second such shock.
As the world's fifth largest semiconductor company, and a leader in markets like cellular telephones, two-way radio and paging, Motorola has generally been regarded as one of the bellwether stocks of the high-technology sector.
"A lot of this was anticipated but not the magnitude," Rakesh Sood, who follows Motorola for Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, said.
Motorola said that sales of cellular, paging and other communications-network equipment to phone companies and their competitors remained strong, but equipment like Motorola's cellular phones and pagers were not being sold as rapidly as expected to subscribers to those networks. In many markets, Motorola had bet too heavily on the development of technologies that have yet to be deployed and so fell behind in introducing new products for existing systems.
"There is no indication that competitive pricing pressures are easing," Ed Gams, head of investor relations for Motorola, said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Unchanged; Data Awaited

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were virtually unchanged yesterday, as investors remain defensive about two unknowns: inflationary pressure building in the economy and the size of the next interest-rate increase.
Anxiety over coming inflation numbers today and tomorrowheightened recently as Fed officials continued to sound warnings about potential tightening. And with each warning the market sold on fears despite the lack of clear-cut signals. 
 This latest anxiety over inflation was sparked by concerns raised by a Fed governor, Janet Yellen, about tight labor-market conditions and their effect on labor costs.
An inconclusive report on inflation in the latest beige book report yesterday by the Fed on business conditions in its 12 districts could not bring back the market completely, though it did squeeze some short positions out of the market.
By the close of the New York market the 30-year bond was at a price of 95 19/32 to yield 7.11 percent, unchanged from Tuesday.
Greg Jones, an economist with MMS International in San Francisco, said even with a parade of Fed governors sounding the tightening warning, "the market is not fully priced for a 25-basis-point tightening, and it is not even remotely prepared for a 50-basis-point tightening."
"In our view, it is the debate between 25 and 50 basis points that is the more relevant than the debate between steady policy and a 25-basis- point tightening," Mr. Jones said.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Mr. Jones added that it was difficult to judge whether supply in the form of two large global offerings by the European Investment Bank and the Tennessee Valley Authority had any impact on prices of Federal Government securities since those offerings also compete for investor dollars. "Any supply is a problem for a market that is already focused on the negatives," Mr. Jones said.
The European Investment Bank priced $1 billion of debt securities, its first global issue ever, through underwriters led by CS First Boston and Lehman Brothers. Rated AAA, the 10-year bonds were given an interest rate of 7.125 percent and priced at 99.979 to yield 7.128 percent. At the same time, the T.V.A. priced 1.5 billion German marks, or about $1 billion, in noncallable 10-year bonds. It was the first time that the Government corporation, the country's largest producer of electricity, issued a global bond in anything other than dollars.
The T.V.A.'s 10-year noncallable mark bond, priced through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers Bankhaus A.G. and Deutsche Bank A.G., was given a 6.375 percent coupon and priced at 99.173 to yield 6.49 percent. It too is rated AAA.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said he saw some short-covering followed by an erosion of prices as the market wondered what kind of information the Fed's beige book would reveal.
"Maybe everyone got a little ahead of themselves in the early part of the session," Mr. Donne said, "but then the beige book came in pretty market-friendly and I think the first comment within the summary was how there were inconclusive signs of inflation. If you read each of the 12 district reports, as I did, they are indeed inconclusive."
Mr. Donne noted that after the release of the beige book, the Chicago Fed issued its Midwest manufacturing index, which is not usually followed. "On days when there is very little information to go on, reports that are not always followed closely suddenly are," he said. The Chicago index showed a rise "for the third straight month to a record high level. Manufacturing remains strong, but there does not seem to be a large increase in wage pressures."
Yesterday was a day that did not give anybody clues, or any reason to expect a surprise in today's Producer Price Index report for August. "I expect the P.P.I. number to be somewhere up around one-tenth of 1 percent, with the core rate pretty much the same, and Friday's Consumer Price Index to be up two-tenths of 1 percent in both the overall and core number," Mr. Donne said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Behind Rally, an Optimism That Mystifies

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 27 points yesterday, bringing it within a whisker of its record close of 5,778 on May 22 and nearly completing a recovery that wiped out its 6.7 percent decline in July.
But the return to near-record levels is mystifying some stock strategists because market conditions -- including higher interest rates, modest earnings growth, expectations of higher inflation and the slowing of cash inflows into mutual funds -- are not as positive as they were in May. 
 None of these or other factors, including the prospect of a modest rise in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, would be likely to undermine the market alone. But they are all coming together at the same time now; yet the Dow has rebounded.
"All the variables that helped the market are less vigorous," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. "So I am amazed that the market has held up so well."
One reason for the rebound, which has also brought the broader Standard & Poor's index to within 1.7 percent of its closing high, is that the sentiment of the bull market persists.
This sentiment, said Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, moves investors to "see every dip as an opportunity to buy that has to be broken."
That investor persistence was reflected again yesterday in the Investment Company Institute's estimate that stock mutual funds took in a net $19 billion in cash in August, more than triple a revised $5.8 billion in July, when a plunge, particularly in smaller stocks, scared some investors.
This bull-market view also means that many uncertainties that have made stocks volatile this summer are still seen through rose-colored glasses.
So a strong jobs report for August becomes a reason for a rally, not a selloff. Similarly, the bull-market view has discounted signs of inflationary pressure that some economists see. It even allows modest earnings expectations -- 10 percent growth in 1996 -- to support stocks despite a rise in interest rates and the clear threat that the Fed's policy-making committee will raise short-term rates further at its meeting on Sept. 24.
"In a bull market we look at all of these uncertainties in a glass-half-full, positive way," said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis.
But looking inside the Dow shows that the return to its May high may reflect less confidence than thought. The Dow stocks that have contributed the most to the index's rebound suggest that many investors have less confidence in continued economic growth than they did in May.
As a result, among the 30 Dow stocks, the issues that have done well over the period include Coca-Cola and Merck, neither of which is likely to see revenues fall sharply in a recession, while the worst Dow performers over the period include General Motors and Goodyear, both highly vulnerable to a recession.
And while the Dow and the S.& P. are doing well, many other indexes that reflect the performance of smaller stocks or specific sectors of the economy are not keeping up. The Nasdaq composite index is still 7.6 percent below its record, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange gaming index, which tracks performance of the casino sector, is 23.8 percent below its peak.
"The big stock indexes are doing better than the average stock," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers.
Mr. Metz said the Dow's rally shows that investors have been concentrating on a small segment of stocks. "If you are going to make a mistake, you better make it on a Coke or a Gillette," he said.
But the new mutual-fund data may indicate that a lot of other stocks are still being bought. Bob Adler of AMG Data, which estimates fund flows on a weekly basis, said stock funds that invest primarily in large-capitalization stocks are getting relatively little of the new money. In the latest week for which he has data, ending Sept. 4, those funds basically broke even in terms of inflows.
A large flow of money is going into funds that invest primarily in smaller and riskier companies, Mr. Adler said. The flow of money into such funds plunged in July, with many experiencing outflows, but investment seems to be returning now.
This flow may be one reason that other indexes, like the Nasdaq composite, have risen more than the Dow since the July lows, even though they have not recovered as much of the ground that they lost.
Perhaps the biggest change in the market's environment since May has been in interest rates, which have risen, and the growing consensus that the Fed will have to raise its short-term interest rate target.
The yield on the 30-year bond is at 7.11 percent and the yield on the 2-year note is 6.30 percent. On May 22, the day the Dow peaked, the 30-year bond yield was 6.81 percent, and the 2-year yield was 5.98 percent.
The higher interest rates, Mr. Wien said, have pushed the market to the top of its fair value, and higher rates or a decline in earnings growth would make the market, in his view, overvalued.
According to IBES International Inc., expected 1996 earnings growth on the Standard & Poor's index has dropped 1.3 percent since the May peak of the Dow, to 9.8 percent.
Flows of investor money into stock mutual funds were at a record pace of $23 billion a month leading up to the May peak. Since June that pace has slowed to an average of slightly more than $13 billion a month, including the $19 billion preliminary estimate for August.
But while even $19 billion would be well below the flows of early 1996, such investment would surpass any month prior to this year. And it was enough to help the summer rebound.
One of the more worrisome, but hard to define, changes has been inflation expectations. At the May peak, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.9 percent for the 12 months through April. If the August index, which is to be released tomorrow, rises three-tenths of 1 percent, the index will have moved to a reading of 3 percent in the preceding 12 months.
While the C.P.I. has remained relatively stable, the closely watched Employment Cost Index, which measures wages and benefits, has crept up enough to draw the attention of many analysts. The drop of the unemployment rate in August to 5.1 percent also signals that wage pressures -- and, thus, inflation fears -- should be growing.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has Vital Interest in Stopping Hussein

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 8 Week in Review article "How Saddam Hussein Survives by Losing" says that in some lights "it defies common sense" that the United States does not consider assassinating Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, as a solution to the troubles in Iraq. 
 On one level, one might say, sure, it would be against American law but he is an unstable leader. Why use economic sanctions and cruise missiles when you can just strike at the source?
In reality, the response of John Deutch, the Director of Central Intelligence, to the question "Why haven't we killed Saddam Hussein?" suggests that for decision makers in the Administration it is still common sense that we should not assassinate foreign leaders.
Is your article evidence of the waning of international norms? I prefer to live in the world that we have grown used to, where rules and norms prevent knee-jerk violent responses by powerful states and where even the United States feels compelled to justify its actions to the international community. We are all safer in such a world.

HEADLINE: Airlines and Others Question Aspects of Anti-Terrorism Plan

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Airline representatives, airport operators and members of Congress expressed reservations today about the Clinton Administration's plans for preventing terrorism. They said they favored re-evaluating aviation security, but raised questions about the cost, practicality and usefulness of many of the proposed steps.
Matching all bags to passengers on domestic flights, as is now done internationally, is a fine idea, James C. DeLong, chairman of the Airports Council International-North America and the aviation director of the new Denver International Airport, testified before the Aviation Subcommittee of the House Transportation Committee. But if it increases the time the average departing passenger spends in the airport to two or three hours from the current 45 minutes, Mr. DeLong said, then airports would have to be three times as big. 
 Running computer background checks on passengers to decide who needs more scrutiny is a good idea, too, said John M. Meenan, vice president of the Air Transport Association, the big airlines' trade group. But, Mr. Meenan testified, the biggest improvements to security would have to be carried out by others, notably by "redeployment of our nation's intelligence resources."
"Countering aviation terrorism, in our estimation, is the responsibility of the Federal Government," he said. He compared improving airport security with trying to stop theft in a home, saying, "Burglar bars and alarms are not a solution to crime, but one of its symptoms."
The subcommittee chairman, Representative John J. Duncan, Jr., Republican of Tennessee, said that security should certainly be re-evaluated, but that he did not believe the country should overreact. The ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Representative William O. Lipinsky of Illinois, said that in most cases, the cost of the new steps would be justified by the benefits, but that all should be studied for the delays they would impose and the penalties on "efficiency and economy."
Also questioned were the criminal background checks performed on prospective airline employees.
Mr. Meenan said that examination of work history was much more productive, and that checking the backgrounds of employees would not have blocked acts of terrorism like the World Trade Center bombing.
Another witness, David Tomlinson, head of security at BAA P.L.C., the private company that used to be the British Airports Authority, said the British police scrutinize airline and airport employees' backgrounds, not for criminal records but for people who might sympathize with terrorists and provide them with useful information.
Questions about cost were also raised. Republicans said that they had not seen anything in writing from the White House on the $1.1 billion that the President is asking for, about one-third of it for aviation.
Representative Robert L. Livingston, Republican of Louisiana and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, pointed out on Tuesday that Mr. Clinton had previously asked for a supplemental appropriation of $400 million to $500 million for fighting western forest fires and $250 million for fighting drugs. Congress is also considering requests for supplemental financing for the re-deployment of American soldiers in Saudi Arabia and the continuing peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, which together will run $300 million, Republicans say.
Mr. Livingston and others complained that the Administration had not identified any budget cuts or revenue increases to pay for any of its requests for more money. "He promises everything to everyone with complete disregard for the American taxpayer," Mr. Livingston said.
There is a vehicle handy, though, for supplemental appropriations; with the end of the Federal fiscal year on Sept. 30, Congress is almost certain to face a vote on a continuing resolution or an omnibus appropriations bill for the parts of the Government that have not had their budgets approved for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. As of today, only 2 of 13 appropriations bills have final approval.
Even if there is no immediate appropriation, the House today overwhelmingly approved a three-year, $29.5 billion financing bill for the Federal Aviation Administration that will allow money earmarked for "airport improvements" to be used for security investments. The Senate is supposed to take up the bill next week.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE MONEY;
A Hollywood Production: Political Money

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
For President Clinton, Thursday evening will be a memorable one. Barbra Streisand will serenade him under the stars, Maya Angelou will read him poetry, and he will mingle with Hollywood's corporate elite, all this at a breathtaking Mediterranean-style estate overlooking Beverly Hills.
And once the evening is over, the Democratic Party will be $3.5 million richer. 
 When it comes to raising money, especially for Democrats, no one does it better than Hollywood. The open wallets of movie stars and the corporate donations of studio executives make the entertainment industry one of the party's biggest sources of contributions, and of the glamour and celebrities who can draw crowds to Democratic rallies and fund-raising events.
"Politicians and movie stars spring from the same DNA," said Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, the movie industry's trade group, who was once a special assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson. "Both hope for applause, read from a script and hope to persuade audiences."
And, Mr. Valenti said, "many in Hollywood feel passionate about the same issues as the Democrats."
At Thursday's event, orchestrated by Hollywood's "A list" -- including Ms. Streisand, the record producer David Geffen and the director Steven Spielberg -- more than 700 people will pay as much as $12,500 apiece to hear entertainers like Ms. Streisand, Tom Hanks, the Eagles and the Neville Brothers.
Tickets come in three prices: $2,500, which admits the holder to the estate, Greenacres, former home of the silent-screen star Harold Lloyd, and to the show that will be performed there; $5,000, which provides admission to a cocktail reception and a "preferred" seat, and $12,500, which buys a V.I.P. dinner and a spot close to the stage.
And even those prices pale when compared with the per-person giving at two small dinners where Mr. Geffen was host, at his home, earlier this year. Those affairs, attended by the President and just 12 guests, netted about $2 million for the Democratic Party.
"To understand Hollywood is to understand big money and politics," said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research organization. "When we think of the Hollywood heavy hitters, we think of Democrats. The biggest contributing zip code to Bill Clinton is 90210," Beverly Hills's fabled enclave of wealth.
The party has already raised $4.7 million in Hollywood during this election cycle, compared with $890,000 raised there by the Republicans, according to the Campaign Study Group, a consulting firm. Since 1991, when Mr. Clinton began taking aim at the White House, Hollywood has given $18 million to the Democrats, $2.6 million to the Republicans. (Those are sums that have gone to the party itself, not directly to any candidate, who by law can receive only $1,000 from an individual and $5,000 from a corporation's political action committee.)
Indeed, since Bob Dole attacked the film industry last year for producing a "nightmare of depravity," Republicans have found Hollywood so poor a source of financing that they have virtually written it off.
"We are more interested in Main Street than Hollywood," said Howard Leach, finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. "That's where the real majority is."
The connection between Hollywood and Democrats goes back decades and, except during Ronald Reagan's Presidency, has proved hard for Republicans to duplicate. From the days when Lauren Bacall was photographed while draped on a piano played by Harry S. Truman, or when John F. Kennedy associated with Frank Sinatra, Peter Lawford and the rest of the Rat Pack, Hollywood glamour has strolled arm in arm with Democratic politicians.
One of the Democrats' biggest fund-raisers is Mr. Geffen, a founder of the multimedia entertainment company DreamWorks SKG, who says he has raised "many millions" for the party in the last few years. Mr. Geffen's influence is such that he was able to persuade some of Hollywood's biggest names to attend his million-dollar dinners with the President: Steve Jobs, the Apple Computer founder; Steve Tisch, producer; Peter Morton, founder of the Hard Rock Cafe; Edgar Bronfman Jr., the Seagram's heir and studio executive, and Lew Wasserman, former MCA studio chairman.
"The Democratic message of taking care of people who are poor and unemployed has traditionally resonated with Hollywood, and that continues to be the case today," Mr. Geffen said. The only thing he has received in return for his efforts, he said, is a night at the White House and an invitation to a state dinner.
The source of Democratic money in Hollywood falls into two categories: the stars and the studios.
Like other industries, studios have a business agenda and make big donations in part to make sure that their views are heard by officeholders. Their main concern today is intellectual property -- protecting American entertainment products from piracy and copyright infringements abroad. In addition, the industry recoils at attacks by politicians who see Hollywood as a source of moral depravity.
As for the stars, most come from ordinary backgrounds and, despite their wealth and fame, do not identify with the establishment.
"Many have been very fortunate and want to give back something to their community," said Lara Bergthold, executive director of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, which has raised more than $6 million in the last decade, mostly for Democrats.
In addition to their own giving, celebrities draw crowds and so help raise money from wealthy people who want to be around them.
"People will come to an event with a celebrity connection who might not come to another political event," said Ann Lewis, deputy manager of the Clinton-Gore campaign. "One of our big challenges is to expand our donor base, and celebrities help."
Mr. Clinton first visited Hollywood many years ago, as a rising young Arkansas politician. In 1992, Ms. Streisand's appearance at a glitzy fund-raising event for him -- at the same estate, owned by the supermarket executive Ron Burkle, where Thursday night's affair will be held -- netted $1.2 million in a single afternoon. Ms. Streisand helped raise even more money by attending Mr. Clinton's pre-inaugural ball, where her appearance helped insure that the event would be televised.
The danger for Democrats, some say, is that Hollywood will make the party appear to have lost touch with common people. For that reason, organizers say, Thursday night's event has been closed to the press.
"It's bizarre," said Ms. Miller, of the Center for Responsive Politics. "Democrats have the reputation of being for the working people. When it becomes a party of the stars, people must wonder whether the Democrats have lost their way."
Mr. Geffen, mindful of Mr. Clinton's substantial lead in the polls, disagrees.
"Even back to the Kennedy days," he said, "there was discussion that stars can have a negative influence. But it doesn't seem to be much of a negative when you are winning."
 Because of an editing error, the article also referred incompletely to the use of the contributions. They went to individual candidates as well as to the Democratic and Republican Parties.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up on U.S. Price Data And Hint of German Rate Cut

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose further against most key currencies yesterday, strengthening as stock and bond markets in the United States rallied and a senior Bundesbank official suggested that a German money market rate could fall.
A Labor Department report that showed surprisingly weak inflation at the wholesale level in August initially put pressure on the dollar, as traders sold on the belief that the Federal Reserve might not raise interest rates at its meeting on Sept. 24. Expectations of higher rates had been helping the dollar for a week or so. 
 But buyers quickly stepped in, reflecting strong demand for the dollar and a growing belief that it could be headed even higher. Traders who had bet on a weaker dollar began buying instead.
Late yesterday in New York, the dollar sold for 1.5125 marks, up from 1.5105 on Wednesday. It traded at 110.20 yen, unchanged from late Wednesday. The last time the dollar was at such high levels against both currencies was in mid-July. The American currency also gained against the British pound, which fetched $1.5545, down from $1.5550.
Part of the dollar's strength came from the stock and bond markets, which rose after the report that core wholesale inflation, which excludes food and energy, declined in August for the first time in five months. This suggested that the Fed might leave interest rates unchanged because inflation remained benign.
The dollar also derived strength from weakness in the mark after Klaus Dieter Kuhbacher, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, said that the 14-day securities-repurchase rate had the leeway to fall 20 more basis points from its current low of 3.0 percent. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Germans lowered the repurchase rate on Aug. 22, in a move some then viewed as the last in a series of cuts intended to stimulate the economy. Still lower rates could hurt the mark by lowering the return on mark-denominated investments.
Other late dollar rates in New York yesterday, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.2373 Swiss francs, up from 1.2351; 5.1601 French francs, up from 5.1589; 1,521.20 Italian lire, down from 1,524, and 1.3714 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3712.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
Ethnologists' Data Turn Out to Be Art

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
LITTLE-KNOWN fact of the week: the Brooklyn Museum established the first photographic department in an American museum in 1889, some 51 years before the Museum of Modern Art (which ordinarily gets the credit) had a department of its own. Brooklyn, however, was primarily a museum of natural history and anthropology, where you were as likely to see butterflies and bones as paintings of the American West. The Department of Photography, rich in ethnographic material, was blissfully unaware of art. In 1974, Barbara Head Millstein, the present curator, discovered a closet that had been locked since 1957; inside was the photographic collection, a good deal of which had been magically transformed into art in the interval by changing tastes and markets.
Since anthropologists and ethnologists, inveterate collectors by profession, had long been interested in the relatively accessible study sites of Latin America, photographs of sites and people found their way to Brooklyn. Then in the 1970's, Ms. Millstein, who was blissfully aware of art, began collecting recent work from the region before it became fashionable. One way or another, the museum acquired some telling images: 107 photographic prints and books from the collection are on view until Jan. 19 in "Latin American Photography: A Spiritual Journey," organized by Ms. Millstein with historical material provided by Deirdre Lawrence, principal librarian at the museum. 
 This show of Latin photographers and foreigners who came and stayed a while lacks a few of the great names but introduces some new ones. It makes a case, as might be expected, for a strong spiritual tradition and a more complex argument for a hybrid of Old and New World cultures. Nineteenth-century photographers in Latin America generally focused on monuments, buildings and cities. Foreigners mapped the ancient monuments; as early as 1843, engravings were made after Frederick Catherwood's daguerreotypes of Uxmal, and Alfred Percival Maudslay studied Chichen Itza in 1889.
Toward the end of the century, as anthropology solidified into a science, photographers grew interested in indigenous customs. The Brooklyn Museum's scientists and curators lapped up whatever looked like good evidence of places and people and customs, an impulse that also accounts for the wealth of remarkable colonial art recently on view at the museum in "Converging Cultures: Art and Identity in Spanish America." Much of the art in that show, originally picked up as documentary material rather than art, had been languishing in the museum's basement for years.
In the 20th century, photographers took on art, economic struggle, spiritual matters and psychological life. Hidden in this show -- it is not entirely obvious in many pictures or spelled out in the labels -- is a photographic lesson quite similar to that of "Converging Cultures": that Latin America took extensively from European art but married it to native culture, sometimes an unlikely match. This is clear enough in the near-miraculous interplay of religions. Two small photographs taken by Juan L. Arauz in 1939 picture colonial baroque altars, those prodigal extravagances of saints and angels and gilt and hosannahs that turned the swell of European exuberance into a virtual inundation. In 1991, an American named Peter Kloehn made color photographs of Umbanda altars that adapted this already adaptive style to religions of a different stripe. Umbanda is an African-derived religion brought over by slaves. In one of these altars' tumultuous gatherings, Jesus carries his cross at the peak of the composition; Mary looks suitably motherly; the saints, in brilliant garments, stand by; blacks attend in white suits; North American Indians proudly wear their headdresses, and drums and fancy jugs are thrown in for good measure.
Then there are two girls standing near the door of a Roman Catholic church in feather, embroidery and paper-flower headdresses that are certainly not standard-issue Catholic (Mariana Yampolsky, 1980's); Javier Silva Meinel's recent pictures of Peruvian rituals, said to be tied to Catholicism, one with a man in a trance while an enormous poisonous spider crawls over his face, another of a woman wearing a necklace of fish as she invites the sea to provide a good catch; and Graciela Iturbide's 1980's photograph of a sad Mexican woman holding a baby and wearing a crown of thorns, or her picture of a proud woman selling sisal, which frames her body like a shining pair of wings. A persistent devotion also shines from images of deserted, shuttered or ruined churches impeccably kept up by people who can no longer pray there.
Latin photographic styles tend to be hybrid as well, frequently welding local traditions onto foreign models. Latin America has long had close ties to Europe. From the 19th century on, people traveled or studied abroad, and at least from the 1920's numerous Latin American cities had steady access to European magazines and books. They also saw the imagery of foreigners like Paul Strand who paid lengthy visits.
So Hugo Brehme, a German who lived in Mexico, taught Manuel Alvarez Bravo, the dean of Mexican photographers, and Alvarez Bravo taught his wife, Lola, who taught other Mexican women. (Women are exceptionally well represented in this show, both in quantity and quality.) Alvarez Bravo looked hard at work by Man Ray and other Surrealists, and an elusive Surrealism suffuses many Latin American photographs that do not even tamper with reality, like Iturbide's picture of a woman carrying a chicken past a wall covered with dripped paint that might well be blood, or Renata von Hanffstengel's image of a stairway leading up to a blank wall. Magic realism, you might call it.
Foreigners and natives apparently photographed much the same things. Death looms large in their pictures: Bastienne Schmidt photographed a Colombian exhumation where the mourners were dismayed to find only a heap of clothing in the coffin, Alvarez Bravo depicted the Day of the Dead, Rosalind Solomon pictured a man about to be buried with a bottle of Pepsi.
Insiders and outsiders both seem to have shared a vision of what was significant in these cultures. To a certain extent, they seem to have shared styles as well. But perhaps this is yet another example of borrowed or imposed European traditions thoroughly reconfigured on new soil. The native learns whatever the worldly foreigner has to offer and invents a new world from this knowledge. The outsider looking in at another culture finds it staring back. Sometimes, eventually, it stares him down.

 "Latin American Photography: A Spiritual Journey" remains at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, through Jan. 19.

Bond prices rose modestly yesterday, following the release of data that showed a decline in last month's core wholesale prices. The decline in the core rate served to reinforce the market's perceptions that inflation was not accelerating.
The 30-year bond rose 15/32 , to a price of 962/32 ; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, slipped to 7.07 percent, from 7.11 percent on Wednesday. 
 While the stock market initially reacted strongly to the Producer Price Index data, since they show that the economy continues to grow at a fairly moderate clip, the numbers mostly provided the bond market with some relief, because it reduces the likelihood of a large interest-rate increase by the Fed.
Thus, the bond market moved higher on the producer-index data, which was released in the morning, then settled into a narrow price range off the day's highs as traders awaited today's release of the Consumer Price Index for August as well as retail sales data for the month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News expect the consumer report to show a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent, both in the overall figure and in the core figure that excludes food and energy costs.
The August Producer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent, a higher-than-expected reading led by a 1 percent surge in food prices. But the core numbers -- excluding the volatile food and energy sectors -- showed a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent, precipitating a short cover rally by speculators who had bet that the numbers would be more bearish, then had to scramble to buy securities to limit losses, forcing yields down further.
"While the cost of food cannot be ignored because of its importance as a basic necessity," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "it is also true that monetary policy is not known to be an effective tool in controlling the weather. The Fed therefore is likely to be more concerned with the P.P.I.," which, aside from the food number, "is certainly no cause for alarm." Mr. Fine said another favorable factor for the market yesterday was the increase of 21,000 in the weekly numbers of first-time jobless claims, for the period ended Sept. 7, a rise that was higher than expected. But he noted that both the latest weekly level of 338,000 claims and the current four-week average of 328,000, both still suggested firmness in the labor market.
Of major importance to market participants are today's release of retail sales figures and the Consumer Price Index. Retail sales for August are expected to be noticeably stronger, economists said, but considering the slack in sales for both June and July, overall consumer spending does appear to be moderating somewhat from its strong pace in the first half of the year.
Mr. Fine noted that the C.P.I., the Federal Reserve's leading barometer of inflation, was expected to stay subdued and nonthreatening, but that the Fed's goal was to insure that the index remained that way.
With the labor market pushing against technical full employment, and with the economy not yet slowing to the extent that the Fed apparently desires, a raising of short-term interest rates a quarter-percentage point still seems likely, Mr. Fine said, when the Fed's policy-making arm meets on Sept. 24.
"Not to do so," Mr. Fine warned, "with a 5.1 percent unemployment rate and payroll growth continuing unabated risks a backup in bond yields and a market interpretation that the Fed is dragging its heels, and credibility, after all, is the Fed's most important asset."
The results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills saw the average rate come in at 5.57 percent, up from 5.36 percent last month. Traders described investor demand as a bit softer than expected, with the total number of bids and retail interest a little less than average. Even though better results were expected, the impact on the market was minimal.
The average rate awarded was the highest since April 27, 1995, when it was 5.90 percent.
Other data released yesterday included the Atlanta Fed's regional index, which featured the component measuring factory activity at 4.0 in August compared with a July reading of -1.2. The prices-paid component was 12.5, compared with 11.5 in July.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills:

HEADLINE: August Producer Price Report Shows Inflation in Check

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Inflation fundamentally remained in check last month, even though hefty increases for food and energy drove producer prices up three-tenths of 1 percent in August, the second-biggest rise this year, a Labor Department report showed today.
Economists and the securities markets largely disregarded these two erratic sectors and dwelled instead on a decline in the rest of the Producer Price Index for finished goods. That, they said, provided fresh reassurance that inflation was not a threat. 
 "The core P.P.I. numbers look fabulous," said Michael L. Penzer, a senior economist at the Bank of America.
The markets also welcomed the department's report this morning that first-time claims for unemployment benefits climbed 21,000 in the week ended Sept. 7, more than offsetting the preceding week's decline.
Bond prices gained across the board, and the stock market posted a moderate advance as operators braced for publication on Friday of figures on consumer prices and retail sales for August.
If today's figures did anything to shift the odds about whether Federal Reserve policy makers would decide to push up interest rates at their meeting the week after next, it was probably in the direction of standing fast, analysts said. But most appeared to hold a belief that the Fed would raise short-term interest rates by a minimal amount to try to keep an economy that has been expanding too rapidly from generating faster inflation.
"We still expect the Fed to tighten policy by 25 basis points at the Sept. 24th Federal Open Market Committee meeting," Bruce Steinberg and Cheryl Katz of Merrill Lynch told clients today. "However, that is an extremely close call, and the P.P.I. report certainly supplies a rationale to hold policy steady."
Although the core finished-goods index eased just one-tenth of 1 percent, the consensus forecast had been for a slight rise. Moreover, prices of the goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production were also well behaved -- each up two-tenths of 1 percent over all and up one-tenth of 1 percent excluding the volatile food and energy components over which Federal Reserve influence, in any event, is scant.
"There is simply no inflation in the pipeline," declared analysts at Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis consultant, pointing to actual deflation in the core intermediate and crude indexes since late last year.
On the other hand, while core finished-goods inflation was being halved, to 1.4 percent, over the latest 12 months, the finished goods index as a whole was rising nearly a point, to a 3 percent year-over-year rate in August.
"Unfortunately, the run-ups in food and energy prices coincided and will likely show up in broader measures of inflation about the same time the increase in the minimum wage does," Macroeconomic Advisers said. The Federal minimum rises 50 cents an hour, to $4.75, on Oct. 1.
Prices of finished foods advanced 1 percent in August, with pork prices leaping 8.7 percent. Fresh fruits and melons, eggs for fresh use and shortening and cooking oils also turned up after July declines. Fresh and dry vegetables, however, dropped 11.9 percent, and fish and young chickens also turned down.
Prices obtained by energy producers climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent after a modestly larger July decline, with gasoline a major contributor. Residential electric power and lubricants also moved up. Residential natural gas and heating oil rose less than in July.
Elsewhere, price increases for paper products, alcoholic beverages, tires, floor coverings, sporting goods and newspaper circulation were offset by declines for prescription drugs, passenger cars, books, apparel and light trucks, the department reported. Producers of capital equipment saw prices they receive edge down one-tenth of 1 percent.
Among intermediate goods, durable items like aluminum mill shapes used in manufacturing fell six-tenths of 1 percent following a nine-tenths of 1 percent decline in July. Nondurables like organic chemicals used in factories posted a three-tenths of 1 percent increase in August, reversing a larger July decline.
The index for all domestic manufacturing, including petroleum refining, advanced two-tenths of 1 percent after showing no change in July.
The department's report on jobless claims, which analysts viewed with more than the usual caution because of the difficulty of adjusting for the Labor Day holiday, found 338,000 workers applying for new benefits. This compared with an exceptionally low 317,000 for the week ended Aug. 31 and lifted the four-week moving average to 327,750, a rise of 4,250.

HEADLINE: Ernesto Geisel, 88, Is Dead; Eased Military Rule in Brazil

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Former President Ernesto Geisel, the Brazilian military dictator associated with the gradual reopening of Brazil to the outside world, died in a Rio clinic today. He was 88.
A stern figure whose father immigrated from Germany at the turn of the century, General Geisel was the fourth of five military leaders during the dictatorship that ran Brazil from 1964 to 1985. 
 Stirrings toward democracy were evident during his administration, which ran from 1974 to 1979, and he called his policy a "slow, gradual and sure relaxation" of military authority. But he made frequent recourse to the repressive powers vested in him as the head of a military state.
Two years after General Geisel took office, he shut down an already weak Congress after the opposition party blocked a bill he had presented on judicial reform. A few months later, Congress was back at work, but the pro-Government majority party passed a law restricting the speech of candidates in coming elections.
Walder de Goes, a Brasilia-based political consultant and author of "The Brazil of General Geisel," said the former leader's authoritarian bent was typified by his reaction when his Finance Minister, Mario Henrique Simonsen, told him he wanted to resign. General Geisel turned his minister away with the scalding admonition, "The day I don't need you anymore, I'll be the one to tell you."
"He was probably the President with the single greatest awareness of his own power," Mr. de Goes said.
General Geisel's administration was not notable for the widespread use of torture and the large number of unexplained killings that tarnished the tenure of his predecessor, Gen. Emilio Medici, largely because the dictatorship's perceived enemies had already been silenced or killed by the time he took office, Mr. de Goes said.
General Geisel, who had been president of the state petroleum company, Petrobras, took office as the so-called "Brazilian miracle" of economic growth was winding down. He faced the world petroleum crisis, increasing Brazil's foreign debt to pay for oil imports. He also increased the state's role in industry and production and concentrated the country's budget on developing communications, railroads, ports and shipping.
He also reduced the traditional trade dependence of Brazil on Europe and the United States, increasing its trade with Africa and Asia. He signed a $10 billion contract with Germany to build eight nuclear power plants to lessen the country's dependence on foreign energy sources, though the plan was severely criticized.
Even after he was succeeded by another general, Joao Figueiredo, who completed the transition to democracy, General Geisel remained a respected figure. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who has been wrestling with military dissatisfaction as Brazil begins to recognize and compensate the victims of military repression during the dictatorship, made it a point to visit General Geisel in recent weeks.
In a statement today, Mr. Cardoso praised General Geisel, whose political presence, he said, "was marked by his efforts to end repression, and his determination to bring Brazil back to democracy in what seemed to him the most appropriate way."

HEADLINE: Deane Malott, 98, Educator Who Ran Two Universities

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Deane W. Malott, a business-minded educator who led the University of Kansas and Cornell University through periods of significant growth, died on Wednesday at his home at Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 98.
In 12 years as Chancellor at Kansas, from 1939 to 1951, and 12 years as president of Cornell, from 1951 to 1963, Mr. Malott raised so much money, built so many buildings and supervised such growth in the student bodies, faculties, research and other resources that it seems hardly surprising that his only prior experience as an educator had been at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration. 
 But for all his business acumen and ability as a fund raiser, Mr. Malott was not content to leave academics to the professors. At Kansas, he initiated major changes in the curriculum, emphasizing thought over memory, and substituting Harvard's famous case method of teaching for some lecture courses.
At Cornell, where he transformed the face of the campus with an extensive construction program, he put so much emphasis on liberal arts that he was remembered yesterday by the president of the university, Hunter Rawlings, primarily as the builder of its intellectual landscape.
Mr. Malott was born in Abilene, Kan., where his grandfather helped found the Citizens Bank in 1885. His father was known as the dean of Kansas bankers, and the Eisenhowers were family friends, Mr. Malott served as a Navy seaman in World War I, majored in economics at the University of Kansas and received his M.B.A. at Harvard in 1923.
As Mr. Malott later recalled it, he had wanted nothing more than to return to Kansas and run a country newspaper. But he had been so impressive as a student that when he was offered a dual position as an assistant dean and assistant professor, he stayed on. In the next few years, Mr. Malott, who was respected for his calm administrative ability and sense of humor, began friendships with scores of future business leaders, many of whom later wrote checks that helped the building programs at Kansas and Cornell.
Partly, perhaps, because he wanted first-hand business experience and partly because he had fallen in love with Hawaii along with the Hawaiian-born woman who became his wife in 1925, Mr. Malott left Harvard in 1929 to work as a vice president of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company and as a personal assistant to James D. Dole, the Harvard graduate who founded the company, which was later named for him.
Returning to Harvard in 1934, Mr. Malott wrote casebooks and business texts, advised a variety of businesses and became such a recognized expert on the economics of agriculture that when the University of Kansas needed a chancellor in 1939, the State Board of Regents picked him out of more than 100 candidates, making him the first Kansas native and alumnus to head the university.
By the time he moved to Cornell, Mr. Malott was a member of so many corporate boards and a friend of so many business executives that fund raising sometimes seemed a breeze. It was rarely more so than in 1956, when Mr. Malott presided over what amounted to a check-writing competition between two brothers whose father had helped build the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation. Two months after Spencer Olin pledged $2 million to build a civil engineering building, his brother John pledged $3 million toward the construction of a library.
Mr. Malott, whose wife died in 1994, is survived by a son, Robert, of Kenilworth, Ill.; two daughters, Janet Elliott of Ocala, Fla., and Edith LaBonte of Palo Alto, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Big Labor With a Smaller Agenda;
U.A.W. Is Just Trying to Hold Its Ground With Detroit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 12

 BODY:
For decades after World War II, the Big Three auto makers' negotiations with the United Automobile Workers were the biggest show in labor relations. The highly ritualized spectacle was watched closely by executives and union leaders in other industries because the U.A.W. had a history of winning big concessions, like automatic cost-of-living adjustments and fully paid health care for retired workers, that soon spread to other businesses.
But with the auto makers' current labor contracts set to expire at midnight on Saturday, it is becoming increasingly clear that the U.A.W.'s glory days of big labor breakthroughs are over. Instead of wresting yet more goodies for their members, the union negotiators are fighting a rear-guard action to conserve what they have already gotten and to halt the erosion of the union's membership. 
 Even though the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation are all earning near-record profits and sitting on cash reserves totaling $37 billion, the union is not even pushing for a big pay increase. Rather, in its talks so far with Ford -- the company it chose this year to hammer out a contract to serve as a model for the entire industry -- the U.A.W. has been throwing all its energies into protecting its members' jobs.
"Job security is everything," said Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, at the beginning of this summer's negotiations. The U.A.W. wants the auto makers to guarantee that their employment of union members will not drop any further and that tens of thousands of retiring workers over the next several years will actually be replaced.
And, because the negotiations no longer set the trend for wages and benefits across the rest of the country, the rest of the country is not paying as much notice as it once did. Wall Street is keeping an eye on them in case another ugly strike develops at G.M. like the one that shut down the nation's largest company last March. Executives in other industries say that they are following the talks but do not expect any repercussions on their own labor costs. "At arm's length, we all watch it, everybody in American business does, but in terms of it being a big factor for us, it's not," said Herbert J. Schmidt, the senior vice president of operations at Contract Freighters Inc., a large, nonunion trucking company based in Joplin, Mo.
Added Sean P. McAlinden, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, "I have never seen so little attention paid to them by other industries' industrial relations departments."
True, the U.A.W.'s sheer size, with 400,000 workers in the auto industry, gives the union the ability, unique in American industry today, to shut down almost overnight assembly plants that account for several percentage points of the nation's economic output. That has allowed the union to hold on to far higher wages and much more generous benefits than workers enjoy in most other sectors of the economy..
At the same time, though, the long-term decline in the union's membership to half its peak in the 1970's, largely as a result of rising worker productivity, the European and Japanese invasions of the American car market and the general decline of the American labor movement -- has weakened its position and made it more wary of taking on management. While G.M. has suffered eight local strikes in the last three years, some of which spread across the country, the last national strike took place at Ford in 1976.
As the U.A.W. has lost influence, it has watched with dismay as the Big Three have moved aggressively to get out of the parts-manufacturing business, thinning the union's ranks further. First Chrysler and Ford, and now G.M., have closed factories or sold them to buyers that quickly negotiated much stingier contracts. As a result, all three companies have been steadily buying more and more parts from outside suppliers, only a fifth of which are unionized and many of which pay their workers half or less of the $19 an hour that U.A.W. workers make.
The spectacle of so many workers outside the auto industry slipping down the economic ladder out of the middle class -- and in many cases the sight of their own sons and daughters entering the work force with better educations but worse job prospects than they had a generation ago -- has profoundly frightened the U.A.W.'s rank and file and made job preservation its No. 1 goal.
The auto makers contend they have no choice but to parcel out the parts business to low-cost suppliers if they are to compete with foreign rivals and still maintain high wages for the workers who remain in their assembly plants.
"We have added 13,000 U.A.W. jobs in the last couple of years, and that is because we have become more efficient at what we do and our market share is going up," Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president, told reporters last month. "And we can only do that if we can continually reduce our costs and focus on the things that we do best, which is design engineering, fabricating bodies, painting them, trimming them and doing transmissions and four-wheel drive transfer cases and some axles -- in other words, the core of the car."
But the design, engineering and manufacture of other parts, from seats to steering wheels to dashboards, is better left to outside suppliers, Mr. Lutz said.
Indeed, the the U.A.W.'s scrutiny of outside-supplier contracts shows how much the union's focus has shifted away from bread-and-butter economic issues like higher pay and better benefits and toward assuring its long-term survival.
The threat posed by the auto makers' shedding of parts factories produced a rift in the union leadership that is only now being resolved, according to people close to the U.A.W. At first, some senior officials wanted to work more closely with management, participating in parts-purchasing decisions. The U.A.W. actually controlled a seat on Chrysler's board from 1980 until 1992, when Owen Bieber, then the union's president, relinquished it under pressure from the company.
But the influence of those who advocated such cooperation has waned, as the younger leaders who succeeded Mr. Bieber and his aides showed themselves to be leery of getting too close to management and reluctant to expose themselves to blame for any future sales or closings of factories. The U.A.W. is not even seeking seats on the auto makers' boards this year.
Besides, being the only union representative on a board "is like being the lone chicken in a den of lions -- you can be screaming and ranting and raving but it doesn't matter," said Andrew C. Meyer, a Cleveland lawyer who represents nonunion suppliers.
The union is now trying instead to organize more of the outside suppliers. The goal is to raise the wages paid by the suppliers enough to reduce the incentive for the auto makers to use them.
To achieve that goal, the U.A.W. has rapidly increased its budget for unionization drives. But it also wants the Big Three to use their tremendous buying power to push the suppliers into dropping their staunch resistance to unions.
Some of the nation's largest auto-parts suppliers complain privately that Ford in particular is nudging them to let the union into their factories if they want to keep doing business with the world's No. 2 auto maker. "Some of them are saying that they don't think their customers should dictate what they should be doing," said Donna L. Parolini,, the president of IBD Corporation, a supplier-consulting firm in Troy, Mich.
Ford officials deny that they are putting any pressure on the suppliers. "All we're prepared to do is say to our suppliers that we want them to behave in the same kind of way to their employees as we do," said Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman, chief executive and president. "We cannot, should not, must not bully or jawbone our suppliers into having unions, that's not our business."
Any overt move by Ford to force unions on its suppliers could subject the company to litigation, labor experts said, adding that Ford still might influence its suppliers by letting its friendly views toward the union be known.
With little chance of obtaining Big Three contracts that would require direct pressure on suppliers, the U.A.W. has instead been negotiating ways to persuade the auto makers to go back to manufacturing their own parts. One likely possibility is that the union may allow a lower wage for workers in any new auto-parts industry that the auto makers may enter. Wages would remain high in the auto makers' existing auto parts factories under this plan.
While the U.A.W. is widely expected to conclude deals quickly with Ford and Chrysler, the toughest bargaining may come at G.M. The giant auto maker's initial offer this week angered the union even with its preface, which warned of the rigors of international competition and the need to reduce costs. "It's condescending, it's insulting, it's global economics nursery school," complained one angry recipient of the document.
But a few people close to the negotiations say that the U.A.W. may quickly reach a loosely worded deal with G.M., then try to resolve tough issues like outside parts purchases through separate negotiations at each of G.M.'s more than 100 assembly and parts factories. If that happens, there could be rocky labor relations in the auto industry for many months to come.

HEADLINE: Jamestown Fort, 'Birthplace' Of America in 1607, Is Found

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
On May 13, 1607, the first successful English settlement in what is now the United States got off to an unsteady start at a swampy island in a broad tidal river. The 104 settlers of the Virginia Company named the place James Fort, later Jamestown, after the sovereign for whom more than half would die in a few wretched months.
This was the colony where Capt. John Smith made his name in history and Pocahontas, a young daughter of the powerful Indian chief Powhatan, became a legend befriending the beleaguered English and supposedly rescuing Captain Smith from death. Looking back from the 19th century, the orator Edward Everett spoke of the Jamestown fort in tidewater Virginia as the place "where the first germs of the mighty republic . . . were planted." 
 All traces of the original fort, however, had been lost for more than two centuries. The log fort burned a year after it was built. Buried remains of the wall, along with any weapons, ceramics and other artifacts, were thought to have been washed away by changing currents of the James River. Anything of the first structures at the first permanent English settlement in America seemed beyond recovery.
But archeologists announced yesterday that the lost had been found. In recent excavations, they uncovered stains of decayed wood where they said logs of the palisade wall had stood in the ground.
From this they established the three-sided fort's footprint, determining the outlines of a rounded bastion at one of the three corners and the angle at which the walls were joined. Archeologists said these observations conformed exactly with contemporary written descriptions of the original fort.
Archeologists also reported finding traces of two buildings within the fort, evidence of glass-making and copper-working industries there and thousands of other artifacts, including swords, armor, a smoking pipe, jewelry, ceramics and coins.
A grave at the site held the well-preserved skeleton of a white man in his early 20's who probably died of a gunshot wound, a fate raising intriguing questions about murder or mutiny or other tempests.
In making the official announcement at Jamestown Island, Gov. George Allen of Virginia declared, "We have discovered America's birthplace -- the original fort."
Dr. William Kelso, the director of archeology of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, which owns the site and supported the excavations, said in a telephone interview that the artifacts should afford historians a clearer view of "a very early Colonial society" in the time of Queen Elizabeth I and her successor, James I.
Among the most interesting finds, Dr. Kelso said, were dozens of sky-blue glass beads apparently manufactured by the colony for trade with the Indians. "John Smith got himself out of hot spots by trading these beads," he said.
The project, which is also supported by the National Geographic Society, is expected to excavate most of the site of the one-acre fort and surrounding town ruins by the 400th anniversary of Jamestown, in 2007.
"Any time we get early Colonial artifacts, it's important," said Dr. James Axtell, a historian at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., an expert on early encounters between Europeans and American Indians.
"There's also the symbolic significance here. Jamestown represents the founding of Virginia and of English America, even though other places are better examples of successful colonization."
Indeed, if John Rolfe, who married Pocahontas, had not developed a hybrid tobacco in 1613 that won a ready market in London and the first economic boost for the colony, historians say, Jamestown would have become just another Colonial failure.
An earlier English settlement, in 1584 at Roanoke Island, in present-day North Carolina, was a disastrous failure. In 1562, French Huguenots had no more luck with their Charlesfort, the site of which on the South Carolina coast was discovered earlier this year.
In 1565, the Spanish founded St. Augustine in what is now Florida and which is the oldest permanent European settlement in North America outside Mexico.
Jamestown's early tribulations were many. As Samuel Eliot Morison wrote in "The Oxford History of the American People," the colonists "made the usual mistake of first-comers in America by settling on a low, swampy island." They also put down among a mighty Indian confederacy, which made its first attack on the fort on May 26, 1607.
So because of malaria, starvation and death at the hands of Indians, only 38 of the original 104 settlers lived through the first year. High mortality and bad management led to rumblings of mutiny, which provoked harsh punishment. Supply ships from England were few and inadequate; one relief ship became wrecked on Bermuda, an event that inspired Shakespeare's "Tempest."
"It's incredible that the colony survived," said Dr. Axtell, the historian at William and Mary. "There was 80 percent mortality in the first 15 years. They had no way to make money in the first years. They were a poorly organized community and ill supplied. And their relations with the native people were probably the poorest of any place."
An account of the settlement written in 1610 described the original fort as triangular in shape with a 360-foot wall on the river side and the other two sides 300 feet long. Two sides of the fort form a 46.5-degree angle, identical to the number given in the written account.
The palisades were made of vertical planks and posts of oak and walnut. From the new excavations, it now appears that only 20 percent of the original fort may have been lost to the river. When the fort burned in 1608, it was replaced with a five-sided fort enclosing about four acres.
The excavators were surprised by the number of military artifacts at the site, said Dr. Kelso of the Antiquities Association. In a trash pile buried near one building, they found a helmet and metal breast plate of the type Captain Smith is depicted wearing in a contemporary engraving.
Archeologists also found a smoking pipe, marked with the letter S. "I'm not saying it's his," Dr. Kelso said, referring to Smith. "But who knows?"
The most recent discovery was of a young man's skeleton in a grave inside the fort. Forensic experts from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington examined the skeleton on Wednesday.
From the outline of wood decay and presence of nails, the scientists said, the man had been buried in a wooden coffin. The shape of the nose, teeth and cheek bones indicated that he was a European. Archeologists suspected that he was buried in the first two or three years of the colony.
Dr. Douglas W. Owsley, a forensic anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, said the man had definitely met a violent end. Both the tibia and fibula of the right lower leg were fractured, with a metal ball resting at the fracture site. There was a hole in one of the shoulder blades, which could be another gunshot wound.
Since the Indians did not have guns at that time, was this evidence of a murder among disgruntled settlers, an accident or an execution? That will be a problem for historians, who must comb through colony documents searching for references to men dying of gunshot wounds.
Dr. Owsley said there was an account of a man who had been killed as the result of a mutiny but also an account of an Indian who had seized a gun from a settler and shot him.
Anthropologists are more interested in studying the skeleton and any others found at the fort for insights into the nutrition, diseases and other physical conditions of early 17th-century people living in the harsh Colonial circumstances.
The fort site has so far yielded nothing to embellish the familiar story of Captain Smith and Pocahontas. Many historians suspect that elements of the story border on myth.
In an interview, Dr. Axtell of William and Mary said historical documents had failed to support the notion that Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a love affair. But she did go out of her way, often at great risk, to bring food to the English and warn them of impending attacks.
"I read her as a kind of traitor to her people, particularly to her father, Powhatan," the historian said.
Moreover, according to revisionist history, when Captain Smith was captured by Indians, he was held hostage and exchanged for goods, not freed by Pocahontas.
"The story that she saved him was added in much later editions of Smith's writings, as an afterthought," Dr. Kelso said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT -- THE SOUTH;
If Clinton Sees Votes in South, He's Not Just Whistling Dixie

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Sept. 12

 BODY:
The most remarkable thing about Bob Dole's visit to Tennessee this week, his third in the last month, was that he had to come here at all.
Only two years ago this was the epicenter of a vast political shift in the South: Tennessee voters gave the Republicans a clean sweep of the state's two Senate seats and the governor's office, all of which had been held by Democrats. 
 Stunned by the hostility toward President Clinton, his advisers said at the time that their best hopes in the South for 1996 -- and they were not much more than hopes -- were that they could hang on to Tennessee, because Vice President Al Gore is a native son, and to Arkansas, because it is Mr. Clinton's home state.
But with eight weeks until Election Day, Republicans now find themselves trying to foil the Democrats' far more ambitious -- and suddenly not-so-farfetched -- designs on the region.
Although Mr. Dole assured supporters at a rally in nearby Murfreesboro on Tuesday that "we're going to carry the state of Tennessee," a poll of registered Tennessee voters, issued today by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research, suggested that doing so would be a struggle. Among those likely to cast ballots, Mr. Clinton drew 48 percent, Mr. Dole 37 percent, and Ross Perot 2 percent.
Not only is the President leading Mr. Dole, or running neck and neck with him, in polls in Tennessee and the four other Southern or Border states Mr. Clinton won four years ago -- Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana -- he is also competitive in Florida and North Carolina. No Democratic Presidential nominee has won either of those two states since Jimmy Carter in 1976, although Mr. Clinton himself came close in 1992. The President is even threatening Mr. Dole in Virginia, which no Democrat has captured since President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.
"It's scary from the Republican standpoint," A. Linwood Holton, a former Republican Governor of Virginia, said of Democratic prospects in his state. "The vote in statewide elections in Virginia turns on middle-of-the-road voters. And there are a lot of people who don't like the very, very heavy baggage that Dole carries from the Republican platform."
The President's ability to stay competitive in the South -- and so force Mr. Dole and Jack Kemp to campaign extensively there, depriving them of precious time in the showdown states of the Midwest -- demonstrates that after being vilified throughout the region early in his term for raising taxes and promising to end the military's ban on service by homosexuals, he has had some success in repositioning himself as a cultural conservative. It helps, of course, that the Southern economy is fairly healthy and that many voters do not sound especially enthusiastic about Mr. Dole.
While Mr. Dole also seems to have been hurt by his association with Speaker Newt Gingrich, who remains quite unpopular, Republican officials are far more optimistic about prospects that the party will pick up House seats in the region. Some express hope for a "reverse coattails" effect, in which the popularity of Republican candidates in Congressional races would lead voters to turn out for Mr. Dole as well.
But by and large Republicans are increasingly concerned. While Mr. Clinton could lose most of the Southern states and still retain the White House, the South is the foundation of Mr. Dole's electoral strategy, and the only Southern states where he appears to have a comfortable edge are the Republican strongholds of Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina, although he is also ahead in polls in Texas, rich in electoral votes.
"If Dole has to fight for states like Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, he's fighting behind his own 40-yard line," said Robert Joffee, a vice president of Mason-Dixon, which polls extensively in the South. "These are states that Bush won in 1992, and one would think a competent Republican campaign would have sewn them up some time ago."
His weakness in the South also complicates Mr. Dole's issues strategy: to attract Southern voters, he needs to emphasize policy issues, as well as questions about Mr. Clinton's character, that may not find so welcome an audience elsewhere. Republicans are reminding voters in North Carolina and Kentucky, major tobacco-growing states, of Mr. Clinton's efforts to regulate cigarette makers, Mr. Dole's opposition to which has not played well nationally.
Still, Mr. Dole's best chance for a comeback is in the South, which remains the weakest region for the all-Southern Democratic ticket. Mr. Clinton's lead in the South as a whole is narrower than anywhere else -- a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted last week showed that the margin was 16 points among registered voters around the country, as against 9 points among those in the South -- and surveys show that Southern voters express even greater disapproval of his character than do those elsewhere.
Republicans argue that Mr. Dole is just beginning to fight back after being the target of months of advertising that the Clinton campaign has showered on several Southern states.
"I wish the race were tighter; I wish we didn't have as much ground to make up," said Ted Welch, a major Republican fund-raiser in Nashville. "But I do believe the race is winnable."
One illustration of Mr. Clinton's change of fortunes is that Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a Democrat who sparred with the President throughout the Administration's first two years -- and on one occasion did not show up at a Clinton appearance in Atlanta -- has signed on as co-chairman of the President's re-election effort in the state. "He agreed to, and is serving, and that's a statement," said Gordon Giffin, an Atlanta lawyer who for years was Mr. Nunn's chief fund-raiser.
Dole campaign officials say that they expect the race to tighten nationally and that the first states to move in the challenger's favor will be in the South. Seeking those inroads, the campaign is relentlessly emphasizing Mr. Dole's proposal for a 15 percent cut in personal income tax rates, and underscoring character as well. Introducing Mr. Dole at the Murfreesboro rally, Gov. Don Sundquist said: "He's a man of character, and character does count in public life. He offers mature judgment. And isn't it time we had an adult in the White House?"
But many Republicans are fearful that Mr. Dole's message is not sinking in, that he has not given voters a reason to back him. More than one supporter of his noted that the front-page article in The Tennessean about his visit here did not reflect what he would do to help voters in the state.
Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in Atlanta, said Mr. Dole needed "to get some muscle behind his message." Once that happens, he said, Mr. Dole could pull ahead.
"These states are all close," Mr. Ayres said. "There are a lot of voters in the middle who have gone from moderately opposed to Clinton to moderately in favor of him. But they are hardly in his corner yet."
Several voters from Murfreesboro, interviewed at random in July 1994 and again this week, say that although they backed Republicans in the off-year elections two years ago and have little nice to say about Mr. Clinton, they are torn over how to vote this fall.
Michael Henderson, a 47-year-old teacher who backed President George Bush in 1992 and Republicans in 1994, said he was still deciding between Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton.
"I'm trying to keep an open mind," Mr. Henderson said. Struggling to explain his reservations about the 73-year-old Mr. Dole, he went on: "I don't know whether it's his age, or what. Or maybe it's some of his comments about teachers."
Jeff Sweatt, 29, a former shipping company supervisor who recently went back to college, also voted Republican in the last two elections. He too said he was trying to decide, between Mr. Dole and Ross Perot.
"I like Bob Dole -- he's an honest man," Mr. Sweatt said. "But I think he's got an uphill battle beating Clinton." Asked to explain why Mr. Dole was down in the polls, he replied, "I really don't understand the American public."

HEADLINE: Nation of Islam Guards Ordered to Leave Housing Project

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 12

 BODY:
The Pataki administration has ordered the managers of a state-financed housing project in Brooklyn to break a contract with a security group associated with the Nation of Islam, responding to complaints that the group has been passing out anti-Semitic literature.
But residents of the project, Ocean Towers in Coney Island, immediately expressed outrage at the order, saying that the group, X-Men Security, had greatly improved security in an area once plagued by drug deals, shootouts and other violence. They said the presence of the Nation of Islam guards had brought order back into daily life in the cavernous project. 
 The group was awarded the security contract, now worth $360,000 a year, by the company that runs the building, BSR Management, in the summer of 1993. The previous security agency had been dismissed because some of its guards had been found to be involved the drug trade in the project.
With the new sense of calm that the Nation of Islam guards, in their characteristic business suits and bow ties, brought to the area, vacancies at the 360-unit project dropped to 5 from 50, according to the management company.
"I really think this is a sad day," said Sheila Boyd, president of the Ocean Towers Tenants Association. "That group got rid of the drug dealers and criminals. People were begging to move in here because it was so safe. Now, all I can do is pray that things don't get worse again."
Still, pressure on Gov. George E. Pataki to remove the X-Men from the project had been strong; politicians and Jewish organizations repeatedly complained that the group had tried to recruit members during patrols, passed out racist pamphlets and hung posters of Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, in hallways and lobbies.
A spokeswoman for the Governor, Zenia Mucha, said today that the management company would end its contract with the X-Men as of Oct. 10 because officials at the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal had found flaws in it. Ms. Mucha said the Governor had directed the agency to review the contract because of the allegations made against the X-Men.
"We certainly have a problem with the fact that the leader of this organization is a person who practices anti-Semitism," she said, referring to Mr. Farrakhan.
Groups associated with the Nation of Islam have conducted similar patrols in public housing complexes around the country, including Baltimore, Washington and Pittsburgh, often ridding these places of drugs and crime. Those groups have also been accused of proselytizing and vigilantism.
The Ocean Towers complex is privately owned but was built with state money under an agreement that a certain percentage of apartment units be set aside for low-income families.
The first complaints about the X-Men date to 1993, when the group began sending guards to the projects. In testimony last year before a Congressional subcommittee looking into the Nation of Islam security details at public housing complexes, Jules Polinetsky, a Democratic Assemblyman from Brooklyn, said that the X-Men had been distributing issues of the Final Call, the Nation of Islam newspaper, at the Ocean Towers complex.
"In this paper," he testified, "white men are called wicked and filthy, Jews are called bloodsuckers, and the Pope is described as the leader of organized crime on this earth."
But attempts by the state to remove the group met with strong opposition from residents and building managers, who said it was doing a good job. Mr. Pataki himself, in a July 26 letter to Mr. Polinetsky, said vacancy rates had declined sharply since the X-Men's arrival.
Today, Mr. Polinetsky expressed satisfaction with the administration's decision but criticized the length of time it had taken. "The Nation of Islam did a good job at providing security but did a better job at proselytizing," he said. "Mussolini made the trains run on time, but that did not make Fascism an acceptable evil."
But residents of the complex expressed dismay, saying the X-Men had been criticized by people with a vendetta against the Nation of Islam.
"If they move, I'm moving," said Jeanie Booker, a resident. "These drug dealers are waiting for the X-Men to leave so they can come back. The X-Men are the only ones who have been able to get them to leave. I don't know why they are trying to get rid of them."

HEADLINE: Don't Start New York on School Vouchers Path;
Don't Siphon Gas Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Gas Tax Could Help Our Cities," by Felix Rohatyn (Op-Ed, Sept. 11): Wrong. It would be wrong to use a Federal gas tax for school improvements or anything other than transportation maintenance. Federal gas-tax revenues should be dedicated only to the Highway Trust Fund. Breaking this trust in 1993 has already resulted in serious decay of roads and bridges. Economic development and jobs would suffer under Mr. Rohatyn's plan, as would the tax base that now pays for most school improvements. 
 Education is the responsibility of local and state governments. If unrealistic debt limits are the problem, they should be increased to allow for longer-term repayment. When it comes to educating the nation's young, who will pay off the debt as productive adults, the expense is well worth it.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Follows Stocks and Bonds In Rise, Ignoring Weaker Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark and Japanese yen yesterday, aided by rising stocks and bonds, even though weaker-than-expected economic data eased speculation that the Federal Reserve would push up interest rates.
The dollar again reached two-month highs against the yen and mark, its third time in recent sessions, after initially dropping on news of scant rises in consumer prices and retail sales for August. 
 Both statistics indicated inflation was in check, creating less need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to avert inflation at its Sept. 24 meeting.
But the dollar shot up shortly after that, supported in part by spiking stock and bond prices. Foreign investors bought dollars to invest in American securities.
"Because the dollar was not significantly hurt by this morning's data, that only boosted the confidence of traders who were already dollar bullish," said Tom O'Malley, a senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data in Boston. "The dollar has built upside momentum over the past week," he said.
In late New York trading, the dollar traded at 1.5134 marks, up from 1.5125 Thursday. The dollar traded at 110.35 yen, up from 110.20 yen.
The British pound traded at $1.5535, down from $1.5545.
The dollar has risen 3 pfennigs, or nearly 0.05 percent, since Sept. 4, largely on speculation that the Fed will raise interest rates.
"The dollar in general was supported by what I think was good news from U.S. data today, which showed continued growth in the U.S. economy with moderate inflation pressure," said Lisa Finstrom, a senior currency analyst at Smith Barney Inc.
However, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor, said yesterday that despite the weak data, the economy "still looks robust." Analysts said the comments supported their contentions that the Fed still might raise rates, but they came too late to influence the market.
Mr. Lindsey sits on the central bank's policy-making committee that will decide whether to raise rates.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, were: 1.2434 Swiss francs, up from 1.2373; 5.1550 French francs, down from 5.1601; 1,521 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.3695 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3714.

Opposition Grows in Brazil To High Domestic Air Fares

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 13

 BODY:
As Brazil moves slowly toward selling off state companies and trimming government's regulatory role, its airlines have become an anomaly: an industry forced to bear high costs and tight regulation while still charging high domestic fares that most Brazilians cannot afford.
But opposition is growing in a country where it is often cheaper to fly from Sao Paulo to Miami than to Manaus, despite the greater distance. A consumer group's campaign to deregulate domestic air fares has drawn unexpected support. 
 At just four airports over eight days last month, more than 20,000 travelers signed petitions complaining of the high cost of domestic air fares, said Danilo Santana, national president of the Brazilian Consumers Association, which ran the campaign. The number of signatures was all the more noteworthy since the airports, which are government run, limited the consumers group to two volunteers at each airport.
The instant support for the campaign among passengers has put the airlines, accustomed to protection in determining prices and to lax enforcement of consumer rights, on the defensive. As Brazil moves slowly toward privatization of state-run industries and dismantling of regulation, the campaign appears to have struck a chord at a politically opportune moment.
Before the petitioning campaign even closed, Francisco Dornelles, Minister of Industry and Commerce, gave the Government tourism board 30 days to come up with recommendations to reduce the cost of domestic tourism, particularly air travel.
"Tourism is a priority, and we're going to do everything to reduce its cost," Mr. Dornelles said, adding that the Government would move to reduce some of the heavy taxes, including a 33 percent tax on kerosene, that Brazilian airlines cite for the high cost of domestic travel.
"The move toward liberalization is unstoppable," said Robert C. Booth, president of Aviation Management Services, a Miami-based consulting firm to many Latin American airlines. "The country can't embrace the free market system and ignore things like this. Airline deregulation is one of the last things they're going to do, but they've got to do it."
Flying remains an elite form of transportation in Brazil, despite the country's size. Only 5 percent of all Brazilians have ever flown, and 80 percent of all air travel is for business, according to industry figures. In the United States, only 30 percent of the population had been on an airplane before prices were deregulated in 1978. With deregulation, prices dropped 50 percent and the share of people flying reached 70 percent, Mr. Booth said.
Domestic prices in Brazil are proposed by the airlines and approved by the Department of Commercial Aviation. In addition to controlling which airlines may serve which routes, the agency sets upper and lower bands for prices, limiting promotional fares to 30 to 50 percent of the full economy fare. The president of the department, Joao Felipe Lacerda Jr., declined to respond to written questions for this article.
The airlines say the cost of fuel in Brazil is 40 percent greater than in the United States. They also cite high interest rates and inefficient, Government-run airports as reasons for their heavy costs. They also dispute the contention that fares are higher here than in the United States, and note that Brazilian airlines began offering limited discounts in 1992.
"Right now, we have a flexibility that can be considered the beginning of deregulation," said Ramiro Tojal, president of the Brazilian Airline Association. "I don't think deregulation itself will solve anything."
In an attempt to defend itself against the mounting criticism, Transbrasil took out full-page newspaper ads contending that Brazilian prices were similar to those in the United States and Europe. The advertisement compared full economy fares in the United States and Brazil, a somewhat misleading demonstration, since unlike Brazil, 90 percent of all travelers in the United States fly using discounted tickets, Mr. Booth said. At Varig, Brazil's largest airline, only 28 percent of domestic tickets are sold at less than full economy fares, a spokesman said.
The ad also compared a $295 round-trip Rio-Sao Paulo shuttle ticket not with the similarly priced New York to Washington shuttle, for which steep weekend discounts are available, but with a $419 fare between Kennedy and Dulles airports. The Rio-Sao Paulo shuttle offers no discounts.
"We want to compete in quality, service, frequency, not only in price," Mr. Tojal said.
But it is prices that are on the minds of consumers here. "People are not complaining about what kind of food they get served on board," Mr. Santana said. "They're thinking about more basic things, like how their baggage is handled and how much they pay for a ticket."
Mr. Santana said the association had found that fares were related not so much to distance or frequency of flights or airport costs but to the degree of competition. "Where there's competition, the prices are lower; where there's no competition, it's much higher," he said. "When our companies have to compete with an American company on international flights, those are very low, competitive prices. But if it's a route where the airline has the authorization to cover that route and is protected from open competition, the rates get higher."

HEADLINE: Consumer Price Index Barely Rises, Easing Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in August, the Labor Department disclosed today, a better performance than expected and one that economists regarded as solid confirmation that inflation remains in check.
Shoppers, meanwhile, spent at a subdued pace last month, sending retail sales up by a modest two-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department reported. 
 The two sets of figures, perhaps more important than any still to come before a crucial meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers on Sept. 24, seemed to further diminish -- but by no means rule out -- the chance that the central bank would decide to raise short-term interest rates to restrain an overheated economy.
"The numbers encourage the view that the Fed won't tighten at its September meeting," said Paul W. Boltz, chief economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. "The urgency goes out of it when inflation looks this good."
Today's numbers followed the Government's report on Thursday that prices received by American producers climbed three-tenths of 1 percent last month, but that price index actually declined slightly when the erratic food and energy components were removed.
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for the Chase Regional Bank, said today that inflation posed little immediate threat. He noted that there was wide agreement that prices were rising even less than was being registered by the Consumer Price Index, and that Fed policy was already restrictive as gauged by the inflation-adjusted rate for Federal funds, the overnight lending rate among banks.
He played down the recent creeping up of wages, saying it was more a reflection of higher skills than of general wage acceleration.
"What business is doing, having cut costs as much as it could, is to invest in technology," Mr. Kellner said. More technicians, he added, mean larger numbers of people in higher-paid jobs.
But Paul L. Kasriel of the Northern Trust Company in Chicago contended today that it was time for the Fed to remove the "punch bowl" from the economic party, invoking the definition of a central banker's job used by William McChesney Martin Jr., the Fed chairman in the 1950's and 1960's.
"Human-capital capacity appears to be getting strained," Mr. Kasriel said, adding that an acceleration in wages is a natural result of efforts to attract new workers and retain current ones.
Securities markets rallied today on the twin reports, with interest rates sliding across the board and the Dow Jones industrial average soaring 66.58 points, or 1.15 percent, to a record of 5,838.52, surpassing the high of 5,778 set May 22.
Today's price report, which included a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in so-called core items in August, showed that overall inflation was down to 2.9 percent for the latest 12 months and was at an annual rate of 1.8 percent over the latest three months.
Although analysts noted that the Consumer Price Index was a lagging rather than a predictive indicator, further reassurance came today from a poll of members of the National Federation of Independent Business.
The survey found that only 18 percent of 800 respondents raised prices this summer while 13 percent cut them, the most benign inflation results this year. And it said that only 20 percent of respondents planned to raise prices in coming months, with two-thirds of those planning increases of less than 5 percent. The survey also found that service industries were no more likely to raise prices than others were.
The price index last month was held down by a third consecutive easing in energy costs, which fell six-tenths of 1 percent; gasoline dropped 2 percent, more than offsetting a rise in household fuels. Food prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent, reflecting increases for meats, poultry, fish and dairy products.
Housing costs ebbed after a July surge related to out-of-town lodging; the August decline came despite a 2 percent jump in the cost of intrastate telephone calls. In transportation, automobile finance charges climbed 1.8 percent, but the price of used cars was unchanged after four consecutive declines.
Apparel prices, the report showed, dropped 1.4 percent, reflecting the slower introduction of higher-priced fall and winter wear coupled with large declines for spring and summer wear. The cost of college tuition and schoolbooks and supplies rose 1 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.
The report on August retail sales showed a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent for durable goods -- those intended to last at least three years -- and an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent for nondurables.
Stores selling general merchandise posted a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent, and apparel stores also did well. But merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes had a decline of seven-tenths of 1 percent, and furniture sales were also down.
Food stores and bars and restaurants also had lower revenue. A drop at gasoline stations reflected lower prices, rather than less volume.

HEADLINE: New Delay on Iraq Oil Sale

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Signaling more delays in plans for Iraq to sell oil to raise money for food and medicine, the United States says it needs more time to study how to set the price for the oil, diplomats said today. The plan was already on hold because of the conflict in Iraq.
The United Nations committee that monitors sanctions on Iraq would have approved the price formula had none of the 15 members objected. A Deputy Secretary General, Chinmaya Gharekhan, said one member had delayed approval, but he declined to identify the country. 
 American officials had no comment.

HEADLINE: Judge's Efforts Gain a Reprieve for Farberware Factory in the Bronx

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Under pressure from a state judge, the company that closed the Farberware plant in the Bronx eight days ago agreed yesterday to reopen it temporarily to give government officials more time to find someone to buy and operate it permanently.
At a hearing in which Justice Douglas E. McKeon of State Supreme Court in the Bronx stressed that his priority was to preserve jobs, U.S. Industries of Edison, N.J., agreed to reopen the plant for at least a week and possibly up to three months, and to rehire some of the 700 laid-off workers. 
 City and state officials had sought Justice McKeon's help in keeping the plant open because they said it would be far easier to find a buyer for an operating plant than a shuttered one. They asserted that U.S. Industries had breached a promise to operate the plant until 2006. In exchange for that promise, they said, U.S. Industries had been allowed to rent the state-owned building at below-market rates in 1981.
At a testy daylong hearing in Justice McKeon's chambers, company executives agreed to reopen the plant for one week starting Wednesday and to rehire 120 workers. By the end of the day, city and state officials expressed confidence that a deal could be reached to keep the plant going for three months, but U.S. Industries executives said any such agreement would depend on whether the company could obtain more raw materials for the plant.
The justice made his sympathies clear. "There are families with real problems and real concerns who are impacted by this," he said. "I am most interested in trying to restore hope to these people."
A government official involved in the negotiations called his strategy "judicial capitalism," and several other negotiators agreed that the efforts of the city, state and judge to twist the company's arm to reopen a plant were extraordinary.
U.S. Industries lawyers criticized what they saw as improper government meddling in the free-enterprise system, arguing that the city and state had no basis for asking a judge to keep the plant open. But Frank Mahoney, executive vice president of the Empire State Development Corporation, asserted that the company had violated its 1981 contract. "We're trying to show that when a company makes a promise to us, we're not just going to let them walk away from it," he said.
Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said: "For 15 years, these people have had the benefits of the bargain. Now the Mayor wants the city to have its benefits of the bargain."
In April, U.S. Industries sold the Farberware name and the machinery from the factory -- the largest in the Bronx -- to the Syratech Corporation. Within weeks, word emerged of Syratech's licensing of the Farberware name to another cookware company. This convinced many workers that the factory's demise was imminent. They doubted that consumers would buy cookware lacking the renowned Farberware name.
Under the original arrangement between U.S. Industries and Syratech, the former operated the factory and the latter marketed the pots and pans. This explains why U.S. Industries remains involved in the factory's fate: It retains the lease and responsibility for the workers.
In Justice McKeon's hearings, U.S. Industries and Syratech sought to portray each other as villains. When U.S. Industries officials began by saying that they would not even discuss keeping the plant open for three months unless Syratech paid $4.5 million in bills, Syratech's lawyer lambasted U.S. Industries for putting debt collection above the good of 700 workers.
Then lawyers for U.S. Industries attacked Syratech for having doomed the plant by licensing away the Farberware name. U.S. Industries officials said Syratech had hidden an important piece of information in May when it was negotiating with the city, state and workers about turning Farberware into an employee-owned factory. During those talks, Syratech failed to inform city and state officials that it had already licensed away the Farberware name.
"The fact is both companies are villains," said Ben Camadeco, president of the Teamsters local representing Farberware's workers.
Syratech, which has repeatedly been attacked by Farberware's workers, recently sought to alleviate their anger by agreeing to work with the city and state to keep the plant open until Dec. 8. But U.S. Industries executives have stressed the difficulties of selling the cookware without the Farberware name.
U.S. Industries officials said that even with an agreement to extend the plant's life by three months, the factory would have to be closed for most of October because it could take 6 to 10 weeks to obtain needed raw materials. State and city officials vowed to press suppliers to deliver raw materials faster than that.
Outside Justice McKeon's chambers sat more than 40 laid-off Farberware workers, who awaited word of their fate. "A lot of us worked there for years, even decades," said Hamilton Fields, a mechanic. "Now it's all down the drain. It's very hard on the nerves."

HEADLINE: Flare-up of Gang Gunfire Vexes, Gary, Ind.

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: GARY, Ind., Sept. 13

 BODY:
This faded steel town, which has had stubbornly high crime statistics for years, had a quiet summer and a 34 percent drop in its murder rate for the year so far, primarily, city officials say, because of increased anti-gang efforts.
But the quiet ended on Wednesday with two drive-by shootings at local high schools, followed by several hours of gunfire and a gang-related shootout at a public housing development, where gang members in bulletproof vests armed with semiautomatic weapons darted between the buildings and the trees, firing at each other and the police. 
 Athough no one was killed, Mayor Scott L. King issued a citywide state of emergency, tightened the curfew and increased police patrols.
"We will not tolerate this ever happening again in this city," Mr. King said today in an interview.
"There were an incredible number of shots fired at the housing development, endangering hundreds of innocent people. It's a miracle no one was hurt."
With the two high schools holding football games against separate opponents tonight, there were fears of further violence. But at Roosevelt High School, which is next to the housing development, about 100 students and their parents gathered to watch game without incident. At the other game, at West Side High School, there were no reports of any violence, either.
"Everything looks fine," Mr. King said after visiting both games, each of which had their usual police contingent of about a half-dozen officers.
At a news conference on Thursday, a Gary police officer who was at the housing development during the shootout seemed on the verge of tears as he described the intensity of the gunfire that was finally quelled when police officials sent in the SWAT team. The streets have been quiet for the last two days as investigators try to piece together the motives behind the shootings and determine if they were related.
"Who knows right now," Mr. King said, throwing up his hands and then lighting his third cigarette in 10 minutes. "We're dealing with people who might draw and fire their guns over a disagreement over a baseball score."
But residents of the housing development, the Delaney Housing Complex, say they know the answer: the quick flash of drug cash.
"This is all about drugs," said Marietta Powell, a 41-year-old mother of five, who is afraid to allow her children out to play. "They have no jobs in this city for young people, so they're killing each other up over drugs."
Jobs have been hard to find in Gary for a long time, ever since the steel mills began to cut back a generation ago. In the 1960's the mills employed 30,000. Today, the number is closer to 5,000. Downtown Gary is one long strip of empty stores and burned out buildings, the American Dream in reverse.
But last June, two riverboat casinos, one of them owned by Donald Trump, opened on the city's edge and officials and residents were cautiously talking about a comeback on a wave of $20 million a year in revenue from the boats.
"We're going to devote a lot of those dollars to public safety," the Mayor said then.
Still, gangs have long haunted this city, which is just 30 minutes from Chicago and has some of the biggest gangs in the country. Last year, 50 Indiana State Troopers helped patrol Gary for several months and last spring, Mr. King said the gangs put a bounty on his head because he refused to allow them to use a city building to hold what they said were peace talks.
"It was a whopping $3,000," Mayor King said with a smirk. "My response was to crack down on them." Mr. King said the main reason Gary was relatively quiet this summer was because the Police Department's gang unit was able to keep the gangs separated.
But the resumption of school, where rival gang members are often under one roof during the day, may have set the stage for this week's outbreak of violence.
On Thursday, hours after the shootings, Mayor King started his day by addressing 100 of the city's top honor students.
"I spent 20 minutes with them and 12 hours worrying about a few goofballs," Mr. King said. "People have to remember that only a small minority of kids are involved in the gangs. You can't demonize young people over all."
The "day from hell," as one resident described it, began at 12:30 P.M. with a drive-by shooting at Lew-Wallace High School on the city's West Side.
A few hours later, as hundreds of students poured out of a high school at the end of the day on Gary's Far West Side, shots were again fired from a passing car.
Then as dusk fell over the city 116,000 residents, the police were called to the Delaney development to investigate reports of even more gunshots. When the first two officers arrived, they saw four armed men fleeing the scene but who were caught after a chase by one officer on foot.
"It's amazing, he wasn't killed," the Mayor said. As the crime technicians were inspecting the area, a resident told them that she had just seen four more men in bullet proofvests, carrying rifles. Then a barrage of gunfire lit up the night and the officer drove for cover. The SWAT was called in but the men had escaped.
Today, all was quiet outside Lew-Wallace as Doris Scott, 15, waited for her father, Elton, to pick up her. Mr. Scott, 38, a building contractor, said he had wanted his daughter to attend parochial school but "we didn't have the finances."
Now, after the shooting, he is more determined than ever to raise the money.
Doris said she was afraid.
"You might get shot for wearing the wrong gym shoes," she said, "or for wearing your cap the wrong way. When I see a group of boys together, I get scared."
A few miles away at the Delaney development, Ms. Powell, the mother of five, said she was also scared. She has lived in the development of one-story buildings, twisting streets, neat lawns and shade trees for two years. The beauty of the place hides the danger, she said, adding when she and her family first moved in her daughter saw a man get shot in the head.
"This has been going on for too long around here," she said. "I applaud the Mayor for doing something. But its hard to live here."
But what concerns her more than any noise in the night is what her 18-month-old son did after the shooting.
"He was going, 'Boom, Boom,' like he was shooting a gun," she said. "He had never done that before. This madness is affecting everybody."

Dow at a Record 5,838.52; Bonds and the Dollar Rally
The stock market surged to a record, keeping alive one of history's greatest bull markets and erasing a midsummer downturn that had many analysts predicting the end of good times on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.2 percent, or 68.58, to 5,838.52, eclipsing its May 22 record of 5,778.
The bond market also rallied, as long-term interest rates fell below 7 percent, to 6.95. Behind the surge was economic news showing inflation in check, lessening fears that the Fed will push up interest rates. [Page 1.]
 
The dollar rose against the mark and yen, reaching two-month highs. It followed stocks and bonds upward, despite the weaker-than-expected economic data. Foreigners bought dollars in order to buy American securities. In New York the dollar edged up to 1.5134 marks. [34.]
 
Oil Futures Prices Tumble
Crude oil futures plunged with the contract for October delivery down 49 cents, to $24.51 a barrel, after tensions with Iraq eased. [34.]
 
F.A.A. Faulted on Airport Security
A newly issued Government report says that in inspecting airport security, F.A.A. agents sometimes overstated how well airports performed and made efforts to help airlines do well on the inspections. [1.]
 
In the Tobacco Economy: Alarm
Tobacco is the main cash crop in Kentucky and much of the South, and now a whiff of national politics has tobacco farmers in full alarm. Many local Democratic politicians find themselves opposing President Clinton. [1.]
 
Compuserve Backpedals on Profit
Compuserve retracted a prediction of profits made by one of its executives. Steven Stanbrook, Compuserve's president of international operations, had said in Munich that based on the strength of European operations, "for the year as a whole we will be making a strong profit." [32.]
 
Japanese Economy Shrinks 0.7%
Japan's economy contracted seven-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter. It was the first time economic output had declined since 1994's final quarter, but the Government said the nation's recovery was continuing. [32.]
 
A Mistrial in California Bankruptcy
A mistrial was declared in the first criminal trial related to the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., that of the former budget director, Ronald S. Rubino. [44.]
 
Brazilian Air Travelers Restive
As Brazil moves slowly toward privatization of state-run industries and dismantling of regulation, a travelers' campaign opposing the high cost of domestic air fares appears to have struck a chord at an opportune moment. [32.]
 
Nestle Profits Advance 20%
Nestle, the world's largest food and beverage company, said its net profit rose 20 percent, to 1.35 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) in the first half of 1996, but its stock price fell 10 Swiss francs to 1,413, as investors focused on stagnant trading results. Heineken, the Dutch brewer, reported a 6.1 percent profit rise. [32.]
 
The Hottest Shop in Moscow
Moscow's hottest store is suitably named Arrears. Bargain hunters rush to buy the latest booty seized by the Moscow tax police -- boxes of down coats going for the equivalent of $17, and even a 10-year-old Hungarian-made bus for $19,000. [4.]
 
Mexican Publisher Arrested
The owner of one of Mexico's biggest newspapers, El Universal, was arrested on charges of criminal tax fraud and evasion. Juan Francisco Ealy Ortiz, the owner and publisher, contended the Government was cracking down on dissent in the press. [5.]

HEADLINE: On Eve of Election in Bosnia, Peace Is a Last Resort

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: TRNOVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sept. 13

 BODY:
With most of its villages in ruins, its forests and fields saturated with land mines, its infrastructure so devastated that an entire generation can expect little more than a life of drudgery and poverty, and its people plagued by memories of slaughter and loss, Bosnia can hardly be considered at peace.
But the warfare that raged in this land's hamlets and cities for nearly four years has sputtered out in exhaustion, with hate and fury often smothered by pain and mourning. And the main hope, as ethnic Croats, Muslims and Serbs vote on Saturday in the first elections in six years, is that the fighting never resume. 
 "We can live with anything now except war," said Sofija Jokic, 62, as she and her husband boiled pieces of pumpkin in a blackened pot over a wood fire here in a once idyllic mountain town that changed hands four times during the war and now is little more than a patch of ruins. "The rest does not interest us."
Bosnians are struggling to make a place for themselves in a land where, for many, a pane of glass is a coveted luxury and a small cabbage patch the only thing that stands between a family and hunger. Most simply want a job. And most watch in disgust as the few jobs available in the three ethnic regions go to supporters of the three dominant parties.
"Those of us who refuse to define ourselves as Serbs or Croats or Muslims no longer have a place in Bosnia," said Liljana Kljakic, a 28-year-old Serb from Sarajevo who joined the Muslim-led Bosnian Army during the war and whose father was killed in Sarajevo by a Serbian grenade. "It is as if we have no identity. I will leave soon for Australia."
It is left for the international architects of these elections to debate whether the Croats, Serbs and Muslims who will vote for a three-member presidency and joint parliament will create -- as Washington hopes -- common institutions that will unify the splintered country. Most Bosnians seem beyond caring about that abstract goal. Not a few see in the current de facto partition an end to the conflicts that caused so much misery and grief.
The deep antipathy to war is also accompanied, for many, by a demonization of opposing ethnic groups. Muslims, Croats and Serbs who insist they did not want the conflict blame their opponents for the carnage. Many Serbs and Croats say they would be happy to keep the country divided.
Muslims, especially their leaders and the hundreds of thousands who were expelled from their homes in the process of "ethnic cleansing," are more apt to want to reunify the country -- under a Muslim-led Government.
In the vision of the Dayton peace pact, Bosnia was by now supposed to be a place where refugees could go back to destroyed homes, where a Muslim or a Serb or a Croat could travel freely and where there was freedom to express divergent political views. That Bosnia has not emerged, but under pressure from the United States and European nations -- anxious to bring their military involvement to a quick end -- the elections are proceeding anyway.
The country remains divided in three ethnic enclaves.
The Bosnian Croats, despite the fiction of a federation with the Muslims, carry Croatian passports, use Croatian currency and continue to expel Muslims from the swath of territory they control in the southwest.
The Muslims have refused to allow tens of thousands of Serbs who fled Sarajevo during the war to return to their homes, saying the apartments now belong to the Muslim squatters who took them over.
And the Bosnian Serbs continue to beat and stone small groups of Muslims who try to come back to visit former homes and the graves of their relatives.
Trnovo saw as much of the war as any village in Bosnia: most buildings lack roofs, windows and four complete walls; the main street is pock-marked with huge craters left by artillery shells; its three small factories are blackened hulks. The town changed hands four times during the fighting, before being taken in 1993 by the Bosnian Serbs.
Most of the 1,800 people who still live here are elderly; all of them are Serbs, and many were driven out of Muslim towns.
Trnovo lies inside the demilitarized zone of separation that cuts across Bosnia. This small stretch of the border, known as the inter-ethnic boundary line, is patrolled by 140 French soldiers who are part of the 53,000-member NATO-led peacekeeping force.
Seated in the soldier's mess hall, in the scarred remains of a small tourist hotel on the edge of town, the company commander, Capt. Jean-Philippe Leroux, poured himself a glass of red wine from a bottle adorned with the emblem of his battalion.
He has sent his soldiers to clean up the fetid piles of garbage in the center of town and to help fix a few lathes at the local textile factory, which went bankrupt before the war, and to repair a few street lights. A German charity repaired the kindergarten and a Japanese group gave some supplies to the clinic, but otherwise Trnovo remains as desolate as when he arrived last spring.
"Trnovo's fate depends on what happens in Bosnia," he said. "It will either be a key crossing point for Bosnian Muslims and Serbs who work together, or a wasteland located on the edge of a hostile border."
At the edge of town is a stretch of a three-mile-wide corridor that is being built by NATO troops to link Sarajevo to the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. Trnovo county, between the border and the corridor, is sliced into a crazy patchwork of Serb and Muslim territory. Fields are cut down the middle, with neither side willing, yet, to cultivate land held by an opposing ethnic group.
French soldiers, wearing flak jackets and carrying heavy assault rifles, are at each crossing, stationed behind sand bags and protected by armored personnel carriers.
Tension remains high.
On Sept. 6 a car with four Serbs from Trnovo drove too far down the road, crossing into Muslim-held territory. The vehicle was sprayed with automatic fire by men on the Muslim side in civilian clothes. An elderly woman and young girl, wounded and left behind on the blood-soaked seats, are still in the hospital. The two men traveling with them, also shot, have disappeared.
The ambush took place 100 feet from a French checkpoint. But as with so much that happens here, no one seems to be able to say who carried out the attack, why it took place or what happened to the missing men.
"Can war ever really end in a country where every man has an AK-47 assault rifle and a thousand rounds of ammunition?" Captain Leroux asked. "Our presence has prevented a lot of bloodshed."
Many Bosnians, like Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, thought the peace agreement would be accompanied by large injections of international aid to rebuild the country and jump-start the economy. But while the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and private relief groups still hand out flour and cooking oil, the country's factories lie broken and idle. Bridges remain down, and electricity and sewage often does not function especially outside the cities. And foreign investors like Volkswagen, which once had a large plant in Sarajevo, have come, taken a look and left.
On the edge of Trnovo, 15 men gather each morning in a gear-box factory where they have spent their own money and labor to patch up the holes in the roof and walls. The men, once part of a work force of 150, laboriously scrape the rust off parts of old gear boxes that have lain for four years in a warehouse. They sell the reconditioned parts locally.
"The government in Pale owns the factory now," one frustrated worker said, referring to the capital of the Bosnian Serb republic, "and it is only interested in trying to sell off the machines or the building for some cash."
"We used to make parts for Mercedes-Benz before the war, and we contacted the company in Germany, but they said investment in Bosnia in this political climate was out of the question," the worker said. "We are not very optimistic."
Although unity would mean the possibility of economic cooperation, it is hard to find many Bosnians ready to accept the return of neighbors who fought against them. Many know the names of those who killed their family members.
Milena Vitkovic, a 39-year-old mother of four, lived in the mountain hamlet of Ledici, seven miles west of Trnovo, at the start of the war. The village had only Serbs. The surrounding villages had only Muslims. This was the usual pattern in the Bosnian countryside, and only in the large urban centers like Sarajevo, Mostar and Banja Luka did the ethnic groups mix.
Shortly after the war started, on June 9, 1992, Muslims from the surrounding villages attacked Ledici, Serbs here say. The 83 Serbs in the hamlet fled into the pine forests on the slopes of the mountains above the town. In the woods 10 people from Mrs. Vitkovic's family, including her mother, her two brothers and nephews as young as one, were shot down, according to a 12-year-old nephew who was wounded and survived.
Mrs. Vitkovic pulled worn black-and-white photos from a plastic bag and dabbed her eyes as she haltingly introduced her dead relatives. Her 6-year-old son sat in a corner of the small apartment watching his mother and repeatedly pulling the trigger on the handle of a white plastic toy pistol.
"I want no one, not even a Muslim, to feel what I feel," she said, "but I never want to see Muslims again, even in my dreams. I want to go back one last time to find the remains of my family and give them a proper burial, that is all I ask from the Muslims now."
Ledici is a ruin, a forlorn collection of roofless houses taken over by high grass, saplings, rusting kitchen appliances and trash.
But in the neighboring Muslim village of Dujmovici, just two miles away, men were using plastic tarpaulins and crude planks to rebuild destroyed houses.
When the men in Dujmovici were read the names of Mrs. Vitkovic's family, they acknowledged that they knew them, that for years they had traded cheese and eggs with them, drunk homemade brandy with them, counted them as friends. They also said those on the list had disappeared, but they insisted they did not know where they had gone.
"They did not die in Ledici," said a 45-year-old man in black rubber boots who was rebuilding a home burned by the Serbs during the war. He would not give his name.
"Maybe they died in the hills," he said. "A lot of people died in the hills. But this is over. Muslims and Serbs will not live again together again. There are things outsiders should never know."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
By Fits and Starts, Dole Explains His Tax Cut

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Ill., Sept. 13

 BODY:
Bob Dole tried three times today to give a new and simpler explanation of his economic plan, but it did not prove to be easy.
The first time, at a small manufacturing plant in Ohio, Mr. Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, gave a rambling explanation that mixed up some numbers. That led his spokesman, Nelson Warfield, to tell reporters that Mr. Dole would give a "more concise" version of the plan at the next stop, in Michigan. 
 But at that stop, he was speaking in a huge airport hangar with lousy acoustics, and it was so hard to hear what he was saying that the boisterous audience of about 2,000 people was easily distracted. Even Gov. John Engler of Michigan and Jack Kemp, Mr. Dole's running mate, who were seated on stage with the nominee, chatted with each other throughout the speech. Mr. Dole was virtually shouting to be heard, then skipped three paragraphs of the explanation that was in his prepared text.
Here in Illinois, he offered it up a third time, Mr. Warfield said, "because he didn't get all the way through it last time." This time, standing on a platform with bales of hay in the middle of a soybean field, he stuck to the script.
Mr. Dole was trying to illustrate how the Federal Government could cut taxes and still balance the budget by shaving just five cents from every dollar the government spends.
So at each event, he depended on a new prop -- the lowly nickel -- to show how small his cuts in the Federal budget would be. As if to show how puny an amount he was talking about, he would ask someone in the crowd to part with a nickel, to help him make his point..
Earlier this week, Mr. Dole said it would only be six cents out of every dollar that would need to be trimmed. In Ohio and Michigan, it was five cents. By the time he reached Illinois, it was down to "less than five cents."
The Dole campaign is encouraged by a new survey showing that voters rank taxes as the number-one issue in the Presidential campaign. In that survey, by the Pew Research Center in Washington, taxes edged out health care, welfare reform, crime and drugs.
Still, other surveys show that most voters are skeptical that Mr. Dole can actually do what he promises: cut taxes over six years and balance the budget without cutting Medicare or Social Security.
Mr. Dole is banking on his economic plan to help him close President Clinton's huge lead in national polls. As part of that effort, Mr. Dole, the former Senate majority leader, has been repeating the plan everywhere.
Today, his first explanation came in response to a woman in Wauseon, Ohio, who asked him how he could cut taxes, balance the budget and not touch entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.
First he told her, "You're right, sooner or later, you've got to put entitlements on the table." But in his plan, he said, they would be "off the table." He said he preferred appointing a commission to consider the issue to take it "out of politics." Later, at the airport hangar in Saginaw, Mich., he brought in an element he had neglected to mention in Ohio that is central to the plan. "We just have to slow the rate of increase in Federal spending," he said.
He added: "We need only $576 billion in spending control. Two-thirds of it, or $393 billion, is in the budget resolution already passed by Congress."
But that resolution was never enacted because many of its proposed cuts and curtailments in spending were politically unpalatable.
Beyond that, Mr. Dole assumes that there will be no recession, and he is counting on the economy to grow at a rate that many economists believe to be extraordinarily high.
The Dole campaign has specified few cuts that would be necessary, above and beyond the sort of severe proposals suggested last year by the Republican-controlled Congress. Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now an analyst at the Brookings Institution, said by telephone from Washington that most voters were not asking how the billions of dollars would be shifted around. They want to know whether it is plausible "to be handing out a tax cut that is one and a half times larger than the one offered in the Contract With America, which the Republicans themselves decided was unaffordable," Mr. Reischauer said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REFORM PARTY;
Relgious Right Delivers Perot Cool Response At Convention

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Ross Perot stepped into an unfamiliar pulpit today at the Christian Coalition's convention here and found himself preaching to the unconverted, many of whom did not like his sermon.
The opening line of one of Mr. Perot's favorite 1992 anecdotes -- "In this audience, I am sure there are many people who honestly believe that I elected Bill Clinton in 1992" -- backfired when hundreds of delegates signaled their agreement with that nugget of conventional wisdom by jeering, whistling and giving Mr. Perot his most sustained and vigorous round of applause. 
 When the clapping in hotel ballroom of the Washington Hilton subsided, Mr. Perot, the Reform Party Presidential candidate, tried to recover his rhetorical footing, saying, "That's why I brought it up: to get that reaction."
He then forged ahead with his standard anecdote. He said surveys of voters leaving polling places in 1992 showed that his Presidential bid that year had drawn equally from Mr. Clinton and President George Bush. Mr. Perot then made his main point: Had Americans voted their conscience in 1992, he would have won 40 percent of the vote, with Mr. Clinton receiving 31 percent and President Bush 27 percent.
The delegates' initial reaction to Mr. Perot's opening line foreshadowed how many delegates assessed his overall speech. As members of an influential Republican Party lobby that opposes abortion and favors school prayer, they generally gave it low marks at their annual gathering.
"He wasn't well received," said Armstrong Williams, a conservative radio talk-show host in Washington. "We were psyched, but he didn't give us anything."
Mr. Williams said Mr. Perot had erred in not presenting his views on abortion, school prayer and same-sex marriage. "He kept saying 'Just Listen,' " Mr. Williams said, trying to wag his finger Perot-style. "People don't know his core beliefs."
Yet throughout his speech, they tried to find out, periodically shouting, "What about abortion?" Mr. Perot declined to explain his position.
In the past, Mr. Perot has said abortion should be "a moral, personal issue between a woman and God." But he has insisted that such divisive social issues, while important, should not distract the nation from first solving major fiscal and economic challenges posed by the Federal debt and stagnant wages.
In addition to sketching out his other standard positions -- like raising the ethical and moral climate in Washington, improving schools and ending poll-driven political campaigns -- Mr. Perot delivered his version of a family values speech.
Bemoaning the effects of crime on America's schools and neighborhoods, he said: "Our moral, ethical base is eroding. We should admit it and stop sleepwalking."
Signaling his support for the traditional family, Mr. Perot said: "The most efficient unit of government the world has ever known is one we forgot, never even gets brought up. You'd think they'd be looking for it with the problems we have. Watch my lips. It's the strong family unit, the most efficient unit of government in the world."
Mr. Perot, whose standing in many polls has been hovering at 5 percent to 8 percent, devoted much of his speech to child development, including his summary of a baby's brain development and the link between nurturing parents and an infant's intellectual development and ability to learn in school.
The topic, which Mr. Perot uses to demonstrate his commitment to improving public schools, especially for poor children, seemed to annoy some delegates, prompting several to call out and urge him to spell out his stand on abortion.
Laura Erpelding, a delegate from Michigan, said she liked Mr. Perot's emphasis on improving secondary education but was skeptical about his commitment to family values.
"I have a problem when he talks about family values because he and his wife were involved with Planned Parenthood in Texas," Mrs. Erpel ding said after the speech. "Planned Parenthood to me equals abortion, which doesn't equal family values."
Mrs. Erpelding attributed what she termed Mr. Perot's "cool" reception at the convention to the abortion issue. "This is a pro-life audience," she said. "He can't expect adulation from this crowd."
Larry Dubbs Jr., a council member from Pine Grove, Pa., said he admired Mr. Perot's grasp of financial issues and statistics.
"He knows a lot about financial issues," Mr. Dubbs said. "But the general consensus of the coalition seemed to disagree with his ideas, because we believe our problems are more moral than financial."
Turning to the November elections, Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, said his organization would carry out a national drive to try to register one million religious conservatives as new voters.
Mr. Reed announced the plan in a speech to the convention after strongly criticizing a lawsuit filed against the organization by the Federal Election Commission. The commission has argued that the organization violated its nonpartisan, tax-exempt status by supporting individual candidates in its voter guides.
"We will not be harassed, we will not be intimidated and we will not be silenced," Mr. Reed said.

HEADLINE: RESURGENT STOCKS HIT RECORD HIGHS ON LOW INFLATION

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market surged to record highs yesterday, continuing one of the greatest bull markets in history and erasing a midsummer downturn that only recently had many analysts predicting the end of good times on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.2 percent, to 5,838.52 points, eclipsing its record close of 5,778 of May 22. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks climbed 1.4 percent, to 680.54, breaking the record of 678.51 on May 24. The bond market also rallied, as long-term interest rates fell below 7 percent to 6.95. 
 The spark for the rally -- as has been the case for most big market moves this year -- was economic news that caught investors by surprise and changed their short-term outlook.
Yesterday's triggers were reports that last month's retail sales were weak, which suggested that the economy might be slowing more than thought, and that consumer prices rose only slightly, indicating that inflation was still in check. [Page 31.]
Just days ago, many analysts were predicting confidently that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates later this month to help brake an economy that appeared to be racing over its speed limit. But the new information indicated that the Federal Reserve might wait before making a move, which allowed interest rates to fall and the market to rally, led by technology stocks like I.B.M., Microsoftand Intel.
For individual investors who have been pouring billions of dollars into stock mutual funds, the outlook may not be as certain as yesterday's rally. Views of the likelihood of an interest rate increase engineered by the Federal Reserve have shifted at least three times in just the last two weeks. Indeed, while the consensus now leans toward the belief that the Federal Reserve will leave short-term rates where they are, there is still a chance that it will raise rates at its next policy-setting meeting on Sept. 24, or perhaps later this year when the Presidential election is out of the way.
Moreover, even as the Dow hit a record high, long-term interest rates -- which have had a major impact on the stock market recently -- do not appear to be headed sharply lower. They are well above where they were at the beginning of the year and could move up again on stronger economic news.
Even more remarkable yesterday than the stock market records was the sight of economists, market analysts, traders, speculators and investors scrambling as the outlook for both stocks and bonds turned in a new direction yet again.
The day was toughest on the bears, those equity strategists who have been saying that the high-flying stock market had to be headed for a fall. "It's not very comfortable," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. "It's a humbling business and occasionally humiliating."
Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, has predicted a 1,000-point decline in the Dow. Yesterday he lamented, "I haven't changed my position but this has not turned out as I thought."
Economic forecasters were also caught off guard. John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, was fielding questions from London. "We got this one wrong," he said. For Mr. Lipsky, the most important news in the report was not just that retail sales were weak last month, but that the Government also revised downward its earlier estimates of monthly sales of everything but automobiles for both June and July. He now may lower his forecast for growth in the third quarter.
"It is possible we could end up with 2 percent or less," he said, adding that this was a pace that "could remove the near-term incentive for the Fed to raise interest rates."
What is causing all the recent wild swings in stocks and bonds, analysts said, is the difficulty of figuring out whether each new economic report indicates that the economy is slowing enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady. "Today's data, with the backward revision in retail sales, raise the issue of whether this slowdown has happened already." Mr. Lipsky said. But he said he did not believe the question was decided yet.
Just as the uncertainty over whether the economy is growing at just the right pace is expected to continue, so will the dispute between those with a cautious outlook and the real bulls. And it does not appear yet that the new stock records have changed many minds.
Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Smith Barney, called the record-breaking performance a "high-quality breakout that suggests there should be some follow-on."
But he cautioned that earnings, one of the most important underpinnings for stocks, might disappoint investors, weakening the case for a continuing rally. Earnings gains have already slowed from a 20 percent pace to 10 percent or less this year.
"We are moving into a period where you have to show me more top-line growth in earnings," he said, "and that is going to be hard to do."
But a bull like Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis, had no patience for such uncertainties. "The bears say, 'It is as good as it can get, so where do we go from here?' " he said. "I say it is as good as it can get and I think it can get better."
The 66.58-point rise in the Dow and the 9.41-point climb in the S.& P. 500 index were helped by rallies in technology stocks, which were among those hardest hit during the summer.
"The animal spirits in the market are linked to the technology stocks," said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist and an equity portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation.
I.B.M. jumped 4 7/8, to 122 1/8, as it was upgraded by Merrill Lynch & Company, and Microsoft rose 2 3/8, to 131, its second new high of the week. The Nasdaq index, which includes many technology stocks, outperformed the Dow yesterday, jumping just under 2 percent. And the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index climbed 2.7 percent.
Big institutional buyers also returned to the market, providing an additional shot in the arm.
Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn., said that his calculations for trades on the New York Stock Exchange showed that the net purchases of shares in block trades of at least 10,000 shares -- the hallmark of institutions -- totaled $1.1 billion yesterday. That was more than the institutions put into the market during the period from Aug. 1 through Thursday.
"The public has been buying all along," he said, "and today, with the economic news, instititutions could no longer not participate."
The price of the 30-year bond jumped 117/32 , to 9717/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.95 percent, from 7.07 percent on Thursday.
Shorter-term interest rates also fell. That reflected a belief that even if the Federal Reserve increased rates, the rise would be at best only a modest quarter percentage point.
Despite his view that a rate increase was not needed, Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager at the Private Bank of the Bank of Boston, said he suspected that the central bankers probably would do so anyway because of the split in opinion among Fed officials over just how strong the economy currently is.
"I think the Fed is concerned," he said, "about the looming minimum- wage hike and its implied impact on future inflation pressures."

HEADLINE: City Prohibits Borrowing By Improvement Districts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration restricted the power of the city's business improvement districts yesterday for the first time, announcing that it would prohibit them from borrowing money to pay for big projects.
The administration moved after concluding that it did not have enough control over the finances of the districts, said senior aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. They said they believed that if one of the districts defaulted on its debt, the city might be held responsible. 
 Under the new policy, the districts would not be able to borrow money by selling bonds or even by getting a loan from a bank, said Rudy Washington, the Deputy Mayor for Community Development and Business Services.
Since they were authorized in the early 1980's, more than 30 business improvement districts have been set up in the city. Their influence has increased in recent years as they have taken over some services, like sanitation and security, from a municipal government that has been facing serious fiscal problems.
The districts levy special taxes on property owners and use the proceeds for a variety of activities, from picking up garbage to promoting the local sights. Yet as they have grown, some critics have said they have become too independent and are not accountable to the public.
Until yesterday, the districts were able to borrow money after receiving approval from the city. Two of the most prominent districts, the Grand Central Partnership and the 34th Street Partnership in Manhattan, have sold a total of $56.5 million in bonds in recent years to finance a range of improvements in their neighborhoods, including new benches, lights and signs.
As part of the new policy, the city yesterday denied the Grand Central Partnership's request to sell $10.7 million in bonds to help the Metropolitan Transportation Authority renovate Grand Central Terminal.
Daniel A. Biederman, president of the Grand Central and the 34th Street districts, did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Another district, the Alliance for Downtown New York, which is in lower Manhattan, had been planning to ask the city for approval to sell $20 million in bonds for projects. Its president, Carl Weisbrod, said he was disappointed by the administration's decision.
"However, in view of the importance to the entire city of the type of public improvements contemplated for downtown, we look forward to working with the administration to develop other ways to get the job done quickly," Mr. Weisbrod said.
City officials had said last week that the Mayor was considering limiting or ending the districts' power to sell bonds. Mr. Washington and Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, who oversees economic development, said yesterday that the administration agreed on the new policy after concluding that the districts were getting involved in financial dealings that were best left to government.
"The purpose of BID's was not to act like government and then start running up debt," Mr. Washington said. "That is completely getting away from the core mission of what a business improvement district is."

HAYES MICROCOMPUTER TO CLOSE A CALIFORNIA PLANT

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc., a closely held modem maker that recently emerged from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, said yesterday that it would close its manufacturing plant in Thousand Oaks, Calif. The move will put 350 to 375 people out of work. The company said it was consolidating its domestic production operations at its headquarters in Norcross, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. An engineering group and multimedia products unit will remain at Thousand Oaks. Hayes will take a one-time charge in the fourth quarter of $6.5 million to pay for the plant closing.

As We Know It

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
"ENDING THE I.R.S. as we know it" was a centerpiece of Bob Dole's economic plan, later driven home in his acceptance address with "You will have a President who will end the I.R.S. as we know it."
This was, of course, a play on Bill Clinton's pledge, made in his 1992 acceptance speech and carried out as his re-election campaign began in 1996, to "end welfare as we know it,"and repeated mockingly by Republicans in Congress as he vetoed their first two efforts to pass welfare-reform legislation. 
 "Many people heard only the first two words: end welfare," wrote Jason DeParle in The New York Times Magazine about that '92 promise, "but Mr. Clinton was mindful of the as-we-know-it qualifier. He was talking about new training programs, expanded child care, universal health care."
The earliest use I can find applying the qualifier as we know it (AWKI) specifically to welfare was by David Stockman, before his term as the frequently woodshedded Reagan budget chief, in 1978: "Welfare as we know it should be abolished," he asserted in an article for an economics journal, "for all but the nonworking -- the aged, blind and disabled -- whose eligibility can be ascertained by reference to physical characteristics."
We have come to know as we know it all too well. In "Independence Day" (the movie blowing up the White House, not the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about a real-estate salesman's rites of passage), a computer expert persuaded a fictional U.S. President not to employ nuclear missiles against the Martian spaceships hovering over Earth, warning that it would mean "the end of life as we now know it." The rock group R.E.M. (the initials stand for "rapid eye movements" that take place in sleep) recorded a song in 1987 titled "It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)."
AWKI originally meant "as it is understood today," then was used as an intensifier, then (in Mr. Clinton's case) as a qualifier and often -- as it gained cliche status -- as a self-mocking dramatizer.
What was it before we knew it? In tracking back the source, before welfare, life and the world came civilization. Elizabeth Knowles of Oxford University Press cites Orson Welles, in his 1941 "Citizen Kane," proclaiming: "I've talked with the responsible leaders of the Great Powers. . . . They're too intelligent to embark on a project which would mean the end of civilization as we now know it."
The screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz popularized, if he did not coin, that use of the phrase. More than half a century later, it is used with a tongue-in-cheek connotation: reviewing a $24-dreadful thriller, "Triangle of Death," by Michael Levine and Laura Kavanau, in a recent New York Times Book Review, Colin Harrison refers to a fictional genetically engineered drug that simulates a 20-minute orgasm and wryly notes, "Such a drug would no doubt imperil morally upright civilization as we know it."
The hawkshaws of the Phrasedick Brigade led me to an early etymological source.
When I queried the American Dialect Society's bulletin board on the Internet (send queries to adsl@uga.cc.uga.edu, and subscription inquiries to listserv@uga.cc.uga.edu), a writer on gardening, Duane Campbell, dug up and sent back a citation from Oscar Wilde's essay "The Decay of Lying," in his 1891 book, "Intentions," in which a character says, "The 19th century, as we know it, is largely an invention of Balzac." (You didn't think this laid-back language maven was hip enough to use this resource? You thought I was computer-illiterate? Better not nuke them Martians, Mr. President.)
Pretty soon the cliche will wear out, phrase makers will turn to fresher material and that happy day will spell the end of as we know it as we know it.
 
Arklatex Nugget

 The Whitewater case is producing locutions as well as prosecutions. Joe Pinder of Washington sends along an article from The Washington Times, filed from Little Rock, Ark., by Hugh Aynesworth. In it, the assistant independent counsel, Jackie M. Bennett, asked an investment partner of Jim Guy Tucker, then Governor of Arkansas, "Would it be fair to say that Governor Tucker kind of rolled your pant leg up on that one, didn't he?" The witness, R. D. Randolph, glumly replied, "I came out on the short end of the stick."
The short end of the stick, which first appeared in print in the mid-1800's, refers to the old custom of fighting with sticks or staffs; whoever holds the short end is at a disadvantage. Less familiar is rolled up your pant leg, which, according to Aynesworth, means "saw what you had, looked at your hand -- it's Arklatexan, colloquial for this area, meaning 'took advantage of.' "
He referred me to Guy Bailey, a native of Oklahoma, now dean of liberal arts at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, familiar with idioms of Oklahoma and the Arklatex region (southwestern Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas). Dean Bailey directed me to the song "Deep Elm Blues" (the elm is pronounced ELL-um), recorded by the Shelton Brothers, from northern Louisiana, in the early 1930's.
"When Dallas was becoming the first urban community of the Southwest in the late 20's," says Dean Bailey, "folks were drawn there to have a good time. The song alerted them to the evils of the big city and advised them to protect themselves while there. It warned them of what could happen to careless country people."
The telltale lyric: "Now when you go down in Deep Elm, put your money in your socks/Or the women in Deep Elm, well, they'll put you on the rocks."
And how do you get the money out of the poor innocent's socks? First you roll up his pant leg.
Delicious dialectical discovery. Who says Whitewater is a waste of taxpayers' money?

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
The Oregon Trail, by Rail

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
IF you're looking for train memorabilia, however arcane, you can find it at Grandpa's Depot Store, on the second floor of the Oxford Hotel annex in Denver, across Wynkoop Street from Union Station. There, amid antique railroad lanterns, Union Pacific martini sets and matchbooks from the old Rio Grande line, you can also find Grandpa John White, who's spent a lifetime watching trains come and go. When I met him on a hot afternoon in late July and told him of my plan to ride Amtrak's Pioneer train all the way from Denver to Portland, Ore., he said, in perfect deadpan, "The Government runs it, you know. They don't have a timetable anymore. They just post the day the train's expected."
I had a timetable, though -- along with an itinerary sent to me by Amtrak's Great American Vacations, a book on the Lewis and Clark Expedition ("Undaunted Courage" by Stephen Ambrose) and expectations for the trip almost as high as those of Meriwether Lewis when he paddled into the Missouri River on May 21, 1804. The train's route touches that of Lewis and Clark along the Columbia River, and follows portions of the Oregon Trail, as well -- you could call it Manifest Destiny on wheels. In Wyoming it passes south of pioneer landmarks like Devil's Gate and Independence Rock to join up with the wagon trains around Boise, Idaho; it follows and then leaves the Snake River behind where the settlers did, at Farewell Bend in eastern Oregon, provides bracing views of Mount Hood and the gorge of the Columbia River (the pioneers' two last great hurdles), and finally glides into the promised land of the Willamette Valley. 
 Riding the train west also struck me as a decidedly good deal. I bought an air and rail package for $416, which included coach-class train fare with three stopovers en route, trip protection insurance allowing me to make last-minute itinerary changes, and a plane ticket on United from Portland back to Denver; this month, the price for the same package has dropped to $332. If I had taken the train from Denver to Portland with no stops and no return airline ticket, the one-way fare would have been $194 in coach; if I had booked an economy bedroom (with two seats and sleeping bunks, a shower down the corridor, and three meals a day) the air-rail package would have cost $574.
The journey required intense planning, chiefly because the Pioneer doesn't run daily but only three times a week, stopping in a number of cities at ungodly hours, such as Boise at 4:24 A.M. Also, I wanted to find places to stay in my stopover cities as close as possible to the depots and downtowns, since the idea of renting a car when I got off the train seemed anachronistic. I planned one night in Denver, two nights in Laramie, an overnight on the train from Laramie to Boise, a week in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho, followed by three nights in Boise and a two-night visit to Baker City, Ore. The last leg of the trip would take me to Portland, where I would stay for two nights before flying back to Denver.
In Denver I had booked a $95 room with no view at the Oxford Hotel, built in 1891 largely for train staff and passengers; that is much more than I normally pay for a room, but the Oxford is in LoDo, my favorite section of Denver, half a block east of Union Station, where a red neon sign exhorts passers-by to "Travel by Train." My room on the fourth floor was all deep blue Art Deco, with fancy toiletries, a plump double bed and a full range of cable channels -- although I never bothered to watch because the Rockies were playing my hometown team, the Mets, that night at Coors Field, which opened last year, just four blocks north of the hotel.
It seemed ironic that Coors Field should be surrounded by microbreweries like Breckenridge on Blake Street, where I had an Avalanche Ale for $3.25 a pint before lining up for a $4 seat out in home run heaven beyond center field. This would have been a nice economizing measure were it not for the high price of dinner at the ballpark, consisting of a hot dog, peanuts and a beer for $9.25. On top of that, the Rockies homered three times in the first inning, going on to beat the Mets 11-10.
The next morning the lofty neo-classical main waiting room of Union Station, built in 1914, was busy enough to recall the days when the depot saw as many as 80 departures a day. I checked two bags, and sat on one of the station's high-backed wooden benches as the bilevel Superliner that had just arrived from Chicago was divided into two parts. One, the California Zephyr, headed to Oakland via the Great Salt Lake (taking the window-encased sightseeing lounge with it, alas). The other, the Pioneer, carried mail in the front cars, followed by first-class sleepers, the dining car, several coach cars (with toilets on the lower level that were relatively clean, at first), and a cafe-lounge where seniors played Yahtzee, European backpackers consulted travel guides, and teen-agers mixed.
The attendant gave me a pillow and I bought an Amtrak blanket for $7 (in preparation for my overnight onboard); my seat was roomy, next to that of a nice dad who had spent just $800 to take his family of five on the train from Portland to Chicago and back. As the Pioneer crossed the rolling plains of northern Colorado I spotted antelope and a herd of buffalo out the window.
I lunched on a Cheyenne Burger and hot tea in the dining car for $7 (which tasted better than the cafe lunch of juice, pretzels, and a tuna sandwich that I bought later in the trip for the same amount). The decor reminded me of a slightly upscale coffee shop and the food was palatable enough, but the atmosphere was rushed (I eventually discovered that you can stay as long as you like if you reserve a place at the last seating). Afterward, my tablemates, a mother and daughter from Seattle, showed me their economy bedroom, a tiny compartment with two knee-to-knee seats that could be made into a bunk, and another bunk that pulled out from the wall above, in which they claim to have slept soundly through the night. Down the hall I peeked into bigger, deluxe sleepers with convertible sofas, armchairs and private baths just before the train pulled into Laramie, about four hours after we left Denver (making it 45 minutes late).
The little wooden Laramie depot, built in 1923, lay in the middle of a narrow park and was managed by a good-natured stationmaster who kept one of my bags behind the counter during my stay in town and could sometimes be seen riding a skateboard in the waiting room. Wide Third Street led from there through the tidy Victorian storefronts of the business district six blocks north to the Downtown Motel, distinguished by a huge satellite dish; my $53 room on the first floor of the back wing had a king-sized bed, a parking lot view, and enough floor space to easily accommodate the bicycle I rented from Use It Again Sports on South Second Street ($30 for two days).
Low-slung Laramie occupies the broad, flat corridor between the Snowy and Laramie Mountains. It grew up when the Union Pacific railroad came through in 1868, but owes its long-term well-being to the University of Wyoming, with a student body of 12,000, which constitutes a third of the population. When I was there, the town had settled in for a long midsummer nap, but I still found entertainment, like an excellent exhibition called "The Buffalo in Art and Culture" at the university's art museum ($3.50); rummaging through dinosaur bones at the university's wonderful, old-fashioned Geology Museum (free); visiting the Wyoming Territorial Prison ($6), where the walls bear unnerving, enlarged mug shots of the outlaws who did time there between 1875 and 1903; dining on stir-fried chicken and vegetables for $4.95 at a convivial restaurant downtown called Jeffrey's, and sampling a glass of Fat Tire beer ($1.25) at the Buckhorn Bar, where the walls groan with moth-eaten, taxidermically preserved beasts.
Two days later, the Pioneer came through town an hour and a half late, carrying 23 Boy Scouts with water pistols, two screaming babies, a couple of astonishingly loud snorers even my earplugs couldn't drown out, and a visibly weary staff -- when I asked a passing attendant where we were at one point during the night, she said, "Don't ask me. I just got up."I learned from an assistant conductor that rides on the Pioneer are far more pacific in September, after the kids go back to school. For now, I was thankful that Amtrak had banned smoking on the train, and happy to vegetate as the sagebrush desert of southern Wyoming rolled by. But I hardly slept, so when the Pioneer reached Boise's beautiful Spanish colonial depot at about 5:30 A.M., I felt like a piece of lost baggage.
My condition improved markedly after a week in the Sawtooths and three nights in Boise at a comfortable bed and breakfast called the Idaho Heritage Inn, built in 1904. There my room in the rear had an antique double bed and a small private bath and access to a veranda, ($60 a night, including a delicious hot breakfast). I saw "Twelfth Night" at the Idaho Shakespeare Festival ($15) and learned about the lives of Basque immigrants who came to the city in the late 19th century, at the Basque Museum ($3) before sampling Basque croquetas and potato and chorizo soup (about $7 with a drink) at the Bar Gernika next door. After strolling along the beautiful green belt that lines the Boise River, I toured the Old Idaho Pennitentiary off Warm Springs Avenue ($3), where I learned how to turn a spoon into a shank. Finally, at 4:24 A.M. I caught the train to Baker City, which arrived right on time.
A FTER a two-and-a-half-hour-hour ride, we arrived in Baker City, a little southeastern Oregon town in a high valley between the Blue and Wallowa Mountains that looks like a set for "The Music Man." When pioneers saw Baker City during the Great Migration (which took a half million settlers west on the Oregon Trail between 1840 and 1870), they felt they were at long last getting somewhere. I went there to see the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center (free), on Flagstaff Hill about five miles east of town, with daily re-enactments from settlers' journals, exhibits and life-sized dioramas on prairie schooner life so detailed they include a fly in an ox's eye. A rutted section of the trail itself is about a mile down the hill.
A free shuttle from the Best Western Sunridge Inn took me to the Interpretive Center, and to and from the depot, as well. The shuttle was why I had chosen the motel at the edge of town, with big, two-bedded doubles, a hot tub, and a pool, for $53 a night. On my last night I celebrated with a New York steak and two glasses of merlot for about $25 at the Phone Company Restaurant, in an historic building downtown.
The next morning, the Pioneer was two and a half hours late (and only got later as it chugged along the Columbia River to Portland, because the temperature was over 100 degrees, preventing the train from going more than 50 miles an hour).Waiting at Baker City, I got to talking with a conductor who explained some of the other reasons for the Pioneer's habitual tardiness, including the fact that it often has to wait for passing freight trains. And then, almost as an afterthought, he told me that Amtrak had just announced the cancellation of the Pioneer as of Nov. 10, apparently owing to a sharp drop in riders (especially in winter), and to anemic financing from Congress. Two other Western lines -- the Texas Eagle from St. Louis to San Antonio and the Desert Wind from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles -- had been terminated as well.
I was stunned, and not even the beautiful scenery along the Columbia River could break my mood, which lingered during two busy days in Portland. I stayed in a well-equipped $65 basement room at General Hooker's Bed and Breakfast on the southwest side of town and visited the sprawling Powell's City of Books and an exhibit of Chinese Imperial artifacts at the Portland Art Museum ($13). But all the while I kept thinking about the Pioneer.
Certainly, most people choose to travel by air because they don't have time, or patience, to take the train. But on the Pioneer, which was packed every time I boarded it, I had met fellow passengers with a whole host of reasons for preferring the train, including fear of flying, the relatively low cost of tickets and the desire to see the countryside close-up. Despite the inconveniences and delays , I would like to travel by long-distance train again myself, because the tracks take me back to some of the most stirring moments in America's past. Maybe I'll try the Empire Builder, which follows a northern route from Chicago to Seattle, or the Southwest Chief from Los Angeles to Chicago via Santa Fe. But I won't be taking the Pioneer again. That line is history now.

HEADLINE: Bedford Seeks Retailers to Speed Growth

BYLINE: By ANNE C. FULLAM 

DATELINE: BEDFORD

 BODY:
BEING just another pretty-faced hamlet is not enough for Bedford. Her merchants want her to go out and earn. But has her time passed?
With a petite apron of a Village Green and a bib of white clapboard buildings, Bedford was last a commercial hub during the War of 1812. Clattering hooves and squeaking coaches resounded on Old Post Road, then the main thoroughfare between New York City and Albany. 
 The tiny, wavy-glassed shops grew dim once automobiles started to speed consumers away to newly opened malls. Bedford continued to sell her wares with some zest in the 1950's. But long before strip malls and megastores, cars left behind dusty dispirited stores.
Recently, Bedford got a face-lifting. Sidewalks were repaired, buildings painted and trees watered. Signs were aligned. Cosmetically, Bedford looks great. Now, the merchants want to feel a retail pulse.
"The charm of a hamlet is how it looks, but there's a need for economic viability," said John Dinin, Supervisor of the town of Bedford, which includes Bedford village, Bedford Hills and Katonah.
"They want to attract people who live in the area to shop in area hardware stores and other commercial stores for baked goods, clothing, things like that," Mr. Dinin said. "They want to promote a sense of a small community, not another strip mall."
Perhaps the most community-spirited establishment in the village is Stewart's Market, a friendly blend of grocery and delicatessen. Customers often sit outside, reading, eating or daydreaming.
"The village will die and become a museum unless something is done," said Jim Crookston, who opened Stewart's nearly 12 years ago. Mr. Crookston is president of the Bedford Village Business Association.
"Stores have moved out in the last 10 years because there's no parking," Mr. Crookston said. "People jump in their cars and go to the malls. Bedford won't stay such a pretty little village if everybody shops out of town."
Prodded by Mr. Crookston's business association, the Bedford Village Historic District Review Commission conducted a yearlong study of how to improve business profits. The commission's recommendations, besides additional parking, included relocating the nearly dozen real estate agencies on the main street from shopfronts to the second floor. Retailers, presumably, would move in.
All the real estate agents interviewed declined to talk about the review commission's recommendation on relocation.
Mark Boyland, a salesman at the Prudential-Ragette Realtors, whose comments were representative of other real estate agents, said, "I think any added business to the town is great."
Bedford's real estate offices are thriving, from estates sold to celebrities like Ralph Lauren and Mariah Carey to two-acre and four-acre subdivision houses sold to professionals. Property seems to be the hamlet's most valuable commodity.
"Get a drugstore in the town," said John P. Renwick Sr., a former president of the Bedford Historical Society and a local real-estate agent. "That's what we really need."
While Mr. Renwick talked nostalgicly about the soda fountain era, others yearned for small-town department stores, restaurants and hardware stores. Current regulations for the location of many kinds of businesses require more water, sewage, parking and other services than the village needed in the past.
Too busy with today to think about yesterday, Velda Greenan at Velda Design took a break from cutting cloth to dress patterns to offer her opinion of the plan.
"Rents are becoming so high that it's very hard for the small retailer," said Mrs. Greenan, who opened her business in 1984. Others agreed.
"The people who own the buildings are asking exorbitant amounts," Mr. Renwick said.
Despite its visual impact as a historic place, there are no efforts to commercialize the village's tourist appeal. The idea of making money out of history seems not to have been explored here. For example, there are no walking tours of the nearly two dozen historic buildings surrounding the village green. While dates are posted, no signs explain the historic significance of the buildings.
In 1973, the village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the state register. Bedford's three square miles were bought in 1680 by 22 men from Stamford, who paid Chief Katonah in blankets, cloth and wampum.
The village's triangular green was a hop ground, and the town seal honors that use with a wreath of hops. Bordered on one side by the old burying ground, the green's north side is a solid line of late 18th- and early 19th-century buildings. The southern edge is the 1928 granite St. Patrick Roman Catholic Church.
Originally part of the colony of Connecticut, Bedford became part of New York in 1700. Patriotic during the Revolutionary War, when most of Westchester was neutral, Bedford was burned by the British in 1779. Until 1870, Bedford was one of two county seats for Westchester. The other, less populous then, was White Plains.
Perhaps the most stirring event to occur in the village was a gathering in 1781 of Rochambeau's infantry and cavalry before they joined Washington's forces on the way to Yorktown.
"We need to extol the virtues of the village," said Dick Farrell, a representative of the town historian to the review commission. "We have a treasure of history, and it's not being packaged in an educational manner that would benefit not just outsiders but local adults and schoolchildren."
Mr. Farrell continued: "The problems of Bedford are endemic to the entire United States. Wonderful old towns everywhere are facing the same problems. The Walmarts and the Krogers are taking over."

HEADLINE: FILM;
A Timely Tale, With Endings Unforewarned

BYLINE: By WILLIAM McDONALD 

 BODY:
TO THE MOVIEGOING PUBLIC he was just beginning to reach, Russ Hexter was an unknown. But he did not come out of nowhere. Here, then, are some salient facts about him.
He was a child of affluence from Westchester County's thickly bowered back country, where wealth is displayed tastefully and discreetly behind stately old hardwoods and ivy-covered brick walls. He was inventive as a boy, always making up stories, creating his own comic book heroes, playing long hours alone at his computer in his manorlike home. His quiet way might have been mistaken for shyness, but his mother understood him differently. To her he was simply observant, so much so that he developed a remarkable talent for mimicry that left his family and friends in stitches and that would one day lead to a short stint supplying characters with voices on the MTV animated series "The Head." 
 In high school he discovered the perfect instrument through which he could channel his restless enthusiasms: the movie camera. Before long, a teen-ager's fascination became a passion, and it carried him to New York University's film school, where he made short, funny features about the foibles of ordinary people in the kind of working-class small towns his own upbringing had largely insulated him from.
In the spring of 1994, he shot his first full-length movie about the collision of a fading factory town with the global computer economy. His home-grown film company was mostly made up of pals from N.Y.U., the financing gathered mostly from trust funds, relatives and family friends. After weeks of whittling 27 hours of film down to 90 minutes, the movie was shown at film festivals in Boston and Vancouver, British Columbia, and got admiring reviews in the local papers. Last January it climbed another rung on the ladder, earning a showing at the Sundance festival in Utah, where -- and Mr. Hexter marveled at this -- audiences applauded heartily.
The film's warm reception persuaded the powerful William Morris Agency to represent him. He began flying out to Los Angeles to meet with important people in the film industry. Diane Keaton talked to him about making movies with her production company. Discussions were also held with two major independent companies, Lumiere and Fine Line. On April 28 he was in sunny Los Angeles again for more talks. The horizon indeed looked bright.
The next morning he was back in New York, in his Greenwich Village apartment, chatting with a friend who had stopped by. Suddenly he clutched at his chest and fell to the floor, unconscious. About 24 hours later, at St. Vincent's Hospital, Russell Anthony Hexter died. The cause was an aortic aneurysm, a cardiac malfunction that in his case resulted from Marfan syndrome, a disorder that he had been born with and that commonly results in unusual height and long limbs. Mr. Hexter, at 6 feet 4 inches, had both of those characteristics. He was 27 years old.
By uncanny happenstance, his death echoed by a matter of months that of another promising young talent, Jonathan Larson, the 35-year-old composer and author who died hours after the final dress rehearsal for his hit musical "Rent." Both men had grown up in suburban Westchester, both collapsed in their downtown Manhattan apartments, both were stricken by aortic aneurysms, and both died as the curtains were about to rise on promising careers. Mr. Hexter's movie, "Dadetown," with a national distributor lined up, will open on Wednesday at Film Forum in Manhattan, a theater only blocks from where he lived.
"INCREDIBLY TRAGIC" IS HOW Jim Carden, the producer of "Dadetown," describes Mr. Hexter's death. They had been close friends since their student days at N.Y.U. "Through film school everyone knew this was a guy who was going to succeed," Mr. Carden says, "that his was a career worth watching."
Together the two had started their own independent company, Big Ol' Productions, formed largely around a core of striving young former classmates. "He was the cornerstone of the company," says Mr. Carden, who is 28. "Now, without him, we're nothing."
"Dadetown" was to be their first hurrah. In 90 minutes the film spins out a parable for our times, observing in a quiet corner of small-town America the sort of wrenching transition, from machines to microchips, that much of the country is going through at the end of the 20th century. On the wane is the security and prosperity that bare hands fashioned on assembly lines during a mid-century heyday, when workers labored in the belief that loyalty to an employer would be returned in kind. On the horizon is an uncertain, "downsized" future, where the workplace will be a web site and only the computer-literate will need apply.
The movie's Dadetown is a peaceful patch of central New York State where everyone knows everyone down at the Runway Coffee Shop and every third person works at the town's biggest employer, Gorman Metal Bending. In its glory days, 50 years ago, as Gorman Aircraft, the plant -- and thus the town -- had done its patriotic part during the war by manufacturing wing and fuselage assemblies for American fighter planes. Now, in humbler times, it produces paper clips and staples.
Out on the edge of town, a big software company called American Peripheral Imaging, or A.P.I., has set up a regional headquarters, bringing with it a wave of corporate immigrants from the cities. No one in Dadetown quite understands what the company does or what its initials stand for ("Alien Persons Invade?" one local woman guesses derisively). But the townspeople are smart enough to see that these educated, middle-management newcomers in tailored suits and foreign cars are not just adding to the tax base but trying to remake Dadetown in their own image, putting up handsome new homes that the factory workers could never afford, building a fancy playground (for themselves, really) and, as a harbinger of a tonier future, ushering in a cappuccino shop.
Tensions between the two camps smolder until Gorman Metal Bending, squeezed by the cheap labor in third world countries, announces that it must "downsize" and begins laying off workers, the first step toward a plant closing. Now resentments flare, a strike is called, and A.P.I. families become the targets in a guerrilla campaign of harassment. There is violence. But there is no changing the new order of things.
HOW MR. HEXTER filmed this story is a story in itself. The style is documentary: events are recorded as they happened and dozens of people are interviewed, sometimes after a camera crew collars them, just as Michael Moore did in another blue-collar film, "Roger and Me." But there is a secret behind this movie that isn't owned up to until the credits roll at the end -- a surprise that illuminates the achievement of the film (or a manipulative hand at work, depending on one's point of view) and that must be divulged here if the achievement isn't to be ignored.
For the truth about "Dadetown" is that it's fiction. There is no Dadetown, N.Y. The film was shot mostly in Hammondsport (pop. 929), a village nestled in the Finger Lakes region, and the 82 people who were given lines to speak are actors, most of them amateurs -- ordinary citizens from Hammondsport and elsewhere upstate who answered casting calls to play people very much like themselves and who perform so convincingly that film festival audiences, and even a movie critic or two who didn't stick around for the credits, have been completely fooled.
People involved in the film say the faux-documentary style was chosen as the best way to fulfill Mr. Hexter's ambition to create, often with droll humor, a portrait of a town as a mosaic of voices. "We had wanted the town itself to be the protagonist, not a particular character," says John Housley, another N.Y.U. classmate who wrote the script with Mr. Hexter. "And it was Russ's solution to film it as a documentary. He saw the documentary style as really freeing for him."
He also delighted in not revealing his method until the end. "He loved the idea that it could fool people," says his mother, Maren Hexter.
Not every festival filmgoer welcomed the surprise; some felt that they had been had. Mr. Carden recalls one tense moment during a question-and-answer session after a screening in Vancouver in which a woman rose from the audience and said to Mr. Hexter, "I think you're going to do great in Hollywood because you're a liar and a cheat." The audience gasped, Mr. Carden says, but then someone rose to defend the director, drawing a round of applause.
Mr. Hexter addressed his unconventional approach in a "director's statement" that accompanied the movie to film festivals. "I've always believed that 'Dadetown' could not have been made in any other way without doing damage to the story I wanted to tell," he wrote. "I'll admit that the film was somewhat of an experiment to see just how far I could go with the nonfiction style."
WITH A SLIM BUDGET of $300,000 and months of research behind him, Mr. Hexter began shooting the film in the spring of 1994. A few professional actors were signed up, but for the most part the cast was an unlikely assemblage mustered from everyday walks of life: a town councilman, a disabled Vietnam veteran, a homemaker. Some were given monologues, others a few lines, and after many rehearsals and much gentle coaching they were put in front of the camera. What often happened next was something akin to improvisational theater. Mr. Hexter himself, in the role of an off-screen interviewer, would ask the actors questions about Dadetown's plight and encourage them to depart from the script and use their own words, drawing on their own real-life experience.
"These people could become the characters and talk about Dadetown and know exactly what was going on there, as if from firsthand knowledge," Mr. Carden says. One novice, Bill Garrison, a 74-year-old former town supervisor who plays Dadetown's leading councilman and grandfatherly sage, often put more trust in his own ear for upstate speech patterns than in the film makers'. "I had a little problem with their lines; sometimes one didn't seem to follow another," recalls Mr. Garrison, who came down from fixing his farmhouse roof to talk about the movie over the phone. "So Russ let me put it in my words, and it went smoother then."
Another amateur, Terry Nardone, saw himself as "a natural" for his role. "The part they were looking at was a disgruntled factory employee," he says. Mr. Nardone, who is 43 and lives in Hammondsport, says he has gone through 18 jobs since 1982, a work history that he attributes to delayed onset combat fatigue stemming from his naval service in Vietnam.
Through the months of production, his associates say, Mr. Hexter's dedication to the project deepened as he got to know the cast members better and, through them, came to understand the characters even more. "Russ loved every character in this movie," Mr. Carden says. "He didn't try to make the townspeople look like idiots. He didn't try to make the A.P.I. people look like idiots. He just wanted to state a case, without judging either side."
Mr. Housley, the script writer, says: "He had a real loyalty to the people there. He almost felt it really was a documentary, that he was really telling their story."
It might seem an unlikely affinity, that of an investment banker's son from moneyed Armonk, the home of I.B.M., with an obscure middle-American town. Yet Mr. Hexter believed, as expressed in a kind of epilogue to the film, that "the story of America starts and ends right here, with our myths, in the small town."
"Somehow he was fascinated by small towns," his mother says, "and although Armonk is a small town, that was not his idea of one. This is kind of an upscale place, where you meet people running around in fancy labels and Mercedeses. I think Russell felt that he lived a rather privileged life, that it wasn't real life, in a way."
Mrs. Hexter, a composed, gracious woman of 58 who is tall and slender like her son, is sitting in the comfortable den of her Norman-style brick home in the hushed stillness of a drizzly August afternoon. Later, she escorts a visitor on a tour of the house, past an indoor squash court and a large circular office overlooking four parklike acres and up a spiral staircase to a landing where, on a table, there is a framed photo of her son, a young man with sandy, unruly hair, an aquiline nose, sleepy eyes and a placid countenance. "A very funny, generous, sweet nature," his mother says. The two had lived in the house alone after her husband, Richard, died in a scuba diving accident in the Netherlands Antilles in 1981. Russ was 12 at the time.
Her only child's death came without warning, Mrs. Hexter says. "Knowing he had Marfan syndrome, we knew he had to be careful about certain things, and that when he was older, when he was in his 30's or 40's, he might have had to have heart surgery done," she says. "But the fact that this happened when he was 27 was quite unexpected."
His death was mourned in Hammondsport; Mr. Hexter had become something of an adopted son there. And he had returned the town's affection. In a gesture of gratitude toward the people who had served as both backdrop and cast of his film, Mr. Hexter chose to hold the premiere of "Dadetown" in Hammondsport last October, followed by a party over at Jim Gifford's winery. There were three showings of the movie at the Main Street School auditorium, and just about everybody in town came out to see it.

OUR SECRET CENTURY
Archival Films From the Darker Side of the American Dream.
By Rick Prelinger.
Six CD-ROM's
(Windows and Macintosh).
New York: Voyager Company.
$29.95 per two-disk set.
Strange things happen in "Our Secret Century." An evil clock makes a suburban housewife accident-prone. A professional football player travels coast to coast by bus, encounters what may be the ghost of the Unknown Soldier and marries Angie Dickinson at journey's end. A newlywed, ecstatic over her new Corvair, sips a "teeny weeny polka dot martini." A state trooper is so zealous in pursuit of young people with poor driving habits that he chases them to grisly deaths. And everywhere there are authoritative voices -- some identified as judges or clergymen, while others seem to be the voice of the superego, of concerned bureaucracy, of God, John Forsythe or General Motors. Who can tell the difference? 
 "Pleasant unemotional conversation helps digestion," youngsters are advised. While a teen-age girl weeps in her upstairs bedroom, a female voice taunts, "It's a little late for tears, isn't it, Barbara?" Her sin seems to have been poor management of her dry cleaning, which is somehow associated with an uncultivated mind.
And while an industrial army of everyone from miners to goatherds massages the continent to "harvest" a Chevrolet, a grandiloquent orator apostrophizes: "A gripping springing live thing, resiliently spry and untiringly useful." He's talking about tires.
The voice-overs we hear on so many of the corporate and educational films presented and annotated in "Our Secret Century" rarely try to sell or convince. That would imply doubt. Rather, their message is that this is the way life is. The high-school dropout will lose his girlfriend and his self-respect, and a girl who takes a ride from a stranger risks having something happen that's quite unspeakable. The automobile workers in Flint, Mich., in 1937 are not the vanguard of the labor movement, but "a legion of craftsmen . . . joined to supply transportation to a nation of individuals." And if you get into an accident, it's not because of external dangers but because of your own thoughtlessness.
These three two-disk sets constitute the first half of a projected 12-disk series based on the collection of the New York film archivist Rick Prelinger. Made between the 1930's and the 60's, these corporate and educational films are documents both of an overlooked sector of the film industry and of the values that were winning sponsorship at midcentury.
The films were shown in schools and church basements, and on television at odd hours. People over 40, even if they haven't seen these particular films, are likely to find something familiar about their guilt-inducing narratives, their often awkwardly pantomimed acting and their plodding pace, which is occasionally relieved by flashes of redeeming trashiness. Everyone, regardless of age, will find them odd.
In the lingo of CD-ROM publishing, imagery and sounds are known as "assets." There is tremendous logistical and economic incentive to limit the number of permissions you need to obtain. CD-ROM's are more likely to be generated by the availability of particular material from one museum, movie studio or archive than by an idea. "Our Secret Century" follows that pattern, but Mr. Prelinger has more than assets. He has a sensibility. He sees these films as overlooked documents of social history and, often, as artful works in themselves. He goes out of his way to point out the facts and ideas that are missing from these films, but he is also sensitive to the virtues that are there.
It's possible to speak of Mr. Prelinger's sensibility, because there is quite a lot of him on each disk. Each of the three to seven films on each disk comes with several screens full of written commentary. There are also supporting visual and written documents and interviews that relate to each film and to the disk as a whole, supplemented with excellent bibliographies. And each CD-ROM is introduced by a moving Quicktime image of Mr. Prelinger himself. With his clunky shoes, flap-pocketed shirt and reedy voice, he presents himself as a student and enthusiast. His informal, inquisitive stance on the surface of the screen contrasts strongly with the omniscient off-screen voices of authority found in so many of the films on view.
In this marginal cinematic realm, Mr. Prelinger has even unearthed a couple of auteurs. One is Sid Davis, whose films on youth set in working-class southern California, especially "Age 13" (1955), show a lost time and place and pack a good deal of emotional power. The other is the Detroit-based Jam Handy, who was addicted to aerial camera work and run-on sentences. His was an epic of salesmanship. The earth and all mankind labor and bring forth . . . a Chevrolet!
The disks are packaged in unmatched pairs. Volume 1, "The Rainbow Is Yours," which deals with consumption and design during the 50's, seems logically to belong with Volume 6, "The Uncharted Landscape," whose centerpiece is a remarkable marketing film about 50's suburban life. Instead, it is paired with Volume 2, "Capitalist Realism," containing 30's industrial films.
Volume 3, "The Behavior Offensive," films exhorting teen-agers to plan ahead, refrain from necking and pretend to enjoy their parents' company, seems a natural pair for Volume 5, "Teenage Transgressions," about delinquency. Instead, it's mated with Volume 4, "Menace and Jeopardy," films about safety in which disaster is always imminent.
Nearly all the films, which range from a few minutes to more than half an hour, are shown in their entirety, with about 80 minutes' worth on each disk. Viewers have their choice of seeing the films in a small window, where the images are more or less distinct, or in a larger window, where they aren't, especially if you use only a 256-color display. While the CD-ROM format allows Mr. Prelinger his authorial presence, I'd much rather be watching these on a videocassette recorder, with the comments and supporting documents in a book.
You may start out laughing at these films but they have an odd way of eating into your mind. Just yesterday, I found myself wondering whether my life would be better today if I'd taken command of my closet as a teen-ager. I'd never learned Barbara's lesson, and it's too late for tears now. I really knew I'd had enough when I was watching "Frigidaire Finale," a maniacal 1957 dance to the joy of major appliances, found on Volume 1. A tail-coated gent flung open the freezer and dumped ice cubes all over the floor, and I, brainwashed by Volume 4, found myself worrying that someone might fall and get hurt.
"Our Secret Century" is, perhaps, best taken in smaller doses. (A little Jam Handy goes a long, long way.) But Mr. Prelinger has done a great service by opening a window to such evocative documents of our recent past and presenting them so thoughtfully.

DREAMS OF THE HEART
The Autobiography of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua.
By Violeta Barrios de Chamorro with Sonia Cruz de Baltodano and Guido Fernandez.
Illustrated. 352 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $25.
The national obsession with Nicaragua throughout the 1980's, when the United States waged a proxy war against the Sandinista revolution, seems like ancient history. The bloodshed ended in 1990, after the Sandinistas agreed to elections, which they then lost. The winner, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, was a symbolic candidate chosen to unite the fractious opposition, and she inherited a country wrecked by war and revolution. 
 "Dreams of the Heart" is the story of how Mrs. Chamorro passed from spectator to leader during Nicaragua's tumultuous journey from dictatorship through revolution to democracy. Political memoirs can be tedious, self-aggrandizing affairs, but this one is a modest and engagingly personal portrait. The first half is a charming account of the author's idyllic girlhood, and of her marriage to Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Cardenal, an impassioned journalist who exposed the corruption and atrocities of the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle in the family newspaper. Mrs. Chamorro, a housewife and mother of four, was drawn inexorably into her husband's fight.
The signal event of her life was Pedro Chamorro's assassination in 1978, which detonated an insurrection that brought down Somoza. Nicaraguans rallied to the side of the Sandinistas, who had been waging a hit-and-run war from the hills since the early 1960's. Mrs. Chamorro recounts the first momentous decision she had to make on her own, whether to join the Sandinista-dominated junta that replaced Somoza. In describing her first meeting with the top Sandinista comandantes, she says, "They gave me the chills."
Wary of collaborating with Communists, who wanted her as window dressing to make the new Government palatable to Washington, Mrs. Chamorro recalls lying awake at night: "I ask Pedro . . . to give me a sign if he thinks I can be of use to my country." Ultimately, she joined the junta, but defending this decision now is an awkward task. Her rationale is that she and others in the middle class "still thought of the Sandinistas as sons and daughters of our friends, children we could influence or order around."
Mrs. Chamorro's life poignantly mirrors her country's trauma. Her own children are divided: two are prominent Sandinistas and one became a leader of the United States-backed contra rebels. Yet they were all welcome at her dinner table, even though she criticized the contras and eventually broke with the Sandinistas.
Mrs. Chamorro is still miffed that many foreign reporters derided her neophyte candidacy. But her simple message hit home with Nicaraguans who, she says, saw in her an escape from United States hostility, Sandinista arrogance and a disastrous experiment in Marxist economics.
As president, Mrs. Chamorro infuriated her coalition by opting for a policy of national reconciliation, allowing the Sandinistas to keep control of the armed forces. She contends that it was the only way to shrink that gargantuan machine without sparking another war. The results, she claims, vindicate her: the Sandinista army now has only 12,000 enlisted troops, and the economy is finally reviving. Yet Ms. Chamorro did commit herself to the coalition's platform, which pledged to uproot Sandinista control, and disregarding electoral promises sets a poor example in a place where democracy has more often than not been subverted by back-room deals.
Mrs. Chamorro's successor, to be elected in October, will face the same choice between partisan rule and the politics of compromise. But whatever the outcome, the fact remains that this homemaker steered the Nicaraguan family through a perilous transition more ably than anyone could have imagined.

THE LOGIC OF EVIL
The Social Origins of the Nazi Party, 1925-1933.
By William Brustein.
235 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $27.50.
Like a recurring nightmare, Nazism haunts our historical imagination. In part this is because of the enormity of Nazism's crimes, in part because they occurred in a well-educated, economically developed modern society not so different from our own. To those who want to believe that evil is an ailment that can be cured by education, therapy and reform, the experience of Nazism remains an unyielding challenge. 
 Some of the most popular explanations of Nazism try to weaken its connections to modernity by emphasizing its atavistic character. The Nazis were successful, these explanations suggest, only because Germany was not an authentically modern nation; Germans were not really like the rest of us because they had approached modernity along a "special path," a path that eventually ended with Hitler and Auschwitz. Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's much-discussed recent book, "Hitler's Willing Executioners," presented one version of this argument: Nazism, Mr. Goldhagen maintains, was the latest and most murderous expression of a historical anti-Semitism that had survived in Germany long after it had withered in the rest of Europe.
In "The Logic of Evil," William Brustein suggests a very different explanation of Nazism's origins. Mr. Brustein, a professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota, believes that political behavior is based on people's rational calculation of their economic self-interest. Because German voters were, like those everywhere, "voting their pocketbooks," the Nazis' successes came from their "superlative success at fashioning economic programs that addressed the material needs of millions of Germans." People supported Hitler not because of "irrational leitmotifs such as anti-Semitism, hypernationalism and xenophobia," but because he offered the "best prospects for a better life."
To demonstrate this proposition Mr. Brustein uses data from the enormous collection of party membership records now in the Berlin Document Center. With the help of a team of research assistants, he randomly selected the files of 42,000 individuals who joined the Nazis from 1925, when the party was reorganized, until January 1933, when Hitler became the Weimar Republic's last chancellor. Through a sophisticated set of classifications and statistical analyses, Mr. Brustein concludes that Nazism was overrepresented among those occupational groups to which its economic program most actively appealed: small-business men and farmers, married male white-collar employees, industrial workers in import-oriented enterprises and skilled blue-collar workers.
Mr. Brustein is neither naive nor ill informed. He recognizes that no single factor can explain Nazism's appeal, and he carefully restricts his remarks to what happened before Hitler came to power. Especially in his chapter on the incentives and disincentives for joining the party, he offers qualifications that seem to undermine the basic structure of his argument. But, in fact, his argument is only interesting in its extreme formulation: no one, after all, has ever denied that people's economic self-interest played some role in Nazism's origins. Yet was it, as Mr. Brustein claims, the most significant source of their support?
It is possible, I think, to raise serious questions about Mr. Brustein's methods. I am skeptical that some of his social categories have much analytical value. Furthermore, Nazism's economic program appears here to be a good deal more coherent, consistent and transparent than it actually was. But the most serious weakness in Mr. Brustein's approach is the concept of rational self-interest itself.
How, for example, does this idea explain the relative brevity and apparent instability of Nazism's success before 1933? In 1928, the Nazis were a marginal party with less than 3 percent of the total vote. Between September 1930 and July 1932, their share of the vote grew dramatically, from 18 to 37 percent, and then, in November, two months before taking power, they lost two million voters and declined to 33 percent. Party membership was even more unstable: although it also grew rapidly after 1930, as many as 40 percent of those who joined between 1925 and 1933 eventually left the party. Mr. Brustein cites these figures as an argument against those who explain Nazism through "irrational" appeals like anti-Semitism; it seems to me that they are equally hard to combine with his conception of economic calculation. What these figures do suggest is the fear, frustration and disorientation produced among German voters by the economic and political crisis that gripped Germany after 1929.
Economic rationality also fails to explain the manifest unevenness of the Nazis' success. Although every German party was affected by the Depression and its aftermath, some were far better at retaining their supporters than others. The liberal parties, for example, had virtually disappeared by 1932, whereas the Center Party (the party of political Roman Catholicism), and to a lesser extent the Social Democrats, managed to hold on to their voters. Many Social Democratic and, particularly, Center voters had economic interests quite like the groups overrepresented in Mr. Brustein's sample. It seems clear that people's previous political affiliations, not their occupations, remained the most powerful element in determining German voting behavior.
The most disturbing part of "The Logic of Evil" is the author's conclusion that because they acted "rationally," Hitler's supporters were not fully responsible for the grim consequences of their choice. Mr. Brustein is probably right (and Mr. Goldhagen wrong) that before 1933 anti-Semitism was not particularly important for many Nazi voters and even for some party members. But while the Nazi leaders did not emphasize their anti-Semitism before coming to power, they made no effort to conceal their conviction that Jews should be removed from German society. Nor did they attempt to conceal their willingness to use violence against their opponents at home and abroad. In the summer of 1932, for example, Hitler expressed his solidarity with a group of his followers who were convicted of dragging a suspected Communist from his bed and beating him to death in front of his mother. Any satisfactory account of Nazism's success must explain why so many "ordinary and rational" Germans chose to endorse, justify or simply ignore these aspects of the movement they helped bring to power.

HEADLINE: Black-Owned Bank To Open a Center In Mount Vernon

BYLINE: By F. ROMALL SMALLS 

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON

 BODY:
CARVER Federal Savings Bank, the largest black-owned financial institution in the country, is coming to Westchester.
Carver Federal, based in Harlem, will open a mortgage and loan center in downtown Mount Vernon next month. Local officials and bank administrators say they hope it will be the beginning of a long relationship. 
 The Mount Vernon lending center will be Carver's second loan center to open this year, and outgrowth of what is considered the once fiscally conservative bank's new, more aggressive approach. Much of Carver's new direction is attributed to the appointment of a new president and chief executive officer, the veteran banking executive Thomas L. Clark Jr. of Greenburgh.
Mr. Clark took the helm of of the $363 million institution in February 1995, about the time that Ernest E. Davis was sworn in as Mayor of Mount Vernon. "We were both friends, and the way fate would have it, he was elected president of the bank and I was elected Mayor," Mr. Davis said. "He promised me that if I was elected that he would work with me in bringing Carver to Mount Vernon."
Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association opened in a storefront on 125th Street in Harlem on Jan. 5, 1949. It was founded by a coalition of community advocates, church leaders and small business owners, who established Carver in an area that was being overlooked by other banks.
Today Carver, named for the black scientist and educator George Washington Carver, has two locations in Manhattan, three in Brooklyn, two in Queens and one in Roosevelt, L.I.
Bank and city officials here are looking for a site for the mortgage and loan center. "We think Mount Vernon fits our profile of where we want to be and what we want to be," Mr. Clark said when asked why Carver Federal was moving into the suburban market north of New York City. "It's a middle- to upper-class, African-American community -- predominantly. We feel that we're going to give them an opportunity to deal with a bank that is steeped in working for communities and helping people to attain their goals."
Like Carver's Chelsea District location in Manhattan, the Mount Vernon center will have a small staff and will focus exclusively on originating mortgages, small business loans and loan and debt refinancing. "The target market is lower Westchester and the North Bronx," said Howard Dabney, Carver Federal vice president and chief lending officer. "It will be a central location for all in the area." Mr. Dabney said bank representatives would have laptop computers with modems and will arrange meetings at clients' homes or businesses if necessary. Mr. Dabney said the computers would speed up processing time. "The laptop allows them to evaluate things on the spot. The modem allows communication back to the central office and to credit bureaus," he said.
Mount Vernon's importance to Carver lies not only in its convenient location but also in its sizable black middle-class base. Carver has gained a reputation for opening branches in neighborhoods that are largely populated by members of minority groups or where major commercial banks have closed offices.
"I would like to see Carver, at a minimum, as a $500-million asset institution by December of '97, and by the turn of the century I would like to see us, at a minimum, as a billion-dollar institution," said Mr. Clark, who has lived in Westchester for more than 20 years. "To obtain that growth, we've got to be where the markets are. So following where our people are, those that want an urban-development community bank is important."
Mr. Clark said he felt that Mount Vernon would become Carver's northern corporate headquarters. "Everything we launch in Westchester County will be from our base in Mount Vernon," he said. "So at some point we would like to see a full-service bank operating in Mount Vernon." Mayor Davis said this would require nearly $25 million in bank deposits.
Community leaders and members of a church here have formed a committee to gain support for a full-service branch of Carver Federal Savings. Two innovative products that Mr. Clark said should attract residents are Carver's reverse mortgage, which will allow older residents to use the equity in their home, and a 100 percent-financed first-time home mortgage, which should appeal to young prospective home buyers.
Philippe Francois, a contractor, said he was eager to see the bank come to his hometown. "I would be happy to support a black-owned bank here in Mount Vernon," he said, adding with a broad smile: "I'm sure they will help me. I'm thinking about expanding now and buying more equipment. This could be a good push for me." City officials are also optimistic about Carver's arrival. "This is a dream come true," said Ruth Hassell-Thompson, president of the Mount Vernon City Council. "It speaks to an economic stability that sends very positive signals. They see the growth and development that we are planning."
Community leaders said that the added competition should force other banks to be more aggressive in offering loans to small businesses and those not currently being targeted for loans. "If you look at the record of many banks in Mount Vernon, you will see that the record is poor. We are looking to Carver, who are very much on the forefront of community reinvestment," Councilwoman Hassell-Thompson said.
Mr. Dabney said Carver is different from commercial banks because "we spend the time to get the answer to the problem that in normal circumstances would disqualify a candidate. We look for reasons in how we can make the loan, not reject a loan."
Throughout much of the 47-year history of Carver, it had a conservative lending policy, but in recent years the association has gone through significant changes. Two years ago, Carver started trading publicly on Nasdaq. And Mr. Clark, former Deputy Superintendent and Secretary to the State Banking Department for nearly 20 years, was elected to lead the bank into the 21st century with a new mission of "urban community redevelopment," he said. The bank also recently became a certified Small Business Administration lender.
So far this year, Carver has issued nearly $19 million in family mortgages and small business loans. The seven bank members in the Westchester Regional Small Business Loan Program have themselves provided $4.5 million in small business loans this year.
"We think it's a terrific thing for Westchester," said Harold E. Vogt, president of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce.
Before the establishment of black-owned banks like Carver Federal, which was chartered in 1948, many blacks were denied access to basic financial services. Even now recent studies show that there are still large disparities in the lending patterns between blacks and whites nationwide. Carver Federal is the only black-owned bank in New York State, and is one of only two of its kind traded on Nasdaq.
For many, Carver's arrival in Westchester is considered a milestone. "It is another building block in my city that will last for decades," Mayor Davis said.

HEADLINE: Adapting to Downsizing

BYLINE: By ANN COSTELLO 

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
IT was a 10th anniversary get-together for the group, held on a perfect morning in an opulent room in the Gothic-style castle at Manhattanville College. But it was no frivolous party.
The group of 50 career counselors who attended were there to observe the birthday of the founding of the Westchester Career Counselors' Network, an educational and networking group of 125 counselors, the only one of its kind in the county and, possibly, the country. They also heard two speakers discuss "Are You Change Agile or Change Fragile?" They wanted to be better able to help Westchester's job seekers, displaced homemakers and foundering college graduates. It was part of the effort to hear about ways to adapt to change, gain new insights and update and improve career-counseling skills. 
 One speaker, Dr. Herbert Nieburg, a therapist, author, lecturer, trainer, college professor and director of Behavioral Medicine/Psycho-Oncology at Four Winds Hospital in Katonah, used a humorous style to explain how job seekers who were stuck in a self-defeating way of thinking could learn to become unstuck. The other speaker, Kate Wendleton, a career coach and author based in Manhattan, used a saleswoman's pitching skills to explain how her business, the Five O'Clock Clubs, which she founded in 1978, help job hunters work out similar problems, using job-search strategy groups.
Faye Woocher, the founder of Westchester Career Counselors' Network and a career-development counselor for 16 years, lives in Ardsley-on-Hudson and is president of the Career Resource Center in Tarrytown. She recalled starting the group 10 years ago because of the loneliness of the profession. "It was a professional exchange that I started and kept going on my own from 1986 to 1991," she said. "Then I got busy with a job in Manhattan and needed to have a steering committee to keep it going." In the early days, there might be 5 or 6 or as many as 14 around her conference table. They now meet four times a year.
Ms. Woocher, who says she knows of no other group like it, said that the nonprofit Westchester Career Counselors' Network "provides education for these nationally certified career counselors and career-development specialists so that their skills and information can be on the leading edge."
She said that, as the economy has changed and downsizing and outplacement have become common, the career-counseling profession has grown. The group also outgrew Ms. Woocher's office. It began meeting in college or corporate settings like Manhattanville College's centerpiece, the Castle, this year.
When Ms. Woocher opened the meeting, she acknowledged the three career counselors who, with her, formed the steering committee in 1991: Elaine Sozzi of Mount Kisco, Claire Watsky of Mamaroneck and Gloria Goldstein of Larchmont.
Ms. Sozzi runs what used to be the Westchester Educational Brokering Service but is now the WEBS Career and Educational Counseling Service program operated through the Westchester Library System, providing free career counseling. Ms. Watsky runs job-search workshops for people 50 and older at a nominal fee for the American Association of Retired Persons. Ms. Goldstein heads Directions Career Counseling in Larchmont.
In her practice, Ms. Woocher said, she handles placement for the Ciba Corporation of Hawthorne and the Pure Food Company of Mamaroneck, after the food company was bought by Durkee French Company. She said she also works with "relocating spouses from Big Six accounting firms who move to the Westchester area."
Dr. Nieburg said of the group: "This is an extremely professional and highly ethical group, and when the issue of career counseling comes up, which is really outside of my scope, I often refer to them and they might refer to me. It's very reciprocal."
Karen Ganz, director of the Office of Career Services at Manhattanville College and a member of the Network, praised the group's ability to network.
In explaining the makeup of the group, Ms. Goldstein said: "The diversity is great. Most of us have a master's degree in counseling. We have a couple of psychologists, and a number of us are nationally certified counselors, which means we've taken a four-hour exam and have earned 125 clock hours of re-education to be certified. This could include these meetings, where you can qualify for C.E.U.'s."
Recalling that 10 years ago, "there were just a few of us," Ms. Goldstein summarized the group's appeal by saying: "Now we have 125. We were just friends, and somehow this started to grow and turned into an enormous thing. It's run on a volunteer basis. But it's done for the love of it."

COMPARED with music, art exhibitions, novels and movies, even obscure ones, poetry has few followers and fewer practitioners. It is widely regarded as uncomfortably highbrow and not much fun.
True, the last few years have brought a boom in poetry readings and book sales. Poems have shown up in unorthodox places like New York City buses and Amtrak's New York-to-Washington trains. 
 It's safe to assume that most adults in search of entertainment would choose poetry over a zoning board meeting, or a lecture on the impact of Nepalese immigration on the economy of Bhutan. But most other diversions -- "Seinfeld," a dinner out, lying on the couch talking on the phone -- would probably win out over poems. And few strangers to poetry would understand why people get worked up about it: arguing about it, being moved to tears over it, generally investing passion in it.
This is why the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival, taking place from Thursday through next Sunday at Waterloo Village in Stanhope, is so different from poetry as outsiders would view it. The Dodge festival, held every two years since 1986, contradicts the usual assumptions of what poetry is and who cares about it.
First, the festival is not a select, rarefied gathering. It is, in fact, huge -- bigger than many major rock concerts, the biggest gathering of poets in the country, the continent, maybe the world. Some 10,000 people from all over the United States have attended past festivals and are expected at this one. They include hundreds of English teachers, thousands of high school students, and thousands of others who work at a variety of jobs, from park superintendents to high school coaches to homemakers, business people and the occasional heavy-equipment operator.
Few of the teachers teach at universities; most teach at middle schools and high schools. The teen-agers will not necessarily be the ones who shine in school with high grades and S.A.T. scores.
The Dodge festival was founded and is run by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation of Morristown, which gives money to causes including education, public policy, animal rights and the arts, especially in schools. Its fame has increased since "The Language of Life," a Bill Moyers documentary series seen by millions on public television, focused on the 1994 festival.
People who have attended past festivals say they anticipate them as eagerly as others do vacations in Cancun. What these participants love -- with an intensity some reserve for the beach or the World Series -- is the onslaught of words, billions of them, words booming simultaneously from nine different stages. At the Dodge festival, people can wander from terse free verse in the gazebo to rich, rolling images in the weaving barn, from heart-stabbing descriptions of private pain at one end of the meadow to wryly witty recitations at the other.
Festivalgoers can listen all day, and they do. Scattered throughout the reconstructed Colonial village's 365 acres from 8 A.M. to nearly midnight, are readings and readings and readings. There are intimate readings, and there are readings to audiences of 300 or 400. There are readings that are booming and dramatic, quiet and intimate, sung to music. In the air are poems that are rhythmical or structured or free or spontaneous; poems that are blunt and plain, intricate and mellifluous, as subtle as a glance or as abrupt as cardiac arrest.
In between all these readings, all these poetic groupings of words, the participants may talk to strangers or muster the courage to recite their own work. They may mingle with the featured poets, indulging in hero worship, or engage in displays of fraternal-sororal affection between bites of funnel cake and leaden cafeteria-style food.
There's a lot of weeping and laughing and touching because of the joy of being around others who love what is ordinarily a lonely pursuit, and because of the abrupt intimacy created by poems expressing profound emotions and personal experiences.
"People are always embracing, hugging each other," said Edwin Romond, a poet who teaches at Warren Hills High School in Washington, Warren County. Mr. Romond, who has attended other Dodge festivals, ranks them among his life's high points. "It's a very beautiful experience.
"It's the Woodstock of poetry: Allen Ginsberg in one tent, Lucille Clifton in another," he continued, describing the 1994 festival. "It was overpowering. Poetry requires such concentration. I had to get in my car and go down to the diner for a cup of coffee -- get unpumped before I would go back."
Many poets would agree. "I don't know why it's magical," said Robert Hass, the nation's poet laureate, who said he was planning to attend the festival. "It's very festive, very lively. It's like some plant growing the dark, hugely and gorgeously blooming. Poetry gets practiced in private a lot. Suddenly there's thousands of people there interested in it."

A Safe Harbor, Or Just Too Darn Nice?
Thousands of people -- teachers, students, people who secretly write poems they would not even show their spouses, and many professional poets -- love the Dodge festival. Many think it is unparalleled in introducing poetry to a much wider audience.
Not all poets are so complimentary.
Certainly none object to the cause of poetry's being championed, which, if nothing else, could lead to bigger book sales.
But there are those who are not fond of the festival's all-inclusive, populist style. And since they are poets, artists whose medium is language, their arguments about what the festival and its poets lack tend to be lengthy, impassioned and nuanced.
Briefly, some poets -- individuals and groups -- think the Dodge festival tends to simplify and sentimentalize an art that should be complex, multi-layered with meaning and nuances of language, and best savored privately, on the page. Another objection is that in trying to be palatable to many, the festival's poets avoid gritty, jarring, experimental and scathing works. Much of the poetry read at Waterloo is autobiographical, revealing very personal feelings and occurrences. Some deride this genre as confessional; some even say it is little more than elegant Oprah.
Some poets and critics say that vast, populist poetry readings are too undiscriminating, too inclusive of mediocre works.
"A feel-good, fun kind of thing doesn't go very far," said Marjorie Perloff, a critic of contemporary poetry who has not attended a Dodge festival but knows the work of its poets. "That's nice, but who needs it?"
Another influential poetry critic, Helen Vendler of Harvard University, has accused the festival of placing too much emphasis on politically correct, multicultural poetry, of carefully including poets of different races and ethnic backgrounds but not putting enough emphasis on the complexity and sophistication of the art form.
"Pernicious polarization," said Bill Wadsworth, executive director of the Academy of American Poets, a 62-year-old organization that gives out prizes and grants to poets of its choice. A lot of these so-called controversies "would be quieted if poetry were run like a decent record store -- there's sections for classical, pop, rock, blues, jazz," he said, adding: "You pick what you like. No one's saying there shouldn't be pop or jazz."
Ms. Perloff said she admired some of the festival's featured poets, including Robert Creeley and Geraldine Brooks, but she compared the writing of others to Hallmark verse. "If it's not going to be better than greeting cards, why not see something on TV?" she said.
Some poets see the Dodge festival as a fine forum for exploring oral poetry, a way of introducing newcomers and deepening the connection and knowledge of others to a wide spectrum of poets. But at the Dodge festival, all poetry is recited or sung.
"Poetry on a page in a book is the very best, highest form of the art," said Bill Wadsworth, executive director of the Academy of American Poets, a national association that gives awards and fellowships. "I love going to poetry readings. But for me a deep love of poetry leads one to read books." At its best, "poetry is the attempt to put something into language that's absolutely permanent," he said. "It does involve composition on the page."
Yet Dodge's multitudinous readings, "done so magnificently," he said, "make poetry living for high school students."
"Nothing could be more important for the future of the art than that," he said.
Even an admirer like Mr. Hass conceded that startling poetic innovations or intricate many-layered verses do not emerge from the Dodge festival.
"It's not a gathering of new writing on the edge," he said. "It's not a place for austerity and difficult abstractions. It's not for poets who have a loathing for easy images, a distrust of autobiography or big, emotional resolutions. Nor is it an academy of American poetry, a gathering of the most eminent poets teaching at the Ivy League. Its sensibility is both populist and democratic. It's got good poets and not so good. The atmosphere is very nice."
That is precisely what Robert Creeley, the groundbreakingly innovative, venerable, old-dog poet of upstate New York, is hoping will not be too apparent. At this, his first Dodge festival, he's delighted with the company; "the poets are terrific," he said. He savors the idea of being surrounded by dozens of loud and frequently musical recitations, of off-the-cuff creations, of experiments that work and that don't. But the prospect of being in the middle of thousands of people who are decorous, who skirt edgy danger, who are, in a word, nice -- well, he doesn't look forward to that.
"Poetry can be mean, vicious," he said. "It's utterly human, an utterly human agency. I just hope this isn't too nice. I hope it doesn't turn out to be a conference of nice people."

Buds Among Weeds, And Other Lessons
In the four days of the Dodge Festival, 50 poets will read 3,000 or more poems to audiences ranging in number from 5 or 10 to 300 or 400. Fifty other poets will conduct 80 workshops; dozens of participants will read their work or recite spontaneous poems.
Among the poets will be the eminent -- Ms. Brooks, Mr. Ginsberg and Mr. Creeley, among others -- and the aged, the eldest being Stanley Kunitz, 91, a Pulitzer Prize winner who also holds the distinction of being the oldest living poet writing in English to have a new book published ("Passing Through," W. W. Norton). The youngest will be 23 winners of the 1996 New Jersey High School Poetry Contest, sponsored by Rutgers University.
The audience will consist of 1,500 high school teachers and 3,500 students from New Jersey and New York as well as 5,000 individuals, who will arrive from around the country. For $15 a day they will be able to select from a bewildering number of events: Mr. Hass's 8 A.M. reading at the old church; poets reading from the works of Langston Hughes and Federico Garcia Lorca; Mr. Ginsberg singing poems he'll create on the spot; poets at numerous formal and open readings. In the evenings, poets will read and sing to the music of the Paul Winter Consort. Participants can select among workshops on poetry and women, and poetry and history, and jobs, and teaching, and living with another poet, and living with oneself as a poet, and the Spirit and the all-purpose "Search for Truth."
Clearly, with workshops called "The Search for Truth," the organizers of the Dodge Festival are not embarrassed at sounding earnest. This is precisely the way Jim Haba, poetry director of the Dodge Foundation, wants it. As much as possible, he has put together a gentle, unsarcastic, uncritical gathering, a place where new or shy poets can stutter through their first readings without having to face boos or groans or low scores waved in their faces.
"You have to be willing to write your bad poems, to be embarrassingly, shamefully corny," Mr. Haba said. Good poems, he said, grow among weeds. At Waterloo, this willingness means a decorous willingness to listen -- without grimacing, even to oneself -- to weeds along with better work.
"Poets -- who can be vicious -- come together there around a protected space," Mr. Haba said. "It's a place where the truth is not something to deny."
This is an approach thousands of New Jersey teachers have taken from the festival into the classroom. Teachers who have attended the festival, especially the two weekdays set aside for students and teachers, tend to experiment with personal poetry that lets students express themselves while becoming adept with language.
"It taps the poetry already in them," said Patrick Trujillo, who teaches English at Lincoln Middle School in Passaic. "They get turned off by conventional writing, but they're turned on by this."
Laura Czekaj, who teaches creative writing at Hasbrouck Heights High School, said: "When I teach standard poetry, I get groans. But when they write poetry this way, they get excited. I'm surprised how enthused they are with standard poetry. They wonder: 'What's the relevance to my life? Why do we have to do this?' But when they write poems about themselves and listen to what the others have written, their attention is riveted. They don't have to be told this is important. They know."

HEADLINE: The Voice of Women in Politics

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
SHE was considered a trailblazer, one of a tough new breed of women breaking ground in politics. She edged into the old boys' network, cut deals in smoked-filled rooms and promoted the economic and social causes affecting women. Recently, though, Cecile D. Singer, 66, looked back at the generation of female politicians coming up in the ranks and said that, contrary to what she had hoped for, there was no thundering herd following in her footsteps.
"My generation navigated a difficult political system: we opened up a lot of doors," said Ms. Singer, a former Republican State Assemblywoman from Yonkers and one of a field of possible candidates for County Executive next year. "The problem is that if there aren't more like us, women won't continue to be heard." 
 Indeed, statistics show that women are markedly underrepresented in government. In Congress and in most state legislatures, only 10 percent of the lawmakers are women; in the New York State Legislature, that number is about 18 percent.
Experts in the field say that even though politics appears on the surface to be an alluring field, it continues to be a difficult one for women to enter for several reasons.
In recent interviews, female politicians in Westchester described the difficulty of balancing families with careers that often take them away from home for long periods of time -- the result being that many women wait until their families are grown.
Some women spoke of the problems they encounter in raising money for campaigns, which have become more and more expensive.
Others lamented the persistence of the old boys' network, which sometimes spurns them and other times fails to take them seriously.
"With all of these variables," Ms. Singer said, "it's no wonder that it sometimes takes us a long time to get out of the gate."
Ms. Singer described herself as part of "a bridge generation that sandwiched politics in between the children and the chicken soup."
For black women in politics today, entering the field is especially daunting. In interviews, they complained about what the Yonkers City Councilwoman Symra D. Brandon, a Democrat, called "a double whammy -- the racial as well as gender stereotypes we have to battle."
Overall, the most difficult issue for the women, regardless of race, was deciding when to enter politics, and many said they waited to run for state or national office until they were older.
Like Representative Nita Lowey, a Democrat from Harrison, many of the women came up through the ranks from a background of public service, which centered on parent-teacher organizations and community affairs.
"I never had a long-term plan," said Mrs. Lowey, who raised her children first and then ran for Congress eight years ago when she turned 50. "I got there circuitously. Yet looking back, I can see that each step I took set me up for the next."
Several of the women, like Sandra R. Galef, 56, a Democratic State Assemblywoman from Ossining, said they had entered politics while their children were young but ran only for local office. Mrs. Galef was a County Legislator from 1980 to 1993, and although her schedule involved many late-night meetings, she said she managed with "a lot of Kentucky Fried Chicken" to come home each night for her family.
Amy R. Paulin, 40, of Scarsdale, a Village Trustee, an advocate of many county issues and the mother of three children under 12, said she was debating whether to seek higher office. "If there was an opening to go to Albany, would I even want to?" she said. "On the one hand, I would miss out on these important years with my children, but then do I want to wait 10 or 15 years to make a difference politically?"
The interviews also revealed that the female politicians -- regardless of age, race or their paths to elected office -- shared a common characteristic, what many of them described as an intense desire to have an impact on issues.
"What it comes down to is a passion," said the county's District Attorney, Jeanine Pirro, 45. "It's in our blood.".
Or as Ms. Singer described it, "We burn with all these fevers, this need to be present on the issues."
For the most part, those passions are directed at issues directly affecting women and their families -- what Dr. Ester Fuchs, a professor of political science at Columbia University, called "the kinder and gentler issues."
For District Attorney Pirro, those issues have included domestic violence and child abuse. For Representative Lowey, who was co-chairwoman of the Congressional Caucus on Women's Issues, it has been financial support for fighting breast cancer. Councilwoman Brandon of Yonkers has focused on the needs of children and health care for the mostly poor and minority constituents in her district. And Lois T. Bronz, a Democratic County Legislator from Greenburgh, said she has similarly focused on the housing concerns and human services needed by her minority constituents in a middle- and low-income district of Westchester's largest town.
"These are quality-of-life issues," Mrs. Lowey said. "Men share those concerns, but they focus more on jobs and the economy. By contrast, women bring a lifetime of personal passions to politics."
Or as Ms. Paulin said: "It's not that men are unsympathetic. They're just not as aware of these issues as women. Somehow, life has divided us."
Ms. Singer, however, said, "I'd like to see more women get up and talk about Bosnia and economics."
Eager though they were to contribute to the political process, the women said their efforts were not always welcome.
"I have a coffee cup that keeps reminding me of how difficult politics can be for us," said Vincenza A. Restiano, 48, a Republican, who is President of the Yonkers City Council. "It says that the ladder to success is harder to climb in high heels. This is true.
"So how do I crack the old boys' network? By showing them I can get the vote. I get the satisfaction when I go to the polls."
When Mrs. Galef first became a County Legislator and worked late into the evening, she said a fellow politician once told her to go home and cook for her husband.
"Another time a group of women Legislators were working around a table when one of the male Legislators came in and said, 'Oh, look, the housewives are doing the County budget,' " she said.
"We told him thank you, we were doing a very good job."
Mrs. Bronz, who is 69, said she experienced the most opposition from black men. "Not only did I have have to prove that I knew what I was doing and where I was going, but I had to learn to build a partnership with them," she said. "At first, they were extremely critical. Nothing that I was doing was right."
On the other hand, Mrs. Lowey, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said she never experienced any resistance from her male counterparts, although Washington, when she first arrived there, was clearly male dominated.
"There were only three gynecologists on the staff of the National Institutes of Health," she said. "Even the lab rats were all males. That has since changed."
Expressing another difficulty for them, many of the women said that campaign contributions were harder to come by for female politicians, although they conceded that they were less adept than men at raising money.
Emily's List, a national political-action committee, which backs Democratic candidates who favor abortion rights, has made available more than $50,000 in campaign donations from across the country. Emily is an acronym for Early Money Is Like Yeast.
The goal of Eleanor's List, another political action committee, is to get more Democratic women who favor abortion rights into the New York State Legislature.
Professor Fuchs at Columbia University said that the women's difficulties in raising campaign funds kept their numbers in politics low.
She also said that it was not unusual for female officeholders, like Representative Susan Molinari of New York and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, to come from political families.
"Not only do the women have a harder time raising money but it is difficult sometimes for them to break into politics," she said. "It is not an accident that Susan Molinari or Christine Todd Whitman are successful. They had someone showing them the ropes."
But Steven A. Galef, Mrs. Galef's husband, observed that women can often afford to go into low-paying political jobs -- for example, in the County Legislature -- when men cannot. Mr. Galef, a lawyer and a Democratic County Legislator from 1976 to 1980, said he chose not to continue because he could not afford to give up his law practice and devote full time to county business.

The author has the temerity to tell those of us who do work how we have to function in order to get the unproductive members of society out of their beds and off their duffs. Then, to top it off, we have to bring the jobs to them. 
 It is an insult to everyone in the United States who goes to work every day for Wilson to use Western European democracies with homogeneous populations as a yardstick. Those countries allow almost no immigration; their societies share the same cultural values, attributes and language. Their children attain the same basic educational levels.

Wilson informs us that work "constitutes a framework for daily behavior because it imposes discipline." But is someone really employable before he learns discipline, and when is that instilled? I suspect very early in life. We do have data indicating that inner-city black youths who grow up attending church or mosque and/or live in two-parent families do much better statistically in school, are much less likely to commit crimes or use drugs and usually end up gainfully employed. Where do they find jobs? They commute on public transportation to jobs in other sections of the city. How many Americans, even urban dwellers, white or black, have the luxury of walking to work?

As one who reached maturity in the Great Depression, I remember well the accomplishments of the W.P.A. and feel strongly that something of that nature is what we need today.
 As a young newspaper reporter, I can recall asking a W.P.A. administrator about the "wastefulness" of some of its projects. (For example, dozens of men with snow shovels laboring -- or, as some critics complained, merely leaning on their shovels -- to complete a job that could have been accomplished by one man with power equipment in about the same time.) His answer was: "We're not trying to do the most efficient job. We're trying to create jobs where none now exist." Rather than collecting "welfare" checks, workers had the satisfaction of feeling that they had earned the income they received. 
 And it was not only manual laborers who found work under this program. The W.P.A. recognized that artists and writers, actors and playwrights also had to buy groceries.
Less widely known were the activities of the Civilian Conservation Corps. Its work was largely in forestry, national parks etc. With the importance of conservation today, this program, too, might be revived.

Fate of a Derelict Mill Clouds Patchogue's Future

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: PATCHOGUE

 BODY:
THE first thing that visitors from the west see as they enter this South Shore village is a complex of dilapidated red-brick factory buildings, which many say is a prime cause of the community's deteriorating fortunes.
The sprawling former lace mill, its windows boarded up and extensive fire damage visible from the street, occupies a 12.5-acre site between West Main Street and Waverly Avenue. 
 The complex consists of six interconnected buildings with more than 200,000 square feet of space, towered over by a giant smokestack and a clock tower.
Proposals ranging from boutiques to condominiums have fallen by the wayside as the mill deteriorated over the years. New investment has been deterred, a third of the stores lining Main Street are vacant and residential values have been dragged down.
Nevertheless, a proposal by Roizman Development of Norristown, Pa., a developer of rental housing, to turn the 19th-century structures into a $22 million housing project for people over the age of 55 was rejected by the village's Board of Trustees Sept. 3.
The developers need a special permit to build housing on the industrially zoned site and its purchase from the owner, 225 West Main Street Corporation of Patchogue, is contingent on getting that approval.
The denial of the permit may face a court challenge by the developers.
"We didn't anticipate opposition to senior housing and we've invested between $400,000 to $500,000 in this project in engineering studies, architectural fees and cleaning up the location," said Robert J. Joy, the vice president of Roizman Development. "Right now we are exploring several options, and leaning toward litigation."
Mayor Stephen E. Keegan defended his board's decision, saying, "Since this is the last piece of industrially zoned land on Main Street, we felt that the highest and best use would not be housing."
Patchogue was most successful when the lace mill provided jobs, the Mayor noted, adding that now the best thing to do would be to demolish the existing buildings and use the site for commercial development.
Back taxes of almost $200,000 are owed to the village and an additional $700,000 is owed to Suffolk County, he said, adding that the village intended to foreclose on the owners.
"My vision for that property is to see a 21st century lace mill, whether it would be a bank back office or a credit card or an insurance company, but something that would bring jobs to the community," he said.
Preservationists say that if the lace mill buildings were demolished, Patchogue would lose a historic identity that sets it apart from other communities.
"Patchogue will be a much less interesting place because of their decision," said John Auwaerter, program analyst for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
THE state agency had urged village officials to approve the development proposal to insure "the preservation and continued use of Patchogue's most prominent complex of historic buildings."
"These buildings, with this great high looming smokestack that was the hallmark of industry, jut up like the cathedrals of their landscape, dominating everything," said George E. Thomas, historic consultant to Roizman Development and a lecturer on historic preservation at the University of Pennsylvania.
"As you turn into Patchogue you see this cluster of brick buildings with wonderful arched heads over the windows and with the scale and majesty that at least in America only industry could provide in our villages."
The complex was built in phases between 1880 and 1920, using the water power of the Patchogue River originally to produce cotton twine that could be used in weaving rugs and, later, to produce crinolines and laces. As the mill prospered and expanded, it provided employment for up to 800 people and built a thriving local economy.
"The story of the community was written around the lace mill," Dr. Thomas said. "We all too often lose the touchstone buildings that tell our story and that would be the big loss here."
Roizman had originally proposed 250 apartments, using five of six existing buildings and adding some new construction. Income limits would have been applied because the developers expected to use Federal tax credits available for the production of housing affordable to households making 60 percent or less of the area's median income.
But that raised fears in the community that a low-income housing project was being proposed.
Those fears persist even though the plan was subsequently scaled back to 140 units, all of them within the existing structures. Occupancy was to be limited to older people, with one family member at least 55 old and children under 19 not allowed. A single person could have had an annual income of up to $27,960 and a two-person household up to $31,920. Proposed rent ranges were $584 monthly for a 845-square-foot, one-bedroom, $842 for a 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom and $967 for a 1,200-square-foot three-bedroom.
An economic impact analysis prepared for the developers by Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, and by Thomas Conoscenti, an economist, found that not only was housing for the aging greatly needed, but the proposed project would have yielded $200,000 annually in net taxes and generated more than $3 million annually for the region's economy.
"It would have put shoppers on Main Street, which it sorely needs, and it would have cleared up a blight that is like an anchor weighing everything else down," said David A. Sloane, a Hauppauge lawyer who represents Roizman.
The developers expected to apply for tax credits available to projects that meet strict state and Federal criteria for historic preservation.
ALTHOUGH the interiors would have been gutted, the facades would all have been retained, along with the smokestack and clock tower. The building shapes, the large window openings, and the high ceilings would have permitted apartments with spacious layouts and lots of light, said Richard J. Kline, vice president of GGK Architects of Philadelphia, the project's designer. A four-acre parcel at the west end of the site would have been donated to the village.
Opponents of the project found its sponsors' arguments unconvincing.
"The question is, 'Why add rentals if the village's existing 2,000 rental units that have been there for years haven't produced any economic activity?' " said Martin R. Cantor, a former Suffolk County Commissioner of Economic Development.
He had also been a consultant to the village for its ongoing plan to develop the community as a tourist destination with a maritime center and other attractions.
Instead of shopping locally, he said, "people go to malls and outlet centers to spend their money."
A group of investors has proposed building a minor-league baseball stadium on the property, with a 5,000- to 6,000-seat capacity. Forty-five home games a year would bring in 3,000 to 4,000 visitors each time, said Michael Barsanti, a member of the group called Patchogue Professional Baseball. Parking behind stores would provide some of the off-site spaces that would be needed and that would help Main Street merchants, he said.
Ronald Bush, a local real estate broker who was involved in putting together the Roizman deal, called the stadium plan "ridiculous," because of parking problems, because it was seasonal and because of the danger that the team could founder, "leaving Patchogue with a big, empty stadium."
Mr. Bush said anyone purchasing the property would have to spend $1 million demolishing the buildings and another $1 million to pay back taxes.
"For the past 30 years I did three comprehensive plans for the site, " said Dr. Koppelman of the Regional Planning Board. "This was not the only project proposed, but this developer was going to put in the investment needed to revitalize this site."
"My hope was that this project might act as a catalyst for improving the whole situation, but my arguments fell on deaf ears," he said. "The end result is that the village could sit with that derelict mess for another 30 years."

Jersey City's Waterfront Showing Signs of an Upturn

BYLINE: By By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
A ROLLER-COASTER office market took the commercial revitalization of the Hudson River waterfront here from the heights of the mid-80's to the depths of the early 90's, when construction ground to a halt. But in the years since, the riverfront has slowly rebounded, rekindling interest in building at the water's edge.
At the northern end of the riverfront, the Lefrak Organization of Rego Park, Queens, is gearing up to build the 17-story, 750,000-square-foot Newport Office Centre III at its 400-acre Newport Center mixed-used project. About a mile south, on Colgate-Palmolive's 20-acre Colgate Center site, once occupied by a toothpaste factory, plans are advancing for a 12-story 435,000-square-foot building. 
 Both projects have their approvals in place and will move forward once tenants are found to sign preconstruction leases, which are needed to obtain construction financing. The Lefrak Organization said it would build after 30 percent of its building was preleased. Colgate said it would go ahead when it had a tenant for half the space.
Many commercial brokers say the plans reflect the strengthening of the office market along the Hudson County portion of the waterfront in general and of Jersey City's in particular. In turn, they said, the next round of office construction is not far behind.
"The waterfront has been a major growth corridor for North Jersey since 1984 and since then Jersey City has given companies a lot of justification to move there," said Robert P. Antonicello, president of the ACI Group, a local real estate services concern. "It is no longer a frontier. "
In that time some 8.6 million square feet of offices were built, initially for a flow of financial services companies from Manhattan seeking larger and less expensive space. A 1.2-million-square-foot regional mall was also constructed, as were thousands of residences within the waterfront redevelopment district, which stretches for 1.7 miles along the riverfront and roughly eight blocks inland.
But then the 1987 stock market crash, followed by the real estate recession, stemmed the flow of tenants, leaving the riverfront with blocks of empty space and a vacancy rate that as recent as 1992 was as high as 36 percent. Under current zoning, at least 13.4 million more square feet of offices can be built on the remaining land in the district.
Steady leasing activity over the last three years has chipped away much of that available inventory. "Tenants looking for 100,000 square feet of prime space have no place to go," said Edwin H. Cohen, executive director at the East Rutherford office of the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage, which is marketing Newport Centre III.
AS of the first half of the year, Jersey City's waterfront had a vacancy rate of 8.9 percent, down from 12 percent a year ago; the rate for class A space fell to 7.2 percent from 10.6 percent a year ago, according to Cushman & Wakefield. As a result, average asking rents rose to $25.58 from $24.29 for all space and to $28.09 from $26.89 for prime space, among the highest in the 11-county northern New Jersey market.
Steven M. Frank, a first vice president at the Teaneck office of the CB Commercial brokerage, added that many tenants nearing the end of leases had not only renewed but expanded in Jersey City.
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the Manhattan-based investment firm, for example, just expanded by 73,200 square feet to just under 400,000 square feet at the 600,000-square-foot Cali Financial Tower on the Jersey City riverfront. And M.H. Meyerson, another securities firm, recently moved from Montgomery Street in Jersey City to the nearby Newport Office Tower along the water's edge, doubling its space to 30,000 square feet.
"Everyone expected that after companies initially jumped over the river they would migrate westward," Mr. Frank said. But that has not happened, creating a need for new space from within the market as well, he added.
Space along the rest of the Hudson County portion of the riverfront is also being absorbed. Even the long-vacant 300,000-square-foot building on Boulevard East in Weehawken has contracts signed but not yet closed with two tenants for half the building, said Seena Stein, president of Newmark Partners, the Mountainside-based brokerage that is marketing the building. "The waterfront is ripe for new construction," she said.
Yet while financing for new construction has become more available, it is still dependent on finding a tenant. Brokers said there were big users known to be shopping for space, including Federated Department Stores. The unknown is whether they will land in Jersey City.
Despite New York City's resolve to improve its downtown and retain companies, many brokers and owners believe Jersey City's waterfront will continue to draw tenants, and not only those tied to the financial sector.
In recent years a few telecommunications companies, including USA Networks and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, have located there.
Among the city's other advantages, Mr. Antonicello said, are its mass transportation links, including three PATH stations near the water's edge, the ferry service to Manhattan as well as the planned light rail line through the riverfront. There is no corporate occupancy tax and the area is a state-designated urban enterprise zone, where most corporate tenants pay no sales tax.
In addition, companies relocating to or expanding anywhere in New Jersey can take advantage of financial incentives offered through a state program begun in May. Up to 80 percent of the personal income tax revenue generated by each new employee brought on the tax rolls can be returned to the companies for up to 10 years.
THE more than 3,000 waterfront residences built or under way bolster the office sector by providing housing to employees and bringing life to the area after the offices close.
Mindful that more offices are in the works, Robert Cotter, Jersey City's planning director, said the waterfront master plan was being reviewed to encourage more of that mix along the first two blocks inland from the river's edge.
The developers of the planned office buildings said that those factors, along with technologically up-to-date buildings, would help them snag anchor tenants. Marketing for both began this summer.
Newport Centre III will join two office buildings now at the mixed-use site. One, with 450,000 square feet, is occupied by Recruit U.S.A, a Tokyo-based computer services company.
The other, the million-square-foot Newport Tower, is nearly fully leased with tenants including First Chicago Trust and USA Networks. The complex is also home to the 1.2-million-foot mall and 2,300 residences.
Richard S. LeFrak, president of the Lefrak Organization, said the new building was "very efficient, ready to go," and in a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week, walk-to-work environment. "People tend to bring in more people," he said.
Mr. Cohen of Cushman & Wakefield said, "a lot of tenants are looking hard and heavy for space, not just kicking tires."
At the Colgate Center, the new building, 90 Hudson Street, is to be one-third the size of its sister building, 101 Hudson Street. Now over 90 percent leased, that 1.2-million-square-foot building was built to specification for Merrill Lynch, which has half the space.
Peter Gilpatric, project executive for the Colgate site, said that with 90 Hudson Street "we have created a building we believe will give tenants what they want." He said the new building was smaller because financing would be easier to obtain.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Six Flags Wants to March Into Tourist Territory

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
WITH six of the state's seven top tourist attractions already in place, one about to open and another on its way, southeastern Connecticut may get still more destinations and millions of visitors if proposals for two entertainment complexes are realized.
Six Flags Theme Parks Inc. has proposed a $200 million amusement park on 200 acres off Interstate 95 in North Stonington, which it estimates would attract as many as four million people a year, about four times the number of people that now visit the region each year. 
 A Six Flags spokeswoman, Lauren Hurvitz, said the park would employ 2,000 to 3,000 people on a seasonal basis, and 200 to 300 year-round.
The site, midway between Boston and New York, would tap into a huge new market, said Ms. Hurvitz, noting that it was one of the nation's few metropolitan markets that is not within a five-hour drive of a theme park.
A few miles south on I-95 in Groton, Fun-Plex Inc. has proposed a $20 million development on 115 acres that would include educational and recreational computer simulations.
"This region is already the destination of eight out of 10 tourists who come to Connecticut, so it makes sense that they would want to be here," said the Groton Town Manager, Ronald P. LeBlanc. "It's clear that tourism is going to continue to grow, and will be a stable part of our economy in the future."
But not everyone is in favor of the new proposals. A new regional organization called Not a Done Deal, which is still mustering a membership, has sprung up to oppose the Six Flags project because of concerns that it will add to already heavy traffic generated by the Foxwoods Resort Casino a few miles up Route 2.
Members are also concerned about Six Flags attracting increased commercial development to the region, and other impacts on rural North Stonington, said Douglas J. Carocari, a fourth-generation North Stonington resident and founder of the town's Citizens Land Alliance who is also working for Not a Done Deal.
Nevertheless, both municipal officials and business leaders expect approvals of both Six Flags and Fun-Plex within a year, with construction taking about two years.
George T. Donnelly of Connecticut's Mystic & More, a local tourism promotion bureau, said studies that his agency commissioned showed the percentage of tourists spending two nights or more in the region had increased from 28 to 73 percent from 1994 to 1995. Spending increased from an average of $313.59 per tourist, to $457.09, during the same period.
Those statistics show Six Flags and Fun-Plex are following the tourists to southeastern Connecticut, rather than drawing them, Mr. Donnelly said.
"But if it were not for new ventures, tourism would not only flatten out, it would die off," Mr. Donnelly said. "If you want to keep people coming back to a region, you have to offer them something new."
Tourism has long been a part of the region's economy. Key attractions are Mystic Seaport, Mystic Aquarium, the Nautilus Submarine Memorial in Groton, the Coast Guard Academy and Ocean Beach Park in New London and Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard. State tourism officials say the region already draws more than a million visitors a year.
Two additional major attractions are in prospect -- OceanQuest, a marine sciences educational camp in New London, and the Mohegan Sun Casino in Montville. Site clearing has begun on the former and the casino is scheduled to open Oct. 12.
Ms. Hurvitz of Six Flags, which operates 12 theme parks around the country, said her company looked forward to "cross-marketing opportunities."
"We think there's a real potential to get people to stay in the area long enough to see everything," she said.
Ms. Hurvitz said the park would pay $2 million in property taxes each year, in addition to $10 million in state sales and amusement taxes. And tourists would spend an estimated $3 in the local economy for every $1 spent at the park, she added.
WHILE the Six Flags park will not be able to operate year-round because of the harsh New England winters, Ms. Hurvitz noted that the park park in Gurnee, Ill., outside Chicago, was a financial success even though the seasons there are similar to those in the Northeast.
Ms. Hurvitz said the company was sensitive to some opposition over the fact that the proposed site sits atop one of the state's largest aquifers and other environmental considerations. But she noted that its park in San Antonio had been built over an aquifer as well, with ample safeguards to protect the groundwater.
Arthur V. Pintauro, chairman of the North Stonington Planning and Zoning Commission, noted that a Legoland theme park had been proposed for the same industrially zoned site three years ago. But its Danish sponsor decided to build in Carlsbad, Calif., instead.
"They kind of made us ask the question, 'What if a theme park comes in?' " Mr. Pintauro said. "So for the last few years we've been trying to figure out how to measure the impact of something like a Six Flags, how to stack up all the pluses, and all the minuses."
On the plus side, he said, there are the new jobs and taxes; on the minus, the potential impact on schools, roads, city services, and so forth.
"We haven't put our arms around this yet, we don't know what to expect," Mr. Pintauro said. "Things are changing and we still have to come to grips with it."
While fewer specifics are available on the Fun-Plex proposal, Mr. LeBlanc, the Groton Town Manager, said his conversations with the company's executives had been encouraging.
"It's the family-type recreation we're looking for, in an area of town that we want to encourage development and it doesn't pose any significant environmental hazard," Mr. LeBlanc said.
Planners are urging caution because of the magnitude of the proposed operations. Richard B. Erickson, director of the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments, said traffic was a major consideration.
"Most of the local highways are not near the point of gridlock," said Mr. Erickson. It's more a question of at what point does the congestion reach a point where it's no longer acceptable, For some people, I think we're well past that point already."
But many are anxious to work out solutions. William D. Moore, executive director of the Southeastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, said a study last year commissioned by the nonprofit Corporation for Regional Economic Development, based in New London, had concluded that tourism was a segment of the economy that should be promoted. It specified the region should try to attract a theme park.
The proposals for the two entertainment complexes "will force the State Department of Transportation to make some decisions, particularly with regard to Route 11," Mr. Moore said. Route 11 was once planned as a limited access connector between Hartford and I-95 in Waterford. But it fell 10 miles short of its southern goal when the state ran out of money.
Mr. Moore said the proposals could create some spinoff development. The region's 6,400 hotel rooms already operate at near capacity for most of the summer, he said, and Foxwoods is building 1,000 more.
"You're going to see even more hotels built," Mr. Moore predicted. "And once the tourists come in the summer and see what we have to offer, you're going to start filling them up in the shoulder seasons, March to May and September to November."
BUT Mr. Carocari of Citizens Land Alliance remains firmly opposed to the new tourism proposals. "I don't want to live in a resort community," he said.
Promoters have touted the jobs and tax revenues the parks would bring, he said. But the development would also bring increased costs entailing the probable establishment of full-time police and fire departments, hiring building inspectors and beefing up its road improvement budget.
"If it ends up lowering my taxes even $50 a year, I would be surprised, and is that worth giving up our quality of life?" Mr. Carocari asked. "I don't think the town will become a more affordable place to live, but it will become a less desirable place to live.
"And as far as the jobs go, you're going to bring in a lot of seasonal positions that are low skill, low pay, not the kind of jobs that allow people to move into a town and raise families," Mr. Carocari said. "Basically, you'd have 4,000 kids partying all summer long -- and that's not the community where I want to raise my family."

HEADLINE: Incentives Are Luring Buyers to Bucks County

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE 

 BODY:
DEVELOPERS in a fast-growing, competitive market for single-family homes have started using time-tested car dealer tactics like financial incentives and short-term promotions to lure move-up buyers to Bucks County, a 40-minute drive northwest from downtown Philadelphia.
Prices for detached homes have declined in the last year to an average of $248,000 in the popular hilly rural area, which draws many people who commute to work 90 minutes by rail to New York City. 
 Despite the strongest market for single-family homes in this year's first half since 1992, the Orleans Corporation has revived a seasonal offer of cash rebates on home purchases, and Realen Homes, recently advertising 36 houses, invited buyers to "make us an offer."
The technique is employed by large developers trying to maintain the momentum of construction and a steady revenue stream. Such companies can afford to shave a few thousand dollars off sales prices of certain homes or are able to provide below-market mortgages to motivate buyers.
In some cases, these developers bought property from smaller, cash-strapped concerns during the downturn of the early 1990's, and there is now a rivalry for a market share. Bucks County has been a center of suburban home development for 20 years, and some towns, like Warwick and Newtown, have seen their population more than double since the early 80's.
According to a survey conducted in May by the the National Association of Home Builders, only about 6 percent of builders nationwide said they offered interest rates below market rates earlier this year; of those, most took a percentage point off a buyer's mortgage rate.
Since August of last year, Orleans has offered buyers a credit at closing of 6 percent of their old home's price, 4 percent of the new home price or the commission for selling the old house, whichever is lowest. Buyers may also opt to delay construction of their new home while locking in the price. If the old house has not yet sold, the amount of the credit is made contingent upon the price eventually obtained. With the credit offer in hand, buyers feel free to use more of their cash resources in their purchase.
Most purchases under its Trade Up program cost Orleans slightly less than 4 percent of the new purchase price, said John P. White, the company's vice president for sales administration. Its homes typically sell for $200,000 to $400,000. The company has also developed an appraisal service and list of suggested realtors to help buyers sell existing homes.
"The most it would cost us is 4 percent of the new home," Mr. White said. "But there has to be an appraisal on the old property; we specify a list of agents it can be listed with to insure a fair market value and that it's going to be marketed aggressively. I think it makes the difference in whether buyers can buy or not."
THE program has been offered twice by Orleans, the region's second-largest home builder. Based in Bensalem, Pa., it sold 497 homes in this area in 1995, ranking it behind the publicly traded Toll Brothers, according to the Legg Mason Realty Group. About 75 sales used the Trade Up program, said Gary Schaal, executive vice president for sales and marketing at Orleans.
"The main effect it's having is bringing people to our home sites," he said. "We see a lot of families who are first-time move-up buyers. We thought we'd see a lot of people with zero equity. Home equity is a disappearing commodity and we felt equity was a big reason why people weren't moving up."
The program enabled Thomas and Marcy Liberta to delay construction at the Deer Run development, near Doylestown, Pa., in Bucks County, until they sold a town house in Collegeville, about 40 minutes away. Making the move was a nightmare, they said. It took nearly a year to sell the town house and the couple and their daughter had to live with relatives for four months until their new home was ready, Mr. Liberta said.
"The move was driven by a new company I was working for and it took a while to actually pick up and move," Mr. Liberta said. "It was about a year from the time I changed jobs. We were willing to sit it out and weren't going to give our house away just to get out."
A building boom in Collegeville made older town houses such as the Libertas's difficult to sell, he said. He had to give concessions to his buyer, offer some appliances and agree to an earlier closing date than he preferred. The Libertas moved into their new home on April 15 after selling the old house for $115,000. The new four-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom house cost $200,000.
What led him to buy was the location and affordability of the new house, Mr. Liberta said, but the incentives clinched the deal. "If it had been a free fireplace or something like that, another element with cash value attached to it, it would have had less impact on us," he said. "If the incentive was worth $6,000 on a mortgage over 30 years, that doesn't mean a whole lot."
Other area developers have selectively offered incentives such as contingency sales (the lot is held for construction, which begins after the old house is sold) and "free" amenities like fireplaces or cathedral ceilings, which might otherwise increase the home's price. Other incentives include special mortgage rates or reduced premium charges on choice lots.
Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research at the National Association of Home Builders, said incentive programs reached their peak during soft housing markets like the recession of the early 1990's. The May survey by the trade group found few builders offering financial benefits, but those doing so were large-volume builders in Northeast and Western states, he added.
"This seems to be a program of large-volume builders," Mr. Ahluwalia said. "Only 2 percent of the small-volume builders were doing this. But 20 percent of large-volume builders were buying mortgage rates, and some were buying some of the points. It's the large-volume builder who has the greatest number of homes to sell, to generate cash flow and build their profit."
Such incentives are an open secret, available to buyers who ask but rarely offered in advertisements, said Adriane Jones, market manager at Legg Mason Realty Group. Large builders offer benefits to spur business while others simply wait out the slow periods.
"It's become a sensitive topic," she said. "More and more people are using them, but they don't want to discuss them. Most builders seem to be willing to work with buyers so they'll do everything they can to satisfy the buyer. A lot of builders wait and see what buyers are interested in. If the buyer isn't interested in a fireplace, then offering one won't make a difference."
HOME buyers who capitalize on incentive programs might not otherwise move into new homes. For John Kent and Juliann Rostelli-Kent, a $7,000 bonus from Orleans cut their mortgage to $175,000 and enabled a contingency sale. Both Mr. Kent and his wife had to sell properties before purchasing their new four-bedroom house. The wait was nerve-racking, they said, and both also spent time living with parents until the new house was finished.
"The important thing is I got out," Mr. Kent said. "If we hadn't sold, we would have had to give up that lot. But we looked at a lot of places and we decided that was the one we wanted."

3 More Months to Answer A 20-Year-Old Riddle

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The State Supreme Court cut the Legislature some slack last week when the justices granted lawmakers a three-month extension to come up with a new school-financing plan.
It had become increasingly clear in recent weeks that the Legislature would never meet this month's court-imposed deadline. Neither the Assembly nor the Senate, both controlled by Republicans, is expected back into session until October. And legislative leaders are not even close to reaching agreement with the Whitman administration on a proposal that would end the two-decade court battle over school-aid formulas without jeopardizing their political careers. 
 Over the summer, it became evident to many Republican lawmakers, who represent the more affluent suburban communities, that some of their constituents were unhappy with Governor Whitman's proposal. A growing number of suburban parents notified their lawmakers that they did not support any plan that threatened the level of spending in their school districts. They sent thousands of letters to the Governor's office saying the plan could jeopardize the high quality of public education they have come to expect.
Under the Whitman plan, new statewide curriculum standards would be imposed and school boards would be required by the state to cover only the cost of implementing those standards -- a one-size-fits-all program at the same price. Thus, school spending is equalized in rich and poor districts. But more than half of the state's school districts, particularly wealthy suburban districts in the northern part of the state, spend much more than what the Whitman administration says is necessary and offer more programs, like advanced-placement courses, that many parents do not want to give up.
The plan would allow cities and towns to approve any increases above what the Governor has deemed "constitutionally required." But many parents and educators worry that overburdened property-tax payers might be persuaded to reject any spending that is described as unnecessary to meet what Mrs. Whitman describes as "world class" curriculum standards.
And now suburban parents have formed an alliance with parents and advocates from urban parents who never supported the Governor's proposal because it does not provide enough money to close the existing spending gap between the richest and poorest districts.
"When this whole thing started, they were just trying to pit the urban against the suburban school districts," said Molly R. Emiliani, a parent with five children in Livingston's public schools who has become the parent coordinator for the Garden State Coalition, a group that represents suburban districts.
"That is not the case at all," Ms Emiliani said. "The urban and suburban districts have joined hands and said that this does not help any of the districts. We are not going to stop until we close the gap and it is equal for all the kids."
Until the suburban parents began showing their political might, Democrats, who represent mostly urban districts and who wield little power in the Legislature, stood no chance of seeing their Republican colleagues make any major changes to the Governor's plan. But now, this issue has become a tricky problem for Republicans.
In the Assembly, Republican leaders are pushing for a provision that would maintain current spending levels in the wealthy districts. The Senate version would allow districts to put just a portion of their budgets above what is "constitutionally required" up for a local vote. Some districts fear that they could lose as much as 20 percent of their budget in one year if voters reject spending above what is needed to meet the new statewide standards.
But last week the Governor raised concerns about whether the court would accept language protecting the spending levels of the wealthier districts. Those concerns are well founded: by letting the affluent districts to continue to offer more than what the children in the poorer districts can get, the amendment would destroy the entire premise of the Whitman plan.
The late Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz had set the September deadline and had reserved the right to impose a court-ordered financing plan if the Legislature failed to act this month. He had also wanted to resolve the issue before his retirement, which had been scheduled for next February. He died of cancer in July.
In granting the Legislature a reprieve from the September deadline, the Supreme Court last week concluded that lawmakers and the administration were making progress. The court said it lifted the deadline because "the Legislature is actively considering legislation to address its obligations."
Yet anyone familiar with the inner workings of the Legislature knows that this is one body in need of a strict deadline -- and heavy sanctions, if it's not met.
Take charity care, for example. The source of state financing to help hospitals cover the cost of providing treatment to the uninsured expired last December. As the Legislature dickered over finding a new solution, hospitals delayed payments to vendors, and in some cases laid off staff. Six months later, lawmakers agreed on a new financing plan that turned out to look very much like the old one, depending heavily on the state's unemployment compensation trust fund to foot the bill.
But all during that time, the Legislature was "actively considering legislation to address its obligations."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY & CO.;
Debating The Merits Of Wetlands And Stores

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD

 BODY:
The proposed Meadowlands Mills mall in Carlstadt promises to be BIG. It would cover 2.4 million square feet, making it the largest shopping center in New Jersey. There would be 2.2 million square feet of office space, 50,000 square feet of restaurants, 1,000 hotel rooms, 150,000 square feet of light industrial space. Not to mention 9,000 new jobs, 17,000 parking spaces and a new exit ramp off the New Jersey Turnpike just so people can get to the mall site, which, at 594 acres, would be almost three quarters of the size of Central Park.
But big suggests big trouble to some people concerned about the implications of the project proposed by the Mills Corporation of Arlington, Va., and Empire Ltd. of Wood-Ridge. They are dismayed that the project would require 206 acres of wetlands to be filled with dredged material. They are wary of more traffic. And they wonder whether northern New Jersey really needs so many new places to shop. 
 For now, the $1 billion project is only in the preliminary stages; the Army Corps of Engineers is considering whether to issue a permit allowing the wetlands to be filled.
But what is sure to be a passionate, protracted debate has already started. Just listen to the comments made Wednesday, when more than 300 people attended hearings at Henry P. Becton Regional High School here, sponsored by the Army Corps of Engineers:
Bill Sheehan, the river tender for the Hackensack Estuary and River Tender Corporation, likened the project to "domestic violence" on the environment. To which the next speaker, Craig S. Wask, representing Local 825 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, retorted, "We're more important than any fish, any bird, any plant in the Meadowlands."
When Meadowlands Mills was originally proposed several years ago, the project included 5,700 residential units. Carlstadt officials, objecting to the prospect of tripling the town's population of 5,500, filed suit against the Mills Corporation and the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, the state agency that acts as a supergovernment for the parts of 14 towns that make up the Meadowlands district. A settlement was reached in April, dropping the housing.
The revised plan features a two-level structure with 18 to 20 anchor stores, 200 specialty stores and a 30-screen movie complex.
If the Army Corps of Engineers approves, ground could be broken next summer, and the mall could be open in the spring of 1999.
To the Mills Corporation, which specializes in megamalls offering brand-name merchandise at discount prices at stores like TJ Maxx, Bed Bath and Beyond, and Nordstrom Rack, the Meadowlands site makes sense because of the demographics: 15.5 million people with an annual household income of $62,000 living within 40 miles.
"We are more than just a shopping experience; we are a destination," said Edward B. Vinson, Mills's development director, adding that the average shopper at Mills projects spends four hours per visit -- more than three times longer than a customer at a regional mall.
Mr. Vinson also said the mall would produce sizable economic benefits. Construction work alone would generate 2,500 jobs, which speakers at Wednesday's hearing said were desperately needed.
The state could get $15 million annually in sales tax receipts. In Carlstadt, property taxes could be reduced by up to 40 percent, said Mayor William Roseman. And other municipalities in the Hackensack Meadowlands district would split up to 10 percent of the estimated $3 million that the Mills project would pay in property taxes, he said.
Some residents remain unconvinced by these fiscal calculations. "How can people be so naive to think there will be tax relief?" Elizabeth Moser of Hasbrouck Heights said at the hearing. "They will need larger police departments and larger fire departments, and on top of it, the courts will be clogged with more and more cases, which are expensive."
Some businesses wonder how badly the project would hurt already struggling downtowns and other area malls. The nearby Garden State Plaza just expanded to 2 million square feet, and a 3.99 million-square-foot project, which would be the country's second biggest mall, has been proposed in West Nyack, N.Y., 45 minutes away.
For local residents, the biggest concern may well be traffic. Janine Bauer, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, estimated that the mall would generate at least 100,000 more car trips in the area daily.
To alleviate that crush, the Mills Corporation has proposed building a new road parallel to the New Jersey Turnpike, a new exit ramp off the turnpike and a mass transit center for possible links to light rail.
This has not satisfied everybody.
"If you think people are going to spend money on the New Jersey Turnpike to get into this thing, you're out of your mind," said Erwin Fedhenheuer, chairman of Carlstadt's planning board. "They're going to take the cheapest way; that's what I would do."
Environmentalists are alarmed that the project could be approved without a Federal environmental impact study because of the special nature of the government of the Meadowlands district, even though the wetlands have already dwindled from 20,000 acres to about 6,000.
"This is the single largest destruction of wetlands since 1972, and it's being proposed in the most densely populated county in the most densely populated state in the nation," said an exasperated William J. Cahill, an attorney with the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic. "Where do you break the back of the system? Which acre is it going to be?"

Young Man's Obsession: The American Chestnut

BYLINE: By Anne Raver 

 BODY:
Timothy Van Vliet is one of those intense 17-year-olds who's madly in love. But it's the American chestnut that captured his heart.
"I read about it in 'The Complete Trees of America' when I was 12," said Tim, now a senior at Somerville (N.J.) High School. "I'm kind of a naturalist anyway, and I kept wondering what the whole Northeast looked like before people came here. When millions of passenger pigeons nested in the branches." 
 If anything is an archetype for the lost wilderness, it's the American chestnut. It used to soar 80 to 125 feet into the sky, its deeply furrowed trunk 8 to 10 feet across, earning it the name Eastern Redwood.
In the late 1800's, according to the American Chestnut Foundation, a squirrel could have traveled from Maine to Georgia without ever leaving the branches of a chestnut tree.
This vision of the virgin forest has captured the imagination of a young man who has grown up in a little white ranch house, set on a typical green lawn, with an above-ground pool and a toolshed out back that looks like a red toy barn.
"One in every four trees in the Appalachian forest was a chestnut," said Tim, standing near one of the 10 American chestnut trees he planted from nuts three years ago in his backyard in Branchburg, N.J. (His pride and joy is 10 feet tall; the others are scraggly 4-footers.)
"At one time, squirrels ate more chestnuts than acorns," he said. "That's why chestnuts have those burs -- as a squirrel prevention," developed in centuries of evolution.
Passenger pigeons loved them too. So did wild turkeys, and people, who made chestnut flour and fattened their hogs in the forest on the fallen nuts. They used the wood for sturdy fencing, houses and furniture.
"It's known for its soft, straight grain," he said. "It was as strong as oak, but it wouldn't dull the saw." Abraham Lincoln's log cabin was made of chestnut and oak. The tannin from its bark was used to tan leather.
Then, in 1904, an orange fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, was found on the American chestnut trees that graced the avenues of the Bronx Zoo. The fungus, which was girdling the trees and cutting off nutrients and water, had apparently been brought in on chestnut trees imported from Asia. Within 50 years, the blight had traveled up to Maine and down to Georgia and across the country to the western edge of Michigan, killing several billion mature trees -- and the economy that went with them.
By 1913, plant explorers found the fungus in China and Japan -- on Asian chestnuts resistant to the disease. Thus began a breeding program, crossing the Asian species with the American, to develop a blight-resistant tree. By the 1930's, trees were planted at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, and research has been continuing there and in other places ever since.
In 1983, a group of prominent scientists, including Dr. Norman Borlaug, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for crop breeding, and Dr. Peter Raven, the director of the Missouri Botanic Garden, started the American Chestnut Foundation. It now has 2,200 members, and 7,000 chestnut trees growing on its two research farms in Meadowview, Va.
"We're trying to introduce the blight resistance of the Chinese chestnut into the American, but otherwise retain the traits of the American tree," said Dr. Fred Hebard, the superintendent of the research farms. The Asian species is more of an orchard-type tree, rather than the regal American that once marched up and down the Appalachians.
"We expect to be releasing seed by 2005 or 2007," Dr. Hebard said.
The foundation wants to put the American chestnut trees back in the hardwood forest. It sells seed kits to members like Tim, who want to grow the trees in their backyards. When they're old enough, these trees can eventually be pollinated with pollen from the blight-resistant trees being developed in Virginia.
It costs $40 to join the American Chestnut Foundation (P.O. Box 4044, Bennington, Vt. 05201; 802-447-0110). A seed kit is $50.
"And we already have a fair number of people in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio and Vermont who have taken some of our pollen and pollinated existing American chestnut trees to increase biodiversity and avoid inbreeding," Dr. Hebard said.
As well as growing chestnut trees, Tim scouts the countryside every chance he gets for chestnut trees that might, by some chance, have developed resistance in the wild. But almost every time he finds an old chestnut tree stump -- with sprouts valiantly trying to turn into new trees -- he returns to find a house lot springing up in its place.
"It's not so much the development that gets me; it's the concept of extinction," Tim said. "It's irreversible. For the passenger pigeon, that's it. But maybe the American chestnut can be brought back."
Tim has charted the progress of his trees -- from the height of their trunks to the size and color of their leaves -- in yearly letters to the foundation, which are peppered with his observations of the decline of the natural world around him.
"If gray wolves were reintroduced, perhaps I would not have to keep cages around the trees to keep them safe from squirrels, rabbits and groundhogs," he wrote in July 1994.
Three years ago, Tim went looking for an American chestnut listed by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Conservation on its 1991 registry of largest trees. It was supposed to be on the corner of Five Points Road and Asbury Avenue in Freehold. There was a housing development there instead.
"I investigated the fragmented remnants of forest on land marked Lot 16, adjacent to the piles of bulldozed soil, new roads, holes in the ground for foundations, and recently planted hedgerows of our state tree, the telephone pole," he wrote. In a couple of small groves untouched by the bulldozer, he found a few 30-foot chestnut trees with furrowed bark, apparently holding their own.
"They may have evolved to resist the blight," he said. "But when I came back a year later, they were entirely obliterated. Except for one stump with some shoots."
Still, when you're 17, you're an optimist. "Wouldn't it be nice if people took a survey to see if any wild chestnuts were growing in their woods," he said. Even if they aren't blight-resistant, their nuts can be used to increase the genetic pool of this beleaguered tree.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BROOKLYN UP CLOSE;
Future Vision: Planners Head in Different Directions

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
It has been discussed for a decade, undergone several incarnations and been led by three different people. Now, leaders of a committee creating a plan for future development along the waterfront in Williamsburg and Greenpoint say they will release a draft plan later this month. "It will be a blueprint for redevelopment of the Greenpoint-Williamsburg waterfront," said Ronald Webster, who heads the 197-A Waterfront Committee. "When developers come out, they can say this is what the neighborhood wants."
But such a plan would be a remarkable achievement in this sprawling, Balkanized swath of northern Brooklyn where each neighborhood has its own vision. 
 In two and a half years of negotiations under Mr. Webster, the committee -- with representatives from Greenpoint, the artists' colony of Williamsburg's Northside, the largely Hispanic Southside and the Hasidim from below Division Street -- have found consensus on a few things. The committee objects to future waste transfer stations on the water, though it has not yet decided what to do with existing ones. Everyone agrees on opening up the waterfront -- now mostly in private hands -- for public access. And in principle, at least, the committee agrees on rezoning some heavy industrial stretches near the water for housing.
But much is still contested. Greenpoint, for instance, wants to get rid of waste transfer stations and objects to subsidized housing.
Southside leaders insist on affordable housing and worry that waterfront gentrification will drive out Williamsburg's working-class Hispanic and black residents. Southside leaders also want more jobs from Williamsburg's industrial base. "What good is housing if the people in that housing are just warehoused, with no possibility for real growth and development?" charged Luis Garden Acosta, director of El Puente, a Southside community group.
The Hasidim, who favor unsubsidized housing, want to convert former factories like the old Schaefer brewery in the Southside into apartments. "Market-rate housing will only strengthen the neighborhood," contended Rabbi David Niederman, who heads the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg.
And factory owners do not want the industrial areas reduced. "We would like to retain as much as possible the existing industry and even expand it," said Henry Ludmer, director of the Metropolitan Industrial Development Corporation, which represents waterfront businesses.
But Mr. Webster asserted that although specific developments would have to be fought over from block to block, his committee would find the common ground needed to draft a 197-A plan. "When push comes to shove, people will lock arms and do the right thing," he said.
For their part, city planning officials are looking at part of the Southside and weighing whether to convert the heavy industrial zones near the water -- much of the area is now unused -- into mixed-use and commercial zones.
Near the entrance to the Williamsburg Bridge, for instance, a possible area for rezoning, one-fourth of the buildings are vacant; nearly half are used for manufacturing and fewer than 20 percent for housing, according to a department study.
Rabbi Niederman said the Hasidim favored the conversion. Others, like Mr. Garden Acosta, called for a cautious approach to rezoning to insure "that the housing will be affordable for the very families who are doubled up." SOMINI SENGUPTA

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Clinton or Dole? You Might Check Your Portfolio

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
IF history is any guide, small stocks have a better chance of shining if Bill Clinton wins a second term than if Bob Dole unseats him, according to a study by the Liberty Financial Companies, a financial services concern in Boston.
Big stocks, however, are more likely to do better under a Dole Presidency, the study showed. 
 That is consistent with a general belief that big business fares best with a Republican as President. But the study's findings on small stocks run counter to the common notion that policies of Democratic Presidents can hurt business and put a damper on the stock market.
The study analyzed the gains of small stocks during Republican and Democratic administrations beginning in 1929. It used as a proxy the Ibbotson Small Stock Index, comprising the bottom fifth of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange plus stocks of the same size on Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange. Market capitalizations of these stocks range from $86 million to $171 million.
Since the start of the Hoover Administration in 1929, small stocks have risen 22.8 percent a year, on average, during the nine terms of Democratic Presidents and just 1.9 percent during the eight Republican terms. The trend continues even when the Depression years are eliminated. Since 1937, small stocks have risen 17.2 percent a year, on average, under Democratic Presidents, compared with 10.2 percent annually under Republican Presidents.
More recently, small stocks have gained 19.9 percent a year during the Clinton Presidency, through June 30, the study found. That compared with 11.8 percent a year during the most recent Republican Presidency, under George Bush, or 13.3 percent if the results under Ronald Reagan are also included.
By contrast, large stocks have performed better during Republican administrations than during Democratic ones. After the Depression, the S.& P. 500 posted an average annual return of 11.9 percent, through June, under Republican Presidents, compared with 10.2 percent under Democrats in the White House.
"While it is generally accepted that Republican administrations are often good for big business, the Democratic focus on reducing unemployment tends to help small business," said Kenneth R. Leibler, Liberty's president and chief executive.

How the Gold Group Is Keeping Its Luster

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
GOLD mutual funds seem to have a magical touch in 1996. For the year so far, they hold the lead among all equity funds that have at least $30 million in assets, and the precious-metals group has gained 17.4 percent, on average, nearly twice the 9 percent for the equity funds through Thursday, according to Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.
The meteoric rise of gold funds has not escaped the notice of market commentators, who have offered a variety of reasons for the surge. Earlier in the year, nervousness over the United States budget impasse, with the possibility of default, was named as a cause. Another was skittishness about the markets, which led investors to hedge their portfolios against possible declines in stocks and bonds. 
 At midyear, the run-up was attributed to a speculative bubble in gold stocks that could burst any time. The funds did experience a correction in June, losing more than 13 percent for the month, on average, but the bigger, more established gold-mining companies were hit hardest.
Confounding the situation, the price of gold itself has been treading water. After hitting a high of $415 an ounce in February, gold prices fell markedly and have held in the $380's since early June, closing at $385.80 a troy ounce on Thursday. Clearly, the recent returns on gold funds are not linked to the metal's price.
The basic reason, it seems, is much simpler: an imbalance in the supply and demand for gold that is prompting small exploration companies to accelerate operations.
As prices reached the low $300's at the start of the 1990's, it became less profitable to look for new gold sources, said Abhay Deshpande, a Morningstar analyst. But South African mines began drying up, he said, and demand started rising over the last three or four years as markets in China, India and Southeast Asia began growing strongly.
ONCE the stage was set, the trick was finding the companies most likely to succeed.
"It comes down to stock picking," said Daniel B. Leonard, who runs the $381 million Invesco Strategic Gold Portfolio. That fund led the equity fund group through Thursday this year, with a gain of 54.4 percent.
Mr. Leonard says he follows a "growth-gold" philosophy. "We're looking for middle-size and small companies that are looking for new gold mines around the world," he said. "Over the past few years, there's been a reasonable degree of success with that strategy, if you pick the right stocks."
He owns Bre-X Minerals, a Canadian company that recently discovered a large gold mine in Busang, Indonesia. Mr. Leonard said he paid $3.85 a share in January; the stock closed Friday at $18.875.
Another winner was Arequipa Resources, a Canadian gold-mining company on the Toronto Exchange. The company made a major discovery in Peru in June, prompting Barrick Gold to acquire it in early September for $22 a share, an impressive jump from the $1.50 a share Mr. Leonard said he paid last year.
A third company, also Canadian, is Golden Star, with a portfolio of prospective properties in South America and Africa. The stock price took off this spring when the company discovered diamonds as well as gold on its properties in South America. Mr. Leonard said he bought the stock at $5.50 a share in late 1995; it closed on Friday at $17.
Have prices gotten ahead of themselves? "There are some mistakes out there, but there are also a number of stocks with good geologic reserves," said Richard H. Warden, who manages the $115 million IDS Precious Metals fund, up 45.6 percent this year and right behind Invesco. "People are buying because gold is being found," he said, and the major producers need more gold.
Besides Bre-X and Arequipa, several stocks have contributed to Mr. Warden's return: Dayton, now in gold production in Chile, and Stillwater Mining, which found platinum and palladium in Montana.
Mr. Warden concedes that 1996 has been a "very unusual year," given all the major discoveries. But he said he owned a number of other companies "that have a good chance of finding gold." He cited Greenstone Resources and Romarco Minerals, both on the Toronto Exchange.
Douglas D. Donald, who runs the $215 million Scudder Gold fund -- up 40.8 percent since December -- uses a similar "growth-gold" approach. A geologist by training, Mr. Donald tends to avoid mining stocks in South Africa, which he says is too unstable. And he said he looked for low-cost producers, "so they don't need runaway gold prices to succeed."
While rising gold prices play only a small part in these funds' returns, they add some kick. Where do managers see gold prices going? Given today's supply and demand, Mr. Leonard said they should continue to move up slowly. Mr. Warden agreed, forecasting prices in the low $400's.
But Mr. Deshpande, of Morningstar, said the run-up in small exploration companies "seems excessive, so it seems like a correction might be in order, but it shouldn't be more than that." He advised investors to wait for a selloff of 10 percent to 15 percent in the more speculative gold funds before buying.
This year aside, gold funds have been unimpressive. As a group, the funds had annual returns of just 7.4 percent for the 10 years ended in August, versus 11.5 percent for all equity funds, Morningstar said.
Even so, Mr. Leonard sees gold as a good long-term investment. "In 1914, it was said that you could buy a good suit of clothes for an ounce of gold, which then cost $20," he said."Now, with gold almost $400, that's still true. If you had kept paper money, that wouldn't do it."

When It's Time to Do Your Math

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
AS your child struggles with her application for admission to a well-known boarding school, you get to apply for financial aid. What can you expect?
All boarding schools use a complex formula to determine need, developed by the School and Student Service for Financial Aid in Princeton, N.J. The service looks at a family's size, income, assets, expenses, the cost of living in its geographic area and other factors. 
 Be prepared to share all sorts of financial intimacies with the service, including not only the market value of your house and your children's college nest eggs but also what you spent on camp last summer and the number of cars and boats you own. All the schools will want a couple of years' worth of 1040 forms, too, although they won't demand a list of your jewelry and paintings.
"It was intrusive, and a lot of work," said Gwen Haley, whose younger son received financial aid to attend Choate Rosemary Hall. "It meant we got our taxes done a lot earlier than usual."
Among its rules of thumb, the service deems child support and uninsured medical costs as essential expenses that could not be rerouted toward tuition. But the interest on the loan for the backyard pool is seen as nonessential, and could be.
Divorce -- 27 percent of all financial-aid applicants come from divorced families -- further complicates the process. Schools, as well as the service, want to know about the finances of both parents, and remarried parents need to detail the finances of their new spouses as well, said Constance L. White, program director for the service. "We tell the schools to take a look at the information and do a variety of scenarios," she said. Most schools will make case-by-case decisions.
The financial resources of an applicant's grandparents are not counted, since extra-generational subsidizing is not assumed. You may, however, want to look to grandparents for help, said Meade B. Thayer, director of financial aid services at the National Association of Independent Schools, based in Washington. "Grandparents can reduce their estates by passing on $10,000 a year each to grandchildren," he said. The gift is tax-free to the recipients and cuts the tax liability of a grandparent's estate if it exceeds $600,000.
Parents can help their cause, too. Assets are considered as of the day you complete the form, and your income is based on the year in which you apply. So a big bonus might be deferred until the new year.
But beware. "We do ask about next year's income, and if you anticipate the income, you should report it," Ms. White said. "If you don't, the school might be quite angry."
For basic information, Mr. Thayer's association offers two free booklets on financial aid to parents who write to it at 1620 L Street N.W., Washington 20036-5605.
After all the math, the Princeton service -- known as the S.S.S. -- ends up with an amount called discretionary income. That is the figure it uses in recommending how much your family can pay.
Many schools revise the service's recommendation, and not always in your favor. For example, depreciation losses on second homes and hobby businesses are not recognized. (Bad!) But at Deerfield, accommodations are made for home-equity inflation based on real-estate vicissitudes. (Good!)
Being turned down for aid, or receiving less than you had hoped, shouldn't be cause to turn sadly back toward the local high school. Start a dialogue.
"Rarely do those families call us and say another $1,000 would make a big difference," said Jay Doolittle, director of admissions and financial aid at St. George's School in Newport, R.I. "If we don't interpret the data correctly, I want to know about it." Appeals make particular sense if your circumstances have changed -- if you are now supporting an elderly parent, for example.
But do not expect the aid to flow freely. "We recognize that it's not a piece of cake to pay tuitions," Mr. Thayer said. "At the same time, we don't want families to think they shouldn't also be planning for this."
Indeed, when school officials sit down to discuss their aid decisions, they are not shy about suggesting where you could be more cost-wise.
"We might figure they could unload one of their cars, or do with a lesser car," Mr. Doolittle said. "We don't order families around. But we do say, here's the rationale for our decision -- that extra Subaru was not really necessary."

Choate on the Cheap: Prep Schools Woo the Middle Class

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
GWEN HALEY teaches at a public high school in Stratford, Conn. Her husband, Ted, is a drug rehabilitation counselor. Together they make a decent income, but not enough to simply say yes when their younger son, Ben, announced he wanted to go to Choate Rosemary Hall, a boarding school with a blue-chip reputation and a price tag of more than $22,000 a year.
So they applied for financial aid, and received an award that covered half of Ben's costs for his freshman year. The following years, his aid was increased to meet three-fourths of the cost because by then Ben's older brother had entered a private college. 
 "I would say to anybody who wants to go to a school like that, just go for it," said Mrs. Haley, whose son graduated last year and now attends Amherst College.
During the last few years, sending your child to boarding school -- that fabled realm of quaint buildings around a picturesque green; steam tables loaded with mysterious, clotted entrees, and well-weathered teachers wielding big academic sticks -- has become surprisingly attainable for people like the Haleys. Dismayed by the paucity of middle-income students on their campuses, the nation's boarding schools are widening the array of financial-aid options for people who know they are not rich enough to pay outright and have long presumed they were too rich to receive help.
The eligibility rules vary from school to school, but many families with substantial salaries are receiving help. At Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, N.H., for example, middle income now refers to people earning between $60,000 and $120,000 a year. This year, 70 of the 331 financial-aid awards went to students whose families fell into that category. The Emma Willard School in Troy, N.Y., gave aid to 46.7 percent of its 270 students. Nearly all the families who received that aid reported incomes of more than $75,000.
At Concord Academy, a coeducational school in Concord, Mass., 23 students whose parents earned $60,000 or more received awards that averaged $12,000 apiece. At St. George's School in Newport, R.I., someone whose parents earned $145,000 still got a break on the cost this year.
"There's no income cutoff because there are so many variables," said Jay Doolittle, director of admissions and financial aid at St. George's. "If you make $100,000 and you have three or four children at tuition-paying schools, you could easily qualify for aid."
High fees, now as high as those at many colleges, and attributed to unavoidables like salaries, heating bills, technology and deferred maintenance, are one reason that boarding schools are offering a more generous helping hand. The median annual cost, including tuition, room and board, has risen from $10,195 in the 1985-86 school year to $19,850 in the 1995-96 year, according to the National Association of Independent Schools in Washington. That is a 94.7 percent increase in dollars, and a 37.1 percent increase after inflation is taken into account.
Particularly in the 1990's, these numbers can unnerve a group that admissions directors call "the emotional middle class."
These people earn far more than the Government's definition of middle income. Children in families earning $35,000 a year would receive automatic free rides at a typical boarding school. But while many middle-class families could and did send their children to boarding school through the 1970's, these days many more of them balk. They worry about an insecure job market, another four years of tuition at college and the specter of a penny-pinching retirement as traditional pensions vanish.
Boarding schools are worried, too -- about losing their socioeconomic diversity. In some institutions, enrollments have started to resemble barbells, with the wealthy clustered at one end and the woefully deprived at the other. Over the last decade, the same concern has propelled many colleges to award merit scholarships to even out their enrollments.
At Choate Rosemary Hall, "we definitely want to avoid having just the haves and the have-nots," said Charlotte Murphy, the school's communications director. "It's an issue that all the schools are hearing and are concerned about."
At Exeter, trustees were hearing complaints at alumni cocktail parties that tuition had spiraled beyond many people's means. A comparison of middle-class enrollment in the 1950's and in the 1990's found a definite discrepancy, said Rick Mahoney, the director of financial aid at the school. "We still had a spread, but we felt the middle-income group was less well represented here than they were 40 years ago."
Thomas Hassan, Exeter's admissions director, said: "It's part of our charter that this place shall ever be open to youth from every quarter. We want to get all kinds of kids. It's just healthier."
THE schools, eager for the best students, know they face tough competition. "Our biggest competitors are the public high schools, for which the price tag is zero," said Trudy Hanmer, Emma Willard's director of admissions and associate head of school. Moreover, "it is not an expectation that middle-income families are going to pay for high school," she said, and when they do they "typically pay for education out of discretionary income, not out of trust funds."
For all these reasons, boarding schools have set aside more money in the last few years for the middle class. In 1994, for instance, Exeter began offering more aid to families with incomes of $60,000 to $120,000, Mr. Hassan said.
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., with a $6.7 million aid budget, recently increased its middle-class support too. In the 1992-93 school year, 52 families with incomes greater than $80,000 received aid from the school; this fall, 140 such families will.
The schools, which generate their financial-aid money from endowment earnings or annual campaigns, can often be generous with both the size and number of awards. After all, they are making them for just three or four years, not 14 as with schools that run from prekindergarten through grade 12. Choate, for example, gave an average award of $14,000 to middle-class students this year, while at St. George's the average was $11,900. (But never say "scholarship" in talking about the new largess. The somewhat cumbersome "need-based financial aid" is preferred.)
One beneficiary is Amanda Cohen, an Exeter senior from Sacramento, Calif. The school covers about three-quarters of the $20,000 tuition. "Let's put it this way," said her father, Ned, a deputy counsel for the California Legislature. "I don't make enough to send Amanda to Exeter. But we made the decision that we would afford it, and that she would go."
His daughter, he added, has flourished. "They work them to death," he said, approvingly. "I think she's gone through four years of sleep deprivation."
Besides outright grants like Amanda's, monthly payment plans are offered by most schools to help those without ready chunks of cash. For a $70 annual fee, Concord Academy will deduct a monthly payment directly from parents' checking accounts, said Rachel Countryman, the school's director of financial aid.
Schools can also steer families to low-interest loans. Knight College Resource Group, which administers many monthly payment plans, offers through many schools a low-interest, variable-rate loan pegged to the 13-week Treasury-bill rate.
For many families, aid ends up being a combination of grants, loans and payment plans. "In general, we will meet about 80 percent of a family's need," said James F. Ventre, financial aid director of Phillips Academy. "And then we will help them come up with the other 20 percent."
Nevertheless, many middle-class parents are too embarrassed to acknowledge that they cannot afford boarding school. Many also believe that to check the box next to the question "Are you applying for financial aid?" is to deal a death blow to their child's chances for admission.
Charles Pittman, an advertising manager from Charlotte, N.C., battled those anxieties when he applied for aid to send his son, Tony, to Andover in 1989. "I thought at this stage of my life I should have been better prepared," he said. "But I don't think you can prepare for this unless you make tons of money."
Since then, he has sent his two daughters there, too. His youngest, Mauresa, is a senior who manages the football team. She said that once she enrolled, she felt no different from anyone else on campus. "Nobody asked, and nobody brought it up," she said.
PARENTS might be surprised at how many boarding-school students receive aid. At Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Mass., for instance, only about two-thirds of the families pay full tuition and "most of them were born into it," said Bill Cumming, the admissions director. The remainder receive financial aid or use monthly payment plans.
Parents need to squelch their reluctance and check the box when they apply, Mr. Cumming said. After all, what is more painful: a little honesty now or a huge humiliation later?
"I don't want to get blindsided in the middle of someone's junior year by a phone call from the father, saying 'I've tapped everything I have, I can't come up with the money, and he won't be coming back,' " Mr. Cumming said. "It's not the best thing for the child."
Some schools have revised the aid process to help eliminate embarrassment and worry. At Concord, all parents receive information about financing options along with the application packet.
Concord also handles all aid requests on a sheet of paper apart from the rest of the application. "We've started not to have a box per se," Ms. Countryman said. "We were concerned about keeping the two processes separate." At many schools, just who is getting help is a closely held secret as well. Gone are the days when scholarship students had to help out in the dining hall.
Despite all this concern and generosity, however, there is no guarantee that asking means you will receive. Only a handful of schools -- Deerfield is one -- call their admissions need-blind, and even they acknowledge that their resources are not so bottomless that they never turn down someone who needs help with tuition.
"There are a lot of families who may well qualify for financial aid but won't get it because the school doesn't have a big enough financial-aid budget," said Meade B. Thayer, director of financial aid services for the National Association of Independent Schools. The approach may differ: a Concord applicant may be accepted and not receive aid, while Deerfield tries not to accept someone who needs aid unless the money is available. But the point is that there is not enough cash to go around.
Parents should not conceal assets, however, because while the schools may be more supportive, they are often vigilant in checking the truth of applications.
"Some people think it's a hiding game, but these days it's real easy for us to find out about other information," said Mr. Ventre, of Phillips Academy. "They do have to provide tax returns, and we have C.P.A.'s here who are trained to look things over."
While aid is clearly welcome, it hardly means easy street for the middle class.
"We haven't been on a real vacation in a long time," Mrs. Haley said, "and we drive old cars."
Mr. Pittman said, "It's the sacrifice we've opted to make, to give our children the best education possible." With financial aid, he added, the boarding-school experience becomes manageable.
"It stretches you," he said, "but at the same time, it doesn't bankrupt you."

HEADLINE: An Asian Billionaire Tries to Fly by the New Rules

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
EARLIER this summer, the largest tax evasion case on the planet landed in the lap of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Lucio Tan, one of the country's richest men, stood accused of evading more than $1 billion in taxes.
The Government, many economists and a large segment of the business community argued that losing the case against Mr. Tan would risk the very integrity of the Philippine state. But a sharply divided Supreme Court faulted the Government for failing to give Mr. Tan adequate notice in pursuit of its case, and dismissed the case. 
 Score another one for Mr. Tan, a 62-year-old Chinese immigrant who has become a billionaire legendary for his brazen business ways and his seeming invincibility. Using street-smart strategies, Mr. Tan has built an empire that spans banking and brewing, tobacco and trading as well as real estate development. But he also benefited from political cronyism reaching back to Ferdinand Marcos and Government-granted monopolies. For years Mr. Tan has refused to disclose financial data on his companies to the Government. In the beer and cigarette business, he was given open-ended tax breaks that allow him a big competitive advantage. And with the Philippine Congress debating a major tax overhaul, he is peddling a plan to give his breweries an even greater edge over his leading competitor.
In the process, he has faced accusations of not only tax evasion but also corruption, receiving political favors, and ruthlessness. Mr. Tan and his lieutenants steadfastly maintain that no legal case has ever been proved against them.
But now, as the Philippines follows other Asian nations in trying to open its economy and become another Asian tiger, the rules are changing. And Mr. Tan intends to prove he can win at this game, too. To do so, he is taking on a challenge that even his own advisers consider folly: to fix Philippine Airlines, the money-losing national carrier known as P.A.L. or, among its critics, "Planes Always Late."
This time, there is no Ferdinand Marcos to help him with tax favors; indeed, Mr. Tan is out of favor with the current President. And this time he has no ready-made monopoly; the airline faces competition from a spate of domestic start-ups and sleek, efficient Asian carriers.
Just as the economy here is in transition, Mr. Tan himself is trying to transform his image from Marcos crony with sweetheart deals to respected businessman who put the airline on course for sustained profits and ended its years on the public dole.
Mr. Tan declined to be interviewed for this article. But from his rare public comments, it seems that his obsession with Philippine Airlines stems from a determination to achieve what many think impossible as well as from a chance to demonstrate a public commitment to his adopted country. As Teresita Ang See, who runs a research center on the Chinese in the Philippines, points out, there is still tension between ethnic Filipinos and ethnic Chinese, fueled in part by the sense among many ethnic Filipinos that the Chinese have prospered at their expense and hold a disproportionate sway over the Filipino economy.
Because of this, some people here believe that Mr. Tan's takeover of the national airline is a way of asserting his Philippine identity. For Mr. Tan, who speaks poor English and Tagalog when he cannot converse in his native Fujian dialect, this is not unimportant.
Last March, at the airline's 55th anniversary dinner, Mr. Tan confessed that the airline takeover was really an "emotional" decision. "This is 100 percent emotion," he told employees. "This is my contribution."
Emotion alone will not salvage the floundering airline. For years, Philippine Airlines has piled on losses and staff. Since 1983, the carrier has lost at least $408 million. According to Airline Business magazine, the carrier had a net loss last year of $66.1 million on revenue of about $1.1 billion.
The airline, which ranked 56th worldwide in revenue last year, between Aeroflot and Aerolineas Argentinas, has wallowed around Asia with aging planes, bad service and approved but unused routes. For years it had been run by political cronies who looted its assets and neglected its modernization. It was a basket case in the fiercely competitive Asian market, which is bustling with crisp, efficient and profitable carriers like Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways.
It is no accident that Cathay Pacific's flights to Manila are solidly booked in all classes while seats always seem to be available on Philippine Airline flights.
Yet, the allure of controlling a national airline, even one as bedeviled as this one, proved irresistible.
"Mr. Tan started investing in the airline in 1992, when the airline was privatized by Mrs. Aquino's administration," Jaime J. Bautista, a long-time executive with Mr. Tan's companies and now the chief financial officer of Philippine Airlines, said of Corazon C. Aquino, who had succeeded Mr. Marcos as President. "Being a taipan in the Philippines, it is a challenge to him to take over a very challenging business."
In 1992, a group of Philippine investors agreed to commit about 10 billion pesos, roughly $400 million, into a consortium called PR Holdings to buy two-thirds of the airline. When one of the leading investors failed to come up with his half of the capital, he secretly turned to Mr. Tan for help. "He agreed to invest about 5 billion pesos as a silent investor," Mr. Bautista recalled of Mr. Tan. "There was an agreement that he would not come into the open, but he wanted to be consulted."
Mr. Tan scrupulously hid his participation in the takeover because of an aggressive series of moves by the Government of President Aquino against Mr. Tan and his companies. Mr. Tan, whose close ties to Mr. Marcos included preferential tax status, had faced a series of investigations into accusations of corruption and tax evasion. At one point, the Government failed in a legal attempt to seize his companies.
Even as a business matter, Mr. Tan's lust for the national carrier seemed risky to his senior aides.
"I was involved in the cigarette and beer business," Mr. Bautista said, referring to the Fortune Tobacco Company and Asia Brewery Inc., two of Mr. Tan's flagships. "There was a consensus among the senior executives that it was very difficult investing in an airline. We don't know the business. We knew the airline was beset by problems. We knew P.A.L.'s people were known to be involved in graft and corruption. But he wanted to make it his personal challenge."
Mr. Tan's involvement in the airline, and his momentum toward complete control, came to light only after a series of management wars at the airline. Philippine President Fidel V. Ramos was so enraged at Mr. Tan's subterfuge that he authorized the licensing of a second national airline, Grand International Airways, to compete against Philippine Airlines.
For Mr. Ramos, Mr. Tan's attack on the airline presented a quandary. On the one hand, the Government was desperate to privatize a failing state enterprise. On the other, Mr. Tan was anathema to post-Marcos Governments. In the end, Mr. Ramos decided, on the advice of many of his advisers, to let the takeover go through. Last week, the airline's shareholders approved it.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Tan can turn the airline around. His executives profess that the carrier may show a profit this year, although it will be so slim that it will fit into a billfold. Like Mr. Tan, his competitors here, including John Gokongwei, another leading Filipino-Chinese businessman, who runs Grand Airways, declined to be interviewed.
LUCIO TAN was born in the Chinese coastal province of Fujian and little is publicly known about his rise to fortune. When he was still a young boy, his parents fled the chaos of China and moved him and his six brothers and sisters to sleepy Cebu in the middle of the Philippines archipelago. Arriving with virtually nothing, he struggled like many other immigrants to the Philippines; for a time he worked as a janitor, later as a dock worker. Various stories surround his emergence into the ranks of powerful businessmen here and into one of the world's richest men. According to Forbes magazine, his holdings are roughly valued at $2.2 billion but no one outside the Tan clan seems to know for sure. What is known is that his ties to President Marcos did much to fuel his success.
Within the tight Chinese social and business network, opportunities for credit abounded and business practices were less hindered by tradition and convention than for the landed aristocracy and Spanish business houses of the country. More, the Chinese showed extraordinary flexibility in dealing with a series of political regimes. And none were as adept in their footwork as Mr. Tan.
Indeed, the success of Chinese family empires throughout southeast Asia can be attributed in no small part to an indifference toward the nature of the political regime of the moment. And in many cases, exemplified here by Mr. Tan and in Indonesia by several dominant Chinese tycoons, substantial support in the early days of regimes has been rewarded with lavish contracts, licenses and monopolies.
MR. TAN'S first major venture was in the cigarette business and the founding of Fortune Tobacco in 1966. With tax breaks and near-monopoly licenses, he quickly captured the dominant share of the Philippine cigarette market with his Champion brand smokes. "It was," a Manila banker put it, "a license to print money." Today, Fortune commands 67 percent of the cigarette market.
In 1977, as the Philippines labored under the rigors of martial law, Mr. Tan and a group of Filipino-Chinese businessmen banded together and acquired a small, floundering bank, General Banking and Trust. Mr. Tan changed the bank's name to the Allied Banking Corporation.
Today, from its headquarters on Makati Avenue in Manila's thriving business district, Allied is the country's eighth-largest bank, according to Moody's. On the bank's worn second-floor executive headquarters, the language that drifts from offices and down the central hallway is Mr. Tan's native Fujian dialect.
Three years after Mr. Tan's foray into banking, President Marcos gave him a license to open Asia Brewery Inc. to compete against the San Miguel Corporation, the old Spanish brewer that had a monopoly in the Philippines and was the country's only real multinational. Wiseacres at the time suggested that the new beer would be called Lucifer, a contraction of the first names of Lucio Tan and Ferdinand Marcos. Mr. Tan reciprocated Mr. Marcos's favors with substantial contributions to the President's election campaigns; Mr. Tan's critics denounced the donations as bribes.
Despite the favoritism shown by Mr. Marcos, Mr. Tan also displayed a ferocious desire for his companies to succeed on their own merits. A former Government adviser on privatization and a management expert here contend Mr. Tan has thrived in the sharply shifting political winds by being a smart entrepreneur.
"He's very good at taking care of his people," said the former adviser, who maintained that he could be more candid by speaking anonymously. "He believes in single proprietorship; he has no listed companies. He believes in getting the most modern equipment."
Still, this former adviser said: "Lucio Tan is very secretive. Many Filipino Chinese wield a lot of influence here, but Lucio Tan maybe wields the most. He has the most political connections of everyone. He's funded almost every Congressman."
It is in Congress where Mr. Tan has waged one of his biggest battles. Under stiff demands from the International Monetary Fund, which is a major lender to the Philippines, the Philippine Government is attempting to rewrite its tax laws. A major element of the revision entails changing the formula used for calculating the excise tax on cigarettes and beer, revisions that would sharply increase the taxes paid by Mr. Tan's companies.
Because Mr. Tan releases no financial data on any of his companies -- despite requirements by the country's Securities and Exchange Commission that all companies, public or private, do so -- it is impossible to determine the profitability of his cigarette and beer operations. As for revenues, discussions with financial analysts and competitors suggest that Fortune Tobacco's were about $670 million last year, and that Asia Brewery's were in the neighborhood of $215 million, about 20 percent of the beer market.
The Philippine Department of Finance contends that not only do Mr. Tan's companies underpay taxes, but also that he employs a variety of schemes to evade accurate assessments of his existing tax liability. Based on its findings, the department devised a simplified excise tax code that would make such cheating difficult or impossible and would eliminate the favorable, open-ended low tax brackets Mr. Tan had obtained for his products. The department submitted the proposal in legislative form to Congress as part of the overall tax overhaul package.
"There was very strong opposition from him, and it was translated into opposition from members of Congress," said Milwida M. Guevara, the Undersecretary of Finance. "We say everybody should pay the same amount on each bottle, on each pack of cigarettes. We say companies should compete on quality and brand name, not on special tax preferences."
After a blizzard of lobbying by Mr. Tan's companies, an alternative tax proposal was put forward by some members of Congress. "They have come up with a compromise that is worse than this current system," Ms. Guevara said.
Mr. Tan's only competitor in the beer market, San Miguel, reacted with fury to the new bill. "It seemed specifically designed to put us at a marketing disadvantage," said a senior executive at San Miguel, who preferred that his name not be used. "He wants to carve out a larger market share through this tax bill."
AT the same time, Mr. Tan has remained embroiled in a tax evasion case of cosmic dimensions. For years, the Government has pushed a case through the court system charging Mr. Tan with evading 25.6 billion pesos in taxes, about $1 billion. In June, in a 3-to-2 decision, the Supreme Court dismissed the case against Mr. Tan, a move that was greeted with a public uproar and accusations of payoffs to the justices. So deafening was the criticism of the court that it felt compelled to take the bizarre step of issuing a letter denying that it had been bribed.
But President Ramos left no doubt where he stood on the court's decision. "The decision of the Supreme Court First Division is certainly a setback," Mr. Ramos declared. "It has a grave implication on the Government's effort to proceed against those who violate our tax laws."
The dean of newspaper columnists in Manila, Amanda Doronila, who writes for The Philippine Daily Inquirer, put the matter bluntly. "The Court just delivered another blow to further weaken the state on the capacity to raise revenue," he wrote.
"No business entrepreneur in the history of this country has been more successful in gaining his objectives in the strategic economic, political and judicial arenas in so short a time than Lucio Tan," he wrote. "Lucio Tan appears unstoppable."
Estelito P. Mendoza, Mr. Tan's chief lawyer and the solicitor general for part of Mr. Marcos's regime, noted that Mr. Tan's victory in the Supreme Court did not mean that the Government had given up or that Mr. Tan was home free. "Now that we have won does not mean that Fortune Tobacco does not owe the Government," he said.
Still, despite the implications of his tax case and the problematic fate of the Government's tax package, many business people believe not only that Mr. Tan will continue to thrive, but also that he is a needed force in the economic revival of the country.
"Yes, he's having real problems with the executive" branch of the Government, said Gregorio U. Kilayko, the president of ING Barings Securities (Philippines) Inc. "But the Government realized that the only way to save Philippines Airlines was to let him run it. He had real trouble getting financing from local banks for the airline because of worries about liabilities from his tax cases. But he got it."
Mr. Tan is moving aggressively on a range of fronts, from Philippine Airlines to property interests abroad -- and even in beer. Although he is now clunking around in the low-priced end of the beer market with Beer na Beer (translated roughly as Really Beer), Mr. Tan's Asia Brewery just won rights from Anheuser-Busch International to produce Budweiser beer in the Philippines.
In Hong Kong, Mr. Tan's development group, Eton Properties, run by his brother Frank Chan, has grown to become one of the top 15 developers in the territory. With as much as $500 million invested in commercial and residential property in Hong Kong, Mr. Tan has used the territory as a base to expand into China. Already, Mr. Tan has property investments, of unknown size, in Shanghai, Beijing and Xiamen.
With a bit of arm-twisting from President Ramos, Mr. Tan has teamed up with six other Filipino-Chinese tycoons to form an infrastructure group, the Asia's Emerging Dragon Corporation . Each of the tycoons anted up 100 million pesos, about $3.8 million, to get the consortium off the ground. Its first project is building a new passenger terminal at the decrepit international airport in Manila, a project already under court challenge from other developers who want a piece of the action.
BUT it is with Philippine Airlines that Mr. Tan faces the most formidable and immediate challenge. As part of the country's economic liberalization, a spate of new airlines -- eight at last count -- have sprung up, all competing with Philippine Airlines' most lucrative domestic routes. And all offer cheaper seats, up to 40 percent cheaper, than P.A.L.'s.
"Mr. Tan concluded that P.A.L. can recover from losses and its bad image by four strategic initiatives," said Mr. Bautista, the airline executive. "First we have to develop new and profitable routes. Second, we have to improve on-time performance. Third, we have to maximize the use of our resources. And fourth, we have to get optimum efficiency from our employees."
Although P.A.L. has nearly 14,000 employees -- comparable carriers like China Airlines of Taiwan have about 4,000 -- Mr. Bautista said that dismissals were unlikely. "What Mr. Tan wants to do is make all these 14,000 people productive," Mr. Bautista said. In addition, the airline needs more than 30 new airplanes, equipment that will cost billions of dollars. Financing, he said, will come from Mr. Tan and from borrowing. He declined to be more specific.
"No one can do what Mr. Tan is doing," said Mr. Mendoza, the lawyer for Mr. Tan. Indeed, the lingering belief that Mr. Tan has only succeeded because of favoritism continues to rankle, an irritation that Mr. Mendoza joked about.
"No one has the guts to do what he is doing," he added. "He was saying that after he turns Philippine Airlines around, it will show that he can actually succeed, and then retire. Of course the retort is that if you don't succeed, you'll have to retire anyway because you'll be bankrupt."

HEADLINE: The Rise and Fall of El Feo

BYLINE: By BRIAN McDONALD 

 BODY:
THE night of the shooting was supposed to be a celebration. Just that afternoon, Jose Reyes had gone downtown to F.A.O. Schwarz and purchased the perfect gift, a three-foot tiger, for the guest of honor -- the 1-year-old child of an associate.
It was a fine night and the powerfully built 22-year-old was in a fine mood. Times were good; money was rolling in. The party stretched on. At midnight, Mr. Reyes decided to make a private call. He and his right-hand man, Raul Vargas, walked down the block to the Amsterdam Deli Grocery, around the corner at 2172 Amsterdam Avenue at 167th Street. The street lights glowed a dull yellow. The streets were filled with teen-agers and as he passed, they undoubtedly nodded at him with respect. 
 This was his street. The place where he got his start, where, as a 15-year-old lookout, his whistle warning of passing police cars became a familiar sound. Now it was his headquarters.
The shooting happened quickly. As Mr. Reyes walked into the bodega, a man stepped out of a double-parked maroon sedan, pointed a revolver into the open doorway and fired twice. The first shot hit Mr. Reyes in the abdomen. The second shattered his spine.
Mr. Reyes couldn't feel his legs.
" 'I don't want my mother to see me like this,' " Raul Vargas remembers him saying. " 'Take me to the hospital.' "
This was July 12, 1992, and Jose Reyes would never walk again. But he would keep playing the chess game of the streets from a wheelchair in a van and from suites in suburban hotels. It was like that in the Washington Heights drug trade. You went for the money. You took your chances. You killed before you were killed.
When the history is written of the drug gangs of New York in the 1980's and mid-1990's, the kind that wrecked a city's nerves, helped create record-high murder rates and made gunfire a common sound in many neighborhoods, the author might want to spend a chapter on Jose Reyes, or, as he was known, El Feo.
Calm, charismatic and predatory, Jose Reyes rose to become both dealer and supplier, building an empire that even the most ruinous drug organization of the era -- like the Wild Cowboys, a South Bronx gang -- paid respect to. He called the Wild Cowboys "my sons."
Court testimony from Mr. Vargas, a Reyes hit man, and a major dealer, combined with interviews with a close friend, a business associate, detectives and prosecutors, offers a glimpse into the brutal inner circle of the El Feo organization and explains some of the dynamics behind the out-of-control violence of the era -- the street-by-street turf battles, the pressures that made guns a necessity, the jealousies among the hit men.
Operating in a neighborhood doused in drug money, Mr. Reyes was a general in an army of dozens of teen-agers and twentysomethings. Like those around him, he smiled easily, wore jeans and T-shirts, played pickup basketball, ate Chinese takeout, watched crime movies on the VCR. He also devoured books on the Mafia. He read Machiavelli and argued Gibran's philosophy. And he killed, managing a hit team that left a trail of rivals dead in Manhattan and the Bronx. He was eventually indicted for 17 murders.
He was so well insulated that it took law-enforcement authorities several years to hear of his existence. When they did, they were often amazed at his reach. "There were six major dealers in Washington Heights and Mr. Reyes was one of them," said Detective Gary Dugan, who did surveillance on Mr. Reyes. "I would rate him at the very top."
Two months ago, Mr. Reyes was convicted of running a drug organization and of killing seven men. At his trial, he often sat in a courtroom empty of spectators. Paralyzed, he was already in his own private prison. He wore a urine catheter (he could not even make a bowel movement without being positioned by a nurse or attendant). Every five minutes or so his torso would shake uncontrollably and he would cling hard to his wheelchair to keep himself steady.
When a visitor entered the courtroom, he would swing his head slightly to catch a glimpse. In a flash, his eyes could go from a frightening, piercing stare -- an intense sizing up -- and collapse into a warm welcoming -- summing up in less than a moment the two sides of Jose Reyes, extreme violence and personal charisma.
The charm part almost worked on some of the jurors. Some said they felt themselves almost taken in.
"To be honest, a bond developed," one juror said.
 
 
FROM FEOLITO TO EL FEO
 Partly by accident of geography, Washington Heights became a symbol of the drug crisis in the 1980's. Access to the highways gave parts of the neighborhood almost the feel of a tourist economy. It is at the nexus of the Cross Bronx Expressway, the Harlem River Drive, the Henry Hudson Parkway and the George Washington Bridge.
If you lived in northern New Jersey or Westchester and were looking for a high, it was easy to get into -- and out of -- very quickly.
The locals learned the basics of the quick sale, employing pitchers and even making sure translators were on hand to bridge language gaps with the newest Spanish-speaking arrivals. The blocks of 166th and 167th Streets, between Audubon and Amsterdam Avenues, were among the earliest crack spots; word got around that they had a reliable product. Those blocks also lay in the reasonably well-kept neighborhood around Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, with its street traffic of doctors and nurses, probably making it less threatening to suburbanites.
Jose Reyes came to the neighborhood around 1975, at the age of 5. He was born in Puerto Rico. His father abandoned the family in Puerto Rico. He moved to 501 West 167th Street with his mother, older brother and sister. The family declined to be interviewed for this article. Though he grew up in a neighborhood dominated by Dominicans, he quickly gained acceptance.
"Everybody on the block liked him," said Tino Grana, whose father owned the Amsterdam Deli Grocery back then. One day, Mr. Grana called Jose Reyes, "Feolito," the little ugly one, and the name stuck.
"I said it as sort of a pet name," Mr. Grana said. "It wasn't meant to be derogatory, and Jose didn't take it that way. Nothing ever bothered the kid."
Jimmy Lucca, a lifelong friend, said of Mr. Reyes: "He was a little toughie. He was a little rough kid. He was bad, always. He wasn't a bully, but he was tough; he could handle himself."
Eventually, in the mid-1980's, Mr. Reyes grew close to the man who ran the crack business on 166th and 167th Streets -- Rogelio Perez Almadovar, or Chocolate. Fifteen years older than Mr. Reyes, Chocolate became a father figure to Feolito. At the age of 15, Mr. Reyes dropped out of Automotive High School in Brooklyn when Chocolate offered him an entry-level job as a lookout. Mr. Reyes moved up the ranks quickly. He began working "the table," an apartment where heroin was cut, packaged and stamped. He became a messenger, carrying drugs and money.
These were days of relative quiet on 166th and 167th Streets. No other gangs had tried to move in. But in 1987, Chocolate was arrested in a drug deal and sent to prison for several years. Chocolate handed Jose Reyes the reins. Feolito became El Feo.
Even Mr. Reyes's defense lawyer concedes that his client took over most of the drug spot, describing Chocolate's move as a way to avoid warfare within his gang by not giving any of the usual factions total control. Mr. Reyes was to be a caretaker -- tough but balanced, completely loyal to Chocolate while he was in prison but inoffensive to the factions.
The operation was fairly large. Mr. Reyes controlled all of 167th Street and half of 166th Street -- the other half of 166th was bequeathed to a Dominican in Chocolate's gang, Victor (Pielo) Battista. The business was even diversified. As the drug trade of Washington Heights, dominated in the early and mid-80's by crack, began to return more to heroin, Chocolate had expanded his operation to include "American," the street name for heroin. Customers from New Jersey were willing to pay Mr. Reyes's rate of $13 for a bag of heroin; the going street rate in less convenient locales was $10.
For the first time, Mr. Reyes saw how much money came with the turf. "These were carefree and exciting times," said his lawyer, Don Buchwald, whose defense in the trial was that Mr. Reyes was a drug dealer but not a murderous one.
Mr. Reyes also came into contact with the larger players. And then he made the same decision other dealers in the city made in the frenetic, brutal atmosphere of money in the late 1980's. He expanded. Testimony from his trial told of an operation that changed from a relatively small, tightknit, self-contained crew of fewer than a dozen to an organization both fueling, and adapting to, the imperialism of the streets. In some ways, the drug trade reflected the go-go high finance of the times: mergers, acquisitions, takeovers.
Under Mr. Reyes, the crew began supplying in bulk both cocaine and heroin to other dealers. He moved kilos of heroin to a drug organization on St. Ann's Avenue in the South Bronx. He bought a drug spot on 167th Street in the Bronx for $15,000 to $20,000. He opened a major crack and heroin location at 1770 Andrews Avenue in the Bronx and he began supplying the Wild Cowboys. By the time Chocolate returned in 1990, Mr. Reyes had turned his crew into an organization. Prosecutors said he was making as $1 million a week.
And he honored his mentor, his father figure, by allowing him to retire. The financial terms are not known. But it is believed that Chocolate became a drug boss emeritus in his mid-30's. Chocolate was shot to death in his native Dominican Republic in 1993.
But Mr. Reyes continued Chocolate's philosophy: take care of the block. And he had added a new proviso: the hell with everyone else.
 
ENCHANTED BY THE MOB
 Jimmy Lucca, Mr. Reyes's boyhood friend, is a neighborhood kid, home-grown on 167th Street, a mutt -- as he describes himself -- half-Dominican and half-Puerto Rican. Mr. Lucca, now 26, chose a different road. He now he works two jobs -- as a barber and a groundskeeper at Columbia-Presbyterian.
"I'm just a garbageman at the hospital," he says.
Mr. Lucca and Mr. Reyes were close, even after his rise. Mr. Reyes used to go to Mr. Lucca's home. They were crime buffs; they would watch tapes of crime movies while Mr. Reyes gulfed down his favorite Chinese takeout -- lemon chicken and watercress.
Mr. Lucca often taped movies for Mr. Reyes's crew. In fact he once edited out the commercials out of a season of the television series "Wiseguy" and sold the tape to a crew member.
The crew member had a reputation for being cheap, but forked over $100 for the shows. When Mr. Reyes found out, he was astounded. "You're kidding me right?" he asked Mr. Lucca.
Mr. Lucca and others close to Mr. Reyes say he played down his intelligence on the street. But they say he was a voracious reader and hungry to talk about what he read, fascinated by the lessons about tactics and the dynamics of betrayal. Some of his reading was history and political power.
He loved books on crime and the Mafia, studying them very closely. And some say he even imagined himself as a Sicilian. During one hit, he ordered that a .38 be used, instead of a 9-millimeter, because that's what "the Mafia dudes" use. Once, trying to get the owner of a drug spot to clean up his act, he gave the man a Mafia book to read for educational purposes but he was so insistent that the book not be dogeared or marred in any way that the owner was too intimidated to take it.
Mr. Lucca said that he had no illusions about what Mr. Reyes did but that they never talked about it. The topic would sometimes reach the borderline of discussion. Mr. Reyes would play mind games with Mr. Lucca. They would be in a car and another car would pull alongside at a light. Mr. Reyes would say: "Oh, that car looks suspicious. I think those guys are after me." Mr. Lucca would try not to look nervous but he couldn't help himself.
But conversations drifting too close to Mr. Reyes's real life would end quickly. Mr. Reyes would say, "You're better off not knowing," or "Someday I'll explain it all to you."
If Mr. Lucca had known the details, he would have known his friend had taken on the heavy responsibilities that came with expansion. Opening new spots and supplying "work" -- drugs -- meant creating alliances and managing an entire new layer of middlemen, security people and auxiliary personnel, finding the best product sought by the drug spots.
"In the early 80's crack dealers were mostly freelancers," says Richard Curtis, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "By the late 80's these were replaced by corporate-style organizations. Typical of these organizations were levels of ownership, management and labor. Tensions between management and labor frequently occurred. Workers were untrustworthy. This was one source of violence."
Expansion meant Mr. Reyes had to expose himself to new threats, new competition. And that required a determination to use violence.
"My God is great," Mr. Reyes would often say. "I will kill anyone who tries to do me in."
 
THE GOOD WARRIOR

Mr. Lucca says one of Jose Reyes's favorite books was "The Sicilian" by Mario Puzo. They had long conversations about many aspects of the book.
He said Mr. Reyes identified in particular with the character Guiliano. In the tale Guiliano steals a piece of cheese for his sister's wedding and is shot at by a policeman. Guiliano shoots back and becomes a fugitive.
According to Mr. Lucca, Mr. Reyes once said: "Guiliano found himself in a situation and had to live with it. He was a good warrior, had good tactics. He tried to make the most of his situation, and do some good for people that needed it."
Mr. Reyes became a good warrior, which meant reveal no weakness, protect your turf and strike first. He became a killer.
It was a highly tense, paranoid time in many neighborhooods. Sometimes two or three gangs would fight for dominance of one street. Drug dealers would check one another's spot for movement. Those who did not feel capable of defending themselves brought in others to help out.
Mr. Reyes's basic needs were to keep his drug spots supplied with desirable cocaine and heroin, to back up his allies in northern Manhattan and the Bronx with violence or the threat of it and to watch his back on his own turf in the upper 160's, an increasingly sticky situation because Pielo, the man to whom Chocolate bequeathed half of 166th Street, was undercutting Mr. Reyes's $13 price for a bag of heroin by 30 percent, a clear sign of disrespect in Mr. Reyes's own backyard.
These dynamics came out strongly in the testimony of Edwin Ortiz, the boss of a heroin crew supplied by Mr. Reyes, and of Raul Vargas, the right-hand man who pleaded guilty to taking part in all 17 murders for which Mr. Reyes was indicted.
Mr. Vargas's testimony, in particular, has a Leopold Bloom feel, depicting his wandering through the Washington Heights drug world from the age of 14. It also shows the ebb and flow of life inside the El Feo hierarchy in the early 1990's -- a mix of everyday management problems, mass production, checking for signs of betrayal and fierce defense of turf.
Violence was routine. Mr. Vargas gave an account in his testimony of one night when Mr. Reyes and his crew were hanging out in front of the Amsterdam Deli, drinking rum. A worker from his 166th Street crew got into an argument with a man in a neighborhood restaurant. Hearing about it, Mr. Reyes led his crew in a rush to find the man. They jumped him, kicked him, beat him and repeatedly stabbing him until he collapsed at a gasoline station.
There were threats. Soon after, Mr. Vargas had Mr. Reyes sent him to a drug spot he had opened on 184th Street and Audubon Avenue. Mr. Vargas went to help out another crew member. Dealers on 182d Street warned Mr. Vargas and another crew member to get out.
"They said they weren't going to approach us talking next time," he said.
Mr. Reyes said he would take care of it. That night Mr. Reyes and several others pulled out machine guns, jumped in a car and headed to the spot. Mr. Vargas, who wasn't in the car, didn't offer details but said he had heard they settled the dispute.
You had to keep watch far from home. In his burst of expansion, Mr. Reyes bought a drug spot on 167th Street in the Bronx for somewhere between $15,000 to $20,000. "It's like buying a store," Mr. Vargas said. "You buy a store, it's just change the owner."
But then Mr. Reyes started hearing that the sellers had taken the customers, too, around the corner. So Mr. Reyes hired an "old-timer" -- a veteran street warrior -- and with several other crew members carrying guns visited the spot and settled the matter. At least for the time being.
Mr. Reyes had a host of business principles: always carry a gun; keep your guns, drugs and bookkeeping records in separate stashes and never use your own car for a hit. He also test-marketed his product. That meant finding a hard-core but trusted addict with a high tolerance for heroin who would rate the intensity from 1 to 10. The testing usually took place in a shooting gallery on 166th Street. Samples were sent down from the gang's heroin factory tables at an apartment up on Dyckman Street. Anything over 8 1/2 was a smoker.
The gang kept a stash of guns up in the Bronx, in an apartment of an associate. Mr. Vargas visited the place at least once, to prepare for a bloodbath that was later canceled. He saw a closet packed with boxes and duffel bags filled with bullets and dozens of handguns and machine guns.
An apparatus of murder developed. Mr. Vargas testified that the gang had kept special cars for hits in garages in the Bronx -- Mark VII's, Celebrities and even ex-police cars. These cars had specially designed stashes, hidden compartments you opened by simultaneously hitting the windshield wipers, the defrost, and the nickel slot of the coin-holder. Guns would pop out.
In the back, they would have strobe lights to deflect the eyes of any accidental witnesses from the license plates, which would roll up.
There were more mundane details. The owner of a drug spot in the Bronx wanted more "Fruity," a hard-to-get brand of heroin that had sold well. The head manager of the 167th Street spot was skimming money and had to be fired.
Mr. Reyes needed a driver. Occasionally, Mr. Vargas drove Mr. Reyes on shopping trips. One day in 1990 they were driving in tight traffic on the F.D.R. Drive. Mr. Reyes was so impressed with how Mr. Vargas cut in and out between the slow-moving cars, sometimes at speeds of 80 miles per hour, that he offered him a job as a driver.
" 'Yeah, you know I always knew you was a driver,' " Mr. Vargas said Mr. Reyes told him.
RECRUITING THE TALENT
Drug gangs need hit men -- ready-made or trainable -- and Mr. Reyes clearly had his eye out for talent and opportunities to train.
One day, a young man named Francisco Medina showed up at 167th Street. He was what they all called "new new" -- recently arrived from the Dominican Republic. He had heard about Mr. Reyes's reputation and said he wanted to kill for him.
"I'm going to show you I'm a smoker -- I ain't no joke." Mr. Medina told Mr. Reyes during his interview, according to Mr. Vargas.
Another crew member, Hippolito Polanco, told Mr. Reyes that he didn't like Mr. Medina. But Mr. Reyes soon gave him a test, and he arranged for a gun. Mr. Medina took the job with relish, Vargas said.
When Mr. Medina returned, Mr. Vargas said, he recounted the shooting this way:
" 'Oh you should have seen, you know, you should have seen the way I shot him. I went up to the door, and I told him who, Smoky, Smoky, and then the guy said, yes, come on in, come on in, and the guy turns around and I forget he said turned around or I just know that he said, and I started to shoot him, and I left him stooped over the stove there, and he said the damn door got locked on me, it didn't have any handle and I was trying to get out I couldn't get out and I left by the window."
The body was discovered several days later when people began complaining about a foul smell coming from the apartment. "I think Freddy was like laughing about it, a dead body up there," Mr. Vargas said.
Mr. Reyes paid Mr. Medina $3,000 for the hit, Mr. Vargas said, and Mr. Medina became part of the inner circle.
Then one day, a man named Willie Jones came by. Mr. Jones was an old friend of Mr. Reyes. Mr. Jones ran a crack operation on Allerton Avenue in the Bronx and Mr. Reyes supplied the cocaine. Mr. Jones was desperate. The dealer who once ran the spot had returned from prison and was putting pressure on Mr. Jones and his workers.
"No problem," Mr. Reyes said, according to Mr. Vargas.
He sent Mr. Medina and Mr. Vargas to the Bronx. They found the former dealer, Ronnie Gedders, in a park just as school was let out. There were children in the park. "Freddy wanted to do it," Mr. Vargas testified, 'but I said no, no, no, there is a lot of kids coming out of school."
A couple of days later, Mr. Reyes, Mr. Vargas and Mr. Medina all went after Mr. Gedders. They found him on the street and Mr. Medina took out his 9-millimeter and started out the door of their car.
But Mr. Reyes told Mr. Vargas to do the hit. Mr. Vargas testified that he said: "Damn I never shot nobody. You know, I never shot anybody."
Mr. Reyes said, "Yeah, you got to -- that's how you start training yourself." He said Mr. Vargas needed to polish his skills.
Mr. Gedders was knocking on the door in front of a building.
Mr. Vargas, laid back through much of testimony, rose in the courtroom to describe what he says is his first hit:
"I got out on the driver's side, and I put my hand back like that, like I was going in my pocket, and the guy looked at me, and he's knocking on the door. And he turned away. When he turned away, then I just started shooting.
"You know I shot at the guy so I just started shooting. I was jumping when I was shooting him . . . I just held my hands like that and started shooting and when I started shooting I was jumping like that."
The Beretta he used held 15 bullets. He "emptied out" -- shot all of them.
He ran back to the car.
"Yo yo yo," Mr. Reyes said. "Slow down. Slow down. You never run from the scene because then people know that it was you."
He said Mr. Medina and Mr. Reyes started laughing at him. Mr. Medina said he was surprised it was Mr. Vargas's first hit.
"I thought you were a big-time hit man," Mr. Medina said, according to Mr. Vargas.

DOM PERIGNON AND SUN TZU
There were the good times, too. Mr. Reyes liked to party. He threw Gotti-like Fourth of July parties on 167th, for the block. He took his gang out to dinners and clubs. He drank Dominican rum, Dom Perignon and Guinness. Mr. Vargas testified that Mr. Reyes said he didn't use drugs.
He spread his money around. He became close to Michael Dean, a barber he played basketball with on 167th Street. Mr. Dean had a company, Sure Shot Entertainment, which promoted parties in clubs like Private Eyes, Bentley's and the Palladium that Mr. Reyes attended. Mr. Dean testified that Mr. Reyes invested $3,000 in a party thrown after the 1991 National Basketball Association draft, and that it was attended by several pro players.
They also had long talks about books. Mr. Dean says they discussed "The Prophet," Kahlil Gibran's poetic account of a spiritual quest.
"Jose believed, we both believed, that we were put here to master the earth, master all possibilities," Mr. Dean said. "Jose would say, 'You work with the liabilities or assets you have."
"We walked about poverty -- that it's like living without food or water and how it produces a savage state. But it doesn't mean you don't strive for knowledge. And it doesn't mean you don't worry that you'll be an old man worrying where the rent was coming from."
He said Mr. Reyes was also attracted to Sun Tzu's "Art of War" "Jose liked that it taught you that the best way to fight is to never fight. That everything in life is war. Everything always clashes. Everything is always chaotic."
But avoiding a fight was impossible around his own turf. Still he did try -- at least once, according to Mr. Vargas, who otherwise painted Mr. Reyes as very quick on the trigger.
The issue on 166th Street had to be dealt with. Mr. Reyes felt he could no longer allow Pielo and his brother, Morenito Battista, to undersell him on heroin.
He knew the two brothers well. They once all played basketball together on the 167th Street court. Jimmy Lucca says Pielo had an extremely wild temper. You could not call a foul on him; he would throw the ball over the fence in anger.
One day, Mr. Reyes walked to 166th with Mr. Vargas to persuade Mr. Battista to up his price. Mr. Battista spit at Mr. Reyes's feet and challenged him to a fistfight.
Mr. Battista put on a big show, Mr. Vargas said, and "embarrassed Jose in front of everybody." But Mr. Reyes wouldn't fight.
As they walked away, Mr. Reyes told Mr. Vargas, "I will get mine."

HIT FOLLOWS HIT
Drug violence often occurs in clusters. Here is how prosecutors presented events over the next year or so around 166th Street and 167th Street.
In March 1991, Mr. Battista and his brother send a hit man to kill Mr. Reyes in front of the Amsterdam Deli Grocery. Mr. Reyes is shot in the leg and survives. Mr. Medina is shot in the shoulder, but kills the hit man. He later cuts the bullet out with a knife.
In response, Mr. Reyes orders the shooting of the two brothers. Morenito is shot but survives. On March 3, 1992, his brother, Pielo, is killed by Mr. Medina, who uses an assault rifle.
A few months later, on the night of the birthday party for the 1-year-old, Mr. Reyes is shot and paralyzed for life.
Morenito thus had his revenge, prosecutors say.

EPILOGUE
Mr. Reyes loved the book "The Westies," by T. J. English, the story of the Irish gang in Hell's Kitchen. Like "The Sicilian," it has a major theme of betrayal. In the end, gang members turn on each other. Discussng the book with Mr. Reyes, Mr. Lucca said he could not understand how this could happen.
But Mr. Reyes told him: "Anybody would do it. Anybody put in that position would do it."
After the shooting, Mr. Reyes kept power but not for long. From his hospital bed at Columbia-Presbyterian, he continued to direct operations at his headquarters just a few blocks away. People who visited him said he took his circumstances in good humor. There were sad moments, though, like when he told his girlfriend to find another man.
After being released, he customized a van and used it to prowl his empire, says Detective Dugan, whose surveillance provided prosecutors with important evidence. Detective Dugan says Mr. Reyes searched desperately for a cure: "He had one of those computerized organizers. He had the world at his fingertips. He called Canada, Cuba, everywhere."
Mr. Reyes offered to pay a Cuban doctor a million dollars to cure him. But it couldn't be arranged.
He started to stay in suburban hotels, with Mr. Vargas sleeping at the foot of his bed. He gave out $30 tips at breakfast, Detective Dugan says.
The organization got shoddy. Edwin Ortiz testified that heroin distributed to him in the Bronx was brown and hard, like paint chips. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms raided Mr. Reyes's prime spot, 1770 Andrews Avenue. That set off a domino effect that landed Mr. Ortiz and Mr. Vargas in prison.
Facing life imprisonment, Mr. Ortiz gave up Mr. Reyes and he was arrested in Miami. At some point, Mr. Reyes met Mr. Vargas in prison. "He said, you know, you could really hurt me," Mr. Vargas recalled.
He said Mr. Reyes at first threatened him, then told him they could escape to the Dominican Republic. Then he said Mr. Reyes tried a different tactic: implicate Mr. Medina instead, Mr. Reyes urged, thus trying to throw to the dogs the man who killed for him and took a bullet in his body for him.
Later, at his trial, Mr. Reyes's face showed no expression as he sat in his wheelchair watching Mr. Vargas testify for two weeks against him. Perhaps, as his interpretation of "The Westies" and "The Sicilian" suggests, he understood.

WELFARE PROTEST
Goodbye, Mr. Clinton
 
The welfare bill that the President signed a few weeks ago hasn't been too popular at the Department of Health and Human Services. But reactions have varied. Donna E. Shalala, the department's Secretary, has joined those who seem to be saying that Bill Clinton needs to be re-elected to undo the welfare damage done by Bill Clinton. "This bill will be changed," she vowed, "until we get it right." Others at the agency, though, are not buying this Mobius-strip logic. Last week two top welfare officials -- Mary Jo Bane and Peter B. Edelman -- resigned in protest. For Mr. Clinton, the departure of Mr. Edelman had to sting. He and his wife, Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund, had started as staunch members of the Friends-of-Bill club, but as Mr. Clinton was washed to the right by the conservative tide, the Edelmans receded in the liberal distance. Last week Mr. Edelman was simply waving goodbye.
 
WALL STREET
What Goes Up Must Go Up
 
In July the party seemed to be over on Wall Street, as the Dow industrials took some scary drops. But the resounding message last week was: Never mind. The Dow piled gain on top of gain, soaring to a new record of tktktktk. Does it make any sense? Not really. After that summer scare, money is flowing back into mutual funds -- the market's lifeblood -- but it isn't the flood it was earlier in the year. And higher interest rates -- the market's mortal enemy -- seem highly possible when the Federal Reserve next tinkers with them in a week or so. The explanation seems to be that investors have it fixed in their minds that this is a bull market that won't die. By that logic, a market dip means "buy." Period.
 
TERRORISM
Can Air Travel Be Perfect?
 
If everyone at an airport, whether traveler or employee, faced the scrutiny accorded, say, a Supreme Court nominee, you can bet there would be no terrorism. But perhaps three or four people would fly a day, having each spent a week at the airport. So what's needed is the right balance between reward (everyone flies) and risk (getting blown up). Some would say that balance had been found, considering how vastly safer it is to fly than to drive or do a lot of other things. But the bottomless mystery of the T.W.A. crash created a vacuum that demanded to be filled by action (especially -- dare one say it? -- in an election year). Last week, sure enough, President Clinton proposed sweeping changes, from criminal background checks on workers to searching the luggage of "suspicious" passengers (is that you, Big Brother?). Airlines and airport operators, though, raising the specter of three-hour airport check-ins, quickly questioned whether such steps were practical.
 
IMAGE INSURANCE
Bad News, Spin Away
 
It doesn't matter what you do, Henry Higgins said, as long as you pronounce it properly. What a sadly outdated notion. For one thing, E-mail means never having to pronounce anything. Now it doesn't matter what you do; it's how it looks. Image is all. Say a corporation gets bad news, be it a defective product or a defecting executive. Given the speed of communications today, that news will hit the streets in no time. You need spin control, fast. Miss a beat and the egg gets imbedded on your face. Enter National Union Fire Insurance, the first insurer to cover the hiring, if the need arises, of a public-relations firm for "crisis management." Spin the bad news fast enough, the theory goes, and it will just fly away.
 
SECOND THOUGHTS
Tax-Cut Memories
 
It was 1981. Ronald Reagan was smiling, taxes were falling, all was Republican with the world. To Bob Dole, it was the good old days, and now he wants to revive that tax-cut crusade. A survivor of those good old days, though, has distinct second thoughts. Murray Weidenbaum, who as Mr. Reagan's chief economic adviser applauded the 1981 cuts, warned last week against copying them. It is easy to cut taxes, he said at a gathering of business economists, but far harder to cut spending -- a lesson he "learned the hard way." Simply cutting taxes, he said, is like pumping air into a flat tire without patching up the holes first. Easy for him to say. He isn't running for office.
 
TAKEOVERS
Smiling at Duracell
 
It was hard to tell whether it was a lovefest or a merger announcement. Analysts and executives fell all over themselves in applauding Gillette's deal last week to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock. A perfect fit, they all cried. Few acquisitions "could be better for Gillette." "Duracell absolutely fits their core competencies." But as often happens, the big winner is not Duracell or Gillette, but a deal maker in the wings. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts -- sound familiar in these billion-dollar windfalls? -- put up just $350 million to buy Duracell in 1988, and now stands to make billions on its controlling stake. But do those billions emerge from thin air, or come out of someone's pocket? An enduring capitalist mystery.
 
HEALTH INSURANCE
The Mighty A.A.R.P.
 
If the A.A.R.P. speaks, the elderly listen. So it's clearly a big deal when the group bestows its seal of approval on a health insurer -- roughly a $4 billion deal. That's the amount of business Prudential will lose yearly after the A.A.R.P. switched its blessing last week to United Healthcare. There is not much of a profit margin in this business as it stands, of course -- the lure for United Healthcare will be the shot it will get at persuading elderly policyholders to switch to H.M.O.'s. That's where it can make some money. And though 3,500 jobs will be lost at Prudential, United Healthcare has committed itself to hiring many of them.
 
SOCIAL POLICY
Depressed? Build a Prison
 
Whenever America has a bad day, it seems, it cheers itself up by building a few prisons. Keep locking people up, we say, and our problems will evaporate. The trouble is, it costs such vast sums to build and run prisons that there is less left for society's other needs. Usually that trade-off is hard to see up close, obscured in the shifting billions in Government checkbooks. But in Los Angeles last week the choice was stark: whether to take $19 million away from poverty relief so a new high-tech prison could open. An advocate for the homeless estimated that it would cost the same to support 10 people on relief as to support one prisoner. And another predicted that crime would rise by a third if relief was cut. This time, Los Angeles stuck with poverty relief. But the prison industry keeps booming.
 
TRADE POLITICS
Too Many Best Friends
 
Imagine calling everyone you know, wife-beater and model citizen alike, your dearest friend. Sounds silly, doesn't it? Yet the United States has done exactly that, using the gushy phrase "most-favored nation" for, well, any country we trade with. This relic of some long-forgotten tariff wars is not just linguistic nonsense, though, that can be easily ignored. Every time the topic of, say, China comes up, indignation erupts. How can we give special treatment to such a nation? Take heart. An elegant solution is at hand: Since we obviously can't change China, we'll just change the words. The Senate voted last week to scrap "most-favored" and make it "normal" trade relations. "It's a victory for clarity," said Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a co-sponsor of the bill. True, China still won't be a model world citizen -- but is anyone really?

HEADLINE: The Nation;
What Welfare Research?

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN trying to remake the nation's welfare system, members of Congress and President Clinton rarely cite any data or research to support their arguments. And for good reason.
The data are skimpy, and on many important questions, the research results are ambiguous, contradictory, confusing or nonexistent. 
 In a survey of the available research, Robert A. Moffitt, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said that studies of people moving on and off welfare "appear to suffer from a lack of theoretical content and from a failure adequately to construct testable hypotheses."
More than 4.5 million adults receive monthly cash payments through the main welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. But it is difficult to determine from Government data how many of them work while on welfare or how long they stay on the rolls.
Many members of Congress want to change the behavior of welfare recipients, to increase work effort and reduce out-of-wedlock childbearing. But Mr. Moffitt said that lawmakers had "ignored even the small amount of research" that has been done on the effects of various incentives.

Little Demand
By contrast, a student of health insurance or pension policy can find dozens of studies by Government agencies, business organizations, labor unions, Wall Street analysts and actuaries describing who gets what benefits. For such research, there is a large market.
Christine Seltz, a spokeswoman for Hewitt Associates, an employee benefits consulting firm based in Lincolnshire, Ill., said, "When a company considers offering a new benefit, it wants to know whether such benefits are prevalent in its industry, in its region and nationwide."
But there is less demand for data on welfare benefits.
For social insurance programs like Social Security, the Government keeps detailed data on a person's work history and lifetime earnings to compute benefits. But there is no need for such data in determining who gets A.F.D.C. All that matters is a person's income and assets.
It is relatively easy for the Federal Government to collect data on Social Security, Medicare and food stamps because Congress sets uniform national eligibility criteria and the Federal Treasury pays the entire cost of benefits. By contrast, welfare varies from state to state. So the task of compiling data is more formidable.
Social Security is able to provide an abundance of data to defend its programs. For example, it says, "12 percent of the aged are poor, and 42 percent are kept out of poverty by their Social Security benefits," so more than half of the elderly would be below the official poverty line without Social Security.
But welfare has proved harder to track and thus harder to defend. The number of people in a household, the number of workers and the amount of income change frequently. Few welfare recipients have regular work habits. Some work in the underground economy.
Barbara Boyle Torrey, executive director of the Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education at the National Academy of Sciences, said: "Poverty is a very dynamic concept. Because people continually go in and out of poverty, you need to be able to follow the same person over time. That is difficult."

No Complaints
What's more, in recent years, it seems, poor people have been less outspoken, less well organized and less likely to report the effects of changes in Government programs. While a small cut in the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security would generate a torrent of mail to Congress and studies from the American Association of Retired Persons, welfare recipients register few protests when the purchasing power of their benefits erodes.
Studies of welfare are often confounded by other factors as well. Changes in the economy at large, like a recession or strong economic growth, can obscure the effects of changes in welfare policy. Moreover, there are complex interactions between welfare and other benefit programs like food stamps and Medicaid, which are often changed by Congress at the same time. Thus, researchers have found it difficult to separate and measure the effects of each change.
Of course, there have been many attempts to study the effects of welfare, and Democrats cited some of those studies in defending parts of the current system. But Republicans in Congress tended to view data on the old welfare system as irrelevant to the new world they were creating.
So what about the future? Evelyn Ganzglass, director of employment and social services policy at the National Governors' Association, said, "We're entering largely uncharted territory," with time limits on benefits and no one entitled to any specific amount of cash assistance.
Under the new law, states can go off in 50 different directions. Each state is supposed to collect data on each family receiving Federal aid, and in theory these reports will provide a treasure-trove for researchers.
But Peter T. Gottschalk, a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation in New York, is doubtful. "States will have every incentive to make it look as if their programs are successful," he said. "Unless you have impartial data, it will be impossible to determine whether these reforms succeed or fail."

The Congress and the Issues

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

 BODY:

The West
'War' Refrain Is Given the Boot
Bolo ties and cowboy boots come out of the closet at this time of year in the West, as candidates in costume try to appear like ol' Clem at the electoral corral. What worked for Republicans in 1994 was an accusation that the Clinton Administration's restrictions on logging, grazing and mining were a "War on the West" against average folk. 
 But what played in Casper and Durango in 1994 looked like anti-environment oratory once it got to Congress and was given broad exposure. So this year, Speaker Newt Gingrich has told his troops out West to curb the war talk and show up at tree-planting photo-ops instead.
It may be too late. While Republicans believe their candidates will ultimately prevail, Democrats say they could pick up 10 or more Congressional seats in the West, and at least 1 gain in the Senate -- in part because suburban swing voters disagree with recent Republican positions on public lands, forests and endangered species. Republicans say the West will return to the party fold, albeit by a narrow margin.
When Bob Dole showed up in Utah last month with the War on the West refrain -- his campaign has yet to get the word that Mr. Gingrich has sent out -- he was blasted by the Salt Lake Tribune for embracing "the Whine of the West."
Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, considered perhaps the best friend of the mining and ranching industries in Congress, has recently appeared in advertisements where he is seen rafting down a wild stream.
In the race for the open Senate seat in Colorado, Tom Strickland, a Democrat, has been criticizing Representative Wayne Allard, a Republican, for his vote in favor of a measure to sell some Federal lands. Recent polls give Mr. Strickland, a lawyer, a seven-point lead in the race to replace Senator Hank Brown, a Republican who is stepping down.
Some of the bloodletting has come from within the party. In Arizona, Robin Silver, an emergency room physician, mounted a Republican primary challenge against Representative John Shadegg based entirely on environmental issues. Mr. Silver said his party "basically created the most anti-environment Congress in history."
Mr. Shadegg, who won the primary by a comfortable margin, said his own polling showed people "all want clean air and and clean water, but they don't want extreme approaches on the issue, like throwing people off Federal lands."
In Wyoming, another hotly contested Senate race in a ranching stronghold has steered clear of War on the West sloganeering.
"That whole issue has abated," said Kathy Karpan, the Democrat who is facing Mike Enzi, a Republican, for the seat being vacated by Senator Alan K. Simpson, also a Republican.
Another sign that times have changed: Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has yet to be hung in effigy this year. Two years ago, the mock lynching of Mr. Babbitt was a regular feature of property rights rallies in the West.

Tobacco Ads
Racing Fans Likely To Feel the Squeeze
It is no secret that the Clinton Administration's attack on cigarette advertising has hurt the President among the farmers and others on tobacco road. But the proposed restrictions on smoking advertisements may cost the President another constituency: the fans of stock car racing.
Big tobacco companies are the main sponsors of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, or Nascar. The sport drew 5.3 million people to tracks across the country last year. At places like the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina, the Winston label is ubiquitous at trackside. It adorns buildings, carpets and patches worn by drivers like Jimmy Spencer, whose "Smoking Joe" Ford is sponsored by Camel.
All that could change under the President's proposed regulations restricting cigarette advertising from sporting events.
"I don't think it's right what Clinton is doing to Nascar," said Ron Burts, a racing fan. "Who knows what could happen to the Winston Cup?"
Another fan, Bruce Buske of Dallas, said: "It's more government censorship of my freedom to choose. And I look at all the good things the Winston Cup does for the family unit."
Of course, there are racing fans who despise the restrictions but still plan to vote for Mr. Clinton.
"It just ain't racing if it don't have Winston on it," said Joe Armstrong, a retired mechanic, who plans to vote for the President.
Recent polls indicate that among cigarette smokers, Mr. Clinton leads Mr. Dole by a ratio of almost 2-to-1.

Nebraska
Agriculture Issues Still Top the Menu
Red meat, corn and hay -- these are still the staples of Nebraska's agricultural economy, and they hold the political food chain together as well. Big Government generally does not come in for a lot of praise, unless it is used to sell Nebraska foodstuffs overseas.
In the contest for the Nebraska Senate seat being vacated by J. James Exon, a Democrat, a big issue has developed over how much the Federal Government should continue to help sell the home-grown products of the state.
The Democratic candidate, Gov. Ben Nelson, wants more Government help. He would like to see more effort made to promote specialty products, like pasta and ethanol.
The Republican nominee, Chuck Hagel, an investment banker, supports the changes in a recent Congressional bill, which gradually reduces Government agricultural subsidies. Republicans far outnumber Democrats in Nebraska, but recent polls give the Democrat, Mr. Nelson, a 20-point lead, perhaps proving the old saw about knowing on which side your bread is buttered.

Louisiana
This Is the Song That Never Ends
Conspiracy alert: Harry Connick, the New Orleans area district attorney who defeated James Garrison in 1970, looks to be in trouble this fall, facing Morris Reed, a lawyer. Mr. Garrison, of course, said he had figured out the key to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, bringing charges that were quickly dismissed by a jury. He alleged a conspiracy between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Connick is the father of Harry Connick Jr., the singer often compared to Frank Sinatra. Mr. Sinatra was a close associate of Mr. Kennedy. Mmmmmm. TIMOTHY EGAN

HEADLINE: POLITICS;
Christian Coalition Offers Dole Both Cheers and Sharp Prodding

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Bob Dole made a brief and unscheduled appearance at a Christian Coalition conference today, bringing cheers from the rank and file of the politically powerful religious conservatives but barbs from some of their most outspoken leaders.
Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, told the nearly 5,000 delegates that it would take "a miracle from Almighty God" for Mr. Dole to win the Presidency and that Mr. Dole would win only if he made moral issues the core of his campaign. 
 "It's not the economy, stupid -- it's morality, stupid, and that's where the issue's going to be decided in this campaign," Mr. Robertson said.
But in Mr. Dole's brief comments to the Christian Coalition today, he focused mainly on the issues that have become the standard in his stump speech: his economic plan, school choice and the war on drugs.
Only in the last moments of his speech did he touch on one of the issues dear to religious conservatives, -- the legislation President Clinton vetoed that would have outlawed a type of late-term abortions that opponents call "partial birth" abortions. An override vote is scheduled next week in the Republican-controlled Congress.
"When I get the partial-birth abortion bill, I won't veto it, I'll sign it," Mr. Dole said, drawing his most thunderous applause. "I still believe, if you continue to work, you may yet persuade enough Senators so we can override this terrible veto."
The Republican Presidential candidate made the "surprise" visit during the final session of the Christian Coalition's two-day "Road to Victory '96" conference to introduce his running mate, Jack Kemp, who was the featured speaker. Mr. Dole had turned down an invitation to speak at the conference but decided to appear after he came under a barrage of criticism from Christian Coalition followers and after a personal appeal from the group's leader, Ralph Reed Jr.
"If you want to retain control of the House and Senate," Mr. Reed told his members at the opening session on Friday, "and you want to have any chance at all of gaining the White House, you had better not retreat from the pro-life and pro-family stands that made you a majority party in the first place."
Campaign aides said Mr. Dole had turned down the first request to speak to the group because the conference conflicted with campaign events. But, in some circles, Mr. Dole appeared to be distancing himself from the Religious Right in order to appeal more centrist voters. In his place, the campaign sent Mr. Kemp, who is very popular with religious conservatives.
The Christian Coalition is the largest and most prominent organization among politically active religious conservatives. Evangelical Protestants, the core group of the coalition, are credited with helping Republicans take control of both chambers of Congress two years ago. At the urging of Mr. Reed, the coalition threw its support behind Mr. Dole early in this year's Republican Presidential primary races.
But Mr. Dole was not welcomed by the crowd with the same enthusiasm that greeted him at last year's gathering, when he was one of the keynote speakers.
Before Mr. Dole took the stage, Mr. Robertson reminded the audience that evangelical conservatives had provided the margin of victory for George Bush in the 1988 Presidential election and that Mr. Dole needed similar help in 1996.
"I want to say this as clearly as I can," he said. "This campaign for the Presidency is far behind. Twenty-three points is about as insurmountable an obstacle as I can think of.
"In my personal opinion," he continued, "there's got to be a miracle from Almighty God to pull it out, and it could happen."
The Christian Coalition joined other conservative forces at the Republican National Convention to make sure that the party platform retained a strong anti-abortion stance, a move that alienated some moderates.
Initially, Mr. Dole sided with the moderates who attempted to weaken the anti-abortion language in the platform, fearing that such language could drive away some women voters and moderate voters. But the candidate backed down after a strong push by party conservatives.
Shortly after the convention, Mr. Dole riled party conservatives when he said that he had not read the platform. On the stump, neither Mr. Dole nor Mr. Kemp have made abortion an issue.
But Mr. Kemp used the platform today to deliver the strongest anti-abortion message of the Republican campaign.
"It is impossible to speak credibly about compassion for the weak while allowing the tragedy of partial-birth abortion," he said.
"These children, just moments away from their first breath, must be allowed to live," he added. "Our nation must be humane enough and inclusive enough to welcome them into life. And let me say that as President, Bob Dole would never veto any attempt to save these precious lives."

HEADLINE: ELECTION IN BOSNIA: THE SCENE;
Traveling to the Polls Is Difficult for Many

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: ALISICI, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Wearing a suit, black cardigan and white shirt and tie, Hivzo Burazezovic and his wife, Nusreta, in a patterned dress, walked with dignity into a war-damaged house in this rural village at 9 A.M. today to cast their votes in the Bosnian election.
The Burazezovics are Muslims, and they were the first to vote in this Serb-controlled village. Behind them another 100 or so Muslims waited, some somber, some in tears. They included a man from Canada and a woman from Stuttgart, Germany, who had journeyed here to vote. 
 They were escorted here by the police and international monitors, with NATO armored personnel carriers omnipresent, from the Muslim-controlled town of Sanski Most across the boundary line that divides the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia from the federation of Muslims and Croats.
"I voted for the parties that want to have a unitary Bosnia," said Mr. Burazezovic, 59, an economist who once managed the Hotel Prijedor and now lives as a refugee.
His wife, an elementary school teacher in Prijedor before Serbs dismissed her when they took control of the town and expelled the Muslims, said, "We would like to have voted in Prijedor." Around Prijedor were some of the most notorious Serbian concentration camps.
Prijedor is only 10 miles north of here, on a road past cornfields and along the Sana River, which is pushing over its banks these days.
Other Muslim voters, many wiping back tears, were even closer to their former homes.
"My house is just over there," said Nurka Alisic, 54, pointing to the hills and choking with tears. It was the first time she had been back since 1992, but this was as close to her former house as she would get today.
But in getting even this far, the Muslims who voted here had made a journey that Bosnian Serb leaders had denied to their ownpeople wanting to go the other way.
The election day odysseys of Muslim and Serbian refugees along the 18 miles of road between Sanski Most and Prijedor illustrated the different approaches to the elections by the Muslim leaders on one side and those leading the Bosnian Serb republic on the other.
And they provided more evidence of the utter failure to realize two fundamental principles of the Bosnia peace accord negotiated in Dayton, Ohio. Nearly a year after the agreement was signed, there is little freedom of travel in the country and refugees have been unable to return home.
"These are not elections," said an irate election official at the Prijedor office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is overseeing the elections. "It is not free and fair. And it began with the registration process."
Registration irregularities were minor in the Muslim-Croat Federation but were extensive in the Bosnian Serb republic, he said.
Under the peace agreement, refugees had the right to vote in the places where they used to live, either by absentee ballot or by going in person today. But in furtherance of their desire for an ethnically "pure" Bosnian Serb state, Serbian officials used intimidation and coercion to force Serbian refugees from federation areas to vote in the Serbian towns and villages where they are now living as refugees.
And today there were no buses and no polling places for Serbs who wanted to go back to their homes and vote.
In the northwestern part of Bosnia, only four buses with Serbs crossed into federation territory, said Alum Roberts, the spokesman in Banja Luka for the United Nations International Police Task Force.
It was one year ago this very day that Savo Strivicevic, a Serb, was forced to flee his village near Kljuc, where he had worked in a furniture factory.
He now lives as a refugee in Ljubija, a mountain village that has towering trees but is rundown physically. Today, he was sure he would be able to make the 40-mile journey home. To vote, yes, but more important, he wanted to see his 76-year-old mother, who is ill and could not flee when he did.
"I do not know if she is still alive," he said. Mr. Strivicevic had appealed to local Serb leaders to help him get home, but they told him they were not providing any transportation, that he would have to get there on his own. But it is not safe for Serbs to go alone back to the federation.
"I'd like to vote for a united Bosnia, so I can live where I used to live," Mr. Strivicevic said when asked whom he was going to vote for.
But when he went to vote today, he discovered that the municipal officials had filled out his registration form improperly. Mr. Strivicevic went to the European security organization's office for help, but the election officials there said there was nothing they could do for him.
It was before the morning fog lifted -- bringing crisp but clear voting day weather -- that Lazar and Milica Baic were on a walk of several miles to the polling place in Prijedor. They had wanted to vote in Drvar, their former home, two hours by car southwest of Prijedor, but there was no transportation.
With no freedom of travel, the only way for refugees from one part of Bosnia to vote in their former towns and villages was along 19 special routes agreed on at the last minute by the federation and the Bosnian Serbs. Only buses were permitted on the routes.
Neither the European organization nor NATO troops provided transportation. The federation provided buses to take its people across the ethnic boundary line. The Bosnian Serb republic did nothing. It did not ask for polling places to be set up for Serbs on the other side of the boundary, similar to the one here on this side for Muslim voters.
Officials thought that 7,000 people would cross from the federation to vote at this rural polling place. Altogether only 13 buses crossed, bringing just over 400 voters, said Mr. Roberts, the United Nations spokesman. He praised the Bosnian Serb police, who were stationed every 400 yards up and down the road here, for their professionalism.
One reason for the low turnout appeared to be the postponement of municipal elections because of registration irregularities.
"Local elections are what count," said Refik Hodzic, 25, who used to live in Prijedor but is now a refugee in Lusic Palanka, where he works for a new radio station, Free Radio Prijedor.
"This is absurd," he said, as he waited to vote in the damaged house here. "This is democracy? But it's a step we have to take."
A big enough step so that people traveled long distances.
"I could have voted by post," said Ahmed Alisic, who emigrated to Canada 40 years ago. Six years ago he returned to build a retirement home in the hills here.
"There are chestnut trees, mushrooms, places to walk," he said. "And the River Sana, for swimming," he said, the rapidly flowing river within sight of the polling place. "I wanted to bring my grandchildren."
He had almost completed the house in 1992 -- having spent $35,000 -- when the war broke out.
"You don't see it, but it's in that direction, just behind that hill," he said pointing.
Waiting in line, he still was unsure whom he would vote for. "I'm a Muslim, but not very religious," he said, adding that therefore he probably would not vote for the ruling Muslim party, the Party of Democratic Action. "I want a united Bosnia, to see all my friends."

HEADLINE: AIDS Patients Slipping Through Safety Net

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
William Krantz, a 29-year-old chef who lives in Indianapolis, has AIDS and no health insurance. Early this year, as his medical bills began to mount, he applied for a program that was supposed to help people like him get medications. He is still waiting.
The program, the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, or A.D.A.P., was established by Congress in 1990 to provide money to states to assist people with AIDS who fall through the cracks of the American health care system. They are not poor enough for Medicaid, the medical insurance program that pays for the drugs and other health care of low-income people. And they either have no insurance or insufficient insurance to buy drugs for themselves. 
 The problem is that more and more people are applying for the AIDS drug program, encouraged by the discoveries of drug combinations that seem to keep H.I.V., the AIDS virus, at bay. At the same time, the price of AIDS therapy has soared, with more and more drugs added to the arsenal. As a consequence, many states, and many people with AIDS, are having to make tough choices.
In a recent survey, the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors found that some states had set up waiting lists for people who want to join the AIDS drug program. Others have closed their enrollments or limited how much they will pay for each patient. And nearly half of all states were limiting or expecting to limit access to a new class of drugs called protease inhibitors. These drugs, used in combination with older drugs, can knock the AIDS virus down to nearly undetectable levels in many patients and have restored the health of many who were severely debilitated, but they cost $10,000 to $20,000 a year.
The group found that the programs in New York and Connecticut paid for protease inhibitors and that New Jersey's program would start paying for them next month. None of the three states' programs had a waiting list.
The A.D.A.P. Working Group, a Washington group that lobbies for AIDS patients who need help paying for drugs, calculates that the $190 million that Congress and the states have appropriated for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs in the 1996 fiscal year is less than half the amount needed. In 1995, the programs served 70,030 people, a 20 percent increase from the previous year.
Mr. Krantz is one who fell victim to the cutbacks. "Right now I can't get any of the drugs I need unless I pay out of pocket," he said. "I had to get samples from my doctor for six drugs." He added that he could not afford the prescriptions. He started trying in Janauary to get into the AIDS Drug Assistance Program in Indiana. But he said, "I don't think I'm any closer to being accepted now than I was then." And protease inhibitors, he added, are out of the question because of their cost.
Paul Chase, at the Indiana Community AIDS Action Network, said that 400 people were in Indiana's AIDS drug program and that 75 were on the waiting list.
Mr. Krantz's roommate, Ray Ford, has taken another tack, impoverishing himself so he qualified for Medicaid, which meant that all his drugs, including protease inhibitors, would be paid for. To qualify for Medicaid, he said, his income cannot exceed $482 a month. Mr. Krantz said he was not ruling out this solution, but, for now, he wants to work.
Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist, said that tales like Mr. Krantz's were nothing new in American medicine. The very poor are covered by Medicaid, which pays for prescription drugs and medical care, he said. Many other Americans have health insurance plans supplemented by their salaries or savings. But, he said, that leaves "the lower middle class, the gas station attendant, the taxi driver, the waiter." And these people, "the silent sufferers of America," Dr. Reinhardt said, "take all the abuse."
Some people with some diseases, however, are provided for. The Federal Government pays the medical bills for all people whose kidneys have failed. The State of California pays for clotting factor, a $100,000-a-year drug, for all hemophiliacs.
"You've heard of the natural lottery?" asks Dr. Norman Daniels, a philosophy professor at Tufts University who specializes in health care. "You have to be lucky in the disease you get.
"When you have a system that doesn't have a fundamental commitment to helping people, what you have is politicians and lobbyists and activists who are trying to make headway. You end up with irrationalities. A favorite disease gets selected."
All too often, the silent AIDS suffers are indeed silent, advocates say. Unwilling to go public, reticent about saying they have AIDS, many will speak only anonymously and make do as best they can.
A woman who lives in a Washington suburb, for example, who spoke only on the condition that her name not be used, explained that some people in her church did not know she had AIDS. Her insurance policy has a $3,000 annual cap for prescription drugs, which she quickly exceeded. She has begun taking protease inhibitors, which cost $900 a month, she said, and she cannot bear to give them up. "I can actually feel the difference in my body," she said. "I generally feel good."
So with her insurance exhausted, the woman started charging her drugs on her credit cards and applied to the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. But the program would not pay for her prescriptions for protease inhibitors, she said. And she has reached the limit on her credit cards.
"I haven't exhausted all my resources yet, but it's really rough," the woman said. "It's rough and it's sad."
Even affluent and outspoken AIDS patients can have a hard time. Jeff Bloom, a volunteer lobbyist at the AIDS Action Council, a Washington group that represents 1,400 AIDS service organizations, said he was so ill from AIDS in 1994 that he retired from his job as chief executive and chief financial officer at an audiovisual corporation. He paid his own insurance premiums after he retired, but he, too, had a $3,000 annual cap on his prescriptions. That, he said, covered only two months' worth of the drugs he needed. He said he had got drugs by asking his friends to persuade their doctors to prescribe more drugs than they needed so they could give him the surplus.
Dr. Wayne Greaves, an AIDS expert at Howard University in Washington, said he knew that many patients did what Mr. Bloom did. There are dangers with such an approach, he said, because the drugs must be taken regularly, on a rigid schedule, so it is risky to allow supplies to depend on the generosity of friends and their doctors.
Drug companies have plans that provide drugs for the destitute, but many patients do not qualify. Even when a patient does qualify, the doctor must spend hours on telephone calls and paper work to get the patient enrolled in the program.
Dwight A. Knuckles, a social worker at Blacks Assisting Blacks Against AIDS, a St. Louis organization, said he had found himself "with my hand out, begging" for drugs for his clients or for doctors willing to enroll his clients in drug company programs for the destitute. Even so, he said, he can "only help about 5 percent" of his 65 clients.
Advocates for people with AIDS say that at the very least, the Federal Government and most states must chip in more for the drug assistance programs.
"We're at a turning point, and I honestly don't know how we're going to resolve this one," said Gary Rose, the research and treatment coordinator at the AIDS Action Council.

HEADLINE: ELECTION IN BOSNIA: THE OVERVIEW;
BOSNIA HOLDS VOTE WITH FEW REPORTS OF REAL VIOLENCE

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sept. 14

 BODY:
With only minor incidents of violence, hundreds of thousands of Bosnians voted today in elections that the United States and its allies hope are a major step toward democracy and ethnic integration in a country bitterly divided by war.
Turnout was heavy, with European monitors reporting that 60 to 70 percent of Bosnia's 2.9 million eligible voters had cast ballots for a three-person presidency, a national parliament, regional parliaments and presidents for the Muslim, Serbian and Croatian enclaves and provincial councils. 
 These institutions are to begin functioning within two weeks, international officials in Sarajevo said, and they will clearly be the last instrument left to overcome the stark division of the Bosnian state into three enclaves that have so far evidenced neither the tolerance nor the cooperation envisioned in the peace accord signed last year.
"These elections were necessary as the first, concrete step on the long, long road that will take generations for peace and reconciliation," said Flavio Cotti, the Swiss Foreign Minister and chairman of the European organization that ran the vote.
"If opposition parties can place in the different parliaments even a few members, then perhaps this will open a pluralist dialogue," he said. "What four years of war created cannot be eliminated in a few months or by elections. You need generations now for the fear to disappear from the souls of the people."
Tensions and divisions were evident today. Relatively few voters crossed the old confrontation lines to vote in areas where they once lived but that are now held by a different ethnic group. Many Bosnian Serbs and Croats appeared intent on electing leaders who will push for continued partition and independence from the central Government in Sarajevo.
And this evening the party of President Alija Izetbegovic, who leads the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government, said that because of "voting irregularities" in Serb-held areas, it would consider the vote there "invalid" and would contest the results.
European monitors acknowledged problems in all parts of Bosnia, with voters being dropped from registration lists or the wrong lists turning up at polling stations.
But Robert H. Frowick, the head of the European mission monitoring the vote, said he considered the election to be "almost entirely free of abuse." And he answered Mr. Izetbegovic's charges by saying that the Muslim-led Party of Democratic Action had no authority to decide if the elections in Serb-held areas were valid or invalid.
Muslims, Serbs and Croats went to the polls today with vastly different expectations.
Many Muslims hoped the vote, a crucial part of the peace plan, would be the first step to reunifying a country they believe they have a right to control.
But the Bosnian Serbs see in the vote the final legitimization of their own state. Bosnian Serb leaders openly call for union with Serbia and campaigned on a promise that they would secure a permanent partition of Bosnia.
Such a partition, many here fear, could lead to a war started by a resurgent Muslim leadership intent on taking control of a state the international community insists is one entity. Or it could see NATO forces bogged down here for years in an effort to keep the factions from renewing the war.
The Bosnian Croat leadership, although formally linked with the Muslims in a federation, is already so closely allied with neighboring Croatia that it is hard to tell where Croatia ends and the Croat-controlled part of Bosnia begins.
Nationalist leaders who governed during the war are expected to receive most of the votes, and many opposition parties, in all three enclaves, complained of harassment and intimidation.
Municipal elections that were also to have taken place today were postponed because of manipulation of voter lists, fraud and harassment of local candidates.
But today the focus was less on the outcome of the vote, which will not be known for three or four days, than on the often confusing voting procedures set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is overseeing the vote.
Casting ballots took as long as 10 minutes per person, with each voter required to fill out four pieces of paper. Voters at times had trouble locating polling stations, many polling stations received the wrong ballots or registration lists, and some had to be closed for a few hours until the correct papers were delivered.
In Tuzla and other parts of northeastern Bosnia, European monitors said at least several thousand voters did not appear on registration lists at their local polling stations. Polling hours were extended in some places in Tuzla to give monitors and the voters time to search for names on master lists. But some voters, lacking transportation and fearing having to go to check lists in areas controlled by another ethnic group, simply gave up.
In Miljevina, a hamlet outside Sarajevo, a red and white bus, lumbered into town and disgorged 21 jittery Muslim voters at a polling station surrounded by French soldiers and Bosnian Serb police.
The few Serb onlookers watched their former neighbors step out, and only after the Muslims returned the gaze of several Serbs did the two groups exchange brief greetings. One Muslim, Jakup Varajic, extended his hand to a childhood friend, who told him softly: "We were not responsible for this. We did not want the war."
Then, once again, the two groups fell silent as the Muslims filed slowly into the small town hall to vote, climbed back into the bus and left under armed escort. "This was the first time I have seen my home in five years," said Mr. Varajic, 46, "and the way things are going it may be a long time before I see it again."
Voters, especially in urban areas, often waited outside polling centers for hours. And angry crowds in Sarajevo had to be dispersed by NATO troops after they kicked in doors and smashed windows in polling stations in the Novi Grad neighborhood because of the delays.
In several overcrowded polling stations, like the Butmir School in Ilidza, a Sarajevo suburb, distraught European monitors told voters, who pushed and shoved to get through the door, that they would extend the voting hours beyond 7 P.M.
Voting rules allowed those displaced from their homes by the war to vote in either their old villages or their current residences.
The election organizers requisitioned more than 700 buses to take some 100,000 Muslim and Croat refugees into Serb territory along 19 designated routes secured by NATO peacekeeping troops. But most of the buses had only a handful of people as they crossed the old confrontation lines and many never departed because passengers failed to show up.
For instance, a fleet of buses were prepared to take up to 8,000 Muslims to Serb-held Srebrenica, but fewer than a dozen people appeared this morning at the departure point in Kladanj. During the war several thousand Muslim prisoners were executed in the area around Srebrenica, which had been designated a "safe haven" by the United Nations, after the town fell to the Bosnian Serb army in July 1995.
Muslims also failed to cross in large numbers to vote in Serb-held Doboj, in the north, and in the disputed town of Brcko.
Most Serbs, likewise, did not venture into Muslim or Croatian sectors in Bosnia, although 55 buses were available to transport any who wanted to go back. Serbs voters, under the guidance of the ruling Serb Democratic Party, chose to vote in areas now held by the Serbs.
Mr. Frowick, the head of the European monitoring group, estimated that about 20,000 Muslims and Croats crossed into Serb-held Bosnia to vote, and about 4,000 Serbs entered the Muslim-Croat Federation.
He said that Muslim voters, who would have been unable to cast a ballot in Serb-held Bosnia for one of the main Muslim candidates for the three-person presidency, may have preferred to vote where they could elect their own candidate.
There were a few of reports of trouble, although no reports of injuries. Election officials said they were investigating what might have been a hand grenade attack on the home of a local election commission chairman in the Croat-held town of Bugojna. And Bosnian radio said Serbs had fired at a polling station in Felatici, northeast of Sarajevo.

; Chart: "A CLOSER LOOK: Voting for a Stake in Bosnia"
 Yesterday's election was a centerpiece of the American-brokered peace accord, which took effect last December, halting four years of war that followed the splintering of Yugoslavia.
Under the Dayton accord, Bosnia continues as a single country with power split between a national government and two substates: a Bosnian-Croat Federation and a Bosnian Serb republic. The vote is to fill the newly created national and regional positions. Municipal elections were postponed because of abuses in voter registration.
 
THE ISSUES
 
The Offices
The Muslim, Croat and Serbian communities will each elect one member of a shared national presidency. Voters will also elect representatives to a two-chamber legislature, an upper house with 15 members divided equally among Muslims, Croats and Serbs and a 42-member lower house, with one-third of the seats reserved for members from the Serb region. The Federation and the Serb republic will also elect their own presidents and 140-seat legislatures. Province-level assemblies will be elected in the federation only
 
The Problems
The Dayton accord called for free and fair elections, with free movement of people and a free press. Western officials acknowledge that these conditions were not met but still hope the elections will be a step toward healing.
The parties have clashing basic goals. The Muslim-dominated government is anxious to reassert the control it once had over the entire ethnically mixed country, and many Muslims displaced by the war hope to regain homes now in Serbian hands. The government fears that, instead, they may only legitimize Serbian "ethnic cleansing" and lead toward the country's permanent division.
Serbian leaders want to use the election to consolidate control over their half of the country, with a nearly pure Serbian population.
 
Who Votes Where
The many voters who were displaced by the war, or became refugees abroad, had a choice of voting either in the place they lived before the fighting began -- which often meant crossing ethnic lines -- or voting where they now reside or plan to live. In either case they could vote in person or by absentee ballot.
 
THE CANDIDATES
 
Muslim
Thirteen major parties and many smaller ones are fielding candidates. Here are the major candidates for the national presidency.
 ALIJA IZETBEGOVIC -- President of Bosnia and head of the Muslim-dominated Party of Democratic Action that governs the country. Widely expected to win and is esteemed as the father of the Bosnian state. Has close ties to the Islamic world, but says he favors a multi-ethnic state.
SEAD AVDIC -- Head of the Joint List of United Social Democrats of Bosnia and Herzegovic, a coalition of five parties from Tuzla that have shown a strong commitment to a multi-ethnic state. Has large following and may turn out to head the biggest opposition party.
HARIS SILAJDZIC -- Former Prime Minister, heads the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina, a liberal, western-oriented party. Widely respected, Mr. Silajdzic is critical of the ruling party's Islamic coloring; expected to get the second or third largest number of votes.
FIKRET ABDIC -- Renegade Muslim leader who ran against Mr. Izetbegovic in 1990, won but handed over the Presidency in a political deal. When war broke out he raised a private militia, carved out an independent enclave in northern Bosnia that was backed by the Croats and the Serbs until it was overrun by the Muslims last year. Deemed a war criminal by Sarajevo, he heads the Democratic Peoples' Association from exile in Croatia, but he has a following in the Bihac area.
 
Croat
KRESIMIR ZUBAK -- President of the troubled Croat-Muslim federation, has long backed a separate Croat state. Heads the Croatian Democratic Union and has strong ties with Zagreb. Expected to win the Croat seat and keep his region's close links with Croatia.
IVO KOMSIC -- Head of the coalition, Joint List, as well as the Croatian Peasant Party. The Joint List is fielding both Muslim and Croat candidates for the Presidency. Has a loyal following among liberal Bosnians who want a multi-ethnic state and is attacked by the ruling Croatian party as selling out to the Muslims. Not expected to fare well.
 
Bosnian Serb
MOMCILO KRAJISNIK -- Hard-line speaker of the current Bosnian Serb parliament and right-hand man of Radovan Karadzic, who cannot run because he is indicted for war crimes. Running on behalf of Mr. Karadzic's Serb Democratic Party, which says it will work with the Dayton agreement but has advocated secession from Bosnia and union with Serbia. Expected to win.
MLADEN IVANIC
University economist who heads the Peace and Progress coalition as well as his own party, backed by Belgrade, the Democratic Patriotic Front. Takes a less hard line toward the Dayton plan, accepting that Bosnian Serbs may no secede for many years at least. Expected to poll second. (pg. 14)

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE MIDWEST;
Crucial Midwest States Lean Toward Clinton

SERIES: The Race For President: Midwest

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The more Presidential politics changes, the more it stays the same.
Techniques evolve. Issues come and go. Candidates vary. Population has shifted from the North and East to the South and West. Yet the balance of power in the 1996 election remains where it has been in most elections since the Civil War -- in the six or seven states of the industrialized Middle West. 
 This year, the Middle West is tipping markedly, if not yet decisively, in President Clinton's direction. In states where Democratic Presidential nominees usually win without much difficulty, like Minnesota, Mr. Clinton seems unbeatable. In the battleground states, like Missouri and Ohio, he is running strongly. Even in Indiana, historically the Republicans' most reliable regional redoubt, a recent poll showed the President with a narrow advantage.
"Ohio is still in play," said Prof. Alfred Tuchfarber of the University of Cincinnati, "but Clinton looks formidable. Bob Dole can still win, but he can no longer do it by himself. He has to have some help from Clinton or the Whitewater prosecutor or Saddam Hussein or Ross Perot -- somebody, anybody."
Another political scientist, David Rohde of Michigan State University, said his state and the Midwest as a whole were simply mirroring the nation. Mr. Rohde said that of the Presidential elections involving incumbents since the 1950's -- when reliable polling was developed -- four had approval ratings of more than 50 percent the summer before the campaign got under way: Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956; Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964; Richard M. Nixon in 1972, and Ronald Reagan in 1984. All four won. Incumbents who had approval ratings under 50 percent lost.
"Clinton is in the first category," he said, "and nothing suggests to me that Dole can change the pattern."
A few voices -- surprisingly few -- urge caution. Former Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio warned during the Democratic convention in Chicago, "No election is ever a gimme."
Robert J. Keefe, a veteran Democratic operative in Indiana, expressed skepticism about his party's chances there.
In Wisconsin, Representative Scott L. Klug, a Republican, said it seemed to him "like an incumbents' year, without the anger at people in power we've seen, which means Clinton will probably win, but not by a lot, and not with a lot of gains on Capitol Hill."
If the President wins here in the nation's sixth largest state, which casts 21 electoral votes, he will be well on his way to re-election. Which is why he took a train through Republican strongholds in western Ohio on his way to the convention, and why Mr. Dole keeps returning.
On Thursday, the Republican was in Montpelier, Ohio, where his ancestors stopped on their way to Kansas, and he devoted Friday to stumping in Ohio, Michigan and Illinois.
Four Democratic Presidential candidates have managed, often narrowly, to carry Ohio since World War II. Three were Southerners -- Johnson in 1964, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Mr. Clinton in 1992 -- and the fourth, Harry S. Truman, came from the Southern-influenced part of Missouri. All were elected.
Although Presidential contests have a smaller influence on races for the Senate and House of Representatives in this day of widespread ticket-splitting, they do have some. Politicians of both parties in this region believe Mr. Clinton will help the Democrats hold two of the three Senate seats that they are defending this year: those of Carl Levin in Michigan, who is seeking re-election, and Paul Simon of Illinois, who is retiring. Representative Richard J. Durbin is trying to hold the Illinois seat for the Democrats.
It is only in Minnesota, probably Mr. Clinton's strongest Midwestern state, where the Democratic senatorial hopeful is in trouble, and he faces a struggle because he refused to abandon liberal orthodoxy. Senator Paul Wellstone, running against former Senator Rudy Boschwitz, held a lead in the polls until he, alone among Democrats seeking re-election, voted against the Republican-backed welfare reform bill. Now polls show the race even.
Mr. Clinton's strength in the region should guarantee that the Democrats hold on to most if not all the House seats they won by less than 55 percent in the Republican sweep of 1994 -- two in Ohio, three in Michigan, and three in Minnesota, for example. It should give them a good shot at ousting several vulnerable Republicans in the region, including Representatives Dick Chrysler in Michigan and Frank A. Cremeans, whose district stretches across most of southern Ohio.
Other Republicans would be in trouble no matter how Mr. Clinton was faring. Among those on that list are Representative Martin R. Hoke, in a Democratic-leaning district in the Cleveland suburbs, now threatened by Dennis Kucinich, a former Mayor of Cleveland who seems to have lived down his reputation as the bad boy of Ohio politics, and Representative Michael Patrick Flanagan, who in 1994 captured a Democratic stronghold in northwest Chicago because the incumbent, Dan Rostenkowski, got into legal trouble.
But only if Mr. Clinton can keep his lead in the high double digits in the Midwest, which most political experts doubt, does he seem likely to set off a landslide that would bury large numbers of House Republicans hereabouts.
Here is a quick look at the seven states in the region (Missouri, traditionally described as a border state, is included because its political behavior in the last three decades has tended to resemble that of the Middle West), with electoral vote in parenthesis:
ILLINOIS (22) Illinois has strong links to Mr. Clinton; his wife grew up in the Chicago suburbs, many Chicago blacks migrated from Arkansas on the Illinois Central Railroad, and some key early staff members came from this state. The successful Democratic convention only strengthened those bonds, and the President now leads by more than 20 percentage points in the polls.
William Daley, the brother and chief political adviser of Chicago's Mayor, Richard M. Daley, said, "Short of his world blowing up, the convention put the state away for him." Republicans contest that, but not very vigorously.
OHIO (21) The unorthodox but unfailingly reliable mail poll of The Columbus Dispatch shows Mr. Clinton ahead, 52 percent to 43 percent, with Mr. Perot at 4 percent. Robert Bennett, the longtime Republican state chairman, conceded that Mr. Dole faced an uphill battle, with Mr. Clinton much stronger now than at this stage in 1992.
But he argued, "It's doable for us, if he can shoot down the idea that he can't balance the budget and cut taxes at the same time, because Clinton's support is shallow and no one feels animosity towards Dole."
Prof. John Green, who heads the Ray C. Bliss Center of Applied Politics at Akron University, said Mr. Dole had failed to find any means of exciting swing voters in Ohio, "so they're leaning to Clinton, though they're not 100 percent sure why they like him, beyond his rediscovered sense of moderation."
MICHIGAN (18) William Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics, a newsletter, sounded categorical: "It's unbelievable. Dole did what people said he had to -- good convention, good running mate and a good issue in the tax cut -- and absolutely nothing works for him. He's already out of it in Michigan, and now, just to nail it down, Saddam has given Clinton his own gulf war."
Ed Sarpolus, a Lansing pollster, sounded a bit less sure. His surveys show Mr. Clinton ahead, 47 percent to 29 percent, but he said a large undecided vote (20 percent) and the President's failure to break the 50 percent mark gave Mr. Dole a chance. But Mr. Dole's weak campaign so far, he contended, has already cost the Republicans their chance to knock off Representatives Dale E. Kildee, Sander M. Levin and Lynn Rivers, all narrow victors in 1994.
INDIANA (12) A new Indianapolis Star poll shows Mr. Clinton leading, 38 percent to 32 percent, and Frank O'Bannon, a Democrat, leading Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis, in the governor's race.
Representative Mark E. Souder, a Republican freshman, commented: "What's got everybody nervous is that we're in toss-up races when we should be ahead. Something isn't jelling."
But Mr. Keefe, like many other Democrats, said he was pinching himself, "because the polls sound like 1964, and we're not there yet." President Johnson carried Indiana that year, like most other states, against Barry Goldwater.
WISCONSIN (11) Mr. Clinton won here in 1992, and he leads in the polls this time. Senator Russell Feingold, a Democrat, said, "If it was the economy, stupid, in 1992, it's probably still the economy, stupid, in 1996." But Jill Hanson of Beloit, a senior Dole aide, calls Wisconsin a toss-up.
Republican Presidential nominees have carried Wisconsin in five of the last nine elections.
The closest House race appears to be the contest for the LaCrosse-area seat of Representative Steve Gunderson, a Republican who is retiring.
MISSOURI (11) Suburban St. Louis County, often the key to close Missouri elections, is proving as troublesome for Mr. Dole as suburbs elsewhere. Ken Warren, a pollster at St. Louis University, said that his latest survey showed Mr. Dole with less than 40 percent of the vote there; Republicans usually need 55 percent to carry the state.
For reasons that baffle the locals, Mr. Dole has not been buying television spots in Missouri, which has voted with the winner in every Presidential contest since the New Deal except 1956, when it backed Adlai E. Stevenson from neighboring Illinois.
MINNESOTA (10) In a Minnesota poll completed on Sept. 8, President Clinton held a commanding lead, 59 percent to 31 percent. If he wins by anything approaching that, politicians say, the marginal seats of Representatives David Minge, Bill Luther and Collin C. Peterson, all Democrats, are expected to be safe, and Gil Gutknecht, a Republican freshman from Rochester who won by a 55-to-45 margin in 1994, might run into trouble.

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies Can Live With Trade Sanctions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding "Who's Punishing Whom?" (Business Day, Sept. 11), I found comments by Donald V. Fites, the Caterpillar chairman, quoted from his unpublished opinion article, to assume gullibility on the part of the reader. 
 Mr. Fites says of unlilateral trade sanctions that the real pressure is on United States companies that must cede American jobs to foreign companies. While pandering to nationalistic instincts, such proclamations disguise the truth.
A public company's main ambition is to increase net worth. As American corporations have sent jobs overseas by the thousands and their respective stocks have risen, executives have almost without exception spoken not of retraining displaced employees but of the need to compete in the international marketplace.
Of course, this cheap labor reduces costs and propels shareholder value upward.
In truth, then, Mr. Fites should have stated simply that these unilateral trade sanctions just might inhibit raising next quarter's dividends.

HEADLINE: The New World of (Skilled) Factory Jobs

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
THE myth is that manufacturing in Connecticut is dead. The fact is that while large military contractors and older, heavy industries have lost thousands of jobs, small and medium-sized manufacturing companies are growing. In fact, their growth is being held back by a shortage of skilled workers, according to the Connecticut Skilled Trades Coalition, which represents small and medium-sized manufacturers.
"It's the best-kept secret in the state," said James Jackson, chairman of the coalition and president of Jackson Associates, a consulting firm. 
 Small and medium-sized manufacturers -- those with an average of 60 employees each -- number nearly 6,000 in Connecticut. A survey of 115 businesses conducted last year by the coalition found an average of 19 skilled trades positions per company. There were 351 openings in jobs like precision machining, tool and die making, plastics and precision sheet metal manufacturing and general machining. Business owners indicated they expected about 2,500 job openings in skilled trades during the next decade, which represents about 22 per company. The numbers may not be large, but machinery is moved into storage and sales staffs cut, because manufacturers are unable to find skilled workers, according to the coalition. They say training for this kind of work no longer exists in Connecticut.
Business owners also say that manufacturing jobs are no longer dull, dirty and dangerous. The noisy, dingy factory has given way to clean, well-lighted, air-conditioned shops. Employees who clock in, work like robots on an assembly line and clock out at the end of the day are gone, they say. In their place are people who are expected to solve problems, make decisions, adapt quickly to new technologies and processes and work in teams. A job in one of the skilled trades pays about $30,000 at the start and $45,000 to $50,000 for 40 hours a week after several years of experience. Pay can increase to as much as $70,000 a year with overtime, said Murray Gerber, president of Prototype and Plastic Mold Company in Middletown. Jobs are available immediately after high school, and most companies offer some tuition assistance.
The 81 employees at Prototype and Plastic Mold make plastic molded parts for a variety of manufacturers, including the aircraft and aerospace industries. Computers control the plant's milling and injection molding machines and optical inspection systems. Yet, most high school graduates who apply for jobs at the plant lack the math and science skills they need, said Mr. Gerber. Furthermore, they have no work ethic, he said: "They don't understand about coming to work on time. They think that in three months, they'll be vice presidents and a year later, company presidents. The state's education system has many flaws and is far from producing the educated people needed in an industrialized society."
Students who are not interested in college are not given as much attention and encouragement as those in college preparatory courses. Parents assume that a college education is the key to their children's career success, and going to college is seen as a measure of achievement, noted Larry McHugh, president of the Middlesex County Chamber of Commerce. "That has to change," he added. "We have to start getting kids ready for jobs immediately after high school."
The Connecticut Business and Industry Association promotes collaboration between schools and businesses in order to prepare students for work. Brian Beaudin, senior vice president of the association, said: "Word must get out that manufacturing is the only industry where you can support a family out of high school with no college degree. It's tough to support a family on a bank teller's wages."
Members of the Middlesex County Chamber of commerce who responded to a survey ranked attendance and dependability highest among the traits essential for employees. Ability to work as a member of a team came next, followed by skill in reading, writing, general math, blueprint reading and problem solving. The chamber of commerce, which runs job training programs, plans to start another training course to meet the needs of its members.
As the number of workers in manufacturing has declined, apprentice programs have dwindled and failed to keep pace with technology, said Mr. Gerber. Companies that set up apprentice programs, he said, should receive tax incentives, and advanced courses should be offered in locations across the state so employees do not have to travel long distances to attend classes after work.
The state's vocational-technical schools trained many students in manufacturing technologies until large companies started downsizing. Then the apprentice system, the traditional feeder for skilled workers, died out, and enrollment in the schools dropped. Last spring, only about 400 students out of 9,500 were enrolled in manufacturing courses, said Dominic Spera, assistant superintendent of the vocational-technical schools. Mr. Spera said he blames the students' lack of interest in manufacturing on continuous publicity about downsizing.
Mr. Spera added that vocational-technical schools need to become more involved with businesses, and he is asking teachers to meet at least twice a year with business people and to follow up on recommendations made at the meetings. "We need a lot of outreach," he said. "We can't sit back any longer and wait for people to hire our students."
There are some success stories, however. At E. C. Goodwin Regional Vocational-Technical School in New Britain, enrollment in manufacturing technologies has increased to four times the number of students there four years ago, according to the instructor, Bryan Sierpinski. Mr. Sierpinski's approach to teaching has attracted attention, and local businesses are enthusiastic about hiring the school's graduates.
Through his contacts in manufacturing, Mr. Sierpinski was among the first to learn that manufacturing was indeed alive and well, he said. "Even though the attitude in the general public was that manufacturing was dying out, we knew differently. We started telling everybody four years ago that this wasn't the case."
But breaking down stereotypes and convincing students of the opportunities in manufacturing wasn't easy, Mr. Sierpinski said, and he knew he had to infuse his message with excitement. He teaches production concepts by having students make flashlights and brass whistles. He deliberately chooses objects that demand activity and produce energy. "You can't give kids economic facts and expect to teach them," he said. "You have to excite them about careers by giving them tangible examples of things they can do."
Mr. Sierpinski also teaches what he calls "workplace readiness." In fact, he concentrates more on the importance of making a high-quality product and working as a team than he does on the actual technical skills, he said. "If I can make a kid a more conscientious worker, he'll be able to survive long enough in a company to be profitable for them," he said.
At Prototype and Plastic Mold, Mr. Gerber spends $20,000 a year training an employee in a four-year apprentice program, he said. "Before I'll invest $80,000 of my money in someone, I look for a person who has a couple of years of college, state technical college, or some kind of demonstration of willingness to learn. I like people who are married, who have a car or boat to make payments on, because they have accepted responsibility and have to produce and perform."
Employees at Prototype and Plastic Mold are trained in each other's jobs to allow flexibility in the plant's operation. Currently, five employees whose jobs require knowledge of computers are selecting a new computer system for the company, Mr. Gerber said. "These are not just rote operations. We want employees to be thinking about how to make things better, improve quality and reduce production time."
David Calabrese, president of Cole Screw Machine Products Inc. in Naugatuck, said he has to turn down orders because he is unable to find qualified workers to form a second shift. "If I see an opportunity to take a new order, I need additional equipment. Then I need guys to maintain those machines. If I don't have people to maintain them, I can't keep the machines running."
With help from the Waterbury Adult Education Department, Mr. Calabrese set up a training course in math, blueprint reading, measuring instruments, quality control systems and machine operation. He recently hired two graduates and is planning to hire more. "If I have a pool of people, and they prove themselves, I'll take that extra order," he said.
At least half a dozen of the 30 employees at Cole Screw Machine Products, none of whom are college graduates, earn between $35,000 and $40,000 a year, Mr. Calabrese said. "They have to have manual dexterity and ingenuity to use these machines. They have to be able to look at a part, see it's out of tolerance, know why it happened and fix it in 10 minutes, not 10 hours. They have to be smart people. It's a very sophisticated industry."
Employees in the new type of manufacturing plant also have to keep their training up to date, Mr. Gerber said, because they can no longer expect to spend their entire working lives with one company. And unlike factory workers of the past, who were trained in only one job, manufacturing employees today perform many different tasks. "Everybody does a hundred things a day," said Mr. Calabrese. "That's the way it is in a small company. That's how we survive."

HEADLINE: At UConn, $1 Billion Plan and a New Chief

BYLINE: By JACKIE FITZPATRICK 

 BODY:
Philip E. Austin was quite content doing what he had been doing the last seven years as Chancellor of the University of Alabama, overseeing three different campuses, 43,000 students and a budget of $1.1 billion.
He'd steered the university through tough times: A stagnant budget and later a 7 percent reduction in state spending for colleges and universities in Alabama and he even took a leadership role in tax reform in the state. He liked Alabama; despite fiscal constraints, the university was strong. 
 So Dr. Austin wasn't looking for a new job when he was first approached about an opening -- the position of president of the University of Connecticut. But as members of the search committee told him about the school, about the recent passage of UConn 2000, the $1 billion 10-year plan to rebuild the university's campuses and about UConn's strategic plan, he became intrigued. "We went to seek him, he didn't seek us," said the UConn board chairman, Lewis Rome, who believes Dr. Austin is "one of the top five sitting college presidents in the country." Dr. Austin visited the university, talked with faculty members, students, administrators and with political leaders in the state and liked what he saw, he said, especially the state legislature's backing of UConn 2000.
"I think UConn is at a point of a real potential transformation from an awfully good university to a stellar university," he said, adding that he feels UConn is one of few public universities in the country on the verge of such change.
Dr. Austin has been named UConn's 13th president, succeeding Harry Hartley, a popular president who is retiring after six years in the job.
Dr. Austin will become president by late September or early October, after completing his work at Alabama University and helping his wife, Susan, orchestrate their move North.
Mr. Rome said the school was looking for a heavy hitter, and he feels they have found one in Dr. Austin. "He gives us an unprecedented opportunity to become an extraordinary public university," Mr. Rome said.
Mr. Rome said the university would also greatly miss Dr. Hartley, calling him UConn's foremost promoter. He said that three years ago when the university was faced with the prospects of laying off professors, Dr. Hartley's efforts led to legislators restoring $18.5 million to the budget. Dr. Hartley will be no stranger to UConn, returning to the faculty of the School of Education -- no doubt still in his trademark Husky blue.
Dr. Austin said overseeing the revitalization of the campus would be one of his biggest challenges as would providing "high quality modestly priced education to any citizens who are able to compete intellectually."
Dr. Hartley has said one of his concerns for the future of UConn is that, with increasing tuition costs, the university could become unaffordable.
"That's a concern nationally," Dr. Austin said. He said he wants to keep "a downward pressure on tuition" but at the same time if the university is to have "the best faculty available" in a period of dwindling or level state spending, the money has to come from some place, he said. He wants the university to grow in excellence so that it is the first choice for the state's top high school students and to that end the faculty is key.
Dr. Austin also wants UConn's branch campuses to "grow and flourish."
"I want to get out and better represent Hartford, Stamford, all of the UConn branches. If one expects broad-based legislative support, people have to have an answer to the implied question 'What have you done for us lately?' All citizens have the right of access to the intellectual repositories."
His strengths as an academic administrator are many, say those who work with him in Alabama. Dr. Austin was able to juggle the delicate balance of overseeing and keeping communication lines open among three Alabama campuses. He also worked well with legislators and the business community, said Frank Franz, president of the University of Alabama campus in Huntsville. He said that while Dr. Austin is known as a man who can get along with everyone, he doesn't shrink from difficult tasks.
"The thing that impressed me was his willingness to take on a leadership role in the state," Dr. Franz said. "A couple years ago he and some others tried to bring about tax reform in Alabama. He took that on in a forceful and persuasive way."
While the tax reform was not successful, Dr. Austin had many successes while at Alabama. He strengthened the university's ties to the business community, attracted a record number of government research grants and improved coordination among the three university campuses, Dr. Franz said. "There is absolutely nothing good in the move for Alabama but everything good for Connecticut," he said.
Dr. Austin has already met with Gov. John G. Rowland and expects to have a strong working relationship with state and national legislators. The Governor's press secretary, Dean Pagani, said the Governor looks forward to working with Dr. Austin and particularly likes his emphasis on academics.
Mana Zarinejad, a senior at UConn and the editor of the daily campus newspaper, noted that from the initial press conference, Dr. Austin dug in and started talking with legislators about the budgetary needs of UConn. "I was very impressed to see that as soon as he was voted in he was already campaigning for our operating budget," she said.
Ms. Zarinejad said the new president also seems to know just where UConn's problems lie and he plans to meet them head-on. She and other students say they will miss Dr. Hartley's accessibility and his warm demeanor and that "Dr. Austin will be a change for us. He also seems like a nice guy and we have to get to know him," she said.
Among the first people Dr. Austin wants to meet are the student leaders. "I want to get there and get a feel for everything. I want to meet with student representatives and find out what their concerns are," he said. "Students are the reason we exist."
Students and faculty are interested to see what role athletics will play on campus, in light of complaints by some faculty members that too much emphasis has been placed on sports at UConn in recent years.
Dr. Austin said the mission of a research university is "the transmission of knowledge that occurs in the classroom, the laboratory and the library." But he said athletics can create excitement on campus, get the alumni revved up and are important for an all-round university. If the N.C.A.A. rules are followed, he said, "I'm the best cheerleader there is."
Dr. Austin said the success of the UConn women's and men's basketball teams and other sports has brought positive attention to the school, allowing people from across the country to discover UConn; after they find out about its sports they can also find out about its academic programs. The challenge, he said, is to be certain academics always remain the first focus of the university.
Challenges are something Dr. Austin has always liked taking on. A North Dakota native, Dr. Austin earned a Ph.D. from Michigan State University. He served in the Army from 1969 to 1971 as an economist and at U.S. military headquarters in Saigon.
After serving in Vietnam, he was a senior economist for the Federal Office of Management and Budget and later worked as an economist and then Deputy Assistant Secretary for Education in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. His first taste of college administration, he said, was as director of a doctoral program at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
From the start, he found university-level education to be just what he wanted to pursue. "I think high-quality education is the great equalizer in society," he said.
Dr. Austin spent six years as provost and vice president for academic affairs at Baruch College of the City University of New York. During that time he had a weekend home in New Fairfield. Dr. Austin then become president of Colorado State University. After five years he was named chancellor at the University of Alabama.
Dr. Austin, who is the father of two young sons, 10 and 8, says he looks forward to settling into the president's mansion with his wife and sons, and to diving right into his new job. "To say that I'm honored is a great understatement," he said.

HEADLINE: The Changing Voice of Local Radio

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
LONGTIME listeners to the Norwalk radio station WNLK got a rude awakening of sorts when they tuned in to the David Smith morning show on July 30. Not only did they not hear Mr. Smith; they also did not, in a sense, hear WNLK.
What they heard instead was the morning news team of Stamford radio station WSTC, Michele Donofrio and Bill Shepard, doing a four-and-a-half-hour news program interspersed with traffic, weather reports and sports reports, both on WSTC and WNLK. 
 Welcome to simulcast broadcasting: in this instance WSTC and WNLK, now under joint ownership, are carrying essentially the same programming, even though they are practically alongside each other on the AM radio band at 1400 and 1350, respectively. Local newspapers had reported the impending change but to many Norwalkers it still came as a surprise, if, indeed, not a shock, since Mr. Smith, as WNLK's "morning man," had established a large and loyal following over the last 21 years.
For many in Norwalk the shock has still not worn off. True, Mr. Smith is still on the air -- not only on WNLK but also on WSTC and WINE-AM in Danbury, which is now also included in the simulcast broadcasting -- but during a radically different time slot, from 3 to 6 P.M. Monday through Friday. Only now, rather than reporting school closings, school lunch menus and, in general, helping prepare his listeners for the day ahead, Mr. Smith now accompanies them home from work.
If WNLK in Norwalk seems to have lost its identity in the new simulcast venture, Stamford (where all of the broadcasting now emanates from) may be on the verge of physically losing a radio station that has been broadcasting from the city for 55 years. Although Scott J. Bacherman, the president of the Northeast region of the station's new owner, Commodore Media Inc., says no decision has been made, there have been reports -- not denied by Mr. Bacherman -- that WSTC will move its operations to Norwalk, either later this year or in early 1997.
"That would be worse than deplorable," said Don Russell, for many years the morning man on WSTC who is now the general manager of Public Television and Radio/Fairfield County in Stamford and who also writes a column for The Advocate in Stamford. "It would be a terrible shirking of local responsibility."
Such a move, if it happens, is almost bound to antagonize many Stamford area residents, many of whom were upset when, during the ownership change in May, about 30 of the station's 55 employees were let go. Among them were Len Gambino, a popular sportscaster who had been with the station for 27 years, and the locally-produced afternoon program featuring Mary Anne DeLuca-Melillo and Rick McDonald. Their dismissals spurred telephone calls to the station and letters to the editor of The Advocate, all of which protested the layoffs.
In Mr. Gambino's case, fans obtained more than 500 signatures on a petition that was sent to Mr. Bacherman calling for the sportscaster's reinstatement and threatening a boycott of WSTC and its advertisers if he was not rehired. "We never even got a response and a lot of us have stopped listening to WSTC," said Barbara Burke of Stamford, one of the organizers of the petition drive. "Lenny was tremendously popular, and did a great job of covering local sports, and also coached a lot of our kids in Babe Ruth baseball," Mrs. Burke said. "What they did to him was outrageous." Mr. Bacherman said he was unaware of the petition. "I never saw it," he said in an interview.
Although Mr. Bacherman says the new network will cover more news than ever in the Stamford, Norwalk and Danbury areas, the result to date seems to be far less on-scene coverage and more telephone interviews than in the past.
And many listeners have noted that much of what is being broadcast simultaneously in the morning on WSTC and WNLK bears a striking similarity to what they have already read in The Advocate. But Ms. Donofrio, the news director, denies that she and her news staff have been culling stories from The Advocate. "It's true that we're doing mostly phone interviews, but we're being more creative," she said. "And most of what we broadcast in the way of news comes from us or from the wire" -- The Associated Press -- "and from releases, faxes and phone tips. And we already know most of what's in The Advocate on any given day."
Ms. Donofrio said that the new news radio operation would continue to include important municipal board meetings. But she conceded that, at least for now, such coverage would be limited. "Our last news anchor, Jim Bleikamp, goes off at 8 P.M. so when he covers a meeting he can only stay for a while," she said.
In the past, as a former WSTC news director, John Roman, recalled, the station would cover Board of Representative meetings "from gavel to gavel." That, as Mr. Roman added, often meant covering, and broadcasting, meetings until well past midnight. "Sometimes, the meetings would last all night, and we'd broadcast them to the end," said Mr. Roman who worked at WSTC from 1965 to 1995.
Those were also the days when the news staff consisted almost entirely of native Stamfordites like Mr. Roman, Mr. Gambino and Mr. Russell, who, on and off from 1941, when the station first went on the air as WSRR, until 1994, became the station's best-known personality.
"Local news was the most important part of the station," said Mr. Russell, who in the late 1940's and during the 1950's was a pioneer television newscaster and network announcer for shows such as "The Cavalcade of Stars" starring Jackie Gleason. "And we had as many as 10 news reporters covering the city. And there was tremendous dedication. John Roman, for example, would come in at 5 A.M. and, when I was program director in the 1960's, I'd still find him in the newsroom at 6 o'clock at night, and I'd say to him, 'John, won't you please go home.' "
That was during an era when WSTC was owned by the Gillespie family of Stamford, which had founded both The Advocate in the early 1880's and the radio station in 1941. Local ownership continued until 1986 when Chase Broadcasting bought WSTC and then sold it to Odyssey Communications in 1993.
Both WSTC and WNLK have offered an eclectic array of programming in recent years, ranging from rock music on WSTC to big band music and vocalists from the 40's, 50's and 60's on WNLK.
But in recent years both stations have tended to emphasize news during morning drive time and a talk format the rest of the day. Under the current format, Ms. Donofrio and Mr. Sherpard jointly anchor a news and information segment from 5:30 to 10 A.M. and then return for a "Midday Report," which is sandwiched around a Paul Harvey broadcast, between 11:30 A.M. and noon. Thereafter, apart from Mr. Smith's show, the rest of the day's programming on WSTC, WNLK and WINE includes syndicated radio talk shows. However, Mr. Bacherman said that the three stations will begin to carry a one-hour news program interspersed with traffic reports between 6 and 7 P.M. Monday through Friday, starting in October.
Mr. Bacherman, who lives in Westport, said that both the cutback in staff and the simulcast programming were because of economic conditions. "We were losing a ton of money at both stations," said Mr. Bacherman whose company owns nine other radio stations in the Northeast and a total of 33 on the East Coast, including WKHL-FM in Stamford, WEFX-FM in Norwalk and WRKI-FM in Danbury, all of which he said draw more listeners than their AM counterparts.
"What we've done is take three little stations and combined them so that the sum is bigger than the three parts. Simulcast broadcasting is currently a trend in the United States and most people involved have to wear more than one hat."
Despite its current bare-bones news operation -- three fulltime anchor-reporters, including Ms. Donofrio, and one parttime newscaster-reporter, for its simulcast operation -- Mr. Bacherman said that in the long run news coverage of Stamford, Norwalk and Danbury and their surrounding towns would be more comprehensive than ever. "We're not going to skimp on the news," he said. "And we're going to go real heavy on Fairfield County news since we'll be simulcasting into a broader area. And there'll a lot of on-the-scene coverage. Eventually, we'll be hiring more people and using a large corps of stringers in the county."
He also said that advertisers would benefit from the new arrangement, since they could advertise on all three AM stations simultaneously at a considerable saving. "Yet small advertisers could still pick and choose the stations they want to use," Mr. Bacherman said.
The abbreviated news radio format, which Mr. Bacherman says is patterned after that of WCBS Radio in New York, is employed only on weekdays, although some of the promotional messages that are broadcast imply that it is in effect around the clock. Weekend programming primarily includes syndicated talk shows, along with locally-produced programs offering advice on gardening and a "Shop and Save" program during which various products are sold on the air.
Despite the simulcast broadcasting, Mr. Bacherman said the three stations would retain their local identities. "For example, we'll broadcast high school football games involving local teams on WSTC and the same on WNLK," he said. "And the stations will be able to break away to do other local programming. In Danbury, they'll also have "windows" where they can leave the simulcast and do Danbury area news. We're also looking into some other program changes including a sports talk show."
"We're trying to run a profitable operation here and be as economically sensible as we can," said Mr. Bacherman, a 42-year-old native of Boston who has been involved in broadcasting since his graduation from college. "We were faced with a mandate when we took over and we've had to make some painful moves. And some, like the layoffs, were more painful than others."
Commodore Media Inc. was able to purchase the Stamford, Norwalk and Danbury stations because of Federal deregulation that now enables companies own more than one station in a specific market. The company is in the process of merging with Capstar, a firm that specializes in the acquisition of radio stations.
The Stamford Mayor, Dannel P. Malloy, said he telephoned Mr. Bacherman when he heard a report that WSTC would vacate its studios on Prospect Street, near downtown Stamford, and move to Norwalk. "I told him we'd like to be host to a combined operation," Mr. Malloy said, adding that "it would be most unfortunate" if WSTC left the city.
Mr. Bacherman conceded that such a move was under consideration. "But if we do combine both stations in Norwalk, we would maintain a news office in Stamford," he said, while asserting that such a move, if it occurs, would not come until next year.
As for David Smith, he's enjoying the luxury of sleeping late, or at least trying to, after arising at 3:50 in the morning for 21 years to do his longtime morning show on WNLK. "Unfortunately, while my alarm clock no longer goes off at 3:50 A.M., my internal alarm does," said Mr. Smith who is also the longtime co-host of The Fairfield Exchange interview program on Connecticut Cablevision.
Mr. Smith said said that switching from morning man to mid and late afternoon interviewer represented "a new and different challenge." As a longtime Norwalk broadcaster, he now finds himself in the position of having to learn more about the Stamford and Danbury areas.
"People come up to me and say, 'I just can't get going in the morning without you there'," Mr. Smith said. "I tell them I hope they'll join me now during afternoon drive time. And I hope a lot of my other former morning listeners do, too."

HEADLINE: Things Are Looking Up -- And Going Up

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
FINALLY. After several years of spotty performance, replete with optimistic predictions and disappointed hopes, builders, brokers and industry advisers agree that the commercial real estate market in the New York area seems on a path of steady, if slow, improvement.
At long last, there are new projects. The Durst Organization has begun demolition in preparation for building a 48-story office tower in Times Square at the northeast corner of 42d Street and Broadway. 
 In Brooklyn, after 13 years of wrangling, Muss Development Company is at work on a $320 million, 32-story complex called Renaissance Plaza that will include offices and a 384-room Marriott hotel.
In New Jersey, Bellemead Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Chubb Corporation, put up a 5-story, 205,727-square-foot speculative office building at the Somerset Hills Corporate Center in Warren Township and leased the entire structure to Hoechst Celanese Corporation almost a year before its scheduled completion.
But even though the market is in recovery, real estate industry veterans caution that the late 1990's will be very different from the go-go years of the 1980's. "There will be no speculative buildings in New York in the 1990's because the lenders will not finance a project without a commitment from tenants," said James A. Austrian of Austrian Shapiro & Partners, a consulting company.
"If I had to describe it in a word, I would say the 1980's were rampant while the 1990's will be measured," he said. Another inhibitor to new projects is that current rents do not cover the costs of land assemblage, he added.
"We clearly are in a recovery, but it is a slow recovery," said Bernard H. Mendik, chairman of the Mendik Company, one of the family-owned firms that have dominated the real estate market in the city for much of this century. He said that tenants are starting to expand, rather than contract the amount of space needed, and that rents are creeping upward, but that concessions by landlords are still needed to complete deals.
"We have a new phenomenon, the mobile tenant," he said. In search of a bargain, Mr. Mendik said, tenants long based on the east side of Manhattan will go as far west as Eighth Avenue or to Midtown South, locations they would have not considered in the past.
Like Mr. Austrian, Mr. Mendik predicted there would be little new construction in the near term.
"Banks and institutions were hurt badly by the last cycle, so there will be few sources of financing for new buildings," he said. In addition, he said, projects in New York are so large that they overwhelm the capacity of most lenders.
"In New York a building will have a $100 million mortgage at a time when most institutions do not want to place more than $30 or $40 million," he said. "So it gets tough to refinance projects."
While construction and leases continue to be the basics of shoptalk in the real estate world, two of the most discussed transactions this year involved real estate companies themselves.
The biggest surprise was the sale of the city's largest commercial real estate company, the Edward S. Gordon Company, to Insignia Financial Group of Greenville, S.C. The Gordon concern, which manages 27 million square feet of office space in the New York region, had been privately owned. The price was $74 million.
And the long-running drama involving Rockefeller Center has finally been settled by splitting the old company. The buildings to the east of the Avenue of the Americas are now controlled by an investment group including David Rockefeller, Goldman, Sachs and Tishman Speyer.
The four buildings to the west of the avenue are now a separate entity managed by Rockefeller Center Management Corporation, which is 80 percent owned by Mitsubishi Estate Company Ltd. Among its other holdings are the big brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield, a retail, commercial and industrial complex in Mount Olive, N.J., and a building site on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. "That project is approved and we have a permit to build," said Jonathan D. Green, the president of Rockefeller Center Management. "We're just waiting for the right tenant."
OFFICE leasing in midtown Manhattan and Midtown South has begun to pick up, and effective rentals are up slightly, although no one is dancing in the streets. "There has been a lot of movement, but most of it has been lateral," said James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a real estate brokerage and consulting firm in New York. "It's been like musical chairs, with companies moving and leasing 10 to 20 percent less space per employee."
"I have a sense that we are in a recovery in midtown and Midtown South, but the statistics do not really show it yet," said Mary Ann Tighe, an executive managing director of Gordon. "We are just on the cusp of feeling price pressure, with prices up about $1 a square foot from last year."
But others note that the recovery comes after a precipitous fall and that rental rates do not approach the levels of the late 1980's. "We had a virtual collapse of rents from 1989 to 1993, with declines of 25 to 30 percent," said Douglas Durst, president of the Durst Organization, which owns four large office buildings on Avenue of the Americas and four more on Third Avenue. "Since 1993 we have recovered 50 to 75 percent of the decline, but we are still not at the level of the 1980's," he said.
The building that the Dursts are constructing in Times Square is the first major office tower started in Manhattan in the 1990's and is an indication of how the area, once seedy and ridden with pornography, is reviving. Conde Nast, the company that publishes Vanity Fair, Vogue and other magazines, is the anchor tenant in the building, with an agreement to lease 583,000 of the building's 1.5 million square feet.
Because the city has an interest in redevelopment of the area, the project has the assistance of $10.75 million in tax abatements. Otherwise, real estate executives say, rentals have not yet risen to a level where new construction can be economically justified in Manhattan.
The average asking rate for Class A office buildings in midtown, which generally means recently built, well-equipped office towers, is $38.63 a square foot annually, according to RE/Locate, a statistical services company. Most executives say that will have to rise at least into the mid-40's before developers will be tempted to build.
When they do, they are going to find lenders more cautious than in the go-go days of the 1980's. "The difference between then and now is that you are going to see 75 percent financing, not 90 percent or 100 percent," said Peter Hauspurg, chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a commercial brokerage. "The lenders are going to require a significant equity cushion."
But if rental rates are only creeping up, some kinds of space -- particularly large blocks in prime buildings -- may be growing scarce. RE/Locate reports that the amount of Class A space available in midtown has fallen out of double digits, to 9.3 percent in August compared to 11.1 percent in August 1993.
Indeed, some brokers say the market appears to be approaching a state of equilibrium, with power almost evenly divided between landlords and prospective tenants. "During the 1980's it was a landlord's market, then during the early 90's it was a tenant's market," said Mitchell S. Steir, executive vice president of Julien J. Studley. "Now it is what I would call a fair-play market."
Mr. Steir said such a market was one in which landlords can make a living while tenants can get a good economic deal. He said that both sides had learned from the ups and downs of the last decade and that landlords were once again putting a premium on retaining existing tenants with good credit to avoid the $100 a square foot cost of finding and installing new tenants.
Thus far 1996 has been a year of improvement after a disappointing 1995. Here is how some specific sectors performed so far this year, and the outlook for the near future.
Building Sales
With the market on an upswing and capital flowing in from abroad, sales picked up last year and are expected to be up sharply again when the books are closed on 1996.
"We are having back-to-back banner years," said Scott R. Latham, managing director of CB Commercial Real Estate Group's industrial properties division. He said the company keeps track of notable transactions, those involving major buildings in Manhattan. In 1994 there were 39 such sales for a total value of $1.2 billion. Last year there were 54 such sales, totaling $1.8 billion, with $1 billion of that from foreign sources. Based on deals done so far and those expected to close before the end of the year, Mr. Latham said 1996 should be $1 billion over last year.
One reason for the influx of foreign capital is that New York still looks cheap, despite the nascent recovery. "Foreign investors think that buying property at $120 to $125 a square foot is low when they remember that it was $330 to $340 a foot from 1985 to 1988," said Mr. Hauspurg of Eastern Consolidated. The weakness of the dollar in relation to major European currencies increases the attractiveness of property in this country as well.
Although sales prices are up from the lows of $105 to $110 at the bottom of the market from 1991 through 1994, the bounce has been too small to scare off foreign investors.
The Retail Market
Kmart is invading Manhattan, with stores on 34th Street west of Seventh Avenue and at Astor Place in NoHo. The city is trying to encourage other "big box" retailers to come into the city by rezoning manufacturing areas to permit stores as large as 200,000 square feet.
"New York is welcoming the big-box stores," said Faith H. Consolo, senior managing director at Garrick-Aug Associates, a firm specializing in retail leasing. "Home Depot wants to be here, Wal-Mart wants to be here." Both are said to be looking at sites on the west side of Manhattan.
As the 34th Street Kmart demonstrates, models developed for suburban locations need to be modified for a city location. Instead of providing parking for hundreds of car, the multilevel store will open onto the platform for the Long Island Rail Road.
In theory, at least, this should encourage commuters to zip through the store, buy what they need and run for the train with hardly a break in stride.
In spite of the difficulties involved in operating in the city, major national retailers are seeking stores in New York "because there are more people in three or four blocks than there are in some cities," said Alan Victor, executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation.
"Entertainment/retail is what is happening now," he added. He said the Disney and Warner's stores that trade on movie characters, and the All Star Sports Cafe at 45th Street and Seventh Avenue in the Times Square area, which uses sports stars to encourage consumers to spend money on food, drink and trinkets, are examples of this approach.
Noting that Chanel and Louis Vuitton co-exist on 57th Street with Warner, Nike shoes and Levi's jeans, retail specialists say exclusive shopping districts of the past will stay in the past. "These stores have different use groups," said Ms. Consolo. "Some customers want to shop Chanel, others want a sneaker."
Just about everyone agrees that Times Square, particularly 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, is quickly becoming an attractive location for retailers. "Times Square is hot," said Edward A. Friedman, executive managing director of Newmark & Company Real Estate.
Within the next few years the once seedy strip will feature a 25-screen film complex, a Disney Store, Madame Tussaud's wax museum, an HMV music store and many smaller stores and shops. Some retailers in the area are already doing quite well. The Virgin music store in the street and lower floors of the Bertelsmann Building at 45th Street and Seventh Avenue is widely reported to be selling $1 million worth of merchandise a week this summer.
The Hotel Industry
"Occupancy rates have been at or above record levels all year," said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting. "Through July, the occupancy rate was 77.9 percent, compared 73.8 percent in 1995. We are projecting record rates through the rest of the year and an increase next year."
As a result of the demand, he said, room rates have gone up about 11 percent over last year. Prices for the properties involved are presumably moving up as well since the higher rates are expected to be sustained, although no sales are known to be imminent.
One sale that did take place was the Four Seasons Hotel which sold for about $190 million.
Although this was an eye-popping $515,000 a room, it was less than half the original $440 million cost to build. The hotel was sold to Lai Sun Group of Hong Kong and Singapore by a group of lenders led by the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
Hospitality industry executives said an improved domestic economy had increased business travel and domestic tourism. And the low value of the dollar promoted an increase in visitors from Europe, whose stronger currencies allowed them to purchase more dollars to spend here.
There also seems to be a sense among visitors that New York is a safe and acceptable destination again.
"The crime statistics are down, and that sort of information is transmitted all around the world," said Joseph E. Spinnato, the president of the Hotel Association of New York. "We are also still getting a positive impact from the repeal of the state room tax," he said.
The 5 percent surcharge, enacted in 1990, pushed tax on a room costing more than $100 a night to 21.25 percent. The repeal in 1994 and a lowering of a city tax has reduced the charge to 15 percent, which makes the city more competitive with other destinations, Mr. Spinnato said.
Despite the high occupancy rate, very few hotel projects are under way.
The SoHo Grand, which has 367 rooms and is owned by Hartz Mountain Industries, opened on West Broadway last month, and Donald Trump is converting some of the old Gulf & Western tower on Columbus Circle into hotel rooms, but the only completely new construction underway is the building that will house the Marriott in Brooklyn, and Lincoln Square West at 66th Street and Broadway, which will have some floors operated as a hotel.
Downtown
Part of the focus downtown is on converting old office buildings, many of which cannot compete with up-to-date, high-tech structures, into residences. As many as 20 buildings have been purchased for conversion or are the subject of negotiations.
The city has offered a system of tax breaks for the area that has attracted the attention of developers.
That program was instrumental last week as three New York State agencies agreed to lease 450,000 square feet of space on the lower 10 floors of 60 Broad Street. Concord Properties, manager of the building, said both the tax abatement and lower-cost energy provisions of the incentive program were invoked and will be passed on to the tenants, the state's Office of Court Administration, Department of Insurance and Division of Housing and Community Renewal. The upper floors are to be developed as residential condominiums.
Speaking of the move to convert downtown buildings to residential use, Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, said: "What has been happening exceeds our expectations and the city's. We originally thought we would get 3,000 apartment units over seven years, but now we are running at 1,000 units a year for a total of 7,000. We are going to double the population of lower Manhattan."
Mr. Weisbrod said that while an increase in resident population would undoubtedly attract more stores, shops and restaurants to the area, it is already a major tourist destination that has a well-established infrastructure.
And for someone who already works in the area, living there would give people what has been described as the "ultimate New York perk" -- the ability to walk to work.
"You have 4 to 5 million square feet of unrentable office space down there," said Raymond O'Keefe, the president of Grubb & Ellis New York. "So the alternative vision of a 24-hour community was developed, and it is actually happening. Buildings are being renovated, or sold and emptied out in preparation for renovation."
"Downtown is going to work because there is no place else to put people," said David Gialanella, manager of the New York office of Cushman & Wakefield. "But you can't measure progress in quarters; you have to measure in years."
Outside Manhattan
Brooklyn will get its first large hotel since the 1930's as part of the Renaissance Plaza project that is considered a key to renewing the borough's downtown area. The 385-room Marriott Hotel will occupy the first seven floors of the 32-story, 810,000-square-foot building on Adams Street, which will also have an underground parking garage. The project is scheduled to open in the summer of 1998.
Joshua L. Muss, the developer, said the hotel is key to the redevelopment of Brooklyn's downtown area. "There is not a business district in any city in the world that does not have a hotel," he said.
He said the underground parking was critical for attracting out-of-towners, who tend to arrive in cars. "The reason the old hotels in Brooklyn went down the drain was that there was no place to park a car," he said. He said the long delay was caused by difficulties in getting tenants and financing all in alignment at once.
In New Jersey, Hoechst Celanese's decision to lease an entire building being built on speculation "was kind of an eye-opener," said Donald P. Eisen, a senior managing director with Cushman & Wakefield. "People have been asking if prices have gone up enough that you can make money building, and the answer is a resounding 'yes.' You have to anticipate that others will follow suit."
In Queens, another long-pending project appears about to go forward at Jamaica Avenue and Parsons Boulevard. An 11-screen movie theater bearing the name of the basketball star Magic Johnson has been announced as the anchor tenant of an $80 million office and commercial complex being developed by the Mattone Group of Whitestone.
New construction is not expected for Westchester and Fairfield Counties, to the northwest of the city.
"In Stamford you can rent Class A space for $30 or $31 a square foot and in Greenwich you can get it in the mid-30's," said Anthony E. Malkin, the president of W&M Properties. "That's better than it was, but its still a good $10 to $15 below what you need to justify new construction."
If few new buildings are likely anytime soon, existing properties are changing hands and being upgraded. Recently Reckson Associates Realty Corporation agreed to buy Landmark Square, a six-building office park in downtown Stamford.
Reckson, a real estate investment trust based in Melville, L.I., is paying the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company about $79 million for the properties and is planning to invest $11.5 million in a five-year capital improvement program.
Earlier this year Reckson purchased 1 million square feet of office space in Tarrytown and White Plains in Westchester.
 The data, supplied by a concern called RE/Locate, omitted four transactions. They were a lease for the New York City Agency for Children's Services of 309,454 square feet at 150 William Street, which would have been No. 5 on the list; Dillon Read & Co., 205,818 square feet at 535 Madison Avenue, No. 8; Sony Retail Entertainment, 82,930 square feet at 711 Fifth Avenue, No. 24, and REFCO Inc., 56,631 square feet at 1 World Financial Center, No. 46.
The data also omitted renewal space in two deals. Including renewal space, the figures for News America Publishing at 1211 Avenue of the Americas should have been 501,300 square feet. The total for Zurich Reinsurance Centre at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza should have been 162,723 square feet.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 6, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A heading on Sept. 15 for a table listing the 50 largest commercial leases so far this year described them imprecisely. The transactions shown were limited to Manhattan.
In addition, the first transaction on the list was incorrectly classified. The acquisition of 600,000 square feet at 175 Water Street by American International Group was a purchase, not a lease.

HEADLINE: Business Districts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Elaine Rosenberg, a Madison Avenue art gallery owner, calls for limits on New York City's business improvement districts (letter, Sept. 9). In fact, the city's oversight of the districts begins with a complex formation process during which a plan outlining expenditures and salaries is approved by the City Council, the state comptroller and the mayor. 
 Ms. Rosenberg's contention that Madison Avenue does not need improvement does not reflect the support expressed by the majority of 700 property owners and 300 merchants in the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District's two-year formation process. Since the district's establishment, Madison Avenue is the only 26-block stretch in the city that is graffiti-free.
The Madison Avenue B.I.D. president earns $55,000 a year, a salary considerably lower than that paid to directors of comparable-size districts. This compensation to administer an organization with 30 employees, operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year can hardly be called excessive.

HEADLINE: New York Has (a) Too Many Pupils (b) Empty Seats (c) Both

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
It's a matter of simple arithmetic, isn't it?
The severity of the overcrowding in New York City's public schools should be easy to measure: How many classrooms have too many children? How many have desks to spare? 
 But the pitched debates between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the central Board of Education since school opened 10 days ago show something that children in grade school are unlikely to be taught in math class: that numbers can be a matter of interpretation.
The school system says there are 91,000 students in crowded conditions in some schools, but yesterday a deputy chancellor said there were 67,000 empty seats in others.
Interpretations of these numbers can make a big difference in the solution to school overcrowding. Are new schools the only answer? Or can other adjustments be made?
The issue became even more charged this weekend when Mayor Giuliani said he believed the overcrowding problem was being exaggerated because, in his view, the numbers provided by the Board of Education were confusing and could easily be misread. Even Board of Education officials agree the counting is complicated.
"This is not simple stuff," said Lewis H. Spence, the school system's deputy chancellor for operations. "You always have to clarify the assumptions behind the numbers."
Schools officials say that schools are more overcrowded this year than they have been in decades. They say 55 percent of the city's 1,100 schools have too many students.
But the Mayor, who has resisted allocating more money for school construction, said yesterday that "a lot of the problem" had been "misstated."
"It gives the impression that there is disorder in a large number of schools," he said. "The fact is there are certain districts that have problems they're addressing. Then there are a lot of districts that don't. And that part of the message hasn't gotten out."
Essentially, there are three different numbers in the school crowding equation.
First, there is the number of students that the schools cannot comfortably accommodate and who are therefore being grouped in extra-large classes or being taught in places like locker rooms, oversized storage closets or teachers' cafeterias.
These students have desks and chairs, but they are in inferior classroom conditions. They may be in classes with more than the 32 to 34 students per class allowed under the current teachers' contract, which sets different limits depending on the grade. Some students are taking classes in trailers, in Manhattan's Town Hall, in an old torpedo factory.
The Board of Education has said that 91,000 children in 13 of the system's 32 school districts are in this circumstance, many in neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens that have been flooded with immigrants in recent years. Put another way, nearly 10 percent of the school system's 1.06 million children are in classes with too many other students or in rooms and buildings that were not designed for teaching Shakespeare or chemistry.
And some education experts say that a figure of 91,000 students is misleadingly low, reasoning that when a classroom is overflowing, all the children in the room suffer, not just the extra students.
Second, there is the number of students who are actually without desks, who may be sitting on the floor or sharing a corner of another child's desk. Mayor Giuliani said this weekend that this is the number that matters when measuring school overcrowding. The Mayor has said that large classes do not have to be detrimental, pointing out that the Roman Catholic schools he attended had classes of 50 students or more.
"When I went to grammar school and high school, I was in classes of 40 or 50," the Mayor said earlier this month. "I think one class I was in had 52 students in it. And I think that what we've done with students is to sometimes give them excuses for not learning."
The Mayor has put the number of children without desks at 2,000 to 6,000, and has expressed frustration that school officials cannot come up with an accurate count for this.
In fact, Mr. Spence said yesterday, the Mayor's number is merely an estimate, based on projections the school system made before school started this year; he said the actual figure would not be known until October, when new enrollments and transfers between schools slow down and attendance numbers are tallied.
He said daily totals were not available because the central school board did not have the enrollment system adequately computerized.
The projections work like this, Mr. Spence said: Last year, 86,500 students were taught in places like the school gym or were otherwise sandwiched into large classes. This year, the Board of Education predicts about 21,000 additional students are entering the schools, meaning the schools would be "over capacity" by roughly 107,500.
But, by the end of last year, the school system had added 16,500 new seats to the system by building or leasing classroom space. That means 16,500 of the 107,500 students theoretically have seats, leaving the system about 91,000 over capacity. Most of those -- 86,500 -- have desks and chairs, school officials reason based on last year's situation, even if they are not being taught in optimal conditions. The remaining 3,500 to 5,500 may not have desks, he said, depending on whether schools are able to create more space or shuffle students to other schools.
"It's an estimate," Mr. Spence said. "When we get to October, it may prove to be wrong."
Third, there is the number of empty seats in other districts, like District 1 on the Lower East Side, where the number of students has been declining in recent years. Many of the 19 districts that are not considered overcrowded have extra space in some of their schools.
Yesterday, the Mayor said there were 30,000 to 40,000 empty desks in these districts.
"You're trying to correlate somewhere between 2,000 and 6,000 on an emergency basis with somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 empty desks," Mr. Giuliani said. "That's a very different task than trying to correlate 91,000 children without desks with 35,000, which is the way in which a lot of people believe it is happening."
Mr. Spence said the number of empty desks was even higher, about 67,000. But he stressed that empty desks alone are not a solution.
Many of the vacant seats are in junior high schools, he said, while the greatest overcrowding problems are in high schools and elementary schools. And, he said, "large numbers of those seats are not available because they're in the wrong geographic locations," meaning they would require students to be bused great distances from one district to another, a solution that is not popular with many parents, especially parents of young children.
Mr. Spence also said that the central Board of Education cannot order individual school districts to move children from an overcrowded school to an undercrowded school in the same district. The districts themselves are legally entitled to make their own decisions about that.
Given the numbers, what are the solutions?
To the teachers' union, which is beginning a newspaper and radio advertising campaign this week, the only long-term solution is more money for new schools.
"The real answer is bricks and mortar," said a union spokesman, Bert Shanas. "Government has to find the money to fund a good education. A decent education starts with a chair and a desk."
Mayor Giuliani has said the solution is planning and organization, not money. "Just throwing money into this system will not work," he told reporters yesterday.
Mr. Spence said the system was looking at options that did not involve spending to build new schools.
For example, he said, school officials will be looking hard at the undercrowded districts, especially those that are adjacent to overcrowded districts, to see if any of the empty space can be used. They will also be looking to see if any large classrooms are being used by special education classes, which are legally required to have fewer students. If so, those classrooms might be partitioned so that two special education classes could be held in the same space.
Another option is split-session schedules, where half the students go to school in the morning and the other half in the afternoon, a system a handful of high schools are already using. And if the problems of air-conditioning, staff salaries and New York State law can be dealt with, school officials are hoping to introduce year-round education.
"Before we try to look for capital," Mr. Spence said, the schools should make sure "that we've used existing capacity that is politically, geographically, economically and programmatically feasible."

Brush Off the 'Pollbearers'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After the New Hampshire primary, the pundit-pollster pack wrote off Bob Dole's candidacy.
After he came back to win nomination, the pack decided in June he had no chance against Bill Clinton. 
 Then, after a supposed 20-point gap disappeared overnight during the Republican convention, the pack drew a horrified breath -- until the "bounce" unbounced.
But now, with the campaign barely begun, the finger-to-the-wind set, with Thomas E. Dewey certitude, declares Election Day to be a mere formality. Rose Jacobius, a Washington Post night editor, aptly labeled the funereal crowd "Dole's Pollbearers."
This earlier-than-ever stampede toward self-fulfillment favors the favorite and insults the voters. Forgive us contrarians for daring to suggest the delicious possibility of upset.
Don't we realize that it is impossible for an incumbent to lose in the absence of hard times or national humiliation? Why don't we get with the program?
The answer is that this month's wisdom is next month's folly. Nearly half the electorate likely to vote is undecided. Pollsters will increasingly stress "likely voters" rather than blowhards, and press the "leaning toward" to a decision. This will tighten the race because much of the front-runner's support is demonstrably soft, and the tightening -- "erosion" -- will become part of the story.
I predicate this not only on congenital contrarianism but on four assumptions and a key decision.
Assume that the general euphoria about the economy, which helps the incumbent, is offset by the general conservative drift of the swing voter, which works for the challenger.
Assume that both ad campaigns are now equally adept and financed, erasing the early Democratic advantage. Mr. Clinton's Mediscare theme -- they'll throw Grandma out in the snow -- can be countered with a Dole fear theme, that the recent doubling of teen-age drug abuse is caused by slipshod anti-drug enforcement and is symbolic of the lax moral example set by the Clintons.
Assume that Dole's positive life-style theme -- trust me to provide you more control of your life, symbolized by a big tax cut -- has more lift than the Clinton positive theme, which has become "me too but not so fast."
Assume that the hard edge of the G.O.P. campaign -- against racial preferences, against illegal immigrants, against teachers' union rigidity, against lawyers' harassment -- has greater resonance than the Democrats' hard-edged assault on pro-lifers and the gun lobby.
The key decision affecting the campaign is to be made this week: whether to insert Ross Perot as a buffer into the TV debates, as Clinton wants, or to set up a direct confrontation with the two electable candidates.
Got a call over the weekend from Harvard Professor Richard Neustadt. He's doing his job, surveying pundits and pols, before joining four other academics in recommending who should debate to the 10-person commission making the decision.
I held to my opinion expressed here last week: Perot has no "realistic" chance of being elected President, which is the central criterion in the judgment. Does he have a realistic chance of carrying one state that, in a squeaker, could throw the election into the House? No.
Some Clinton supporters argue that Perot would add entertainment value to the debates, or educational value, or even news value. Maybe just one (which would automatically boost his ratings, keeping him on). Most people say sure, to hell with the "realistic" criterion, let him in, what's to lose?
To lose is the electoral value of the debates. When we put two men in the arena, one of whom is sure to be elected, we force ourselves to face reality. Which one will I make President? That is the essence of the debate process, not to be perverted by putting on a show that helps one candidate.
The pack, of course, is certain that Clinton -- with his memorized barrage of figures, his oratorical skill, and with the experience of the first five-year campaign -- will clobber the plain-spoken Dole in the debates. A few White House aides worry that some Americans might find the underdog role appealing.
We'll see. Ain't over. Who would have thought that Miss Kansas would become Miss America?

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
Bozell Worldwide joins in a venture to reach black consumers with nontraditional marketing.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A GIANT agency has helped form a company that offers marketers a chance to reach black consumers outside the boundaries of conventional advertising.
Bozell Worldwide in New York, the nation's 11th-largest agency with billings of $2.3 billion, joined with two partners to start Graham Gregory Bozell, which develops sponsored projects aimed at African-Americans. Bozell took an undisclosed minority stake in the company. 
 Graham Gregory Bozell, with offices in Chicago and New York, focuses on cultural, entertainment and sports events. Its specialty is nontraditional efforts that include event marketing, like staging arts festivals; producing television programs; cause-related marketing, which raises money for organizations like the United Negro College Fund, and life-style marketing, such as associating advertisers with celebrations of Kwanzaa, the annual cultural festival patterned after an African harvest festival.
Bozell's interest in Graham Gregory Bozell is indicative of two trends. One is the increasing prevalence of tactics to pitch products that range far afield of standard ploys like 30-second commercials or print ads.
"We've tried to look for opportunities like this that go beyond our traditional business," said Charles D. Peebler Jr., president and chief executive at the Bozell parent, Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt.
The other trend is the growing ardor for niche marketing, which addresses narrow consumer segments sorted on traits like ethnicity.
One appeal of the black market, according to a study by Target Market News, a market research company in Chicago, is that spending last year by black households outpaced spending in white households in categories like children's apparel and foods prepared at home. And though median income for black households, at $21,000, trails that for all households, at $32,300, American Demographics magazine reported, black households tend to spend more on average for personal-care services, hosiery and jewelry.
"My interest to focus on African-Americans is because there's a lot of opportunity to create value in that market," said Stedman Graham, president and chief executive at Graham Gregory Bozell.
Mr. Graham, 45, is also president and chief executive at S. Graham & Associates, a sports marketing firm in Chicago. He discussed Graham Gregory Bozell, in which he holds the majority stake, in a telephone interview Friday; at a news conference scheduled for today, he and other company principals will present their projects.
"My goal was to form a partnership with a large, well-known advertising agency," Mr. Graham said, "because what they do better than anyone else is taking an idea and making it ready for the market."
"I pitched this to a couple agencies," he added, "but they weren't really receptive." He then connected with Bozell through W. Grant Gregory, chairman at Gregory & Hoenemeyer, a merchant bank in Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Graham knew Mr. Gregory, a former chairman at Touche Ross & Company, from serving together on the board of Junior Achievement. Mr. Gregory -- also on the board of Bozell, Jacobs -- arranged for Mr. Graham and Mr. Peebler to meet.
"Chuck said, 'Let's do it,' just like that," recalled Alfred L. Schreiber, a senior partner at Bozell, referring to Mr. Peebler. Mr. Schreiber, 50, who has been responsible for Bozell's external and internal communications, is executive vice president and general manager at Graham Gregory Bozell; he hopes to draw on his experience with marketing events like Olympic torch relays and Hands Across America. (Mr. Gregory is a director and owns a minority stake that is smaller than Bozell's.)
If Mr. Graham's name is familiar, it may be because he is also known as the fiance of Oprah Winfrey, who has agreed, with her company, Harpo Productions, to participate in a Graham Gregory Bozell project, a television special titled "What's Right With America."
Mr. Graham had this to say to anyone who assumes that Ms. Winfrey's participation was assured because of their relationship: "That was no easy sell. That was harder for me than anything else."
Mr. Schreiber agreed. "I figured we'd go in there and bingo," he said. "But it was not a foregone conclusion. We made four presentations."
Other projects for Graham Gregory Bozell include a pan-African cultural event, planned for 1998; another television special, "Kwanzaa: Capture the Spirit!," and helping create a sports marketing curriculum for black colleges.
One marketer with which Graham Gregory Bozell is working is Heritage Collection Inc., a New York company that designs, imports and sells "Afrocentric" products like lamps, rugs and pillows.
"With Stedman's ability to develop marketing approaches and our ability to develop products," said Reginald Powe, president at Heritage, "we can create jobs for African-Americans and for Africans."
Graham Gregory Bozell also plans projects aimed at the general market, particularly those that capitalize on the so-called crossover appeal of black arts and celebrities.
"Today, the whole world is on a first-name basis with Oprah, Whitney, Whoopi, Michael, Shaq, Hak and Tiger," Mr. Schreiber said.
(For those who are popular-culturally challenged, those stars, in addition to Ms. Winfrey, are Whitney Houston; Whoopi Goldberg; the basketball players Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and Hakeem Olajuwon, and the young golfer Tiger Woods.)
"The only color" that should matter, Mr. Graham said, "is green."

HEADLINE: Lotus Gears Up To Get a Slice Of Internet Pie

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Colleen Griffiths, a product developer at the Lotus Development Corporation, had to suppress a laugh recently when an executive at a large bank asked her why he should risk his business on new Lotus Internet software when he could choose "mature technology" from the two-year-old Netscape Communications Corporation.
Less than a year ago, Ms. Griffiths and her Lotus colleagues were combating the widespread perception that Internet software from fledgling companies like Netscape had made Lotus's 10-year-old Notes software obsolete. Now, as she demonstrates Domino, a new Internet version of Notes, she has been confronted with the view that the Lotus software is untested. 
 The situation would indeed be funny if the stakes were not so high. Barely a year after I.B.M. spent $3 billion to acquire Lotus, much of the computer industry is focused on selling networks that enable workers at medium and large companies to exchange electronic messages and collaborate on documents. It is a market that Lotus pioneered with Notes and one where it still holds a large technical advantage over its rivals in the view of many analysts.
But rather than being at the center of the action, Lotus finds itself on the sidelines. With a new marketing blitz beginning this week, the company hopes to remind the industry that there is more to the future of the Internet than the so-called browser war between Netscape and the Microsoft Corporation.
While revenues from sales of Internet software are expected to grow to $8.5 billion over the next three years from $127 million last year, according to Forrester Research Inc., about $4.4 billion of that total will be sales of software like Domino that runs on servers -- the larger computers that host and manage sites on the World Wide Web.
By comparison, the total estimated sales from browsers in 1999, according to the Cambridge-based research firm, will be $440 million, one-tenth of the server market.
Capturing its share of the revenues in future years, however, depends on how well Lotus can capture the attention of the industry now. "Lotus has been marginalized," said Geoffrey A. Moore, president of the Chasm Group, a Silicon Valley marketing consultant. "They are not in a very good position to compete for mindshare."
Without "mindshare" -- the attention of thousands of third-party software developers, industry analysts, trade journalists and customers -- even the best technologies can founder. That is a lesson that I.B.M. learned the hard way with OS/2, its operating system for personal computers. Many experts considered it to be technically superior to Microsoft's Windows, but it never caught on because of poor marketing.
"I think people who understand our products understand that we have the technology to take the industry where it is going," Michael D. Zisman, Lotus's chief executive, said in an interview last week.
But he admitted that there are still relatively few people in that category. "We have to do a lot of work and spend a lot of money," he added.
That process will begin this week. The company will promote Domino with advertising in publications and on the Internet's World Wide Web, and plans to announce a developers conference to be held in Anaheim, Calif., in November to encourage third-party software writers and computer services providers to build Web sites using Domino.
Paradoxically, Lotus faces an uphill battle trying to sell the virtues of its server software at a time when much of the industry is racing to match it.
The biggest criticism of Notes is that it is not built around Internet standards and it is expensive. Lotus recognized the problem late last year and set out to reconfigure Notes to complement the Internet rather than compete against it. The result is Domino, which was introduced in July, and is now priced below Netscape's Suitespot offering because it can be used with the Netscape and Microsoft browsers.
 The software includes many of Notes' most powerful features, including sophisticated security, the ability to limit access to information to specific workers, a data base for electronic discussions, and the ability to easily synchronize different versions of the same document residing on different computers.
Many of these same features have been promised by Netscape for the next version of its software due out next year. Microsoft and Novell Inc. are also trying to match Domino with their products. And Radnet, a year-old company also based in Cambridge, advises people to think of its Webshare product as "Notes for the rest of us."
But a July report by the Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm, put Domino 12 to 18 months ahead of Netscape and Microsoft in developing server software.
Indeed, Netscape's co-founder and chief technologist, Marc L. Andreessen, was so impressed with Domino when he first saw it last June that he and other Netscape executives approached Lotus about a partnership that would link the Netscape browser with the Domino server, according to an executive familiar with the talks. The brief discussions ended when both sides realized that there was no way around the fact that they were competing head-to-head for the server market.
In public, Netscape officials are not complimentary about Domino. "They are trying to layer on Internet compatibility on top of what they have and you pay a very big price when you do that," Eric Hahn, a senior vice president at Netscape, said last week. The price, he said, would come in diminished performance by the software. It might also mesh poorly with other Internet programs, he asserted.
As Lotus gears up to promote Domino, friction with Netscape has increased. The two companies recently clashed over a cost comparison in a Netscape advertisement that Lotus said inaccurately inflated Domino's price. Mr. Zisman said that Lotus had been considering suing Netscape until late last week when Netscape executives agreed to withdraw the comparison.
Domino has been well received so far by the estimated 6.3 million users of Notes because it gives them a seamless link to the Internet. The challenge now is to sell Domino to the much larger universe of companies that do not have Notes and do not intend ever to buy the software because they think it is out of date.
"Notes is not cool," said David Marshak, an analyst with the Patricia Seybold Group in Boston. "It's looked at as proprietary even though it supports all the Internet standards. It's looked at as expensive even though it is a lot cheaper than Netscape. It's essentially a bad rap."
Mr. Zisman said the company hoped to focus its efforts on establishing Domino as a superior way to manage Web sites, or as a way to play host to on-line discussion groups.
A good example is a new site called Harvard-Square.com (http://harvard-square.com), which is a virtual representation of the Cambridge neighborhood. Dozens of shops, restaurants and other businesses have a presence on the site. With Domino, each business can update its Web page remotely using any common browser. So a restaurant can change its list of daily specials on the Web without the help of a software engineer, who might charge $100 an hour.
"Without a tool like Domino, we would not be able to support 700 Web sites and hope to make any money," said V. A. Shiva, president and chief executive of Millennium Productions Inc., which built and maintains the Harvard Square site.
To attract more interest from the Internet community, the company is also considering breaking Domino's features into components and giving some of them away piecemeal over the Internet, even though one of Domino's main strengths is that it offers an integrated set of features that form a powerful package.
Mr. Zisman said he had come to realize that Domino might be too far ahead of the market, so Lotus will give customers what they want today even though he is convinced that the demand for Domino's full capabilities will soon grow.
"There is nothing more frustrating," he added, "than trying to sell someone a solution to a problem that they don't know they have."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Clinton Presses Tax-Cut Issue, Saying His Plan Is Paid For

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: INDIANOLA, Iowa, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Blending a prairie populist's fervor with a New Democrat's fiscal decorum, President Clinton pledged today that his was a party that could be trusted with people's money and to balance the Federal budget while providing targeted tax cuts to help the middle class.
"I'm telling you, folks, there is a new Democratic Party," Mr. Clinton told a cheering crowd of partisans at Senator Tom Harkin's annual steak and pork-chop fry fund-raiser in a rolling farm field here. "We have proved that we are the party of responsibility when handling people's money." 
 For months, Mr. Clinton has sought to co-opt Republican issues like crime, welfare, family values and fiscal responsibility. Today he made one of his more pointed defenses of his strategy of modest tax breaks for education and families with children in the face of Bob Dole's proposal for a 15 percent income tax cut.
"I'll tell you something, folks," he said of the competing tax proposals. "Mine are paid for, and we've got to pay for them. We don't want to go back to that old time when we promised you a tax cut on the one hand and wrecked the economy on the other."
The White House believes that taxes are one of the Republicans' few strong issues, though polls also show the public is deeply skeptical of Mr. Dole's ability to deliver on his plan. So Mr. Clinton misses few chances to attack the Republican proposal as likely to "explode the deficit" and force higher interest rates that would only hurt taxpayers in the end.
Campaigning here in the middle of middle America, Mr. Clinton offered his listeners a little bit of everything today, lambasting the Republican record on the environment, taxes, education and crime and touting his own.
With a hand-painted backdrop of a Madison County-style covered bridge and bulletproof barrier of hay bales behind him, Mr. Clinton vowed for the umpteenth time to lead the country into the 21st century."
At another point, the President said, "This is a huge election, this is the last election of the 20th century to elect the first President of the 21st century."
A listener shouted out, "And you're going to win!" to which Mr. Clinton laughed and replied, "I am if you keep that same attitude for the next 51 days."
Mr. Harkin, who is the state's only elected Democratic Federal office holder and is running for his fourth term in a competitive race against Representative Jim Lightfoot, rallied the faithful with a fistful of old-fashioned firebrand attacks on Republican plutocrats and pundits.
"Trickle-down economics doesn't work," Mr. Harkin declared at one point. "We here in Iowa know that you can't fertilize a tree from the top down. Gotta stick it in at the roots."
But Mr. Harkin, too, warned that it was the Government's responsibility to provide a ladder of opportunity to help people help themselves, not "an escalator."
For Mr. Clinton, today was a chance to appear in a Midwestern swing state that he wants to win, albeit one that seems comfortably in his column at the moment. But mainly, it was repayment to Mr. Harkin, who opposed Mr. Clinton in the Democratic Presidential primaries in 1992, but then dropped out and promptly and enthusiastically supported the Arkansas Governor.
Before leaving the White House this morning, Mr. Clinton placed a call to another old friend, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, to wish him well on his planned heart surgery.
The traveling White House spokeswoman, Mary Ellen Glynn, said that the two men talked for about 10 minutes in what she described as a "friendship call to touch base" and that Mr. Clinton had told Mr. Yeltsin he had taken a "bold stroke" by confiding his surgical plans to the Russian people.
Besides the steak fry, the President appeared at two other fund-raising events, collecting a total of $400,000 for the day, half of it for the Democratic National Committee and the other half for Mr. Harkin's re-election campaign.

HEADLINE: The Internet as an Influence on Urbanization

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
For years, experts have warned that computer technology could bring the demise of old bricks-and-mortar cities. In "The Third Wave" in 1980, the futurist Alvin Toffler sketched out a vision of legions of workers liberated from the traffic and hassle of urban areas by computers and telecommunications. Instead, he predicted, they would work from homes soon to be transformed into far-flung "electronic cottages."
Recently, the rise of the Internet has added weight to the theory of technology-led urban decline. The global computer network, after all, is seen as a powerful tool that could decentralize work and living patterns. 
 But to date, the impact of the Internet has been mainly to reinforce the economic and intellectual leadership of a handful of urban centers and nearby suburbs, according to an analysis by the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University.
The New York University study, released today, focuses on the Internet as an engine of economic and regional development. The university researchers examined the location of computers directly connected to the Internet, or "host" computers. They worked from data supplied by two consulting firms, Matrix Information and Directory Services Inc. and Netwizards Internet Domain Surveys.
Entitled "Leaders and Losers on the Internet," the study used the host count as a measure of where the infrastructure of the Internet is concentrated. Host computers are typically more powerful machines, each with its own Internet name and address, and a count of them by location is assumed to be an indication of where private and public investment in the Internet is greatest. The study did not try to measure the number of people using the Internet.
The central measurement in the study was a county-by-county analysis. The five regions with the most Internet host computers were Silicon Valley, the Boston-Cambridge, Mass., area, Los Angeles, Manhattan and Fairfax County in Virginia.
In the rankings of the top 25 counties, the areas embracing several major American cities make the list, including San Diego, Chicago, Minneapolis, Seattle, San Francisco, Dallas and Washington.
But the study observed, "Some of the nation's major cities, like Houston, Miami, Detroit and New Orleans are not major participants in the Internet."
These cities have not yet nurtured a large number of Internet-related businesses in the way that New York has become a center for developers of World Wide Web sites, Los Angeles has become the capital of high-technology special effects for movies, or the Seattle area has benefited from new companies started in the shadow of the Microsoft Corporation.
"The location of Internet hosts," the study said, "suggests that there is a new pattern of leaders and losers in modern metropolitan growth."
The Internet, to be sure, is merely the latest wave of technology that affects cities unevenly, helping some and punishing others. Deep-water ports, railroads, the telephone and the automobile all brought changes in the geographic distribution of wealth and people.
In the future, the New York University study asserts, access to the Internet and technical know-how to exploit computer technology may well be the keys to economic development. "The future is going to belong to those cities and regions with the information-driven industries and people with the skills to thrive in those industries," said Mitchell Moss, director of the urban research center at New York University. Mr. Moss was the co-author of the Internet analysis with Anthony Townsend, a research assistant.
The regions doing well in the high-technology development race, Mr. Moss says, are likely to extend their lead. Telecommunications deregulation, he believes, will mean that new investment will increasingly go into the existing high-tech clusters. The accelerating concentration of skilled people, investment and innovation -- the Silicon Valley model -- will more and more become the pattern of economic development nationally, according to Mr. Moss.
Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, agrees that Silicon Valley will be the model. But he says it is a model that suggests that new high-technology clusters will develop.
Computer engineers, Mr. Saffo notes, gathered in Silicon Valley partly because of Stanford University and the nearby Government research laboratories. Yet the weather, landscape and life style also made it a place where people wanted to stay. Once the industry took root, he notes, the business advantages of clustering grew in important.
Already, he sees evidence of computer professionals settling in new areas, attracted by the life style and high-speed telecommunications links in places like Santa Fe, N.M., and Telluride, Colo.
"The Internet won't mean the death of urban centers," Mr. Saffo said. "It will mean the reinvention of urban centers.
"But," he added, "it could also eventually mean an explosion in some exurban areas, leading to a migration not seen since the suburbanization of the 1950's."
Computer experts point out that trying to count host computers by location is difficult to do precisely. The method used for the New York University study does not count the machines on internal corporate networks, known as intranets. In addition, the address listed for an Internet computer may not always be where the machine actually is.
Yet David Gelernter, a computer science professor at Yale University, questioned not the methodology, but the significance of counting clusters of Internet host machines. The results of the study, he said, showed that Internet connections are spreading beyond their university and computer-company origins (Silicon Valley and Boston-Cambridge) and into centers of affluent, well-educated people (Manhattan and Los Angeles).
"The Internet today is about high-powered consumerism," said Mr. Gelernter, who writes about technology's impact on society. "Most people now use it for hanging out, shopping and browsing. Nobody's really making money on it yet. Culturally, the Internet is trivial.
"This may change, but I'm not sure that having a lot of Internet connections is any great economic or cultural advantage," Mr. Gelernter said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REFORM PARTY;
Perot, in Video Lecture, Renews Attack on Trade Accord

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

 BODY:
Ross Perot says that when he cocks his ear toward Mexico, he still hears that "giant sucking sound" of American jobs headed south of the Rio Grande.
"Yes, folks, we predicted it, and there is a giant sucking sound coming out of Mexico," Mr. Perot, the Reform Party's Presidential candidate, said in a new 30-minute "infomercial" that was broadcast on Saturday evening on the Fox network. 
 "They're sucking your jobs down there, they're sucking our dollars down there, and both political parties were locked arm in arm and bound at the hip to make that happen," Mr. Perot said, as the campaign advertisement showed photographs of President Clinton, who led the fight for Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement in late 1993, and his Republican opponent, Bob Dole, who strongly supported the measure. "I'd like to see them defend it now."
Mr. Perot's video lecture reiterated his long-held belief that Nafta, which gradually abolishes nearly all trade barriers between the United States, Mexico and Canada, is an unfair, lopsided agreement that results in companies moving jobs in the United States to overseas sites, and American consumers buying foreign-made, tariff-free products.
To increase the number of higher wage jobs available to Americans and to increase prosperity in general, Mr. Perot proposes three policies: renegotiating Nafta, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Most Favored Nation status for China; increasing the amount of money invested in domestic manufacturing plants, and improving the creation of new technologies.
"I want to make one point absolutely clear regarding international trade," Mr. Perot said in the campaign advertisement, which includes his newly named running mate, Pat Choate, a political economist. "I am for fair, intelligent international trade that does not produce huge trade deficits and job losses in our country."
Mr. Perot framed the nation's trade deficit as a problem that America created for itself. "We have only ourselves to blame for our trade losses," he said. "They come from unfair, one-sided trade deals that encourage shipping our jobs overseas to get the cheapest labor possible, and then sending the foreign-made products back into the American market with no tariffs."
One of the charts that Mr. Perot uses in his new infomercial -- an advertising device that has become his preferred method of campaigning, as opposed to making personal appearances and giving stump speeches -- shows that the United States has a $61 billion trade deficit with Mexico and Canada in the last 27 months. Mr. Perot contends that the United States has "lost more than a half million American jobs to Mexico alone in this time period."
In 1993, before Congress approved legislation implementing Nafta, Mr. Perot predicted that the trade accord would cost the United States more than five million jobs.
After discussing the trade deficit, Mr. Perot posed a number of rhetorical questions, all of which underscored his contentions about Nafta's negative effects: "Did the average citizen in Mexico benefit? No. Did anyone benefit from Nafta? Oh, yes -- the people who poured tens of millions of dollars into Congressional campaigns benefited by moving their factories to Mexico, where they pay low wages, have little or no employee benefits and sell the goods back into the United States with no import tariffs."
In the advertisement, titled "Made in the USA . . . Again," Mr. Choate provided the intellectual underpinning for Mr. Perot's assertions about job creation and trade policy. In an indirect criticism of Mr. Clinton's campaign themes, Mr. Perot asked his running mate why some Americans are having a tough time "making ends meet" if the economy has produced 10 million jobs, low inflation and a robust stock market.
Mr. Choate replied: "In today's global economy, workers are abundant, jobs are scarce and corporations are highly mobile. The problem is one-sided trade deals. Our workers are in a race to the bottom with workers from the developing third-world countries."
Responding to Mr. Perot's observation that "people are working harder but making less," Mr. Choate said the United States was letting itself become a service economy.
"America is deep into the process of swapping good jobs for poor jobs," he said. "The numbers tell the story. Between 1985 and 1996, the United States created more than 23 million new jobs. But the vast majority of them were in part-time, low-wage service work. This is minimum-wage work, which is immune from international competition."

HEADLINE: Flags Flying, North Italian Secession Rally Falls Short

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: VENICE, Italy, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Unfurling the banners of the still-mythical state of Padania, Italy's small but flamboyant secessionist movement steamed into this northern lagoon city this evening, stepping up its improbable challenge to Italian unity with a mix of medieval pageantry and political bombast.
Borrowing phrases from the American Declaration of Independence, Umberto Bossi, the movement's leader, who had just completed a three-day "March to the Sea," delivered a tirade against the "colonialists" in Rome who, he said, have robbed the north of Italy of its hard-earned money and its cultural identity. 
 But the long-awaited independence day rally by his Northern League fell far short of expectations, as an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered on the banks of the Grand Canal here. As the crowd milled below a sea of colorful flags, shopping for Padania memorabilia, the mood was more of a small town party than the beginnings of a separatist rebellion.
The lower-than-predicted turnout for Mr. Bossi's elaborately staged spectacle, which began on Friday with a flotilla down the Po River, did not shield him from attack by a full array of Italian political leaders who have mounted an all-out effort to halt his secessionist bid.
Speaking in the southern city of Bari on the eve of Mr. Bossi's symbolic declaration of independence, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro warned the secessionists: "The state guarantees freedom of expression, but cannot tolerate incitement to illegal acts. A democracy that is afraid to apply the law when the need arises would not be worthy of the name."
And at a counterdemonstration held today in Milan by the far-right National Alliance party, an estimated 150,000 people sang the Italian national anthem after listening to the party leader, Gianfranco Fini, declare: "Italy is here, it will not be insulted, and it will not be divided. Secession and division are an insult to history, and an insult to reason."
The birth of Padania -- the name chosen by Mr. Bossi for an undefined area stretching north of the Po River -- is the latest expression of a protest movement that began in the mid-1980's as a regional revolt against the corruption, mismanagement and inefficiency that for many northern Italians have become synonymous with Italy's central Government.
To listen to Mr. Bossi is to hear how divided Italians remain. He sprinkles his rambling speeches with crude insults against southern Italians, taunting their accents and their economic backwardness. He calls them "mafiosi" and accuses them, and their political patrons in Rome, of dragging Italy down and dashing its hopes of joining a united Europe on an equal footing with France and Germany.
After last spring's parliamentary elections, which saw Mr. Bossi's Northern League win 10 percent of the national vote but as much as 40 percent in some of Italy's richest northern regions, he redefined its goals, moving away from calls for greater federalism to a battle cry for outright independence.
In the weeks building up to today's declaration, Italy's mainstream political leaders struggled to come up with an appropriate response to Mr. Bossi's challenge, alternating between ridicule and alarm.
Even the Roman Catholic Church -- which a century ago was one of the major obstacles to Italy's new-born unification -- weighed in against secession, with a pastoral letter by Milan's popular Cardinal, Carol Maria Martini, branding any attempt to break up Italy "demagoguery and adventurism."
But as many political observers noted in the steady stream of commentary issued in anticipation of Mr. Bossi's next move, the 55-year-old former hospital orderly has succeeded in placing himself at center stage and shaking the political establishment out of its complacency.
In making the argument for a "free Padania," Mr. Bossi and his small circle of advisers have argued that in an era of an increasingly united Europe, regions -- rather than traditional states -- need to be better represented.
The three-day "March to the Sea" began Friday on a high mountain plateau where Mr. Bossi, in one of his symbolic gestures, held high a Venetian-made flask containing water from the source of the Po River, to represent a baptism of Padania.
Like the Northern League's flag, which shows a medieval warrior raising a broadsword against the background of a red-on-white cross, the flask -- and the accompanying emblem of Padania's green six-rayed "Alpine Sun" -- is designed to give his proposed new state the trappings of a mythology.
"These rituals are not about discovering the past, but about building a new identity," said Ilvo Diamanti, a sociologist at the University of Padua and Urbino who has closely followed the emergence of the Northern League.
Mr. Bossi's ambitious 400-mile journey along one of Italy's most historic river valleys was greeted along the banks of the Po, and at various stops along the way, by small bands of enthusiastic supporters, wearing the green shirts of his movement and waving the banners of his cause.
It had its moments of farce, when water levels at one point were too low to keep the Bossi entourage afloat, forcing them to resume part of the trip by car. At another point, lights that were to flash the word Padania onto a night sky failed to turn on.
But judging from the relatively low turnout for his voyage and the rally in Venice, Mr. Bossi may have tried the patience of his supporters, few of whom share his love of medieval legends and theatrical gestures.
"Mr. Bossi has figured out that the only way to get attention is to be outrageous," said Patrick McCarthy, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Bologna. "But Bossi's support doesn't come from people like Bossi."
For the small and medium-sized businesses of northern regions like the Veneto, where Mr. Bossi scored his biggest success in the last elections, Italy's high tax rates and poor public administration have hampered their ability to compete on European markets. Many of them support Mr. Bossi because he was the first Italian politician to promise greater federalism. Since then, federalism has become a widely accepted goal, in particular of Italy's current center-left Government.
But the federalist reforms promised by Prime Minister Romano Prodi have been slow in coming, and many political observers have said Mr. Bossi's latest antics have gained attention, if only because of his opponents' shortcomings.
"The League has to be taken seriously because it belies deep dissatisfaction, particularly of an economic nature," said Prof. Aurelio Lepre, who teaches history at the University of Naples. "Basically the rich north no longer wants to support the poor south, because the north is afraid that it will not be able to enter into Europe. The racist ideology the League has adopted is there to cover economic dissatisfaction. But racism mobilizes people; it gives them a symbolic objective."

HEADLINE: West Coast Naval Base Belatedly Stirs Passions

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., Sept. 12

 BODY:
This past Wednesday, Patricia Fink went through a routine she had followed for four years, locking the door of her office on the elegant, campuslike naval base here, initialing a form against the back of a sailor who had been waiting in the breezeway, then walking toward her car for the ride home.
The only difference was that it was the last time she would make the trip. 
 Ms. Fink, who first saw the base 13 years ago when her father became its commander, was one of many people taking home little more than memories as the once-thriving Long Beach Naval Station, a mainstay of the local economy for five decades, moved closer to being shut down.
The Department of Defense decided to close it as part of a nationwide cost-cutting program, and the ships that had carried sailors to and from wars around the globe pulled out for good last year.
But what has made the experience particularly melancholy for workers and residents is the proposed fate of the historic, 130-acre naval station: the City of Long Beach has been aggressively pushing a plan to raze every structure on the site, including 11 handsome, International style buildings whose designers included Paul Revere Williams, one of the country's most prominent black architects. The site would be paved for a shipping container terminal.
The decision has come as a shock to many people familiar with the site, an oasis of greenery in the middle of the country's busiest commercial port, and it has blown up into a major civic protest, with some people demanding a recall of the Mayor, Beverly O'Neill.
"Economically, they think it's best for the city, but I think it's a shame," said Capt. Joseph Innes, a dentist in the base clinic whose first posting was at Long Beach and who locked up for the last time today. "This was one of the best-kept secrets in the Navy. It was a very nice place. I can't believe they can't use it for a little college campus or something."
For several years now, cities around the country have been forced to deal with base closings and their economic repercussions, a combination of lost jobs and, for creative local governments, new opportunities. But few communities have felt the issues as poignantly as Long Beach, a depressed industrial city of 440,000 just south of Los Angeles.
A hearing on the proposed terminal Wednesday drew several thousand people and dragged on until 1 A.M., with many people hooting derisively as Mayor O'Neill described plans to create what she said would be as many as 650 jobs at the site. No matter that the city is suffering an unemployment rate of 8.3 percent, more than three percentage points higher than the rest of the country.
"I've been in this field 20 years, and this is without a doubt the biggest turnout I've ever seen for something like this," said Cherilyn Widell, the state's historic preservation officer and part of the effort to determine whether the buildings should be saved as architectural landmarks.
What is striking is that residents here seem suddenly energized by a sense of civic pride rather than raw economic need, even though it is pride in a group of structures that few of them had seen or even known of until a few months ago.
Because the base was always closed to outsiders, "we had no idea what was there; no one let us know," said Peter Devereaux, vice president of Long Beach Heritage, an organization that is trying to rescue the buildings. "We had no time to work on any alternative plans."
In fact, opponents of the terminal concede that they do not have a well-thought-out counterproposal, and at the least are asking for more time.
During California's recent recession, Long Beach was betrayed by what had been the two pillars of its economy. The city lost 30,000 aerospace jobs, and then it was hit with the devastating news that the Pentagon was closing the Navy base and several other military installations, with a loss of about 27,000 jobs.
The city has placed its hopes on trade. Long Beach harbor is an endless vista of spindly cranes, bulky vessels and stacks of containers, most bearing the names of Chinese, Korean and other Asian companies.
The port, which is adjacent to its competitor, the Port of Los Angeles, handled the equivalent of 2.8 million 20-foot containers last year, trade valued at $82 billion.
The city's plan is to immediately level everything on the site, not just the Williams buildings, but also the $50 million worth of structures put up in the last decade, including apartment buildings and a medical center. The more than 100 acres of blacktop would then be leased to the China Ocean Shipping Company, which is owned by the Chinese Government.
The city has said that the company is threatening to move if the additional space is not provided. A company official confirmed that it had been wooed aggressively by the Port of Los Angeles and would take the best deal offered.
"I don't think it's any secret that there's a lot of competition from other ports for these jobs," said Jim Hankla, the city manager. "We don't intend to lose them."
The focus of concern is not the whole naval station, but a 60-acre portion known as the Roosevelt Base that was rushed to completion in 1942, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It contains 11 buildings, among them offices and a huge gymnasium, designed by Mr. Williams and another architect, Adrian Wilson.
The base is still in excellent condition, with trimmed lawns, clipped rosebushes and huge ficus and olive trees. One complaint is that destruction of the base would eliminate the habitat for numerous birds, including herons. Ms. Fink said she had rescued perhaps a hundred baby herons that had fallen from nests.
Mr. Williams, who died in 1980, is well known for many local landmarks, including the Los Angeles County Courthouse, a Jetsons-like structure at the Los Angeles airport and homes for celebrities.
The city has said that it will try to preserve the memory of the base buildings by producing a documentary film, ordering some drawings and salvaging some artifacts. The audience at the hearing on Wednesday heckled city officials mercilessly when they described the plan.
The Long Beach port commission, which is proposing to build the new terminal, has made its own peace offering. It said it would donate $2 million toward construction of soccer fields near downtown to make up for the destruction of the recreational offerings at the base, which some residents had proposed turning into a public park. At the hearing, protesters shouted "payoff!" when the offer was mentioned.
"People are looking at the price they are being asked to pay for those jobs, and they think it's too high," Mr. Devereaux said. "People want to be proud of their community, you know."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CONTROVERSIES;
Perot's New Campaign Propels Unanswered Questions Back to Surface

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

 BODY:
Four years after Ross Perot took his first run at the Presidency, a remarkable odyssey that saw him capture nearly one in every five votes cast in the 1992 election, the Texas billionaire is once again a candidate for the White House, atop the ticket of a party he founded and bankrolled.
As he did last time, Mr. Perot has embarked on a campaign that relies on spare public appearances, scripted infomercials and his usual litany of Texas homilies. But his re-entry on the political stage last month also brought a fresh round of something else that marked his last Presidential run: controversy. 
 Within only days of Mr. Perot's official entry into the race for the Reform Party nomination, his chief rival, former Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado, asserted that he had such iron control over the party machinery that the balloting might be rigged.
When the voting was over and Mr. Perot had indeed won handily, Mr. Lamm refused to support his Presidential bid. "I will endorse Ross Perot as a prophet," he said. "I will endorse Ross Perot as Paul Revere. I will endorse him as prescient. I will not endorse him as President."
Although Mr. Lamm did not elaborate on his decision, he is not the first to raise questions about whether Mr. Perot is suited to be President. In the 1992 campaign, Mr. Perot was dogged by questions not only about his temperament, but also about decisions he had made as a politician and, earlier, as a businessman.
Mr. Perot has, his critics say, an inordinate need for control, which is perhaps not unusual for a man who is a self-made billionaire. The critics have also suggested that he has a penchant for intrigue and conspiracy theories, which has at times caused him to threaten those whom he sees as his enemies. They also have questioned whether Mr. Perot has followed and benefited from the same standards of corporate behavior that he has insisted are corrupt and should be changed.
As the Texan runs again for the Presidency, a number of such questions remain:
*Despite railing against the corrupting evils of political donations, Mr. Perot has given many tens of thousands of dollars to political candidates over the years and was once the single largest contributor to Congressional candidates in the nation.
*Even though he has denounced lobbyists in their "alligator shoes," he and his top aides have successfully lobbied to advance his own fortunes; his successes include securing tax breaks for a huge airport project on land owned by his family and fighting off a Texas state plan to cancel a major contract with one of his companies.
*His apparent fondness for hiring private investigators has brought him an unwanted nickname, Inspector Perot, and he has raised eyebrows by detailing conspiracy theories, some involving threats to his own life, like a bizarre and never-proven accusation that a group of Vietnamese-backed Black Panthers had once sneaked onto his property to kill him.
*Perhaps most damaging of all, many voters say they remain deeply bothered by Mr. Perot's abrupt exit from the Presidential race in the summer of 1992, followed by a surprise re-entry and the shocking explanation that he had left in the first place because of a Republican-backed "dirty tricks" campaign to disrupt his daughter's wedding.
*Even as Mr. Perot insisted for nearly three months that he had pulled out of that race, he continued to spend heavily at that time to get his name on the ballot.
Only this week did Mr. Perot choose his Vice-Presidential candidate, Dr. Pat Choate, an economist. So far, public opinion polls suggest that his campaign has not generated the same curiosity or enthusiasm it did four years ago. Various polls show that Mr. Perot is the preference of as few as 4 to 7 percent of the voters, and even his paid television commercials have drawn ratings that are a bare shadow of what his wisecracks, aphorisms and famous charts drew four years ago.
During the political season so far, Mr. Perot has shown no inclination to address the doubts that have been raised about him.
"You can't confront it head on," said Gordon S. Black, a Rochester, N.Y., pollster and informal Perot adviser. "It's sort of like having to say, 'I'm not a liar; I'm not a cheat; I'm not a philanderer.' The very fact you have to do that reinforces the idea that you might be. What is he supposed to say: 'I am not crazy; I am not unstable?' You can't do that."
Gerald Posner, author of "Citizen Perot" (Random House, 1996), a new, unauthorized biography of the Texan, said Mr. Perot "wants to be a sort of climate-controlled candidate." Mr. Posner continued: "He gets short-tempered. He knows he doesn't handle these questions well. So his solution this time is to stay above it all, and nobody yet seems to be raising a ruckus that he isn't really dealing with these issues."
But the questions are there. Here is a guide to many of them, with comments that Mr. Perot has made about them in the past. He declined requests for an interview for this article.

The 1992 Race
Political Decisions And Consequences
On July 16, 1992, still riding high in the polls, Mr. Perot abruptly pulled the plug on his campaign. He said he believed that the Democrats were responding to his campaign themes and that a three-way election would wind up being settled in the House.
Still, he quietly encouraged his volunteers in the next few months to maintain their efforts for him and to get him on the ballot in 50 states. On Oct. 1, he was back in, telling his supporters: "I thought that both political parties would address the problems that face the nation. We gave them a chance. They didn't do it."
About four weeks later, just as he was coming back up in the polls, he went on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" and revealed his reason for getting out in July: what he called a Republican-backed plot to disturb his daughter's wedding in August, in part by creating fake photographs of her that would embarrass her.
"I found myself in a situation where I had three reports that the Republican Party intended to publish a false photograph of my daughter," he elaborated in a speech to supporters, saying the photograph involved a "head on another body" and was to be distributed to supermarket tabloids. "This is one of the most important days of her life, and I love her too much to have her hurt."
The accusation, dismissed by a spokesman for President George Bush as "all loony," was exhaustively researched by reporters and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who were unable to establish a credible basis for it. Mr. Perot admitted on "60 Minutes" that he could not prove the bizarre charge, but he said he had heard it from reliable sources.
The incident is treated at length in Mr. Posner's new book, which says Mr. Perot's chief source for the accusation was Scott Barnes, a twice-dismissed police officer from California whom Mr. Perot had spoken to on the telephone for years about various intelligence matters.
Mr. Barnes now says no such photographs existed. In a recent letter to Time magazine, he expressed remorse over the whole incident and said: "There was never any G.O.P. plot against Perot. It was all a political hoax to remove Bush."
A caller to "Larry King Live" on CNN two months ago asked how people could be sure that Mr. Perot would not suddenly pull out of the race this year. Mr. King, paraphrasing the question, said to Mr. Perot, "If there is a threat again to family, as you perceived the last time, would that cause you----"
"It was not perceived," Mr. Perot interrupted. "I don't want to go into that." He added, "The point is, Larry, can someone just stop and take a few minutes and look at what I have done, night and day, for the last five years?"
The incident hurt Mr. Perot's standing. Newspapers in his home state called him the Yellow Ross of Texas, and Newsweek put him on its cover as "The Quitter," a headline that friends say galls him to this day.

In the Service
Explaining the End Of a Navy Career
Mr. Perot's 1992 campaign was also beset by a controversy over at least three different explanations he gave for abandoning his Navy career in the 1950's.
Mr. Perot unsuccessfully sought an early discharge in 1955, writing to his father that the Navy was a "fairly Godless organization," and that he was offended by "being subjected to drunken tales of moral emptiness" and "seeing promiscuity on the part of married men."
In a 1971 article in The New York Times Magazine, Mr. Perot said he loved the Navy but had wanted to get out because "the promotion system and the seniority system and the waiting-in-line concept were just sort of incompatible with my desire to be measured and judged by what I could produce."
Then, in the midst of the 1992 race, he offered for the first time what he said was the real reason for wanting to leave: He said he had bridled at inappropriate requests for money and liquor from the commander of the destroyer on which he was serving. The commander, in interviews in 1992, called Mr. Perot's assertions "hogwash."
Mr. Perot was subjected to withering criticism that he had changed his story about trying to get out of the service to make it more politically palatable.
But he has ignored the controversy. "It's just another little spitball flying through the air as far as I'm concerned," he said in 1992.

The P.O.W. Issue
Some Friction With Government
Mr. Perot's public and political profile grew over his determined advocacy on behalf of American servicemen believed to be missing in Vietnam.
But while political proponents of the P.O.W-M.I.A. issue hailed the Texan as a hero, Mr. Perot's campaign to take control of the Government's investigation resulted in a bruising confrontation with members of the Reagan Administration in the 1980's, including Vice President George Bush.
Although the Administration had enlisted Mr. Perot's assistance, critics say he soon fixated on the notion that a Government conspiracy was thwarting him. Mr. Perot even argued that his life was in peril from a team of Black Panther assassins hired by Vietnam.
Administration officials say Mr. Perot also used questionable tactics to discredit a chief rival, Richard L. Armitage, a senior Pentagon official who had negotiated with the North Vietnamese about missing Americans and who was once Mr. Bush's nominee for Secretary of the Army.
Using information from several sources, including James (Bo) Gritz, a former Green Beret turned right-wing survivalist and officials of the Christic Institute, a group that supports leftist causes, Mr. Perot served as a conduit for assertions involving Mr. Armitage. Among them, critics say, was information from an undercover police officer in Virginia suggesting that Mr. Armitage's friendship with a Vietnamese-American woman had compromised the Government's effort on behalf of the missing servicemen.
An F.B.I. investigation determined that the accusation and others were unfounded and cleared Mr. Armitage of any criminal wrongdoing. Mr. Perot said he had done nothing improper and had only sought to turn over information of possible illegal activity to criminal investigators.

The Businessman
Knowing How to Push Political Buttons
Critics have also pointed to apparent contradictions between Mr. Perot's political statements and the way he has conducted himself as a titan in the business world.
Mr. Perot's founding of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, or E.D.S., the company that helped turn him into a billionaire, is part of the Horatio Alger cast that Mr. Perot has given to his own life story. The company, formed in 1962, earned a fortune by running computer programs that processed claims for Medicare and Medicaid, the two huge Government insurance programs. The business wound up with contracts with insurers across the nation; as the insurance programs ballooned in size, so did the company's profits.
Mr. Perot's business savvy in setting up E.D.S. is unquestionable. But he was criticized for a long-running feud with Federal regulators over ownership of the E.D.S. software programs that had been developed with Federal money. Mr. Perot basically prevailed, but not without a Congressional investigation into the matter and questions about his company's use of taxpayers' money.
Another episode that raised questions was the brass-knuckle lobbying campaign Mr. Perot waged in 1980 to overturn a decision by a Texas state agency to discontinue using E.D.S. to process its Medicaid claims. The agency initially concluded that an upstart competitor from New York, the Bradford National Corporation, had developed both a cheaper and technically superior program. An outside group of consultants agreed.
The home-state contract covered claims for 700,000 Texans and amounted to about 12 percent of E.D.S.'s earnings. By all accounts, Mr. Perot fought with a vengeance to preserve it.
His company compiled a huge dossier of negative information about its rival that it circulated around Austin, and Mr. Perot at one point referred to one of the officials who had recommended Bradford as "a disturbed individual." According to news accounts, he also said he thought there was a conspiracy afoot among some state officials to make the New York company fail and then take over the processing themselves. The head of Bradford said Mr. Perot and his subordinates had been "watching too many James Bond movies."
Mr. Perot also pulled strings in the Capitol, receiving private hearings with the Governor, the Attorney General and members of the board that was awarding the contract. Former Bradford officials also said in 1992 that they had received harassing anonymous telephone calls during the episode, though they were not able to prove who had made them.
After a tumultuous struggle, Mr. Perot won. He said repeatedly in 1992 that he had fought a tough but fair battle to win back the Texas contract. Nonetheless, the episode received substantial coverage in 1992, with some participants casting Mr. Perot as a ruthless infighter and others saying it showed him to be a master at pulling strings in government.
In addition, Mr. Perot faced inquiries in 1992 about how he had persuaded Federal, state and local officials to grant $200 million in cash and tax breaks for a cargo airport near Fort Worth in the middle of property owned by him and members of his family. Mr. Perot said there had been nothing inappropriate about the breaks; while they may have benefited the Perots, he said, they had also helped bring a business boom to the area.
There were never suggestions that Mr. Perot had done anything illegal in using his close ties to officials to win the tax breaks. More broadly, though, a number of people said in 1992 that the way Mr. Perot had worked the political system contrasted with his claims of being an outsider with disdain for the ways of Washington.
"When Ross Perot influences an issue, it is not lobbying," the acting Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, Barry L. Harris, said in 1992 in reference to the airport matter. "When somebody else does it, it is. Perot has influenced legislators and lobbied as much as anyone else."
During both of his Presidential campaigns, Mr. Perot has bemoaned the influence of money in politics, but Mr. Perot has a history of generous donations to political campaigns. In at least one year, 1974, he gave more than $90,000 to Congressional candidates, making him the largest individual contributor in the country. Among the recipients were 12 members of the House Ways and Means Committee; the next year, 10 of the 12 voted for an amendment to that year's tax bill written specifically for Mr. Perot that granted his business a $15 million tax break. Mr. Perot said at the time that there was nothing hypocritical about playing by the rules, although he believed that the rules should be changed.

Seeking Information
Private Detectives Lead to Controversy
Mr. Perot's predilection for some types of conspiracy theories and his hiring of private detectives were well documented in 1992 and were another point of controversy.
He did not deny that he had hired investigators to look into his business competitors, but, he told reporters in the 1992 campaign, "my total experience of investigating people is like a grain of sand on a large beach compared to the ongoing investigations, day after day after day after day, by the Republican dirty tricks."
Mr. Perot also conceded in 1992 that he had hired private investigators from San Francisco to check into some of his own volunteers. He said he had needed to do so to explore accusations that the workers had misused money or had criminal records.
Other news reports said that Mr. Perot had hired detectives to spy on his own children and their friends and that in one instance, he had tried to dig up information on a daughter's boyfriend he disliked. He said any such cases had been misconstrued. "It is a huge gap between making sure they're safe and investigating my children and/or their friends, or whatever else some fruitcake alleges," he said.
Mr. Perot has also from time to time described elaborate conspiracies aimed at killing him or his family.
Perhaps most vividly, in the third Presidential debate of 1992, he said the Vietnamese hired a group of Black Panthers to kill him in 1969. "The Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed," Mr. Perot told a nationwide audience watching the debate. "The most significant effort they had one night is five people coming across my front yard with rifles."
Mr. Perot later said he had not reported the incident to the police because a guard dog had managed to chase away the would-be assassins. "He worked them like a sheep dog," Mr. Perot explained in 1992.
But several news reports put the whole episode in much doubt. "Listen to me," said Paul McCaghren, the chief of police intelligence operations in Dallas in 1969, to ABC News in 1992. "It didn't happen. It did not happen."
Mr. Perot also suggested that the guard dog had bitten off a major part of one assailant's buttocks, though no hospital in the Dallas area reported treating such a wound at the time.
When reporters questioned Mr. Perot in 1992 about why he could not provide more confirmation of the incident, he said: "I'm not going to get into that with you because it's none of your business. I'm not going to -- hey, look, I don't have to prove anything to you people to start with."
Part of Mr. Perot's fascination with the intelligence field won him plaudits. Many considered him a national hero when he tried to fly into Vietnam in the late 1960's to aid prisoners of war. And his successful organization of a 1979 mission to Iran to rescue two imprisoned employees of E.D.S. became the stuff of a best-selling book, although one over which he had editorial control.
But a few contentious episodes brought less positive headlines for him in 1992. For example, while working on the prisoner-of-war issue in 1987, Mr. Perot unsuccessfully sought to persuade the Reagan White House to begin limited economic relations with Vietnam. Some Reagan Administration officials complained that he had gone to Vietnam for his own business ends, an accusation Mr. Perot heatedly denied. He said he had engaged, at the initiative of Vietnamese officials, only in several "philosophical" talks about American business opportunities in the country.

The Nafta Debate
Accusing Gore Of Cheating
In November 1993, as the Clinton Administration was furiously working to win Congressional approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Perot, an opponent, agreed to debate Vice President Al Gore on "Larry King Live."
The billionaire was on the defensive much of the time, and Mr. Gore goaded Mr. Perot into making disparaging and sarcastic remarks to him, such as: "You're lying -- you're lying now," and, "Please, let's have an unnatural event and try not to interrupt me."
The nationally televised debate caused Mr. Perot's poll ratings to plummet. And news coverage at the time had many people saying that Mr. Perot's impetuous performance made it harder to view him as a potential President.
In Mr. Posner's new book, Mr. Perot is quoted as saying why he thinks Mr. Gore did well in the debate. He says Mr. Gore was wearing a tiny, secret earpiece in his left ear, through which White House aides might have fed him information and debating tips.
"Watch the debate, and you will see that thing twinkle," Mr. Perot is quoted as saying. "Let's say you were being fed good answers, or good questions, or you name it. Don't boast publicly about it because that is cheating. See, the news should have been, 'They cheated.' "
Many people who have reviewed the King show tape, including Mr. Posner, said that light appeared to be glistening on Mr. Gore's left ear but that it looked like a reflection. A spokeswoman for the Vice President recently dismissed the accusation as ludicrous. "Yeah, then Scotty beamed him up to the Starship Enterprise," she said of Mr. Gore. (The Vice President did have a standard earpiece for guests on the show in his right ear.)
A spokeswoman for Mr. Perot's campaign, Sharon Holman, said Mr. Perot had not made a formal accusation of cheating in his comment to Mr. Posner but had merely been repeating "cocktail party chatter" he had heard.

The 1996 Campaign
Questions Get Little Response
Even as this year's Presidential campaign intensifies, Mr. Perot appears to be ignoring questions about these controversies.
"If he buys enough air time this fall, just on the infomercials, and sticks to friendly live television a la Larry King," said Mr. Posner, his biographer, "he thinks he can get his message across and people will say: 'You know what? He doesn't seem so wacky to me.' "
Mr. Black, the Rochester pollster, said Mr. Perot's best strategy was to let his business associates and friends talk about him. Indeed, as was established in 1992, there are many compelling tales of his loyalty and kindness to some of his employees, and of his support for inner-city schools and homeless shelters in Dallas.
In 1992, as reporters asked him about many of the questions discussed here, he responded with colorful, though cryptic, dismissals: "animal crackers," "Mickey Mouse" "tossed salad" and "fairyland."
This time around, in one of the very few times Mr. Perot has had anything public to say about these matters, he took a brief question on ABC's "Good Morning America" the morning after he became the Reform Party nominee. The interviewer said many people "worry that you don't have the temperament to be President" and then asked, "Are you going to try to address that issue at all?"
"Look at who I really am, as opposed to who two dirty-tricks teams for the two parties have tried to recast me to be," Mr. Perot said. "Look at my real life, not what people come up with and the stories they make up. Look at what I have done through my life. Look at what -- how I do conduct my life."

ROSS PEROT
From a discussion of the nation's economic future in a campaign advertisement that was broadcast on Saturday night: 
 "The second solution to restoring our job base is to increase the amount of money that we invest in U.S. manufacturing facilities. This money is typically borrowed by businesses, through banks, from the savings of millions of Americans. The interest rates that businesses are charged determine how much money can be borrowed. The lower the interest rate, the more money a company can afford to borrow to build factories. The interest rate is determined by demand for money. The greater the demand for money, the higher the interest rates.
"The U.S. Government demands a great deal of money each year just to finance deficit spending. If the Government stopped spending more than it takes in, it would not have to borrow any money. Therefore, there would be more money available to borrow, and interest rates would fall. Businesses could afford to borrow more money to invest in their facilities and more jobs could be created in our country.
"We simply must balance the budget so that we can keep the interest rates low for everyone and begin investing in jobs instead of wasting our tax money paying interest on the national debt. Have you had either of the other two Presidential candidates talk to you like this? I don't think so. Their parties created this problem."

THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

 BODY:

Pools and Stars
Come and listen to a story about a man named Bill.
By now, it is well known that President Clinton went to Beverly Hills last Thursday night and picked up roughly $4 million for Democrats at a star-studded fund-raiser. But admit it. What you really want dished up is glitz -- the President's favorite Democratic celebrities, the money, the action at a big Hollywood party. So here goes: 
 The outdoors bash unfolded on the plush (Spanish stucco mansion; pool; tennis court; play area with animal-shaped topiary and a carousel, no less) hilltop estate of Ronald Burkle, owner of the Ralph's Supermarket chain.
About 1,000 people mobbed a $1,000-a-head cocktail reception with the Clintons and other Big Names, among them Rob Reiner, Kevin Spacey, Sharon Stone, Eleanor Mondale, Shirley MacLaine, Joan Collins, Richard Dreyfuss, Carrie Fisher and Calvin Klein. Five thousand dollars bought a concert featuring Chicago, the Eagles, the Neville Brothers, the saxophonist Tom Scott and Barbra Streisand, plus a poetry reading by Maya Angelou.
Paula Poundstone was the house comic. Tom Hanks was the emcee. And this was just the warm-up.
Of the masses, only about 250 made it to the $12,500 dinner. Mr. Clinton saluted Ms. Streisand ("Thank you, Barbra, for being my friend and for sharing your extraordinary gift") and joked that Mr. Hanks's labor had earned him Presidential permission to play the lead in the film version of "Primary Colors," a role Mr. Hanks has turned down.
Then the givers went home. And the recipients celebrated in time-honored Hollywood fashion.
It all ended with a late-night wager between junior White House aides and the President's press secretary, Michael D. McCurry. Mr. McCurry won $100, and presumably a damp ride to the airport, by jumping into the Burkle estate's swimming pool. Fully clothed.
Lucky 15
If anyone wonders why the book version of Bob Dole's economic blueprint, "Trusting the People," costs $15 and had a first press run of 150,000 copies, Jack Kemp says the answer is simple: fate.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Kemp has taken to humoring rally-goers by stating that the Dole campaign is mysteriously and inextricably guided by the number 15. He credits the notion to Mr. Dole, telling Republican legislators last week that his running mate first spotted the conjunction between the campaign's proposed 15 percent tax cut, the 15 on Mr. Kemp's jersey when he played professional football in San Diego and Buffalo, and the '96 election, whose digits can be added to produce the sum of 15.
That's just the start, Mr. Kemp says: The Kemps have 15 children and grandchildren. The first names of Elizabeth Dole and Joanne Kemp, the candidates' wives, together contain 15 letters. So do the names Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
Mr. Kemp draws out the story, piling anecdote atop anecdote until it reaches a pinnacle of silliness that draws a guffaw from even jaded audiences. Unmentioned so far, however, is the latest election poll released last week by ABC News and its "Nightline" program.
Wouldn't you know it: the poll concludes that Mr. Dole trails President Clinton by 15 percentage points.

Spelling Bob Dole
Reason No. 15 to vote for Bob Dole in November: His wit is drier.
Giving out autographs at a rally, Mr. Dole told a supporter that he would bring a distinct advantage to the White House should he be the man signing legislation in the Oval Office next year. "I got a shorter name," he said. "Save a lot of ink. Save money."

Nonpartisan Nabobs
Holy Spiro Agnew: Bucking the trend, a report by a notably conservative media critic concludes that television coverage of the 1996 Presidential campaign may be -- gasp -- more balanced than in many years.
The chairman of the Virginia-based Media Research Center, L. Brent Bozell 3d, released an analysis of network reporting on the Republican and Democratic conventions last week that drew what he called "surprising" conclusions. Among them: the networks labeled Democrats as liberals or extremists more often than they called Republicans conservative or extreme.
Reporters gave Mr. Clinton the liberal tag 16 times but applied the conservative label to Mr. Dole only twice. And while television made scant reference to Whitewater and other Democratic imbroglios, it all but ignored similar controversies in the Republican camp.
The tilt was hardly all Republican, Mr. Bozell's study hastens to add. In the opinion of the study's 10 analysts, the vast majority of questions asked by reporters at both conventions tilted leftward, approaching topics like abortion, welfare and intolerance from a liberal perspective.
Nor does the study necessarily suggest a drift to the right in the broadcast business. The more likely explanation, said the executive director of the research center, Brent Baker, is that reporters are now wielding their liberal biases against both parties and not just the G.O.P.
"They criticized both parties this time for being too conservative," Mr. Baker said. "The bias in how they approach things is still there."
Still, the study's selection of the best convention reporters provides compelling evidence of a world turning upside down. Heading the list, almost impossibly, is Sam Donaldson, the ABC News reporter who was all but a conservative pariah when he covered the Reagan White House.
Mr. Donaldson, the study concludes, "refrained from gratuitous attacks on Republicans" and "offered a balanced appraisal of the party delegates."
Told of the honor, Mr. Donaldson was briefly stunned. "I'll take it wherever I can get it," he said.

Sound Bite
"Most of the stuff that comes and goes in elections is gone like chaff in the wind. It doesn't amount to a hill of beans." -- President Clinton, in St. Louis on Sept. 10, assuring listeners that his stuff is different. MICHAEL WINES

HEADLINE: Study Group Urges Preschool For Every 3- and 4-Year-Old

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
All children need access to two years of high-quality preschool, but publicly funded programs and systems supported by employers or churches are a patchwork that leaves too many children simply marking time waiting for kindergarten, a new report says.
The report, which is to be released on Monday by the Task Force on Learning in the Primary Grades of the Carnegie Corporation, proposes universal preschool to help assure success in school for youngsters. 
 Already 53 percent of the children from age 3 to 5 are in preschool programs. The nation's largest preschool program, Head Start, provides classes for about 800,000 children at a cost of about $3.5 billion a year. At the current birth rate, nearly 7.8 million children would be covered by a univeral preschool requirement, making the potential total cost more than $33 billion a year.
The co-chairwoman of the task force, Shirley Malcom, said today that she was convinced that the goal of universal preschool could become a reality for 3- and 4-year-olds.
"You know, 40 years ago, there was no universal kindergarten either," said Ms. Malcom, who directs education and human resources for the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
The report says preschool programs should not only connect with what parents try to teach their toddlers but with what kindergarten and elementary school teachers will try to accomplish once the child enters school.
Today, Ms. Malcom said, few preschool teachers even talk to kindergarten teachers.
Preschool also should complement after-school programs and what children watch on television or learn on the Internet or at community activities like Scouts, Little League and church, the report says.
"Academic self-image is shaped between the age of 3 and 10," said the report. "Children who take an early dislike to schoolwork or have doubts about their academic worth face disadvantage in all future learning."
The report, which will be considered at a two-day conference in New York that ends on Tuesday, also recommended reallocating resources to proven programs and initiating programs to teach parents in all economic groups how to be effective as their children's first teacher.
"If you have high expectations, and if you have the vision of where you want a child to be at grade 1, 6 and 12, then you have to set the course," said Marlene Guy, principal at Richardson Elementary School in Washington.
"If you have low expectations, that's what you'll get."

HEADLINE: Ford and U.A.W. Optimistic On Reaching an Agreement

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Sept. 15

 BODY:
Negotiators for the United Automobile Workers union and the Ford Motor Company were guardedly optimistic this evening that they could reach a new national labor contract, as work at factories continued despite expiration of the old contract at midnight on Saturday.
While Ford's car and truck assembly lines do not run on Sundays, maintenance workers were on the job today, as were workers at some parts factories with long backlogs. Ford officials said they expected all factories to run normally on Monday. 
 Having warm relations with Ford, the U.A.W. had not threatened to strike if the old contract expired before a new deal was reached.
Negotiators went home at 9 P.M. this evening after agreeing to reconvene on Monday morning. "Things are proceeding well, people just need some rest," Jon F. Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said.
The U.A.W. scheduled a board meeting for Tuesday in the hope that a deal would be completed by then, said a person close to the union who insisted on anonymity.
People with a detailed knowledge of the talks said several important issues were unresolved, including wage increases, the length of the contract and limits on Ford's purchase of parts from low-cost suppliers few of whose workers are unionized.
With negotiations continuing nearly around the clock, exhausted bargainers curled up to sleep on chairs and in hallways through several floors of Ford's headquarters this afternoon. When Stephen P. Yokich, the union president, went outside at 12:30 A.M. on Sunday for fresh air, he carried a plastic bottle nearly full of the unofficial beverage of the talks: Water Joe, which is artesian well water with a wallop of caffeine added.
The union's three-year contracts with the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation also expired at midnight on Saturday, but agreements were reached with both companies on Friday for workers to stay on the job while negotiations continue. Those agreements could be canceled by either side on three days' notice, G.M. and Chrysler officials said. Ford is the nation's second-largest company in sales after G.M.
The union's goal is to persuade G.M. and Chrysler to accept contracts somewhat similar to the new pact with Ford. But while Chrysler is widely expected to do so, G.M. has taken a hard line in negotiations. The world's largest auto maker has higher labor costs than Ford or Chrysler and wants nonunion outside companies to supply a much larger proportion of parts for new cars and trucks.
People close to the union said a strike was possible at G.M. in the autumn, though the union might settle instead for a vaguely worded national contract. The union would then try to work out the details through separate negotiations at more than 100 G.M. factories in the United States. That would leave the union in a position to stage local strikes that could disrupt G.M.'s introduction of new models this autumn.
The Canadian Auto Workers union is negotiating separately with Chrysler. Basil E. Hargrove, the Canadian union's president, said today that Chrysler's latest offers were unacceptable and that his union would was quite likely to go on strike at midnight on Tuesday with no postponements possible. A Chrysler strike in Canada could be serious, halving the company's minivan production and slowing the manufacture of some parts, but the Canadian union has traditionally settled strikes soon after they begin.
Ford and the U.A.W. are using elaborate computer models in the United States this year that allow its negotiators to figure almost instantly the cost of each proposal. The company's current average hourly cost of labor is $40.45, of which $21.79 represents wages, including overtime, while the remaining $18.66 covers health care costs, insurance and payroll taxes like worker's compensation and the employer-paid part of Social Security.
Ford and the union have been arguing over how much the overall hourly labor cost should rise. They have also been arguing over whether this increase should be mostly for wages or for benefits.
Whether the next contract lasts three years, four years or even longer, the union is seeking a 2 percent wage increase every year, in addition to the automatic cost-of-living adjustments workers have received since 1948, people close to the negotiations said. Ford prefers to maintain annual cost-of-living adjustments while giving a 3 percent wage increase in the first year followed by 3 percent bonuses in each successive year -- the same deal that the auto makers won in 1990 and 1993 for three-year contracts.
Bonuses are cheaper than wage increases for the auto makers because they do not permanently raise their labor costs.
Ford and the U.A.W. are also discussing the union's paramount concern this year, protecting the job security of current and future union members. Ford has expressed a willingness to guarantee that it will maintain its employment of union members at close to current levels of 105,000 workers, hiring new workers to replace retirees, people close to the talks said.
But the two sides have been negotiating escape clauses from such a guarantee, including what Ford would do if a serious recession forced it to close many factories. And the U.A.W. still wants a deal that might be accepted by G.M.
G.M. is determined to reduce its work force and expressed a willingness last Tuesday to guarantee current workers' jobs but not to replace them as they retire. G.M. has higher labor costs than Ford or Chrysler, partly because it manufactures a higher proportion of its parts.
All three auto makers two weeks ago discussed a proposal to pay permanently lower wages at any new parts factories they may build or buy. But the U.A.W. has shown little enthusiasm for the idea, and it is not receiving much attention in this weekend's negotiations, people close to the talks said.
The union has also been seeking the right to strike over outside parts purchases even while under contract.

HEADLINE: New Republic And Cuban Agree to Settle Libel Lawsuit

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The leader of the most powerful anti-Castro Cuban exile group in the United States announced yesterday that he had agreed to settle a libel suit against The New Republic for an article in the political weekly magazine that called him a mobster.
 The magazine agreed to contribute $100,000 to the Cuban American National Foundation, or C.A.N.F., for a scholarship and to apologize for an article in the issue of Oct. 3, 1994, about the foundation's chairman, Jorge Mas Canosa. The article was headlined ''Clinton's Miami Mobster.'' 
 The foundation and the magazine said in a joint statement, ''The New Republic regrets its use of the word 'mobster' on the cover of the magazine and in a headline above the article (both of which were the sole responsibility of the New Republic and not the author) and apologizes for any injury or embarrassment that may have been caused to Mr. Mas Canosa or his family.'' 
 Mr. Mas Canosa said at a news conference in Miami, ''I accept with much happiness this $100,000 on behalf of the C.A.N.F.,'' The Associated Press reported. ''I believe this represents a victory for the cause of Cuban freedom and for our community.''
 It was the second legal victory of sorts for Mr. Mas Canosa; in August, Wayne Smith, a former American diplomat in Havana who is now a university professor and a specialist in Cuban affairs, was found to have defamed Mr. Mas Canosa's foundation in a 1992 PBS documentary.
 A copy of the correction to be run in the next issue of The New Republic was attached to the joint statement. It read: ''The New Republic did not intend to accuse Mr. Mas Canosa of being in any way connected to, or engaged in, criminal activity of any kind, nor was its use of the word based on any evidence of criminal activity on Mr. Mas Canosa's part.''
 Floyd Abrams, a lawyer who is an expert on the First Amendment, said on the face of it, the settlement seemed appropriate. ''I'm all in favor of magazines apologizing when they're wrong,'' Mr. Abrams said. ''I think we have too little of that, not too much of it. There is nothing intrinsically troubling about it. If they called him that and they had no basis, then an apology is justified.''
 With the $100,000, the Cuban American foundation said it planned to establish ''The New Republic Scholarship,'' for the education of needy Cuban-American students. 
 As part of the settlement, Mr. Mas Canosa agreed to dismiss his suit against the New Republic and the article's author, Ann Louise Bardach, a freelance writer. The libel suit was dismissed with prejudice, meaning that it can not be refiled. 
 ''The New Republic and Mr. Mas Canosa are pleased to have resolved their dispute,'' the statement said, ''because, although they may have differences, they both have strongly expressed support for policies aimed at bringing an end to the Communist dictatorship of Fidel Castro and bringing democracy to Cuba.''
 Mr. Mas Canosa's exile group lobbied successfully this year for passage of the Helms-Burton Act extending the American economic embargo against Cuba, and the organization is widely regarded as a principal architect of American policy toward Cuba.

HEADLINE: Strike in Philadelphia: What Stopped the Music

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
The central issues in the strike called by the Philadelphia Orchestra on Sunday are those at the heart of virtually all labor negotiations these days: wages, health benefits and pensions. But the flash point was the orchestra's loss of its recording contract with EMI Records last month, followed by management's wish to reduce a guarantee of recording payments that was in the musicians' most recent contract.
With sales in the classical record business flat, particularly in the standard orchestral repertory, other top American orchestras may soon face the Philadelphia's situation. The Cleveland Orchestra, which is also in negotiations, was recently informed by its label, Decca-London, that its recording program would be trimmed. Other label-orchestra relationships seem sound, but executives at major record companies say they have no choice but to pare their projects. 
 The most immediate effect of the strike is the cancellation of the first week of concerts, including the orchestra's season opener tonight and the opening of its regular series at Carnegie Hall next Tuesday. The orchestra's music director, Wolfgang Sawallisch, has kept out of the dispute, as conductors often do. In a brief statement, he said only that he was "very eager to begin making music with our wonderful musicians" and urging both sides to "come to a mutually satisfying agreement so that our concerts can be performed as scheduled." The strike is the orchestra's first since a 58-day walkout in 1966.
With a vote of 100 to 0, the musicians made it clear that they did not consider the contract offered by the Philadelphia Orchestra Association on Friday to be remotely acceptable. The offer includes a proposed wage increase that would give the players a minimum salary of $83,200 in 1999, up from $75,400 this year. The salary is competitive with those of the Chicago Symphony and the New York Philharmonic, the two American orchestras that earn more than Philadelphia, but the players say that givebacks, including the loss of the recording bonus, could mean a net loss for members over the three-year contract.
The musicians blame management for letting the EMI contract slip away and for the lack of interest from other labels.
EMI's decision not to continue recording in Philadelphia has become a symbol of the disarray in the record business. Over the last 20 years, EMI had recorded the orchestra with three music directors -- Eugene Ormandy, Riccardo Muti and Mr. Sawallisch -- as well as several guest conductors. The last time a major American orchestra was dropped by an international label was during a similar slump in the early 1980's, when CBS Masterworks (now Sony Classical) dropped the New York Philharmonic. Although the Philharmonic made recordings for several labels during the 1980's, it did not have a consistent recording relationship until 1991, when Teldec began recording the orchestra with Kurt Masur conducting.
Like virtually all the major labels, EMI is grappling with two interlocking problems. One is that new orchestral recordings are not competing well with less expensive compact disk versions of classic performances from the past, often by the same orchestras and on the same labels. The second, a point about which record companies have complained loudly for two decades, is that musicians' fees have made American orchestras 40 to 50 percent more expensive to record than their European counterparts.
The Philadelphia's loss of EMI and its inability to find a sponsor for its radio broadcasts in recent seasons have led the management to reconsider a provision in the three-year contract that just expired. Called an electronic media guarantee, it promised players a minimum payment, $6,000 this year, for making recordings and radio and television appearances. Until now, this guarantee has cost the management nothing, since EMI's payments covered it. Now management is asking that the guarantee be cut to $2,000 the first year of the contract and negotiated again during the second and third years.
"None of the other 'big five' orchestras have a media guarantee," said Joseph H. Kluger, the orchestra's president, speaking of the orchestras of New York, Chicago, Boston and Cleveland. "They all compensate the musicians for recordings and other activity if it takes place. If the musicians record, they get paid. If not, they don't. This kind of activity is very volatile: it goes up and down based on factors that are out of the control of the orchestras. It is the recording companies who decide whether recordings are made, and how many."
But the musicians fault management for the loss of the the EMI contract, saying that their strike vote is also a no-confidence vote in the administration. They cited other recent problems, including the loss of longtime support from the Pew Charitable Trusts and what they consider management's greater willingness to invest in building a new concert hall than in sustaining the orchestra itself.
"We're not talking mainly about money," said Larry Grika, the chairman of the musicians' negotiating committee. "We're disturbed about management not going after recording contracts. We're known around the world by our recordings, and if we stop making them, that will have a tremendously negative effect on our worldwide tours. When management let our radio broadcasts slide, our national touring dried up. We feel that if they don't have anyone now in management or on the board who can sell us, they should hire someone who has that talent."
Mr. Kluger rejects that analysis. "The big labels -- and we've talked to all of them -- have concluded that the market is saturated at the moment," he said, "and that given the economics of making records, they can't make any money doing it."
Mr. Kluger's alternative is a plan in which the orchestra would make and market its own recordings. Under that arrangement, the players would receive advance payments lower than current union scale, but in return would be paid royalties for the first time. Currently, royalties earned on back catalogue, estimated by the players at about $1.8 million a year, are paid not to the musicians but into the orchestra's endowment and operating budget.
Management sees the plan as a partnership in which both the association and the musicians share the risks as well as the rewards. The players say they are interested.
"But obviously," said Stuart Davidson, the musicians' lawyer and chief negotiator, "there are a million and one technical and logistical questions to be answered about that kind of a plan."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Prices Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in thin trading yesterday, as the day's statistics, -- July business inventories -- had little impact on the market, where traders are looking ahead to the Fed's monetary policy meeting next week.
Traders reported some consolidation and some mild profit taking after subdued retail sales and consumer inflation data sent prices of Treasury securities surging on Friday. 
 The 30-year bond rose 3/32, to a price of 97 20/33 to yield 6.94, down from 6.95 percent on Friday.
According to the Commerce Department, the gain in July retail inventories was the biggest in one and a half years, increasing stocks of unsold goods on the shelves of wholesalers and manaufacturers. Total inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $1 trillion after being revised to show no change in June, down from the one-tenth of 1 percent gain initially reported. Analysts said the July gain was twice what economists had expectated.
Given the lack of major indicators this week, the market is likely to focus on and be vulnerable to rumors and any comments by Fed officials that might shed some light on central bank policy, with next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting looming. "Any hints of that the Fed is more inclined to tighten at the Sept. 24 meeting will lead traders to reconsider their bold move on Friday," said Damon Whelchel, a market analyst with MMS International.
"Like the weather," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors, "the market's view on what the Fed is likely to do on Sept. 24 has fluctuated quite wildly over the past couple of days."
August housing start numbers are likely to be the most important economic releases this week as investors will be watching to see whether some of the nation's most interest-sensitive sectors continues to show signs of a slowdown. "It will be difficult to continue selling the economic slowdown story without at least some signals of a pause or slowdown in the interest-sentive sectors," Mr. Chan noted. He said the consensus was for a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent, his is for a 1.0 percent drop compared with a 1.3 percent fall.
There are a number of speeches taking place this week by Fed officials that could cause the market to react as negatively as it did early last week, including today's talk by the Fed's vice chairwoman, Alice Rivlin, in New York at an Institute of International Bankers meeting. Elsewhere a Fed governor, Susan M. Phillips, is in Washington to testify on the impact on the banking system of the Sumitomo copper trading activities. The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, is speaking at a Conference of Electronic Money on Thursday.
The supply of new Treasury issues this week is thin, with only today's regular weekly bill auction. However, the Treasury will announce tomorrow the size of next week's two- and five-year note auctions. Though the issuance is light this week, corporate and asset-backed activity is expected to remain brisk as issuers try to take advantage of low rates.environment.
Daimler-Benz A.G. plans a United States sale of $500 million in 10-year notes this week, as Ford Motor gears up to sell $1 billion in five-year global bonds.
Yesterday's bill auction saw investor demand perk up after a few weeks of lukewarm interest by investors because of fears that the Fed would raise short-term rates as much as 50 basis points. The average rate for a three-month bill dropped 10 basis points, to 5.07 percent, and the rate for the six-month bills fell 11 basis points, to 5.19 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.718	97.376	Discounted Rate	5.07%	5.19%	Coupon Yield	5.21%	5.40%	High Price	98.721	97.386	Discounted Rate	5.06%	5.17%	Coupon Yield	5.20%	5.38%	Low Price	98.718	97.376	Discounted Rate	5.07%	5.19%	Coupon Yield	5.21%	5.40%	Accepted at low price	74%	29%	Total applied for	$55,130,773	$42,672,735	Accepted	$11,070,369	$11,081,635	Noncompetitive	$1,466,185	$1,259,775	
 
Both issues are dated Sept. 19, 1996. The three-monthbills mature on Dec. 19, 1996, and the six-month bills mature on Mar. 20, 1997.

Dollar Falters as Doubts Grow Concerning Rate Rise by Fed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against other leading currencies as doubts grew about the prospect for a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase next week.
Reports last week on retail sales and consumer prices persuaded many traders that the Fed would refrain from raising rates when officials meet to debate interest-rate policy next Tuesday. 
 "The economic statistics of last week have led people to moderate their expectations of whether or how far the Fed will go in raising interest rates," Dennis Pettit, foreign-exchange manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, said. "That has taken the shine off the dollar a little."
Higher interest rates often help the American currency by making dollar-denominated deposits more attractive to foreign investors.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.5100 German marks, from 1.5134 late on Friday. The dollar slipped to 110.10 Japanese yen, from 110.35 on Friday. The British pound rose to $1.5580 from $1.5535.
 Comments by the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Alexander Trotman, also undercut the dollar yesterday when he said that its recent rise to more than 110 yen was cause for concern for American auto makers.
"At 110 yen for the dollar, we certainly are getting concerned about the comparative costs between the Japanese-built vehicles and American-built vehicles," Mr. Trotman said at a news conference in Detroit.
The dollar has risen 2 percent against the yen and 1 percent against the mark in the last month, bolstered in part by predictions that the Fed would raise rates soon to cool economic growth and quell inflation.
Those expectations were tempered after the Government reported on Friday that retail sales rose only two-tenths of 1 percent and consumer prices just one-tenth of 1 percent in August.
Even so, many traders think the dollar will resume its ascent. "We've got a fairly healthy economy in the U.S. with low inflation," while the economies of Germany and Japan are struggling, said Stephen Flanagan, currency trader at Credit Agricole. "That's a good recipe for a strong dollar."
Moreover, even without a Fed rate increase, American rates are still higher than rates in Germany and Japan.

HEADLINE: Tough New Warning on Diet Is Issued by Cancer Society

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
Just as martinis and steaks seem to be making a comeback, the American Cancer Society, in guidelines released yesterday, warned that eating red meat and drinking even small amounts of alcohol could contribute to certain cancers.
The new warning, along with dietary recommendations, is more specific and tougher than those suggested by the cancer society in 1991 and those published by the Federal Government last January. 
 Cancer, which is expected to be the leading cause of death in the United States by the turn of the century, in part because the incidence of heart disease is declining, is now responsible for 500,000 deaths a year. Of those, one-third can be attributed to smoking and one-third to dietary factors, the society said. The others are caused by various factors, including genetics and occupations.
The society made four main recommendations yesterday, which at first glance appear to be quite similar to current dietary advice of the Government: consumption of a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains; a diet low in high-fat foods, particularly those from animal sources; maintenance of a healthy weight and moderate physical activity for 30 minutes or more on most days, and limited or no alcohol.
The scientific basis for those recommendations, the guidelines say, "is very strong for cancer at many sites," particularly gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.
In the details, however, the guidelines are very different from those provided by the Government, and some health experts attribute that difference to the pressures that are brought on the Government by groups that could be hurt financially. Dr. Marion Nestle, chairman of the advisory committee that developed the guidelines for the society, and chairman of the department of nutrition and food studies at New York University, said the advice came from a group that had no other agenda than "helping people prevent, treat and cure cancer."
Dr. Meir Stampfer, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the cancer society, unlike the Federal Government, "is in a position to make guidelines based more strictly on science." The Government, said Dr. Stampfer, who was not a member of the panel, "is subject to economic pressure as well as scientific pressure."
There are two main areas of difference between the Government and the cancer society. The Government recommends eating lean meat and limiting consumption of high fat processed meats like sausage and salami. The society recommends curtailing all red meat, not just high-fat meat. It links consumption of red meats to colon and prostate cancer. Meat is generally high in fat and high-fat diets have also been associated with an increased risk of rectal and endometrial cancer.
Obesity is also a cancer culprit. The society criticized high-calorie fat-free processed foods for contributing to overweight and said obesity had been associated with colon, rectal, prostate, endometrial and kidney cancers, and among post-menopausal women, breast cancer. As an alternative to red meats, the society recommended beans, seafood and poultry, saying, "Use meat as a side dish rather than as the focus of a meal."
On alcohol, the cancer society acknowledged that studies showed a decreased risk of coronary heart disease among middle-aged adults with moderate intake of alcohol, and it suggested that for men over 50 and women over 60 the "cardiovascular benefits may outweigh the risk of cancer."
Otherwise it disagreed with the Federal dietary guidelines that say "one or two drinks daily appear to cause no harm to adults." The society noted that the "cancer risk increases with the amount of alcohol consumed and may start to rise with intake of as few as two drinks a day," or 24 ounces of beer, 10 ounces of wine and 3 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits.
The society said that studies also noted an association between increased risk of breast cancer and the consumption of "just a few drinks per week" and suggested that women who are at an unusually high risk for breast cancer "might reasonably consider abstaining from alcohol."
Representatives of both the meat and wine businesses took exception to the advice.
"It is inappropriate to indict meat," said Dr. Janet William, the vice president of scientific and technical affairs for the American Meat Institute, a trade group. "The document is not consistent with U.S. Dietary Guidelines."
Citing several studies, John De Luca, president of the Wine Institute, an industry trade association, said that wine should not be lumped together with other alcoholic beverages. Mr. De Luca said that studies had indicated that moderate consumption of wine might reduce the risk for breast cancer.
But Dr. Stampfer said that the alcohol guidelines were reasonable for a group focused on cancer.
"We know lots of way of reducing the risk of heart disease without alcohol," he said. "For subgroups at high risk for breast cancer, why drink?"
Dr. Rachel Ballard Barbash, chief of the applied research branch at the National Cancer Institute, said, "This committee is in a very different position from a Federal committee" in that it deals only with cancer.
The guidelines emphasize, at every opportunity, that there is little or no evidence that supplements like beta-carotene, vitamins A, C and E, calcium, fish oils or garlic reduce the risk of cancer in humans.
The guidelines also answer frequently asked questions: There is no increased risk from artificial sweeteners, coffee, fluorides, irradiated foods, food additives or food substitutes, with two exceptions. Nitrites can be converted to carcinogenic nitrosamines in the stomach, which may increase the risk of gastric cancer. And olestra, the fat substitute produced by Procter & Gamble, was described by the society as worrisome because it reduces the absorption of fat-soluble substances that are potentially protective. But the overall effect on cancer risk is unknown.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Prices Drop Sharply On Talk of Extra Saudi Output

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The prices of crude oil futures and most other energy products fell sharply yesterday on a report that the Clinton Administration had asked Saudi Arabia to raise its output while Iraq remains barred from the world petroleum market.
Among other commodities, natural gas futures rose sharply, while grain and soybean futures prices fell. 
 Crude and oil products faced heavy selling pressure all day, reflecting talk in the market that the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf would not be affected by tensions between the United States and Iraq.
Prices weakened further late in the session on a report by Dow Jones Telerate that the United States had asked Saudi Arabia to raise crude oil production above the current ceiling of eight million barrels a day.
Saudi Arabian officials denied the report after trading had ended, as did a spokesman for the Energy Department in Washington.
"There's no substance behind that rumor," Bill Wicker, the spokesman, told Bloomberg Business News.
But investors speculated that President Clinton, during an election year, was trying to keep energy prices relatively low.
"The market is nervous enough about Iraq right now to react to any rumor that could be legitimate," said Tim Evans, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group.
Crude oil for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $1.32, to $23.19 a barrel; October heating oil fell 2.65 cents, to 65.29 cents a gallon, and October unleaded gasoline fell 1.73 cents, to 62.87 a gallon.
But natural gas rose sharply as stocks remained 20 percent below the levels of a year earlier. October natural gas rose 10.9 cents, to $19.73 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade as forecasts called for moderate temperatures through the end of the month, aiding the harvest.
December wheat fell 7 cents, to $4.17 a bushel; December corn fell 7 cents, to $3.145 a bushel, and November soybeans fell 9 cents, to $7.93 a bushel.

At Micro Craft Inc., contrasting the Republicans' idea of supply-side economics to balance the budget with the Administration's approach:
"One of the most articulate critics of that misguided philosophy in the Republican Party was Senator Dole, when he was in the Senate. He used to make jokes about it. He used to say, 'Aww, that's a terrible philosophy,' and 'How could they be so irresponsible?' 
 "Well, he said that all the way right up to the summer and all of a sudden, he adopted it, and now, he's proposing a huge tax cut that's not paid for that would require deep cuts in science, technology, Oak Ridge, Medicare, education, the environment. . . .
"Let's have a tax cut, yes, but let's have a smaller tax cut that is targeted to people who need it that gives a tax deduction for $10,000 tuition paid by families to send their children to college. Let's have a tax break for the middle-income families that have expenses in raising their children. . . . And then let's pay for every penny of that tax cut as the President says, line by line, dime by dime. That's the better approach."

HEADLINE: Ohio Edison Plans to Buy Another Utility For $1.6 Billion

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
In the utility industry's latest merger deal, the Ohio Edison Company said yesterday that it would buy the Centerior Energy Corporation in a $1.61 billion stock swap to create the nation's 11th-largest investor-owned utility, serving 2.1 million customers in Ohio and western Pennsylvania.
Utilities are seeking to cut costs and widen their service areas in preparation for deregulation and increased competition. With each new merger, pressure has built on many utilities, particularly weak ones, to find partners to stay competitive. 
 In this case, Ohio Edison, a financially strong utility based in Akron, Ohio, is taking on a weaker one. Centerior Energy, based in Independence, Ohio, has high rates and has had to cut its dividend to help pay for its heavy investment in nuclear plants.
Penelope Adelmann, a utility analyst for Gruntal & Company, said that "Ohio Edison is doing the state of Ohio a favor by taking over Centerior."
"Centerior has some good people," she added, "but they have not been able to find their way out of their financial difficulties."
Wall Street agreed. Centerior shares rose $1.625 to $9.25 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, in part because many investors had believed that Centerior would not be able to find a stronger utility to help it out of its troubles. Ohio Edison shares fell $1, to $19.75, in Big Board trading.
The two companies said they would form a holding company called the First Energy Corporation. They estimated that they would save about $1 billion during the next 10 years, in part by eliminating about 900 jobs. The two utilities employ a total of 11,000 workers.
Willard R. Holland, the president and chief executive of Ohio Edison, who will become chairman, president and chief executive of the new holding company, said that "by sharing our employees' skills and each company's best practices, the combination will also enable us to realize substantial economic synergies that will further enhance our cash flow and efforts to accelerate debt reduction."
Robert J. Farling, the chairman, president and chief executive of Centerior Energy, said, "Our alliance will provide customers and shareholders with more value and our employees with more opportunities than would be possible if we did not join forces." Mr. Farling will be vice chairman of the holding company.
Mr. Holland said that Ohio Edison would extend a rate freeze to 2005 for the two utilities owned by Centerior Energy, Toledo Edison and the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. In 2006 there would be a rate reduction of about 15 percent.
Robert S. Tongren, a spokesman for a group that represents residential power customers, said that the "proposed rate freeze through 2005 did not provide a benefit to Centerior customers who are paying rates that are already too high." He said that the group would support the merger only if there were immediate rate cuts for the residential customers of Centerior Energy.
Both utilities have nearby rivals. The American Electric Power Company, a huge utility in southern Ohio, has many coal-fired plants that produce cheap power.
As states begin to open their energy markets to allow outsiders to sell power to customers, such low-cost producers will be in a strong position to raid customers, particularly large industrial users.
Some large customers have been able to get big reductions of rates from utilities like Centerior and Ohio Edison. This has reduced revenue and made it difficult to bring down rates for smaller energy users.
The merger, which is expected to be completed by the end of 1997, is contingent on the approval of shareholders and Ohio and Federal regulators.
Ohio Edison shareholders would receive one share of First Energy common stock for each share of Ohio Edison common stock. Centerior energy stockholders would receive 0.525 share of First Energy common stock for each share of Centerior common stock.
The combined annual revenue of the two utilities will total about $5 billion and their assets will be worth about $20 billion. The companies said that the initial annual dividend of First Energy was expected to be $1.50 a share, the same rate that is now paid by Ohio Edison.
Centerior Energy serves more than one million customers mostly in northern Ohio. Ohio Edison and its subsidiary, the Pennsylvania Power Company, serve 1.1 million customers in northeastern and central Ohio and western Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Has Kemp to Dinner. Is It Just a Flirtation?

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
A remarkable thing happened last night on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's front porch. Without raising an eyebrow of protest -- in fact, while actually grinning -- the Mayor allowed a national political candidate to make a partisan statement at his side.
"Kemp and Dole have come alive in New York City," said Jack F. Kemp, the Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, boldly sloganeering only inches away from a Mayor who has become famously disdainful of partisanship. Mr. Giuliani even stood by beaming as the candidate accused the Clinton Administration of having abandoned America's inner cities, and he did not rush to even the balance by putting in a kind word for the President, as he often does. 
 Finally, outside his own home, the Mayor who has raised political coyness to an art form actually allowed his hand to become entwined with Mr. Kemp's and then lofted above their heads in what might appear -- with any other mayor, in any other town -- to be a gesture of victory, or at least political alliance. Then they went inside Gracie Mansion and shared a meal of lobster and pasta in saffron sauce.
So does that mean the circle dance around the Mayor's endorsement is over? Has the endless tease that bathed Mr. Giuliani in a glow of neutrality come to a close with a concession to his own party? Certainly not. Or at least, not yet. Aides to both men insisted there was absolutely nothing political involved -- just a couple of old friends kicking around some policy ideas.
"I know you're going to read something into this," said Cristyne F. Lategano, the Mayor's communications director, "but you shouldn't. It's a frank discussion of urban policies about crime and drugs and privatization. And also they're just catching up on what's been happening in each other's lives."
But for Mr. Giuliani, a stray Republican who spends most of his time outside the party fold, Mr. Kemp may represent the path of return. No meeting with a national candidate seven weeks before Election Day is entirely unpolitical, and the Mayor's decision to dine with Mr. Kemp follows weeks of signals that he is increasingly pleased with the direction of the Republican ticket.
True, the two men have known each other for years, and Mr. Kemp campaigned for the Mayor during the last election. It was Mr. Kemp who asked for last night's dinner, not the other way around. Wayne Berman, the political director for the Kemp campaign, said that while the campaign would love to receive the Mayor's endorsement, the dinner was nothing more than a "door-opening move."
But part of the friendship between the two men is based on a shared belief in the value of tax cuts to stimulate the economy, on an interest in the fate of cities not always shared by other Republicans, and on a rejection of the party's more extreme anti-immigration wing.
Repeatedly over the last few weeks, Mr. Giuliani has praised Bob Dole's selection of Mr. Kemp as his running mate, and has gone out of his way to compliment the Republicans on the moderate shine reflected from their San Diego convention.
"I thought the Republican convention was inclusive," the Mayor said earlier this month. "And I thought particularly, if you look at the speeches that were made in comparison with four years ago, there was a tremendous difference. I'm also encouraged by the fact that Colin Powell not only made a speech at the convention, and I thought an excellent one, but also is campaigning with Senator Dole, which I think shows real historic movement in the Republican Party."
For Democratic operatives, last night's huddle -- which included William Bennett, vice chairman of Mr. Dole's campaign, and Peter J. Powers, Mr. Giuliani's closest adviser -- was a strong indication that the Mayor is moving toward an endorsement of the Republican ticket. Many of them, in fact, are openly hoping Mr. Giuliani will make such a move. Given President Clinton's popularity in New York -- and the fact that the Mayor's endorsement has almost never been much help to candidates in the past -- they feel Mr. Clinton can do without it. And they would rather not see the Mayor gain any benefit among city Democrats, as he did with his renegade cross-endorsement of Mario M. Cuomo, the ultimate Democrat, for governor in 1994.
"It is clear the Mayor, by bringing Kemp to Gracie Mansion, is at least flirting with his own Republican roots," said Henry A. Sheinkopf, a Democratic media consultant. "He knows his party will kill him if he doesn't endorse Dole, and Kemp is his excuse for going there."
But Republican regulars, knowing better than to predict Mr. Giuliani's erratic political course, are counting on nothing.
"They're just old friends," said Thomas V. Ognibene, the Republican minority leader of the City Council, speaking of the dinner partners. "I'd love to see him endorse Bob Dole, but frankly, I have no idea what he's going to do."

HEADLINE: New York's Welfare Challenge

 BODY:
With more than two million New Yorkers receiving public assistance, Gov. George Pataki and the Legislature in Albany face one of the toughest challenges ever to confront the state's government. Now that the bitter battle over welfare reform has been settled by President Clinton's signature, critics and advocates of change must work together to fashion a new system that softens the law's harshest blows to the poor without bankrupting the state. They have only about six months to transform welfare as we know it into something other than a nightmare for recipients and government officials alike.
The welfare overhaul enacted in Washington ends the 61-year-old guarantee of assistance for eligible mothers and children, replacing it with a block grant that the states may use to devise programs of their own. The law also imposes stringent new work requirements on most welfare recipients and cuts back sharply on food stamps and aid to legal immigrants. A bipartisan task force created by Mr. Pataki and headed by his budget director, Patricia Woodworth, has only begun assessing its immediate impact. 
 A few guiding principles would help the task force in its difficult assignment. The first would be to resist the temptation to cut welfare benefit levels, as Mr. Pataki has advocated in the past. The argument has always been that New York's generous benefits draw welfare recipients from other states, an argument that will be intensified if other states start cutting benefits. But the grant level of $577 for a family of three is well below the poverty line and should be kept intact.
The second guiding principle is that Mr. Pataki should begin preparing New Yorkers for the likelihood that welfare "reforms" will probably cost money, at least in the short run. First, the state has to make a considerable investment in computerizing all its records. Right now it does not even know how long welfare recipients actually stay on the rolls over their lifetimes. Before welfare reforms are instituted next July 1, Albany has to have a system enabling the state to know which families are in danger of being cut off and when.
New York State faces a budget deficit in the next year estimated at $3 billion. The new law does not require states to spend money to help people find jobs, but Mr. Pataki must join with respected community organizations to find ways of insuring that day care, job training, supervision, transportation and other forms of assistance will be available to those who need it.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's experience in New York City is instructive. His administration has achieved considerable success with workfare programs, which will now be required for 25 percent of all beneficiaries in the first year. The Mayor's office estimates that the city will have to spend as much as $100 million more to meet the new law's targets.
New York City and the state may get one benefit from the new law. The state's welfare caseload has gone down in the last few years, in part because the economic boom has lured welfare recipients into the work force and in part because of a crackdown on fraud and abuse. But the block grant provided to the state is to be based on caseload levels going back to 1992, meaning that there may be some extra money to channel into programs that put people to work.
A final guiding principle is to do something about the legal immigrants who are aged, blind or disabled and who are to be thrown off welfare under the new law. Punishing legal immigrants never had anything to do with the work incentives and requirements that most people associate with improving welfare. Yet City Hall estimates that it could cost $100 million to hold them harmless under the new law. All the elected leaders of the city and state should be at the forefront of reversing that particular injustice in the new law and, if necessary, studying the feasibility of using local resources to help those people certain to suffer under it.

HEADLINE: The Best Pennant Race Money Can Buy

 BODY:
The New York Yankees have tumbled since mid-July, depressing their fans and delighting their enemies. The happy result is a delectable three-game September showdown with the Baltimore Orioles this week at Yankee Stadium. While the Yankees were slumping, the Orioles were winning. As the weeks passed the Yankee lead over the Orioles in the American League Eastern Division dwindled from a July high of 12 games to just 3 as of this morning.
As fans savor tonight's pitching matchup between David Cone of the Yankees and Mike Mussina of the Orioles, they will be watching the best pennant race money can buy. George Steinbrenner and Peter Angelos, the owners of the Yankees and Orioles respectively, can claim not only two of baseball's best lineups, but the two biggest payrolls in the big leagues. Mr. Steinbrenner is dishing out $59 million this year, Mr. Angelos $55 million.
It is pointless to wish for a return to a simpler time. For one thing, such nostalgia conveniently overlooks the fact that with a few exceptions like Babe Ruth, the great players of earlier eras were grossly underpaid by miserly owners who ran professional baseball like a plantation. Many of today's owners wish they still could. The charming verities of baseball, from its arcane rules to its sunny heroes, were never the whole story about a game that has long been a big business. 
 Still, there is a prefabricated feeling to baseball these days that makes it harder for fans to develop team loyalty. Teams like the Yankees and Orioles seem to be shuffled so often by their owners that they are barely recognizable from one season to the next. Players are the beneficiaries, which is fair enough in a market economy, but owners like Mr. Steinbrenner and Mr. Angelos play the market so fast they neglect the importance of identity and continuity, which help tie a team to a community.
There was something reassuringly predictable about the championship Yankee roster of 35 years ago. Fans who followed the team then can still tick off many of the names from memory: Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard, Bobby Richardson, Tony Kubek, Clete Boyer, John Blanchard, Bill Skowron and Whitey Ford.
These days the only Yankee sure to be back in future seasons is George Steinbrenner.

HEADLINE: McGeorge Bundy Dies at 77; Top Adviser in Vietnam Era

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
McGeorge Bundy, an influential foreign policy adviser to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson who was a forceful advocate of expanding American involvement in the Vietnam War, died yesterday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 77 and lived in Manchester-by-the-Sea, north of Boston.
The cause of death was a heart attack, said a spokesman for Harvard University, where Mr. Bundy served as dean of the faculty of arts and sciences before joining the Kennedy Administration in 1961 as national security adviser. 
 A descendant of the Boston Lowells on his mother's side, a product of Groton, Yale and Skull and Bones, and a Harvard dean in his early 30's, Mr. Bundy was the very personification of what the journalist David Halberstam, in the title of his 1969 book, labeled "The Best and the Brightest": the well-born, confident intellectuals who led the nation into the quagmire of Vietnam.
After leaving Government in 1965, Mr. Bundy became president of the Ford Foundation, serving until 1979. He was then a professor of history at New York University for 10 years. In 1990, he joined the Carnegie Corporation of New York. He was chairman of its committee on reducing the danger of nuclear war and was its scholar-in-residence at the time of his death.
"He was a man of notable brilliance, integrity and patriotic purpose," said the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who served in the Kennedy White House with Mr. Bundy and counted him among his oldest friends.
As national security adviser to two Presidents, Mr. Bundy played a role in the Cuban missile crisis and other major foreign policy decisions, but he is most remembered for his role in enlarging United States involvement in Vietnam. In 1965 he predicted that if South Vietnam, the American ally, fell, "there would be a great weakening in the free societies in their ability to withstand Communism."
A visit to Vietnam that year, in which he saw the bloody results of combat at Pleiku, only strengthened his view, resulting in a pivotal memorandum calling for a policy of "sustained reprisal," including air strikes.
In Washington, as throughout his life, he was noted for his brisk intellect and self-assurance. Journalists at the time overworked adjectives like "brilliant" and "aggressive."
Louis Auchincloss, the lawyer and author whose novels chronicled the upper classes, recalled of his Groton schoolmate that "he was ready to be dean of the faculty at Harvard when he was 12 years old."1
 
From a Family Of Prominence
McGeorge Bundy was born in Boston on March 30, 1919, the youngest of five children of Harvey Hollister and Katherine Lawrence Putnam Bundy. His prominent family had a long tradition of public service.
His father was a noted lawyer who had once been secretary to Oliver Wendell Holmes, was Assistant Secretary of State from 1931 to 1933 and was a special assistant to the Secretary of War from 1941 to 1945.
His mother was a Lowell, the descendant of John Amory Lowell, one of Boston's most powerful men of the 19th century, credited with picking at least six presidents of Harvard. Mr. Bundy's maternal grandfather, A. Lawrence Lowell, served as president of Harvard from 1909 to 1933.
Mr. Bundy was educated, along with the young John Kennedy, at the private Dexter elementary school in Brookline, Mass. At Groton, he played the lead role in a production of "Henry V."
At Yale, he was first in his class, Phi Beta Kappa, and a member of the secret society known as Skull and Bones, despite a controversial editorial he wrote for The Yale Daily News calling for the abolition of the football team.
His undergraduate degree was in mathematics, but on graduation he was named a junior fellow in Harvard's Society of Fellows -- envisioned as scholars so pure they do not acquire advanced degrees -- and he switched his field to international relations.
But war was breaking out in Europe, and the extremely nearsighted Mr. Bundy memorized the eye test chart in order to join the Army. He rose from private to captain, serving on the staff of the planners of the invasions of Sicily and France.
After the war, he was an assistant to Henry L. Stimson, who had served as Secretary of War under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1940 to 1945, collaborating with Mr. Stimson on his autobiography, "On Active Service in Peace and War," published in 1948.
A registered Republican, Mr. Bundy was recruited to advise Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, who ran unsuccessfully against President Harry S. Truman in 1948. He rejoined the Harvard faculty as a lecturer in government in 1949 and quickly began rising through the academic ranks.
He was named dean of the faculty of arts and sciences on Sept. 1, 1953. He was known as an anti-bureaucratic innovator, favored by students and faculty members, a man who made academic reforms and encouraged students to do independent study outside traditional academic formats.
And with the help of his colleagues, Professor Schlesinger and the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, became close to another Harvard man, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the ambitious Senator from Massachusetts.
 
To Washington, And Into a War
When Mr. Kennedy took office in January 1961, there was a widespread, hopeful sense of a new generation come to power, a new beginning for the country. But within a few years, the country would be deeply, bitterly divided over Vietnam.
When Mr. Bundy arrived in Washington that year, Mr. Halberstam would write later, he was "perhaps the brightest star in the galaxy of brilliant young men who were going to change the course of the country, his reputation was above all else for his intellectual brilliance."
Mr. Bundy survived the transition to President Johnson after Kennedy's assassination, becoming, from his custom-paneled White House basement office, one of the central players in the evolving Vietnam debate, in large part because of his mastery of memo writing.
In 1965, Max Frankel described him in The New York Times Magazine this way:
"He is a man of sharp -- often acid -- brilliance, lean and trim of body and mind and almost collegiate at 46, agile, combative and confident, on the tennis court and in intellectual volley. He eats, drinks, dances, plays and, above all, speaks briskly; some say tartly."
As with many in Washington in those cold war years, he focused on military strength, writing once in a book on Dean Acheson, perhaps the quintessential cold warrior: "Very near the heart of all foreign affairs is the relationship between policy and military power."
In an analysis of the Kennedy years in the magazine Foreign Affairs, he wrote, "Nothing is more dangerous to the peace than weakness in the ultimate deterrent strength of the United States."
The article continued, "As important as having strength is knowing how to use it."
The concern seemed to become personal with his visit to Pleiku, which resulted in his writing a policy memorandum that is one of the pivotal documents of the American escalation recorded in the Government's secret history of the war, which became known as the Pentagon Papers when published by The New York Times in 1971.
"We believe that the best available way of increasing our chance of success in Vietnam is the development and execution of a policy of sustained reprisal against North Vietnam -- a policy in which air and naval action against the North is justified by and related to the whole Vietcong campaign against violence and terror in the South," the memorandum, dated Feb. 7, 1965, said.
"We cannot assert that the policy of sustained reprisal will succeed in changing the course of the contest in Vietnam," it went on to say. "It may fail and we cannot estimate the odds of success with any accuracy -- they may be between 25 percent and 75 percent. What we can say is that even if it fails, the policy will be worth it. At a minimum it will damp down the charge that we did not do all that we could have done, and this charge will be important in many countries, including our own. Beyond that, a reprisal policy -- to the extent that it demonstrates U.S. willingness to employ this new norm in counter-insurgency -- will set a higher price for the future upon all adventures of guerrilla warfare, and it should therefore somewhat increase our ability to deter such adventures."
 
After Government, The Ford Foundation
Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, in his recent book "In Retrospect" (Times Books, 1995), recalls Mr. Bundy recommending "graduated and sustained bombing" and even at one point suggesting that the United States might gain ground in negotiations by threatening to use nuclear weapons.
But, finally, Mr. Bundy left the Administration, and Mr. McNamara writes: "I speculate the true reason was his deep frustration with the war. I believe he was frustrated not only with the President's behavior but also with the decision-making process throughout the top echelons in both Washington and Saigon."
After he resigned from the Government in December 1965, largely because he could no longer accommodate himself to President Johnson's style of dealing with his advisers, Mr. Bundy became president of the Ford Foundation.
He pushed the foundation into a new emphasis on race relations, and became embroiled in New York City's battle over decentralization of city schools, which was opposed by the powerful union the United Federation of Teachers. But by 1974, Ford had to cut back many of its programs because of financial difficulties.
Susan B. Beresford, the president of the Ford Foundation, said that Mr. Bundy provided leadership "in such crucial areas as civil rights, overseas development, family planning, security and arms control, and education."
Mr. Bundy, recalling his Government service years afterward in "Danger and Survival: Choices About the Bomb in the First 50 Years" (Random House, 1988), did not dwell extensively on Vietnam.
"The war was polarizing to American opinion in ways that were certainly not foreseen by Lyndon Johnson and those like me who supported him in the basic decision he made in 1965," Mr. Bundy wrote. "If Johnson could have carried the country with him, I believe he would have made the Vietnam War larger in the hope of making it shorter."
The New York Times described the book, which was a finalist for a National Book Award, as "a detailed, rigorously documented history and analysis of the political decisions in many countries that shaped the nuclear era."
Mr. Bundy is survived by his wife, Mary Buckminster Lothrop, whom he married in 1950; four sons, Stephen McGeorge, of Berkeley, Calif., Andrew, of Watertown, Mass., William, of Northampton, Mass., and James, of New York City, and six grandchildren. He is also survived by two brothers, Harvey, of Manchester, Mass., and William, of Princeton, N.J., and two sisters, Harriet B. Belin of Cambridge, Mass., and Katherine L. Auchincloss of Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J.

Patron Saint Of Street Fairs Marches In

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman 

 BODY:
NO denying, there was a familiar hubbub on Mulberry Street as the feast honoring San Gennaro, patron saint of Naples, enjoyed what the Mayor assures us was its first mob-free weekend in a long time. But con tutto rispetto, as they would say in Naples, with all respect, the annual street fair had that look of faded grandeur Neapolitans know all too well.
Let's not even get into the quality of the air, a greasy gauze from all the burned sausage, enough grease to put a few thousand cardiologists' kids through college. Actually, that was the good news at the fair. At least it was a reaffirmation of street life. 
 Talk to the vendors, and what you mostly heard was one long lament about how the zip had gone out of the zeppole, how the mob -- and by that they meant visitors to Mulberry Street -- was much smaller than last year. It was like listening to Harry Hope's barflies grousing in "The Iceman Cometh" about how Hickey took the life out of the booze.
Who was Hickey for them? Look no further than Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who stood accused of driving the crowds away. The racket-buster at City Hall was described with so many expletives that blue-penciling them all would make any sentence of direct quotations look like a bar code. "Who wants to come all the way down here just to have a bunch of cops in their face?" a sausage vendor said (after the elimination of only a few unprintable words).
NOT everyone was down on the Mayor. "Mr. Giuliani has nothing to do with it," said Luckie Charlie Lanigan, in between asking strollers to try their luck at throwing baseballs through a circle. Bob Dole may be happy to hear that, as far as Lucky Charlie is concerned, the economy is not doing so hot, that "people just don't have enough to go around after paying the rent."
But to a souvenir seller named Salvatore, the problem with the 70-year-old feast is the feast itself. "Before, it was the octopus," Salvatore said in Italian, using a word that often means the mob as a many-tentacled creature. "Now, it's the bureaucracy. It's all the same. What's really wrong is the quality of the whole thing. It's pretty low."
Low and, increasingly, not really part of the neighborhood. Let's face it, there is no Little Italy anymore. It's more like Minuscule Italy, a shrunken enclave of passable restaurants in a widening China sea. Even during the biggest festa of the year, you heard not a single tarantella on the street, only heavy metal tapes. "It's lost its whole meaning of Little Italy and the Italian culture," said Amy Rafano, who had returned briefly from Rhode Island after a few years away from Mulberry Street.
The same could be said about many, if not most, of the 400 or so large street fairs held across the city each year. Scores of them in Manhattan alone lost their true community roots long ago, no matter how much money they may still raise for worthwhile nonprofit groups. Traffic backs up badly on surrounding streets. Avenues that could benefit from a touch of weekend calm, a precious but rare commodity in New York, never get a chance to catch their breath.
WORST of all, many fairs have become thumping bores. How huge can the appetite be for the same portable collections of tube socks, leather bags, "Aladdin" videotapes and plants from Florida that start to die four days after you take them home? Even Mort Berkowitz, who makes his living organizing fairs in Manhattan and defends them as a way for people to meet their neighbors or perhaps just dance the macarena, agrees that street fests no longer have "the same vitality" as those of yore.
No wonder the Giuliani administration has cracked down, trimming the larger gatherings and outright denying requests for "multiblock permits" in about 100 cases. "It's worked well," Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said yesterday, adding that the policy would be re-examined, and the regulations possibly tightened still further, once the fall street-fair season ends.
Maybe he could also think up ways to give new life to the granddaddy of fairs, the San Gennaro feast, so that it can recapture some flavor of the old neighborhood. For instance, instead of the Drown the Clown game, in which players try to drop a guy into a barrel of water, you could have Dunk the Punk.
Why not start with the man labeled by some the world's dumbest crook? He's the mugger who recently robbed the mother of Chin Gigante, the supposed head of the Genovese crime family, which once knew Mulberry Street very well.
