HEADLINE: Gold Miners Eager for Bush To Roll Back Clinton Rules 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CRESCENT VALLEY, Nev. 

 BODY:
These are the hills that gold built, acres and acres of rubble piled more than 200 feet high, the detritus of mining operations that require the removal of 80 tons of rock to produce a single ounce of gold.
 If Nevada were a country, it would be the third-largest producer of gold in the world, thanks largely to a 129-year-old federal law that gives mining companies broad license to scrape and otherwise reshape public lands to get at elusive ores. And mining operations like the giant Cortez complex here are among the most profitable anywhere, in part because the law does not require mining companies to share their gains with federal taxpayers. 
 But the industry has come to see itself as under siege, a target of rule changes by the Clinton administration that scaled back some of those old prerogatives. Now, in places like Crescent Valley, hopes are running fervent that the tide will turn again. 
The Bush administration is widely expected to roll back the bulk of the major Clinton-era regulations governing mining on public lands, in an action anticipated by next month -- one that could not come too soon for Nevada's gold mining industry. 
The anticipated shifts are not only portrayed as further evidence that the pendulum has swung significantly toward positions advocated by industry, but also a demonstration of how administrative rule changes, which do not require Congressional approval, can have a profound effect on the ground.
The changes would scrap most of the rules that took effect on Jan. 20, President Bill Clinton's last day in office, leaving in place a set of weaker regulations imposed in 1980. One measure that would be set aside gives federal officials the power to block mining operations likely to cause "substantial irreparable harm" to resources on public lands. In addition, the Interior Department is expected to undo a 1997 regulatory interpretation that imposed a strict limit on how much land could be used for dumping, milling and other activities to support future mining operations.
"We were dealt a devious, malicious hook," Tony A. Jensen, the Cortez mine general manager, said of the stricter regulations. "And until something changes, we will have a tremendous amount of concern about our future."
The dumping rules, which would probably have greater overall impact, would have little effect on existing mines. But they could greatly restrict future operations. 
Valuable minerals like gold and copper generally are found only in quantities invisible to the naked eye, so mining companies extract them by sifting through vast quantities of rock and soil, usually gouged from an open pit. Most of the waste is simply piled in dumps, and even what is deemed to be viable ore must be milled or stacked in heaps and then bathed in a cyanide solution to disgorge tiny flecks of precious metal. 
The process is so land intensive that the largest pit at Cortez is nearly a mile across, and the area used for milling, dumping and support exceeds that used for mining by five to one.
Mining critics have welcomed the Clinton land-use limit as a novel way to rein in operations they see as having overstepped their bounds. But it has been regarded within the industry and among its allies in Congress as a sneaky, backdoor substitute for the Clinton administration's earlier efforts to rewrite the mining law itself, which failed to win Congressional approval.
Already, members of Congress, including Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, have enacted legislation exempting existing mining operations from the new land-use rules. But the industry has been pushing the Bush administration to draft a legal opinion of its own that would also spare new operations. People on both sides of the debate expect the administration to accede.
The Interior Department said in June that it would retain one provision of the environmental rules that the Clinton administration enacted in January, which toughens rules requiring mining companies to put up bonds against the potential cost of environmental harm. But that idea was never strongly opposed by mining officials, and with a decision on the rest of the package expected soon, the industry's main critics say they are pessimistic.
"On mining, the difference between Bush and Clinton is the difference between night and day," said Alan Septoff, research director for the Center for Mineral Policy, an advocacy group. 
Indeed, Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary under President Clinton, often criticized regulations that allowed industry to extract billions of dollars of minerals from public land while paying what Mr. Babbitt said was too little in taxes. He described the mining law as "one of the most outrageous corporate subsidies" in American history.
But under Gale A. Norton, Mr. Babbitt's successor, the Interior Department has been far friendlier. Its proposal to roll back the environmental regulations for public-lands mining was one of the department's first actions, and its new No. 2 official, J. Steven Griles, a former mining lobbyist, is respected by the industry as a sympathetic expert.
"It was a tough eight years, and now we are doing triage," said Joe Danni, a vice president and director of Placer Dome America, one of the country's largest mining companies and the majority owner of the Cortez mine. (Like most big mining companies operating in the United States, Placer Dome is foreign owned; it is a subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc. of Vancouver, British Columbia.)
Opponents of hard-rock mining point to an Environmental Protection Agency finding that the mining industry produces more toxic waste than any other. In addition, taxpayer watchdog groups have attacked the terms enjoyed by producers of gold, silver and copper on public lands -- rules that are far more generous than those offered to the oil, gas or timber industries.
But people on both sides of the fight say the atmosphere is volatile now because the price of gold and copper has fallen sharply. 
In Nevada, which produces 70 percent of the country's gold, gold mining is still a $3 billion a year industry, second only to gambling in the state's economy. But since 1997, the number of people in Nevada directly employed by mining has dropped to 11,000 from 15,000, said Russ A. Fields, president of the Nevada Mining Association. 
Some of the jobs were cut because of falling gold prices, Mr. Fields said. But he contended that others were the result of "a chilling effect on new exploration" caused by both sets of the Clinton rules, which encouraged some companies to look overseas for new supplies. 
The industry says it fears that the veto power granted to the government under the latest Clinton rules could be used capriciously to block mining operations, even at the last minute, on the ground that they would cause "substantial irreparable harm." The industry prefers the previous rule, which prohibits only environmental disturbances "greater than what would normally result when an activity is being accomplished by a prudent operator in usual, customary, and proficient operations of similar character."
The Cortez mines lie in a "area of control" covering 250 square miles in which Placer Dome and its partner, Kennecott, control mining rights under laws that allow companies to stake claims on public lands for nothing more than filing fees.
The operation is enormously profitable, with Cortez producing more than one million ounces of gold a year at an average cost of $160 an ounce; even with the depressed price of gold, that amounts to a profit of more than $100 per ounce. Under the 1872 law, mining companies pay no federal royalties. By contrast, producers of oil, gas and coal pay up to 12.5 percent in royalties for mining on public land.
Cortez's center of operations, an open pit known as Pipeline, stretches nearly a mile across and will ultimately be 1,000 feet deep, while piles of waste rock nearby will eventually tower more than 400 feet above the natural terrain. Both the pit and the hills will become permanent features of the land, under rules more forgiving than, for example, those requiring that surface coal mines be returned to their original state. 
A cyanide solution is used to separate the microscopic flecks of gold from the surrounding ore -- a process that at the Cortez mines alone consumes more than 2 million pounds a year of cyanide, a highly toxic chemical, posing what environmentalists say are potential risks to groundwater.
"We're going to see impacts out there for hundreds of years," said Tom Myers, director of the Great Basin Mine Watch, an environmental group. 
But in a tour of the mine, Mr. Jensen and other senior managers painted a very different picture.
Active mining operations, they noted, cover just a tiny fraction of the "area of control;" only when gold is found in economically viable quantities is the land disturbed. Five percent of the mine's net proceeds, or about $10 million a year, is paid in state taxes. 
The use of cyanide is governed by strict environmental regulations, enforced by the federal Bureau of Land Management and the state, which require that pits be lined to prevent toxic seepage. The piles of waste rock, though visible from miles away, are being reshaped to more closely replicate natural contours.
Even industry critics concede that the Clinton land-use limits -- allowing just one acre of milling and dumping areas for every four acres of mining claims -- will be all but impossible for many mines to heed. They say companies in need of more land for their operations could always buy it from the federal government, at market prices, but they say the real lesson that mining officials should draw is that the 1872 law is unworkable, for all sides, and is in need of a major overhaul.
"If the multinational mining industry wants the subsidies that it has enjoyed for 129 years, namely billions of dollars in publicly owned minerals for free, and exclusive, essentially free use of publicly owned lands for mining, they must comply with the whole law," said Mr. Septoff of the Center for Mineral Policy. 
That is not a message that sits well in Crescent Valley, where miners point to the bleak surrounding terrain and say they doubt it could be put to better use.
"Just remember," said one employee, Jason Lowe, 33, a heavy equipment operator, "agriculture, mining and lumber -- that's what built America."

HEADLINE: When All Roads Lead to Wall Street 

BYLINE:  By Charles R. Morris; Charles R. Morris is the author, most recently, of "Money, Greed and Risk."

 BODY:
Get thee glass eyes," King Lear says to Gloucester, "and like a scurvy politician, seem to see the things thou dost not."
 Wall Street is cutting jobs by the tens of thousands, and big banks and investment banks are privately predicting a dire downturn in the financial services business. But city politicians, according to news reports, foresee only minor speed bumps on the highway of prosperity. Shakespeare would not have been surprised. 
 Wall Street's fortunes and city finance have been inextricably linked since New York's manufacturing economy dried up in the 1950's. During Mayor John Lindsay's first term, New York enjoyed one of the fastest-growing economies and lowest unemployment rates in the country because the stock market was at the peak of its 60's go-go years. But when the market tumbled in 1968 and 1969 and again in the early 1970's, the city careered toward insolvency and disgrace.
There was another go-go period in the 1980's. Wall Street's leveraged buyout boom swept away sour memories of default and "Drop Dead!" missives from Washington. Mayor Ed Koch metamorphosed from the tight-fisted fiscal disciplinarian of the late 1970's to the good-times free spender of the mid-1980's.
What economists call the FIRE sector of the economy -- finance, insurance and real estate -- accounts for half or even more of city employment, counting the rippling impact on all the law firms and accountants, restaurants and taxicabs, florists, financial printers and other businesses that feed from Wall Street's table leavings. The prices of co-op apartments in upscale buildings generally follow the Dow Jones average but lag behind by a year or two when the direction is down. It takes that long to figure out that moving up to a terrace view of the park is a set-up for a big loss when the best price you can get won't cover your mortgage.
As the long boom of the 90's made giddy excess the norm, wise men convinced themselves that this time would be different. After all, they said, New York was no longer so dependent on the fortunes of Wall Street. We were becoming a high-tech media center -- just look at the new Web-based companies in Manhattan's Silicon Alley. Long a technology laggard, New York City suddenly became a magnet for venture capital, trailing only San Francisco in attracting technology venture financing.
But the Silicon Alley phenomenon was mostly froth from the stock market boom. Few of the Web companies were real businesses with real earnings. They depended on a stream of new money from bursting coffers of investment banks and private equity funds. Now Web entrepreneurs rub shoulders with tech-stock brokers in the unemployment lines.
To his credit, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has not lapsed into the lavish spending that marred the last term of Mayor Koch. Over the past few years percentage increases in city spending have been in the low single digits, and this year projections are for a relatively flat budget. When tax revenues turn down, as they must this year, the city is likely to be facing yawning deficits and painful service cutbacks once again.
Are New Yorkers doomed to repeat the cycle of stock-market-driven boom and bust forever? The great hopes for a more diversified economy have faded with the dreams of the dot-com entrepreneurs. If that's a harbinger of what's to come, our next mayor will be dispensing bitter medicine. And we'd better get used to it, because this market downturn could well be a long one.

HEADLINE: Japan's Budget Deficit Has Soared. It's Time for a Tax Cut. 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
NEARLY two decades ago, when almost everyone knew that Japan's all-powerful economic machine was vastly superior to ours, Russell Baker offered a modest proposal in these pages: In return for Japan's sending cars to us, we should export our lawyers.
 It was a brilliant idea, and one that needs to be revived, with but one change. We should send them supply-side economists instead. 
 Let me make it clear that I think more highly of such economists than Mr. Baker seemed to think of lawyers. Two decades ago, the supply-siders performed a valuable service. They persuaded a popular new president, who had been elected as a fiscal conservative, to slash taxes and claim that no budget deficit would result. Lower tax rates, they said, would miraculously bring higher tax revenues.
That proved to be wrong. But it was a good idea nonetheless. The United States was going through painful economic times, and the tax cut provided relief for the majority who were not to be victims of the cutbacks that were needed to make American business more competitive. The economic stimulus helped to end a severe recession.
Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, now needs all the help he can get to turn around an economy that is viewed as hopeless by the same people who once deemed it omnipotent. He has promised reforms that will clean up the balance sheets of banks and restructure the economy. Longer term, such reforms are necessary. But their immediate effect will be to raise unemployment and restrain economic activity.
It is good news that Japan's central bank moved this week to print money, after making the belated discovery that, as Masaru Hayami, the Bank of Japan's governor, said, "the downside risks to the economy are becoming a reality."
But more is needed. Consumers in Japan these days are the mirror image of those in this country. The last decade has taught many Japanese that economic growth is ephemeral at best, and saving is the most prudent course. Their caution depresses growth, while consumer optimism here has so far kept this country out of recession.
There will be more pain from restructuring in Japan. Getting the banks in shape will mean some borrowers are forced into bankruptcy, putting people out of work. But most people will not lose their jobs, and a tax cut could encourage them to spend. "You have a shot at breaking the logjam in Japan," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company. "For the vast majority, the tax burden would go down substantially, and the purchasing power of their income would go up substantially."
Japan has tried fiscal stimulus before, building roads and bridges that kept the construction industry happy but accomplished little else. Some money from tax cuts would vanish into savings accounts, but the rest would be spent on things people want. Consumer confidence might rise.
The previous spending sent Japan's debt soaring, leading Mr. Koizumi to run on a budget-balancing platform, just as Mr. Reagan once did. He needs a way out of that promise without having to admit he is breaking it. That is where the supply-siders come in.
Japan's domestic policies are all the more important because it is on its own as it has not been in recent years. Without strong American growth, there is little hope for a weak yen to produce an export-led revival. And with the dollar looking shaky, Mr. Koizumi may even have to cope with a rising yen. Tax cuts are a gamble worth taking.

HEADLINE: Ford Weighs Plans to Cut White-Collar Work Force 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
Alarmed by the slowing economy and a slumping market share, executives of Ford Motor have approved an early-retirement program for up to 10 percent of its white-collar employees in the United States, or 4,600 workers, people close to the company said today.
 Ford's management has also begun reviewing the possible delay of some planned vehicle models, which would lower the company's design and engineering costs, and has even started considering whether to shut down an assembly plant, these people said. But only the early-retirement plan appears imminent, they said, partly because Ford has only just installed a new group vice president for North American operations, Nick Scheele, who has begun a comprehensive review of the automaker's activities in the region. 
 The American auto market has been slowing steadily this summer, and Ford has fared worst of all. Sales tumbled 12.7 percent last month while the overall market slipped 5 percent, so Ford finds itself in the unenviable position of holding a shrinking share of a shrinking market. 
Shares of Ford, which is also facing the likelihood of a downgraded credit rating, have been steadily declining, producing pressure from Wall Street for the company to cut costs quickly.
"There is a whole list of actions being considered, some of which will be announced very shortly," said a person close to the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The Street is concerned, and obviously we are concerned about that as well." Ford's stock rallied somewhat yesterday, rising 92 cents, to $23.47 a share, as the falling dollar improved its competitiveness, especially against Japanese automakers, whose stocks fell.
Nick Sharkey, a Ford spokesman, declined to comment on the company's plans.
As in at least two other early retirement programs in recent years, Ford is offering to add three years to employees' years of service with the company and three years to their ages for the purpose of calculating pensions, a second person close to the company said. Because Ford has hired fairly few workers since its heyday in the late 1970's, it has many engineers and managers in their 50's, so retirement incentives have been effective in reducing the number of employees.
Ford had 45,822 white-collar employees in the United States as of Dec. 31. The buyout program might be extended to Ford engineers and managers in other countries, although this would require tailoring it to other nations' laws, two people close to the company said. Ford has almost 200,000 employees outside the United States but does not release the proportion who are in white-collar jobs; comparable statistics for other automakers would suggest Ford has 25,000 to 35,000 white-collar employees outside the United States.
A concern for Ford's leaders is that credit agencies will lower the company's credit rating. Rod Lache, an auto analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, warned in a research note today that "a rating downgrade for Ford appears imminent" while adding that the company appeared to have insulated itself from the effects of a downgrade by rebalancing its credit exposure in recent months.
Scott Sprinzen, the managing director for automotive credit at Standard & Poor's, a big rating agency, said the agency had put a "negative outlook" on Ford's credit rating in February and had been warning actively since May that the rating "could possibly be lowered within a few quarters." The agency is concerned that price competition and a proliferation of sport utility models will hurt the profitability of Ford's North American operations even as Ford's foreign operations are struggling and its cash reserves are declining, Mr. Sprinzen said, while refusing to discuss when any downgrade might take place.
Ford has been struggling with quality problems that have forced repeated recalls and slowed the introduction of new models. The new Ford Thunderbird, a convertible that has won rave reviews, has been delayed until the end of this summer because of problems with overheating engines, two people close to the company said today.
Sales of the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle, the company's best-selling family vehicle excluding pickup trucks, have still not recovered from the recall of Firestone tires on Explorers a year ago despite costly discounting. Sales of Ford's larger sport utilities and pickups, once the cornerstone of its profits, have slowed even more as General Motors and Toyota Motor have stepped up their production and marketing of competitive models.
A person close to the company said one factory that could be closed is Ford's 53-year-old operation on the outskirts of St. Louis, which makes about one-third of the Explorers; the rest are assembled at a larger, 46-year-old factory in Louisville. But any closing of factories will probably not happen soon because Ford's current labor contract runs through September 2003 and bars factory closings except with the permission of the United Automobile Workers, which is very hard to obtain.

PERSON: Gale Cincotta 

HEADLINE: Gale Cincotta, 72, Opponent Of Biased Banking Policies 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Gale Cincotta, a plainspoken mother of six who became a neighborhood activist and went on to help ignite the national debate over bank lending policies that discriminated against minority home buyers, died Wednesday at a hospital in Maywood, Ill. She was 72.
 The cause was gall bladder cancer, said Tracy Van Slyke, spokeswoman for the National Training and Information Center, of which Ms. Cincotta was executive director. 
 Ms. Cincotta, who lived in Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, achieved fame for her spirited fights for residents of the neighborhood of Austin, on Chicago's West Side, where she lived most of her life. In a 1996 article in Illinois Issues, she told of nailing a rat to the door of the alderman for Austin in 1970 after he refused to attack rodents. The next day, the city's rat patrol was on the job.
She moved on to national issues, especially her challenge to the banking industry and the federal bureaucracy over the practice called redlining, refusing to lend to residents of minority neighborhoods. As part of this fight, she once threatened to nail a "Loan Shark" sign over the door of the Federal Reserve in Washington.
After redlining was outlawed in the 1970's, she kept fighting to make sure the law was enforced.
Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago said she "was instrumental in helping the city formulate its campaign against predatory lending." 
Last year, she successfully lobbied for a Chicago ordinance to ban such lending practices, like offering very high mortgage rates and other confiscatory financial terms to minority members and the poor, often resulting in the loss of homes through foreclosures. In April, the Illinois Legislature followed suit.
Gail Angeles was born on Dec. 28, 1929, in Chicago. Her father ran a Greek restaurant. She married a gas station owner and they had six sons. She became politically active in the 1960's because of school crowding.
In the late 1960's, Ms. Cincotta became president of the Organization for a Better Austin. The school battle expanded into other concerns, as Ms. Cincotta fought real estate agents' encouragement of panic selling by white homeowners as minorities began looking for homes.
People in other cities began turning to Ms. Cincotta and her colleagues for advice, and she became head of National People's Action, a network of 30 groups from 110 cities. The umbrella group held a housing conference in Chicago in 1972 and a protest in Baltimore the next year.
The strategy was extended to other issues, including consumer protection. "Coalitions are forming all over the place," Ms. Cincotta said in an interview with The New York Times in 1982.
Her group was one of those that successfully pressed Congress to pass the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires lending institutions to disclose where they make home loans. It also was an advocate in the winning fight to persuade Congress to pass the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which required banks to invest in neighborhoods where they did business.
National People's Action combined with other neighborhood groups to persuade three large Chicago banks to commit themselves to making $173 million in low-interest loans for housing and industrial development in poor neighborhoods. In return, the groups agreed not to challenge the banks' merger plans. 
Colleagues remembered her war cry: "We want it. They've got it. Let's go get it."
Ms. Cincotta is survived by five sons, George and Charles of Delray Beach, Fla.; James of Ottawa, Canada; Theodore of Phoenix and Richard of Oak Park, Ill., eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. No information was available on the sixth son.

HEADLINE: U.S. Consumer Prices Decline At Steepest Rate Since 1986 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
The prices that American consumers paid for goods and services fell in July at the steepest rate in 15 years as gasoline prices plummeted, the Labor Department said yesterday.
 The report provided further evidence that inflation remains under control, even though the Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates six times this year to reinvigorate the economy. 
 A separate report, meanwhile, showed that the housing market remained strong in the weakened economy as new construction surged in July. 
"There's still a lot of question marks about the economy," said Joel Prakken, the chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis. Still, he said, it appeared that the year's "second half is going to be a heck of a lot better than the first."
The Consumer Price Index slid a surprising 0.3 percent, well exceeding economists' forecasts of a drop of 0.1 percent. It was the first decline since April 2000 and the largest since one of 0.4 percent in April 1986.
Excluding food and energy prices, the core inflation rate was only 0.2 percent, even with a large spike in tobacco prices.
The negligible inflation in July appears to give the Fed's policy makers further room to reduce short-term interest rates again when they meet on Tuesday. Several economists said they expected the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by another quarter of a percentage point, to 3.5 percent.
"Inflation is not an issue, in the short term, for Fed policy," said Jade Zelnik, chief economist at Greenwich Capital Markets.
Overall transportation prices fell 2.3 percent, offsetting increases in the costs of many other services, including education, communication, medical care and recreation.
The cost of food and beverages increased 0.3 percent, while apparel costs fell 0.6 percent and housing costs were unchanged.
For the 12 months ended in July, consumer prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with a rate of 3.6 percent in the 12 months ended in July 2000. By the same measure for the same time periods, prices of services rose 4.2 percent, compared with 3.6 percent a year earlier.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the housing market remained strong in July, with starts of new construction rising 2.8 percent, to an estimated rate of 1.67 million, from a revised 1.63 million in June.
"With housing activity a good leading indicator for durable consumption, and the economy balanced two to three quarters since the start of monetary easing, housing gains may point to stronger consumption ahead," Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Banc of America Securities, wrote to clients.
The Labor Department also reported that the number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits in the week of Aug. 11 fell by 8,000, to a seasonally adjusted 380,000.

HEADLINE: THE CENSUS: Economics; 
Mixed Findings on Poverty in Survey of Bronx

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The economic boom that changed the face of New York City in the 1990's appears to have had no impact on the median income of families in the city's poorest borough, according to the results of an experimental Census Bureau survey of Bronx households released yesterday.
 The survey data suggest that the median household income and median family income may even have dropped slightly in the Bronx between 1990 and 2000. The numbers also show that the percentage of Bronx residents living in poverty remained unchanged over the decade, stuck at 29 percent. 
 The numbers come from the American Community Survey, a new approach to census data collection that the bureau has been testing in 31 counties nationwide. The findings were based on a survey of an average of 1,340 Bronx households done each month during 2000. 
The results offer a rare glimpse at important trends involving income, education and employment a year before comparable data from the more comprehensive 2000 census are scheduled to be released. But the survey's findings are not without limitations, the bureau and others point out.
Census officials say some of the numbers are not strictly comparable to figures from the 1990 census, against which they will inevitably be measured. For one thing, there are differences in the way the bureau collects information for the census as opposed to the survey, and whom it is collected from.
An examination of some of the 1990 census and 2000 survey numbers that are considered relatively comparable suggests a mixed picture in the Bronx. Estimated median household income dropped from about $30,000, adjusted for inflation, to $27,551. The estimated median family income dropped from about $35,200 in 1989, adjusted for inflation, to $30,791 in 2000.
A median is not an average; it is the number in the middle. Median income means that half of all the incomes are below that number and half are above.
At the same time, employment levels in the Bronx remained constant, according to a comparison of the 1990 and 2000 numbers. And the percentage of Bronx residents over age 25 with high school and college diplomas went up. The 1990 census found that 58.5 percent of Bronx residents were high school graduates. That figure rose to nearly 65 percent in the 2000 survey. Residents with a bachelor's degree or higher went from 12.2 percent in 1990 to 15.6 percent in 2000.
Also on the rise was the percentage of Bronx housing units occupied by their owners, instead of renters. That figure rose from about 18 percent in the 1990 census to nearly 21 percent in the survey. Owner occupancy is considered an indicator of community stability.
Meanwhile, the percentage of Bronx households in which a language other than English was spoken jumped from 48 percent in 1990 to 54 percent in 2000, a comparison of the numbers showed. That reflected the large number of immigrants, many of them from Latin America, who poured into the Bronx in the 1990's.
The survey data raised several questions. Why did the estimated median incomes in the Bronx fail to rise, and apparently even decline, during a period of affluence in the city and nationwide? And why did the percentage of Bronx residents living in poverty remain stable if median incomes went down?
Though surprising, the income numbers were not entirely inconsistent with recent data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, which found that per capita personal income in the Bronx increased barely, if at all, between 1989 and 1999. Those figures, however, are based on tax returns and do not include people who do not report their income.
Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College who did the income comparisons for The New York Times, said the incomes of middle-class and upper-middle-class residents of the Bronx appeared to have increased while the large numbers of poor people in the borough held the median income down.
"This could mean that those better off in the Bronx are now quite a lot better off while those who are poor in the Bronx are poorer now than they were 10 years ago," he said. "In other words, those in the bottom half could have lost ground and those in the top half could have gained ground."
William Bosworth, director of the Bronx Data Center at Lehman College and a retired professor of political science, suggested the influx of immigrants, many of them poor and unable to speak English, might have counterbalanced any improvement in income and education levels among those already in the Bronx.
"What you have is this constant influx," he said. "It's absolutely clear that the vast majority came from Latin America and of those, the vast majority speak English poorly. If you came from Latin America and speak English poorly, what are your chances of being in poverty?"

Hewlett-Packard Profit Falls but Beats Wall St. Estimates

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
The Hewlett-Packard Company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings today that fell 78 percent from the period last year, as the company, a computer industry bellwether, continues to struggle with a slowing worldwide economy.
 In spite of slowing sales in all parts of the world, the company's profits nearly tripled the expectations from Wall Street, which were sharply lowered after the company warned last month that it foresaw a revenue shortfall. 
 "While we can't control what's going on," Robert P. Wayman, the chief financial officer, said in speaking about the economy, "at least we've made some important progress on what we can handle here."
The company's shares closed up 3 cents at $24.13 today before the earnings announcement. In after-hours trading, shares rose to $24.90. 
Among other technology companies, Dell Computer reported earnings today in line with expectations but lost $101 million, largely because of charges related to job cuts and other expenses. Shares for Ciena, a maker of fiber optic equipment, fell sharply after the company said profits for 2001 and 2002 would not meet estimates.
Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., reported earnings, excluding one-time items, of $218 million, or 11 cents a diluted share. Pricing wars and sluggish demand, particularly in the company's consumer printer and personal computer businesses, dragged earnings down from $1.04 billion, or 50 cents a share, during the third quarter last year.
As recently as June 6, the company said it was comfortable with analysts' profit expectations of 23 cents a share. But on July 26, five days before the quarter's end, Hewlett-Packard warned that its revenue would decline 14 to 16 percent, twice as sharp a drop as expected. The company also announced that it would cut its work force by 6,000 employees.
Analysts cut their estimates to 4 cents a share, according to a survey by Thomson Financial/First Call. Hewlett-Packard today beat those expectations by 7 cents by reporting higher-than-expected revenues, cost reductions and gross margins.
Including special items, the company earned 5 cents a share. The special items included a $131 million loss from the sale of the company's VeriFone business and $49 million for amortization of good will and other intangibles.
Carleton S. Fiorina, the company's chief executive, said today that although sales may improve slightly during the current quarter as back-to-school shopping begins, she saw no immediate end to the dreary economic times.
"We don't see any signs of change in the market before 2002," Ms. Fiorina said in a conference call with analysts. She was referring to the company's fiscal year, which ends in October.
Revenue declined 14 percent, to $10.1 billion, from $11.8 billion in the period last year. The company said that it lost money in its consumer PC and software businesses and that revenue for its "crown jewel" printers and imaging devices declined 10 percent because of economic weakness and falling average selling prices. Over all, the consumer business fell 23 percent from the second quarter and 21 percent from the third quarter last year.
More than most computer makers, Hewlett-Packard is vulnerable to an economic slowdown because of its wide range of products, which include computers, printers and digital cameras, as well as server and storage systems. The company is also focusing more effort on information technology services, mainly through acquisitions.
Trying to quiet speculation that Hewlett-Packard might shut down its PC business, where year-to-year sales declined 36 percent to homes and 23 percent to corporations, Ms. Fiorina reaffirmed her commitment to selling those products.
In the conference call with Hewlett-Packard management today, Andrew J. Neff, an analyst with Bear Sterns & Company who has predicted that at least one of the major PC manufacturers will be forced out of the shrinking market, pressed her to explain her reasons for remaining in the industry.
Ms. Fiorina said Hewlett-Packard needed to use PC's to sell its printers to consumers and its profitable services packages to corporations.
"It has been a good performer for us," Ms. Fiorina said. "We think in more normal times it will continue to be a good performer for us."

Dell Loses $101 Million For Quarter

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
Dell Computer lost $101 million in the second quarter of its fiscal year, largely because of charges related to job cuts and other expenses, the company said yesterday.
 In the same quarter of last year, Dell reported net profit of $603 million, or 22 cents a share. When the charges are excluded from this year's figures, the company posted a profit of $433 million, or 16 cents a share, in the second quarter, which ended Aug. 3. That figure matched forecasts of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
 Sales from the computer giant, which is based in Austin, Tex., were $7.61 billion, down slightly from $7.67 billion the year before. Analysts predicted slightly higher sales of $7.7 billion. Before the company released its earnings after the market closed, Dell shares had dropped 12 cents a share, closing at $25.38. Shares fell as low as $24.60 in after-hours trading.
Dell executives said that layoffs and sharp reductions in inventory had helped the company cut costs and weather the weakness in the economy, while lower costs for computer components had permitted it to reduce prices and to continue a price war with rivals.
"We increased shipments strongly in a down market, particularly in enterprise products," Michael S. Dell, the company's founder and chief executive, said. The company, he said, "gained more than two points of overall market share."
Outside of the United States, the company's product shipments rose 30 percent over the previous quarter and increased 19 percent from the year before as sales for most of its competitors fell. In the United States, shipments increased 13 percent over the previous quarter, the company said.
In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Dell said, "We think we're very, very well positioned for a bounce-back in demand that we think is likely to occur in the spring of next year." 
The company, which is the biggest seller of computers for the laptop and the desktop markets, had a 33 percent increase in global sales of servers, large computers for running networks. 
Dell executives said that sales in the third quarter would probably be flat, or could drop 5 percent. That would translate into earnings of 15 cents or 16 cents a share. Mr. Dell suggested that the forecasts might be conservative, but said, "If our forecasts are conservative, that will be good for us and the rest of the industry."
One market analyst said that Dell's earnings were not a surprise. Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said, "In this tough environment, you have a single company that has executed remarkably well."
Mr. Kumar said the hard times would continue. "It's highly likely we won't see any sequential growth for the company," he said, "and especially for the industry, until the December quarter at the earliest."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Despite Good Market, Mortgage Problems Inch Up

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
Even as the real estate market remains strong in the New York metropolitan region and across the country -- in fact, national sales of existing homes are on track to make this year the second-best year ever, surpassing last year -- some housing observers point to a hairline fracture in the foundation: mortgage delinquencies and foreclosure rates have risen slightly.
 "The numbers are small, but quite meaningful," said Rae Rosen, the senior regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 Douglas Duncan, the senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said, "It's not cause for concern, but for attention."
There are approximately 47 million existing mortgage loans in the country, 31 million of them regularly surveyed by the Mortgage Bankers Association. It tracks mortgage payments that are 90 or more days late and mortgages that have entered the foreclosure process. 
Nationally, the percentage of mortgages that were 90 or more days past due in the first quarter of 2001 (the latest data available) was 0.63, up from 0.52 in the first quarter of 2000. For foreclosures initiated in the first quarter, the percentage was 0.32, compared with 0.30 in the corresponding period last year.
"We didn't get the kind of decline in foreclosures you would have expected during a strong expansion," Ms. Rosen said. "Now we see that 90-day late payments and foreclosures have ticked up, and that was for the first quarter of 2001, before the recent spate of large layoffs."
In New York, the percentage of mortgage payments that were 90 or more days late in the first quarter was 0.55, up from 0.49 in the first quarter of 2000. For foreclosure proceedings initiated, the percentage was 0.34, up from 0.31.
For New Jersey, 0.77 percent of all mortgages were 90 or more days late at the end of the first quarter, up from 0.65 in the first quarter of 2000. For foreclosures started, the percentage was 0.38, up from 0.33.
And in Connecticut, 0.42 percent of mortgages were at least 90 days late, up from 0.37 percent. However, foreclosure proceedings initiated during the first quarter stood at 0.23 percent, down from 0.24 percent.
"Two factors are driving the increases," Mr. Duncan said. One is that unemployment has increased nationally to 4.5 percent from 3.9 percent in October. "The second is that lots of loans were originated in 1998 and early 1999," he said. "They are now three years old and, historically, the peak delinquency period in the life of a loan is Years 3 through 5."
That is because home buyers make sure their finances are in order before they purchase, and because they have had the house inspected to be certain it is in good condition. "Three years later, maybe the furnace breaks down," Mr. Duncan said, "but you're not as flexible financially because you used your resources to get the house. Or now there's a baby and Mom is staying home or working part time."
Mr. Duncan also pointed out that energy prices soared in the fourth quarter of 2000. "For households that were less flexible and all of a sudden their heating bill increases 50 percent, that stretches the budget," he said.
Although the New York region has been somewhat insulated from the national economic slowdown because it is less dependent on manufacturing, Ms. Rosen expressed concern about recent job losses in that sector, particularly in New Jersey. "There's a potential for more layoffs, so there could be an additional rise in foreclosures," she said.
George McCarthy, a housing economist at the Ford Foundation, says the poor are most vulnerable. "When you look at the numbers for the market as a whole, it doesn't reveal the cancer that's spreading from the low end," he said.
"The real story behind these numbers is the rapid expansion of predatory lending," Dr. McCarthy continued. "There is a two-tiered lending market, and increasingly the lower tier is being served by subprime lenders" -- those that lend to people with less than pristine credit and often charge considerably higher rates.
As an indicator that the poor are particularly affected, Dr. McCarthy pointed to statistics from the Federal Housing Administration, which insures prime loans in low-income neighborhoods. "Defaults on F.H.A. mortgages jumped 30 percent within the last year," he said. "And the 30-day delinquency rate on F.H.A. mortgages crossed the 10 percent mark for the first time ever at the end of 2000."
If F.H.A.-backed loans have been hit hard, then subprime loans must be even more vulnerable, Dr. McCarthy said. "What we do know is that the default rates on these subprime loans are at least three times the rate of prime loans," he said. "And the share of the market that's covered by subprime lenders has increased dramatically since 1997."

HEADLINE: Industry Standard Says It Will Cease Publication 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER and ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
The Industry Standard, a magazine that rose with the dot-com boom it was founded to chronicle but suffered when the bubble burst, has published its last issue barring a last-minute rescue by some unexpected savior, according to a statement released yesterday.
 The magazine's parent company, Standard Media International, is expected to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection soon. 
 In the statement, Alissa Neil, a spokeswoman for the magazine, said: "The Standard will be suspending publication of its weekly print magazine, The Industry Standard, while the company continues to look for a buyer. It is quite possible that during that time we will file Chapter 11. We're very disappointed that our short-term financial situation requires this, but we remain hopeful that our assets will be sold." 
Word began to spread earlier this week among the handful of employees who were not taking a company-required vacation, and executives scrambled to reach the rest of the 200 or so remaining employees. In its heyday a little more than a year ago, the company, based in San Francisco, employed about 400 people, including 130 journalists. Company executives said that a flood of dot-com ads brought in $140 million last year, allowing the magazine to turn a profit in its third year of existence -- a rare feat in the magazine business.
But advertising declined 75 percent in the first half of this year, and the magazine was on track to lose $50 million on revenue of $40 million, these executives said. International Data Group, the Boston-based trade magazine publisher that once dominated the board of Standard Media, let its partners know this week that it would not seek or provide a bridge loan of about $10 million, according to a person who participated in the discussions.
Until a few days ago, several members of the company's board thought that as cash ran out, bridge financing would give the magazine enough breathing room to organize a sale, perhaps to a publishing company like Dow Jones & Company or McGraw Hill or even one of its investors, Pearson P.L.C. 
Although no new issue of the magazine is expected -- the final copy was published last week, three and a half years after the first issue -- the magazine's Web site, www.thestandard.com, is expected to continue in the immediate future, operating with a skeleton crew of journalists and technicians.
Over the last two years, the magazine rode to unexpected revenue heights, quadrupling its 1999 revenue in 2000. But in January, the bottom dropped out of the advertising market.
All the magazines devoted to the Internet and to investing in the technology sector have been hurt by the economic downturn, but The Industry Standard was the hardest hit. From January to June, for example, the magazine's ad pages were down 75 percent, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. By contrast, ad pages at Business 2.0 declined 60 percent during the same period, Red Herring was down 49 percent and Fast Company was down 47 percent.
The news of impending bankruptcy came less than a month after The Industry Standard sponsored a conference in Carlsbad, Calif., that attracted industry chiefs from Steven A. Ballmer of Microsoft to Scott G. McNealy of Sun Microsystems. It came only a few months after the magazine, regarded by many as the best of a new crop of news-oriented new-economy publications, won a Gerald Loeb award, the highest award in financial journalism.
The likelihood that a spirited magazine tailored to a new economic and journalistic landscape is coming to an abrupt end left staff members angry and resentful at their financial backers. "We had never fit into the I.D.G. culture," one staff member said of International Data Group. "They do trade magazines. We're just culturally different. It was an uneasy relationship."
During the flush times of late 1999, Standard Media sought out new investors that would dilute the role of International Data. The first step, in January 2000, was to take on an outside loan of $30 million from sources that included Flatiron Partners and Pearson. 
But to attract those investors, the company promised to undertake a rapid expansion built on optimistic assumptions. It created a costly infrastructure, starting back-office legal and auditing departments separate from those of International Data and developing its own software. 
The company also signed leases for office space for up to 600 employees in San Francisco and New York, with some leases negotiated to last as long as 10 years.
In January 2000, the company was valued by its new investors at about $200 million. The investors, who together paid $30 million for a stake of about 15 percent, according to one person close to the transaction, were Flatiron Partners, Chase Capital Partners, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Venture Partners, Pearson, Europ@Web, J.& W. Seligman and Chase H&Q.

HEADLINE: Big Stakes In Small Errors; 
Manufacturers Fight Retailer 'Discounts' In Shipping Disputes

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Earlier this year, Sega of America Dreamcast, which makes computer games and the machines to play them, went to court, suing one of its biggest customers over a $2.2 million unpaid bill.
 Sega contended that although it had delivered some $25 million worth of Dreamcast consoles and other items ordered by Kmart buyers to its stores around the country, the Kmart front office had refused to pay for $2.2 million of them because of "numerous credits and deductions which were not authorized" and were disputed by Sega. Kmart declined to comment on the dispute because of the pending legal matter. 
 The deliveries were made in 1999 and last year, according to the lawsuit, and by June 2000 Sega had halted further shipments to Kmart over the unpaid amount.
Sega's lawsuit was a rare public eruption of what those in the retail business say is a broadening undercurrent in their industry: stores charging their suppliers for all kinds of supposed infractions on the receiving end, ranging from late-arriving trucks to wrongly placed bar-code labels to incorrectly dangling tags on clothing and boxes that are unloaded out of order. By some estimates, retailers charge back as much as 10 to 15 percent of certain types of purchases, which can make a huge difference in the bottom line of suppliers affected by the practice. 
Manufacturers are reluctant to discuss specific charges because they usually are still doing business with the retailers in question. But now, with most businesses suffering from the slowing economy, manufacturers large and small say they are being squeezed harder than ever. And new charge-back permutations have emerged, like the reopening of old accounts to claim fresh deductions.
"Doing business with the department stores has gotten worse over time, and I think it's in correlation to their balance sheets," one clothing manufacturer said. "It is a major, major thing. From the hangers to how it's hung to the placement of the tags, it just goes on and on and on, and there are penalties if you don't do it right."
At first glance, consumers would seem to benefit from the practice because it keeps retailers' costs down, giving them flexibility to keep prices low. The stores, for their part, say the charges, which are perfectly legal, are an attempt to improve the efficiency of their operations, starting at the mammoth warehouses where all kinds of goods are delivered.
But when retailers are charging back as much as they are today, manufacturers say they sometimes end up raising prices to offset their losses. Some may even stop dealing with particularly troublesome retailers, as Sega did, reducing the choices available to shoppers.
"Sometimes retailers find themselves being penny-wise and pound- foolish, by nitpicking with a vendor and then finding themselves without product," said Darrell Rigby, a retail specialist at Bain & Company. 
The practice, generally referred to as charge backs and deductions, dates to the 1970's in the apparel business, where it started small. But in the last few years, industry experts say, chain stores and department stores have spread the practice to packaged food, cosmetics, toys and other products. Consolidation among the stores has left fewer players, and they have more power over their suppliers than in the past. Many stores have information technology that is superior to that of the manufacturers, giving them another edge in the disputes over money owed.
"It's more aggressive lately because business is tough," said Walter Levy, a consultant with Kurt Salmon Associates in Manhattan, which advises retailers all over the country. "It is capitalism run amok."
The problems begin after products ordered by a store have been delivered. A store might claim that cartons arrived with less than the promised amount of, say, compact discs, rubber sandals, blenders, cashmere sweaters and the like. Or they might have held too much. Or the cartons were not delivered the way the store prescribed, perhaps landing on the loading dock in the wrong order or arriving on a truck that was too late or too early. 
Increasingly, stores want products packaged in ways that cut the amount of time required to set them up on shelves or racks. And they will deduct a certain amount for each aspect of product delivery that does not fit specifications, which can quickly add up to thousands of dollars.
The stores serve notice that they expect things to be done a certain way, issuing thick binders of "vendor compliance" regulations. But manufacturers say that the demands have become increasingly onerous, and differ from store to store.
One store even introduces its policy with the following: "When dealing with a major retailer, things will go wrong. So, be prepared, and the journey through charge back and deduction land will be as painless as possible."
For many of the manufacturers, painless is not the word that springs to mind. "You might have an invoice due for $1 million, but then you get paid $100,000, because $900,000 is in charge backs," the credit manager for a California company said. "You then have to identify what the charge back is for, and that could take anywhere from one week to three months. If you think about the cost of capital, you see that they finance their operations on chargebacks."
For the manufacturer, "it affects cash flow," he added. "If you are expecting a million dollars and you get just $100,000, then you have to go out and borrow that missing $900,000."
Steven Parks, director of deductions management at Dun & Bradstreet Receivable Management Services, told of seeing a check representing the net payment to a manufacturer from a $1.5 million invoice. "With all the deductions, the net effect for the manufacturer was 94 cents," he said.
Charge backs have become so pervasive this year that trade groups like the Fashion Association in New York started holding seminars to discuss the problem. On the Internet, various companies advertise their recovery services, intended for both retailers and manufacturers. Agencies have sprung up, like the Vendor Compliance Federation, also based in New York, which tries to bring the two sides together.
"There's no doubt in my mind that there's abuse," said Kim Zablocky, secretary to the federation, which has 150 large companies as members. "It's all subjective. Some manufacturers won't have any issues at all. Others are getting their brains handed to them."
He says that 85 percent of all the charges are the fault of the manufacturers, and most of those stem from shipping problems.
Stores of all sizes and types are using charge backs. At Sears, Roebuck & Company, executives say they are not interested in collecting money, but in improving the logistics of their business. Still, suppliers are fined for not fulfilling orders and other problems.
Each of Sears' 3,000 suppliers also gets a monthly report card -- with grades of A through F -- on how well they perform. "It's just like being back in school," said Charles Izzo, the company's director of vendor performance management. Filling orders counts for the most, followed by operational compliance, or how the orders are delivered to Sears. Poor grades usually generate a call from someone at the manufacturer, asking how it can improve, Mr. Izzo added. "You are changing their behavior," he said. 
If a company fails to ship a product on time, it is fined 5 percent of the cost of each product that was supposed to be in the shipment and did not arrive promptly, Mr. Izzo said.
Some stores have begun charging for what are called unidentified deductions, in which retailers deduct part of their payments for problems they do not specify. Others even forecast deductions as a certain percentage of an order, based on past experience. Post-audit deductions, in which closed accounts are reopened and challenged by the retailers, are another recent development. In effect, an increasing number of deals are just never done. Instead, they are subject to endless negotiation.
"A lot of them will try to get away with just about anything," said Judy Palilla, vice president for business development for Internal Audit Bureau Inc., which recovers unpaid bills for manufacturers from its headquarters in Clarks Summit, Pa. "They throw it up to see what will stick."
Much of what is charged as noncompliance can be difficult, if not impossible, to prove, Mr. Garuba of Dun & Bradstreet said. "The box arrives on the loading dock, and someone at the store signs for it," he said. "But when they open it up, there's only three-quarters of the order inside. So they take a one-quarter deduction for the missing part of the order." Some manufacturers have begun photographing their cartons as they leave the factory, in order to escape certain kinds of chargebacks.
Once a claim is made, many manufacturers do not have time to research it or otherwise defend themselves, Ms. Palilla said. She estimated that the retailers are wrong at least 25 percent of the time, and as much as 50 percent.
"I had one situation where a retailer deducted $200,000 from my account for perfume," said Andy Kahn, president of the children's wear division of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Mr. Kahn's company made clothing, not perfume. Even so, it took him a year to get his money.
The effect is also felt by companies that lend money to the manufacturers, since the payments become more difficult for manufacturers to make. "We never know if we're going to get a dollar bill for a dollar bill," said Jerry Sandak, a principal with Rosenthal & Rosenthal, a Manhattan company that finances manufacturers, "or 67 cents for a dollar bill because the store didn't get it at the right time with the right label."
Wayne Hood, a retail analyst with Prudential Securities in Atlanta, said Wal-Mart was the first discount store to begin charging its manufacturers for noncompliance about five years ago. Wal-Mart declined to comment.
Mr. Hood said that better collaboration between the stores and the manufacturers will ultimately cut down on charge backs. More stores are working with their suppliers to plan what will be on the shelves and when, a development that has improved the sales of many products, he added.
But for now, the penalties are escalating.
"You used to be charged a dollar, or five dollars," said Mr. Zablocky of the Vendor Compliance Federation. "Nowadays, the penalty could be as high as $25,000. If you want to get your goods sold, it's the cost of doing business. The customer is always right."

HEADLINE: Hollywood, an Eye on Piracy, Plans Movies for a Fee Online 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
Five major movie studios, including some of Hollywood's top players, unveiled plans today for a joint venture that would allow computer users to download rental copies of feature films over the Internet.
 The service, which will be available only to those with high-speed Internet connections, is an attempt to get ahead of piracy problems that have plagued the music industry through services like Napster and which were beginning to be felt in the film industry with newer file-swapping services. 
 "I think the majority of consumers believe that copyright has value and that if they have a pay vehicle to watch movies on the Internet, they will pay for it," said Yair Landau, president of Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment. "We want to give honest people an honest alternative."
The venture is also seen by many studio executives as a first step toward true video-on-demand, when consumers will be able to watch any movie they want, whenever they want. Initially, the films will be available for download only onto personal computers, or television monitors linked to an Internet connection, but eventually video-on-demand service is expected to include cable television and other delivery systems. 
"I think anybody who is in the movie business wants to reach the day when you can watch any movie you want, any time you want," Mr. Landau said. "I personally believe that launching an Internet service like this is a necessary first step in that regard."
The studios that will be partners in the service are MGM, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, Warner Brothers and Universal Pictures. Noticeably absent were Disney and 20th Century Fox, although sources close to Disney said that it intended to announce its own video-on-demand service within 10 days. Fox issued a statement late this afternoon saying that it, too, would announce plans soon for such a service.
Executives at Sony's Moviefly, an Internet movies-on-demand effort that will provide the technical backbone for the venture, had been saying since early this year that they intended to go online as soon as they could. 
They delayed the move, the executives said, in hopes of persuading as many Hollywood studios as possible to join the effort, a process that took longer than expected as each studio brought its concerns about pricing, security and competition with other outlets like cable television.
"It's very expensive to create something like this, so economics plays a role in bringing so many studios together," said Jack Waterman, president of worldwide pay television for the Paramount Television Group. "And this allows a lot of companies to come together to create a common viewpoint on the technology and security behind the system."
In the coming months, a chief executive will be hired for the new venture, which will have an equal number of representatives from each studio on its board; a name will be chosen; and the site will be tested extensively to make sure its security system works as promised. Then, the first 100 or so films, a mix of recent releases and films from studio libraries, will become available, either late this year or early next.
The selection of films, and how much it will cost to download them, will be left to the individual studios. Studios that are not part of the venture will also be allowed to post films on the site.
The average feature film is about 500 megabytes in digitized form and will take 20 minutes to 40 minutes to download, Mr. Landau said, depending on the type of broadband connection. Download times would be untenable for those with slower Internet connections. Studio officials estimate that there are 10 million households with broadband connections, a number they expect to increase significantly, as well as 35 million screens in offices and colleges.
A film will remain on a computer's hard drive for 30 days but will erase itself 24 hours after it is first run. In that 24 hours, consumers will be able to watch the film as many times as they wish -- pause, fast forward and perform other functions typical of a videocassette or DVD.
Studios traditionally release movies in a series of so-called windows, starting with theatrical release, followed by videocassette, DVD, pay-per-view, pay-cable networks and, eventually, broadcast networks. Executives at several studios said films would be released on this new system, initially at least, only when they entered their pay-per-view window, usually months after the theatrical release. The rental cost will be about the same as a pay-per-view film, the executives said. 
"We are not looking to undermine DVD, which is a great business," Mr. Landau said.
The new venture will be neither the first video-on-demand service (cable operators in a few markets have offered such a service to some customers, though the movie selection has been limited) nor the first time that feature films have been available for download on the Internet (companies like CinemaNow and SightSound Technologies have offered a limited roster of films for download). But it is the first effort involving Hollywood studios and offers the promise of thousands of potential films.
"This announcement confirms that film producers are eager for the Internet to enlarge and flourish," said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America. "For the first time, in the very near future, a broad selection of motion pictures will be available online, protected by encryption, and delivered directly to consumers at a reasonable price."
In general, the studios have been hesitant to allow the distribution of digital copies of their films on the Internet, fearing they would be too easy to copy and share through unauthorized sites. What has made studio executives agree to this venture has been a growing confidence that the necessary security is in place to prevent copying of the downloaded files.
However, since almost all film pirating has involved the latest releases and this service will make movies available only months later, it is unclear what effect it would have on illegal copying.
"That remains to be seen," said Ric Dube, an analyst for Webnoize, a research company that focuses on digital entertainment industries. 
"What this does is to compete with piracy more effectively than the movie industry has in the past," Mr. Dube said. "And the real issue isn't whether it will affect piracy, but whether the movie industry is willing to tolerate the amount of piracy that's going on in order to grow their market."
The music industry, which shares parentage with many of the studios involved in today's announcement, has also fought against file-sharing sites like Napster, and had a harder time because of the relative ease of downloading a piece of music. 
But movie studios have also been faced with file-sharing sites like Aimster, which allows swapping of both audio and video files. 
"The film industry does have a better history of coming through on plans like this than does the music industry," Mr. Dube said. "So when five major film companies say they will use an online channel to distribute their films, that means a lot more than a similar statement coming from five music companies."
The real question, though, is how many people really want to download movies onto their personal computers.
"To be really honest, we have no idea," Mr. Waterman said.

HEADLINE: White House Sees Economic Growth Doubling in 2002, but Democrats Voice Disbelief 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WACO, Tex., Aug. 16 

 BODY:
The White House estimated today that economic growth would rebound to 3.2 percent next year from a projected 1.7 percent this year and that the current year would bring a small surplus in the non-Social Security part of the budget. Democrats immediately denounced the estimates as overly optimistic and politically self-serving.
 As Democrats intensified their charges that President Bush's tax cut was already draining the budget surplus and putting Social Security funds at risk of being spent for general purposes, Ari Fleischer, the president's press secretary, gave reporters a preview of figures to be issued by the White House Office of Management and Budget next week. 
 Those figures painted a rosier picture than the one provided by many private economists, and presage an intense battle over what is affordable and what is not when Congress hammers out the details of the 2002 federal budget in the coming months. 
Mr. Fleischer used the numbers to counter Democratic charges that the administration would return to deficit spending this year, not counting the revenue set aside for Social Security. "Even with the economic slowdown," he said, "the budget will have the second-largest surplus in history, and the only way the Social Security surplus will be spent is if Congress breaks the budget."
He said the overall surplus for this fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, would be about $160 billion. Virtually all that money is attributable to Social Security, leaving a small remaining surplus of several billion dollars. That cushion, Mr. Fleischer said, will keep the government from having to tap excess Social Security funds for current non-Social Security spending.
But Democrats and some budget experts said the White House was able to make its claim of a non-Social Security surplus only because it had changed an accounting method that had been used for the last 65 years. Under the new method, the non-Social Security surplus this year is increased by $4.3 billion.
In addition, the 3.2 percent growth estimate for 2002 is markedly higher than the projection of 2.8 percent in the most recent survey of private economists conducted by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a leading financial newsletter. While that discrepancy has no relevance to this year's budget, the White House's use of a higher figure could have an impact on how much money Congress calculates that it can spend within Mr. Bush's budget for 2002. It will also be used to underpin White House estimates of budget surpluses for 2002 and the years beyond.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, said the figures showed that the Bush administration "will twist and turn the numbers in an effort to hide the reality, which is that Bush's tax cut has put him on a path headed straight for the Medicare and Social Security surpluses."
Gene Sperling, who was President Bill Clinton's top economic adviser, said he detected in the Bush administration "a disturbing pattern of using budget numbers that are compelled more by politics than fiscal prudence, more by convenience than by consistency."
The conflicting calculations and contentions reflect a broader political battle between the administration and its critics, including many Democrats, over whether Mr. Bush's tax cut was affordable and why Congress may feel a pinch when a 2002 budget is forged this fall.
Administration officials have said any budgetary constraints arise from an economic slowdown that began before Mr. Bush took office. And Mr. Fleisher said the threat to Social Security revenue came from lawmakers' appetite for spending.
Mr. Fleischer said the surplus in the current fiscal year, the budget for which was signed by President Clinton, was turning out to be $34.5 billion smaller than it should have been because Congress and Mr. Clinton "spent more than they promised." Mr. Bush's tax cut, he said, was an insurance policy against that sort of extravagance, because it put money out of reach of lawmakers.
The Office of Management and Budget's midyear report, to be released next Wednesday, will come a week before a similar report by the Congressional Budget Office, and many lawmakers expect the C.B.O. forecast to be more conservative.
Several Democrats and budget experts said they were less troubled by the O.M.B.'s optimistic forecast for economic growth, which they said was only slightly out of line with other projections, than by a sudden budget accounting change that the White House recently adopted.
The change involves payroll taxes that go to Social Security. In the past, this revenue was estimated in one year and then reconciled in a future year with the actual money collected. The reconciliation was reflected in the future year's budget.
But the Bush administration is attributing the actual amounts for 1998, 1999 and 2000 to those years instead of 2001. As a result, it will not have to deduct what is essentially a back payment to Social Security from non-Social Security revenue in this year's budget, and the non-Social Security surplus will be $4.3 billion higher. By the administration's own calculations, that amount could be the difference between a surplus and a deficit this year in the non-Social Security part of the budget. The accounting change does not, however, affect the amount of money in the Social Security trust fund, or Social Security benefits. 
Mr. Fleischer said the change was an effort by an administration in its first year to start keeping the books more accurately and coherently.
But many Democrats said it was obviously intended to help offset the effects of Mr. Bush's tax cut and a provision that moved the deadline for about $33 billion in corporate tax payments into the next fiscal year. The moving of the deadline made those payments available as revenue for the 2002 budget, the Bush administration's first, but also lowered revenue this year, depressing the non-Social Security surplus.
"Political budget gimmicks create a negative cycle that creates the need for more political budget gimmicks," Mr. Sperling said.
"Their first $33 billion gimmick," he added, "has now forced them to go back to the gimmick well a second time," to make the Social Security accounting change.

WEYERHAEUSER EXTENDS OFFER FOR WILLAMETTE SHARES

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 The Weyerhaeuser Company, still trying to win a hostile takeover of a rival, Willamette Industries, extended by a month its offer to buy Willamette shares. 
The offer, $50 a share, was to expire Wednesday but will now run until Sept. 14, Weyerhaeuser said. It was the fifth extension Weyerhaeuser has filed. As of Wednesday, Weyerhaeuser, based in Federal Way, Wash., said shareholders had tendered about 43 percent of Willamette's outstanding shares. Willamette is based in Portland, Ore. Separately yesterday, Weyerhaeuser said it would curtail production at three Canadian mills, putting about 1,000 people out of work for at least two weeks.

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing State Jobless Rate 

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 New York State's unemployment rate remains flat, state officials announced yesterday, but analysts said that was an improvement over the national jobs picture. The state's joblessness in July was 4.4 percent, as was the rate in June and in July 2000. 
The national rate for July was 4.5 percent, also the same as in June, but 0.5 percentage points higher than in July 2000. New York City's unemployment rate in July was 5 percent, down 0.3 percentage points since June. Joblessness in July 2000 in the city was 5.6 percent. The figures are based on monthly surveys of 20,000 businesses and include both full- and part-time jobs, except agricultural workers, the self-employed and domestic workers in private households.

HEADLINE: ABN Amro Shifts Focus Back to Traditional Banking 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
ABN Amro said today that it would concentrate on traditional Main Street retail banking and rein in its corporate and investment banking -- a business, analysts say, where the Dutch bank is not big enough to compete on a global stage dominated by Wall Street giants.
 In the effort to increase its retail business, ABN Amro is expected to look for a merger or an alliance. But the bank has been coy about identifying a likely partner, despite speculation that it may be considering Fortis, a Belgian-Dutch company. 
 "We have not drawn up a list of merger partners," ABN Amro's chief executive, Rijkman Groenink, told reporters in Amsterdam. "If we were to draw up a short list of candidates, then Fortis would fit the criteria."
The planned shift in corporate focus was announced as ABN Amro reported a 21 percent decline in second-quarter profit. Excluding a one-time gain from the sale of the European American Bank to Citigroup Inc., ABN Amro's second-quarter profit fell to 671 million euros, or $614 million, from 851 million euros in the quarter a year earlier.
The bank said earnings from corporate and investment banking fell 65 percent. Like other big international banks, ABN Amro has sought to cut costs in the face of dwindling fees for mergers and equity sales, as the slowdown in the global economy forces corporate clients to curb their expansionary ambitions. 
But Mr Groenink insisted that the bank was not planning to move out of this area. "We are by no means going to leave this business," he said, even as he acknowledged that economic and market conditions were unlikely to improve this year.
ABN Amro also reported a 35 percent decline in profit from private banking and asset management, to 64 million euros.
In retail banking, which is more resistant to recession, according to Mr. Groenink, profit rose 7.2 percent, to 400 million euros -- the only main business line to show an increase in profits. Despite a sharp decline in net income in the Netherlands, where ABN Amro is the biggest, profit from the retail business in the United States surged 63 percent, following the $2.75 billion purchase of the Michigan National Corporation, which was completed earlier this year.
ABN Amro has said that it planned to cut almost 9,000 jobs -- 6,250 of them at Dutch bank branches -- to generate savings of nearly $1 billion by 2004. Today, it said that it would also shed 3 of its 10 management board members by the end of the year and reduce capital invested in wholesale banking by 20 percent. But the cost-cutting has failed to take effect, while the slump in corporate and investment banking continues to push down profits.
Mr. Groenink's ambition is to reach the top five of a group of 20 big banks by 2004. At the end of the second quarter, it was 15th, based on return to investors.
In trading in Amsterdam, shares of ABN Amro rose 2.7 percent.

BYLINE:  By David Firestone (NYT) 

 BODY:
 In a statewide television address, Gov. Mike Easley urged the public to accept his plan for a one-cent sales tax increase to balance the state budget. 
In recent weeks, Mr. Easley has warned that the state's fiscal condition is direr than it has been in decades, and presenting the tax plan as an alternative to sharp education cuts and other reductions in state services. Republican legislators, on the other hand, have said that a weakening economy is the wrong time to raise taxes, and have called for budget cuts. David Firestone (NYT)

HEADLINE: San Francisco Museum Director Resigns Suddenly 

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
David A. Ross, the former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, resigned suddenly yesterday as director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where he had spent three heady years and $140 million building up the museum's collection of contemporary art.
 His sudden departure caught the Bay Area art world off guard, including some members of the museum's 60-seat board of trustees. But Elaine McKeon, the chairman, said the executive committee and Mr. Ross had concluded several weeks ago that their paths had diverged at a time when a slow economy was forcing the museum to keep a tighter rein on its resources. 
 "Our focus in the museum is on internal management, and David Ross is focused on external matters, which he is a genius at," Ms. McKeon said in a telephone interview. "What is good for the museum is not necessarily in his best interests. And we thought it was mutually beneficial if we parted."
Mr. Ross was not available for comment yesterday.
Ms. McKeon praised Mr. Ross's tenure at SFMOMA, as it is called, where, she said, "he created so much excitement." 
Since 1998 the museum's membership has risen to 44,000 from 24,000, and its acquisitions of works by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Mark Rothko, Francis Bacon, Alexander Calder, Chuck Close and Frank Stella put the institution in the top ranks of American museums of modern art.
Before going to San Francisco Mr. Ross had been director of the Whitney for seven years, where he had also created waves by his embrace of the trendy downtown art scene. In interviews later Leonard Lauder, the chairman of the Whitney's board of trustees, said he had tried to dissuade Mr. Ross from leaving New York and had offered to match San Francisco's handsome package.
But Mr. Ross was determined to move West, in part for personal reasons but also out of the belief that the energy -- and the money -- behind the American art market was shifting to the Pacific Coast.
"The idea of modernity is congruent with San Francisco," he said at the time.
Once he arrived, Mr. Ross led the museum on a buying spree that riveted the attention of dealers and artists around the country. "The trustees around here do not bargain," Mr. Ross said then. "They recognize that one of the reasons great pictures are being offered to us is because our trustees are willing to pay. They know what a great picture is worth."
Ms. McKeon said the different approaches of Mr. Ross and the board had surfaced only in the last year or so, with a downward shift in the national economy, in particular among the high-tech companies that are the backbone of Bay Area philanthropy.
"We are in a period, in an economy that puts the focus on management, on being fiscally responsible, financially responsible," she said. "It was a mutual parting of the ways, which was very friendly. So now David can get on with his life, and he can go do for somebody else what he did for us. But I have to think of our responsibilities."
Ms. McKeon said that she would begin a search for a new director next week. "When I get back Monday, I will immediately start interviewing search firms," she said. "We will do that right away."

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit For the U.S. Grew in June 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit widened in June as slower growth abroad and a strengthening dollar pushed exports to their lowest level in 16 months, the government said today.
 Imports fell a third consecutive month as companies spent less on oil, machinery and equipment. 
 The gap in trade of goods and services grew to $29.4 billion in June from $28.5 billion in May, the Commerce Department said. The drop in exports was larger than that for imports. 
The numbers "point to the bleak state of the global economy," said Avery Shenfeld, an economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto. "America's problems have spread to the rest of the world."
Through June, the trade deficit totaled $184.9 billion, compared with $178.1 billion during the first six months of last year. The trade deficit in 2000 was a record $375.7 billion.
Optimistic consumers may bolster the economy in the current quarter, now in its second month. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment rose to 93.5 in August from 92.4 in July. The increase was the third in four months, and the level is the highest since January.
"There is no consumer collapse here at all," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. Rising consumer sentiment about current conditions probably reflects the mailing of tax rebate checks, he said.
Exports fell 2 percent in June, to $86 billion, the lowest level since February 2000. The decline was the third in four months. Exports of industrial supplies and materials, which include chemicals and pulpwood, totaled $13.5 billion, the lowest level since October 1999.
There were two bright spots. Exports of services rose to a record $25.1 billion. Exports of automobiles, parts and engines rose to $6.6 billion, the highest level in almost a year.
Imports fell 0.7 percent in June, to $115.4 billion, the lowest level since February 2000. The decline was the third straight, led by reduced demand for capital goods, as well as industrial supplies and materials, which include oil and natural gas.

HEADLINE: Economic Tombstones; 
The Industry Standard, Unplugged

 BODY:
In Silicon Valley, it may well go down as the day the buzz died. On Thursday The Industry Standard magazine, launched three years ago to serve as the "newsweekly of the Internet economy," announced that it would cease publication and may have to seek bankruptcy protection. It is a dizzying reversal of fortune for a publication whose meteoric rise and fall mirrors the euphoric, then harrowing times lived by the dot-com entrepreneurs it covered. 
 From its inception in 1998, The Standard was a must-read in Silicon Valley thanks to the emphasis by its editor, Jonathan Weber, on journalism over boosterism. In 2000 The Standard broke the publishing industry's all-time single-year record with 7,440 ad pages, as hundreds of start-ups spent their venture capital on glossy ads to build brand awareness in anticipation of an initial public offering. 
 Readers often groused about The Standard's telephone-directory thickness, and the irony that an old-fashioned magazine had become an indispensable medium for the new economy was not lost on anyone. But The Standard, based in San Francisco, always strove to be far more than just a magazine. 
John Battelle, its founder and chairman, wanted to build an information conglomerate for the new economy that investors would value more as a high-tech company than as an old-line media company. The backers who are now refusing to provide more financing bought into this vision, and in its first two years The Standard, much like the companies it covered, raised and lavishly spent millions in venture capital -- all with an eye toward the big I.P.O. at the end of the rainbow. 
The promise of all those stock-option riches allowed its journalists to feel like entrepreneurs themselves, real players in a generation's hottest story, much like Rolling Stone writers must have felt in the heyday of rock 'n' roll.
The Nasdaq bubble popped, of course, and The Standard's revenues plummeted along with the index, from $140 million in 2000 to a projected $40 million this year. What's more, the company found itself faced with high fixed costs, reminders of its past ambitions, and investors who had lost their patience. 
As the dot-coms fell, The Standard's Layoff Tracker replaced its I.P.O. Tracker as one of the most avidly followed indices in Silicon Valley. Ironically, the magazine produced some of its best journalism in its last few months, albeit in a much slimmer package. The abrupt slowdown in the technology sector, with its tales of angst and its implications for the economy as a whole, has provided a gripping story, and The Standard did not sugar-coat it. But like the real player it set out to be, it has now fallen victim to its own story.

Luxury Fleet Grows Nimble

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: CHALLANS, France 

 BODY:
Yachts are no Model-T's. Yet Joseph Brethome heads a team of a dozen workers -- joiners, plumbers, electricians -- who scramble over 30- to 50-foot sailboats as they inch along eight assembly lines in a sprawling factory in this provincial French town six miles from the Atlantic.
 "We generally work on two at a time," said Mr. Brethome, a 12-year veteran of Beneteau, the French sailboat builder. And while sales are strong in Europe, as prosperity and abundant leisure time promote sailing, Beneteau is leading other European boat makers in looking farther afield. 
 Borrowing a chapter from luxury goods makers like Louis Vuitton or Gucci, and blending it with the production techniques of automakers, which modify basic models into dozens of variations, these boat builders have branched out to new markets, notably the United States. 
"Our main challenge is to meet demand," said Annette Roux, 59, the chairwoman and chief executive of Beneteau, who has run the company, founded by her grandfather in 1884, since she was 22. Beneteau, which started as a builder of boats for local fishermen, has grown more than 25 percent a year for five years and invested $80 million in the last two years to increase capacity at its yards in France and in Marion, S.C.
But the challenge may soon change. Competition is growing just as slowing economies and the global stock market slump dry up some of the extra income of the well-to-do, who buy most boats.
Still, Beneteau may be better situated to weather the coming storm, for the company provides a textbook example of how impressive design and modern production methods can overcome many obstacles. This combination has produced sailboats with price tags low enough to attract customers who may never have thought of themselves as yacht owners before. In the United States the pleasure boat industry, including sailboats and powerboats, had a record year in 2000, with revenue rising to $25.5 billion. Sales are expected to fall as much as 9 percent this year, the first decline since the mid-1990's, said Thom Dammrich, president of the National Marine Manufacturers Association. 
That has left many investors and analysts wary. Shares of Beneteau, which is 57 percent family-owned, with the rest traded on the Paris bourse, are down 33 percent this year. Ferretti, a big Italian yacht builder that has been an investor favorite, is off 15 percent.
European yacht builders have made their deepest mark in the American market for sailboats, which is a small fraction of the huge market for powerboats. And the Europeans run against strong American rivals, like Catalina Yachts of California and the Hunter Marine unit of the Luhrs Marine Group in Florida, the leaders in the $1 billion market.
Yet attractive European designs and low prices, thanks to automation and the strong dollar, which makes imports less expensive, have enabled the Europeans to carve out a larger niche in North America. Last year, imports of European sailboats were more than $124 million, up from $79 million five years earlier.
Beneteau's gains have drawn other Europeans, including fast-growing German yards like Dehler International and Bavaria Yachts. It has also opened marketing tie-ins with luxury goods producers. Patrizio Bertelli, owner of the Prada fashion house in Italy, parlayed a passion for sailing into a global marketing pitch by investing $50 million in Luna Rossa, a boat that reached the finals of last year's America's Cup.
Earlier, Leonardo Ferragamo, of the family that controls the Ferragamo fashion group, acquired Swan, the Finnish yard that had fallen on hard times despite specializing in yachts that are to sailing what Porsches are to driving. Wally Yachts, an upstart boat builder in Monaco, has had such success with its sailboats that it plans a line of accessories to go with them.
But Beneteau, whose biggest boats -- about 50 feet -- cost up to $378,000, has had the most success in the United States. It now holds 16 percent of the American sailboat market, placing it third behind Hunter and Catalina, up from 6 percent when it opened its South Carolina yard in 1986.
If a downturn hits the global economy, Mrs. Roux says Beneteau is armed to weather it. In the early 1990's, during the last recession, Mrs. Roux, a short, tanned woman whose charm is combined with self-assurance, refused to follow the industry wisdom and lay off workers on a large scale. While big French rivals like Jeanneau let go half their workers, Beneteau hung on. When sales rebounded in the late 1990's, she said, "we were in position to take opportunities."
Though criticized by analysts who thought she should have done more to prop up profits, she said, "We had not decapitated the company." In 1994, Beneteau acquired the ailing Jeanneau and nursed it back to health.
As rising wealth in the 1990's made sailing accessible to more people, Beneteau's revenue exploded. In its latest fiscal year, which ended last month, the company generated sales of 543 million euros, or $475 million, up 22 percent from last year and 59 percent over 1999's sales of 342 million euros.
If Beneteau has mastered the art of mass-producing sailboats, in factories that turn out 4,000 a year with little or no customizing, some of its rivals have taken an opposite tack. The owners of Wally Yachts invented a kind of virtual corporation, with teams responsible for design and marketing, farming out construction to specialized yards in Europe, the United States and Tunisia. To assure quality, Wally's owners, including Luca Bassani, the chief executive, have begun taking stakes in the companies that build its boats, and are contemplating taking Wally public.
Wally, whose boats average about $4 million, just launched an 88-foot yacht, its biggest ever, and has four more under construction. It is diversifying from sailboats to powerboats. And to expand its presence in the United States, where it gets 8 percent of its revenue, it will show the new models at the Fort Lauderdale boat show in October.
Wally put itself at the high end to try to be more recession-proof. It pioneered some innovations, featuring hydraulic keels and automated furling systems operated by remote control. Mr. Bassani, 44, who sold his family business in Italy making electrical equipment to start Wally in 1994, said the company's peculiar structure, with only about 60 employees, was intended to insulate it from market volatility.
"Historically, yards were always hit when markets contracted," he said. "We control only design and development, since design is essential, and marketing and sales, with which you manage your image."
If Beneteau, with its assembly-line approach, wants to be the Toyota of sailing, Wally clearly wants to be the Ferrari.
Domenico De Sole, a longtime sailor, is impressed. "For me, it's a passion, not a business," said Mr. De Sole, the Italian-born chief executive of the Gucci Group. "But Bassani really changed the industry. He created a class. He is the big news of the last few years."
Mr. De Sole became hooked on sailing, he explained, while living in the United States, where he studied and practiced law, and sailed his first boat in Chesapeake Bay. In 1998, after moving to Europe, he bought a Wally and sailed it in the Mediterranean, but sold it a year and a half later because he had so little time to use it. If he bought another boat, he said, it would be a Wally. "They're big, modern boats -- beautiful, fast," he said.
John Peterson, director of sales and marketing at Hunter Marine, whose 24 percent of United States sailboat sales makes it the market leader, said the combination of mass producers and niche players gave the Europeans their edge.
"Beneteau is a very formidable competitor," he said. "In 10 years they came from scratch."
But niche players, like Bavaria and Dehler, which may sell fewer than a hundred vessels a year in the United States, make a difference, too. "That's a share that someone else doesn't get a chance to sell," he said.
The Americans, scrambling to prevent the Europeans from expanding, are carrying the battle into the Europeans' own backyard. In July, the Brunswick Corporation paid $68 million to acquire Sealine International, one of Britain's most profitable boat builders; in September, Luhrs began building Hunter Marine's line of mid-size sailboats, ranging from 29 to 38 feet, at a new yard in Dorset, England.
"The Europeans build nice boats, but they're not better than American boats," said Walter Schulz, the owner and president of Shannon Yachts, in Bristol, R.I. Mr. Schulz is fighting back with custom-built yachts, including a high-end range of 43- to 47-footers that cost up to $800,000, because sailboats 40 feet long and up have been the fastest-growing part of the market. "That is the niche that everybody is eyeing," he said.
Europeans face two challenges, said Tibor Sillinger, managing director of the Federation of French Nautical Industries: keeping the affluent market rolling and expanding from sail- into powerboating. "On the world market, motorboats are 85 percent," he said. "We are first in the last segment."
Beneteau is certainly expanding. Its catamaran unit, Lagoon, launched a 43-foot power catamaran last year and showed it earlier this year at boat shows in Florida. In Italy, Ferretti, which expects revenue of about $227 million this fiscal year, compared with $165 million a year ago, sells about 30 percent of its luxury yachts, which cost up to $16 million, in the United States. To push into the lucrative market for sport fishing boats, in 1998 Ferretti acquired Bertram Yachts of Miami, a leader in the field.
Still, sail remains the European passion. And while delivery times for Beneteau's yachts remain backed up six months to a year, that could change quickly if potential buyers start getting nervous about the economy.
"It's not financial, but psychological," Mrs. Roux said, "The customer says, 'I'll wait.' "

HEADLINE: Poor Profit Outlook Sends Stocks Down 

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply and broadly as companies as varied as Dell Computer, Ford Motor and Gap provided Wall Street with further evidence that corporate profits appear unlikely to recover soon. Heavy selling in Microsoft also put pressure on the stock market. 
 The Nasdaq dropped more than 3 percent, bringing the week's loss to 4.6 percent. The S.& P. 500 was down 1.7 percent for the day and 2.4 percent for the week. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 1.5 percent, ending the week down 1.7 percent. 
 Analysts said the latest bleak messages from corporate America further unnerved investors, many of whom were already reluctant to buy stocks ahead of Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy makers. Economists expect the Fed to cut short-term interest rates for the seventh time this year, reducing them at least one-quarter of a percentage point.

Ford to Cut 5,000 Workers And Reduce Output This Fall
Ford Motor said it was eliminating 5,000 salaried jobs in North America and planned to reduce production this fall, the latest signs that the auto industry may no longer be able to prop up the stumbling American economy.
 The Standard & Poor's credit agency said it was preparing to downgrade the credit ratings of both Ford and General Motors -- a reflection of Wall Street's worries about the domestic carmakers' high costs and the growing market share of import brands. Page A1. 

Trade Deficit Widens as Exports Fall
The United States trade deficit widened in June as slower growth abroad and a strengthening dollar pushed exports to their lowest level in 16 months, the government said. The gap in trade of goods and services grew to $29.4 billion in June from $28.5 billion in May. Imports fell a third consecutive month, but the drop in exports was larger. C2.

Court Rejects Microsoft Request
A federal appeals court rejected the effort by Microsoft to delay the antitrust case against it, setting the stage for the selection of a new trial court judge soon to consider the appropriate penalties against the company. The decision was a procedural setback for Microsoft. A1.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Slow Slide Indicates Foreign Investors May Be Wary of U.S. 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The dollar's slow tumble against the euro continued yesterday and analysts are not sure where it will stop, given the concern that the American economy may not begin to rebound as soon as many had expected. The dollar has also been slipping against the Japanese yen.
 "There is a change in the mood," said Larry Kantor, the head of foreign exchange strategy in New York for J. P. Morgan. "We are in mid-August now, we are in the second half of the year and people are nervous that it is not here," he said of the economic rebound. 
 Mr. Kantor added that the pace of the flow of capital into American markets from abroad might also be slowing a little, which would put downward pressure on the dollar.
For the yen, he said the rally seemed to reflect a decision by many investors to pull out of trades in which they had borrowed in yen at nearly zero interest rates and then invested that in securities in other currencies that paid much higher interest rates. He said this shift in strategy was a reflection of a move by investors to be more cautious and was overwhelming the economic fundamentals in Japan, which he said favored a stronger dollar.
Since its high in July against the euro, the dollar has fallen 8.8 percent. In New York yesterday, the value of the euro settled at 91.74 cents, a move up from 91.35 cents on Thursday that pushed the value of the dollar 0.4 percent lower. Against the yen, the dollar is down 5 percent from its 2001 high in April. Yesterday, the dollar was up slightly, to 120.40 yen from 119.93 on Thursday.
Yet by any measure, the dollar is still strong. Since the inception of the euro in 1999, the dollar is up 21 percent and it is still up 2.7 percent for this year. Against the yen, the dollar is up 5.2 percent this year and well above its record low in the early 1990's.
One key for the dollar's outlook is how the Bush administration handles its recent slide. Currency traders are looking for any hint from the administration that it is backing off from the strong-dollar policy of the Clinton administration under Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary. If traders hear one -- or even think they do -- the dollar ought to fall further.
While the current Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, has said the strong dollar policy is intact and that he would hire out Yankee Stadium to announce any change, there have been some confusing signals. In July, President Bush spoke about both the benefits and drawbacks of a strong dollar and said that markets should set its value. Some currency traders interpreted those remarks as a hint of a weaker dollar policy and sent the currency sharply lower. Then Mr. O'Neill asserted that he was the administration's sole spokesman on the dollar and reiterated support for a strong dollar.
At the same time, there is growing pressure on the administration from many manufacturers, who have complained that the strong dollar is hurting their business. John M. Devine, the chief financial officer of General Motors, said recently that G.M. had asked the Bush administration to rethink its currency policy. "The strong dollar is frankly destroying the manufacturing capability and the manufacturing competitiveness of this country," he said.
The strengthening dollar has made the rebound of the economy much more difficult. A stronger dollar makes American exports less competitive abroad, hurting sales. In addition, a stronger dollar makes imports cheaper for Americans, hurting sales of domestic competitors.
But at the same time, the strong dollar has been a boon to Americans traveling abroad. In some parts of Europe, the exchange rate has not been this favorable since the 1980's.
The report yesterday that the trade deficit in June grew to $29.4 billion was another reminder of the impact of the strength of the dollar, as American exports fell to their lowest level in 16 months. The widening trade deficit also reflects a long-term problem for the dollar. As it and the broader current account deficit widens, America needs to attract more investment from abroad to balance its books. But if this flow slows, one consequence will be a weakening dollar.
Before the dollar tumble against the euro began, it had managed a surprising rally this year against the single European currency that now covers 12 nations, even though the American stock market was plunging and the United States economy was slowing quickly.
One reason was that Europeans still seemed to have a preference for investing in America. This preference was heightened by the fact that the Federal Reserve began to cut short-term interest rates aggressively in January, which made many believe, at the time, that the slowdown in the American economy would be over in the second half of the year.
But now that the Fed has cut interest rates six times and the economy is still struggling, "it is a scarier environment than it was in January," Mr. Kantor said.
The flow of foreign investment into the United States, which is now going into bonds instead of stocks and mergers and acquisitions, is still positive. But Mr. Kantor said it could slow suddenly. He noted that foreigners did not have to begin selling American assets to put downward pressure on the dollar. All they have to do, he said, is buy at a slower pace than in the past.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Fall Broadly on Poor Profit News From Big Names

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply and broadly yesterday, as companies as varied as Dell Computer, Ford Motor and Gap provided Wall Street with further evidence that corporate profits appear unlikely to recover soon.
 Heavy selling in Microsoft also put pressure on the stock market, after a federal appeals court ruled against the company's request to delay the government antitrust case against it. 
 "That's enough on a summer Friday to give the market a pause, and this is exactly what happens under these circumstances," said Arthur Hogan, the chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "We're seeing literally a handful of negative stories from some pretty marquee companies, and that's sort of outweighing anything we can focus on." 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 151.75 points, or 1.46 percent, to close at 10,240.78. For the week, the Dow lost 1.68 percent.
The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, dropped 63.31 points, or 3.28 percent, to 1,867.01, bringing the week's loss to 4.57 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 19.69 points, or 1.67 percent, to 1,161.97, for a weekly loss of 2.37 percent.
Analysts said the latest bleak messages from corporate America further unnerved investors, many of whom were already reluctant to buy stocks ahead of Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy makers. Economists expect the Fed to cut short-term interest rates for the seventh time this year, reducing them at least one-quarter of a percentage point.
"It's a virtual certainty there will be an easing next Tuesday," said Rory Robertson, an interest-rate strategist at Macquarie Equities in New York. "The only real outstanding question," he said, is whether it will be another quarter-point or whether the Fed will see a need to go for a half-point increase. "The ongoing weakness in equities is a clear signal that equity investors are basically giving up on a quick rebound in growth," he added.
Dell was among those hit hard yesterday, falling $2.38, to $23. Dell reported a loss of $101 million in its second fiscal quarter and warned that it would not meet Wall Street's forecasts for its earnings and sales in the current quarter because of weak demand.
The prospect of slumping demand for personal computers sent shares of other computer makers and related companies downward. I.B.M. fell $1.16, to $104.59; Cisco Systems lost 87 cents, to $16.61; and Intel tumbled $2.09, to $28.07.
Semiconductor issues were among yesterday's most battered technology stocks. Shares of Linear Technology fell $2.74, to $41.37; Texas Instruments fell $1.58, to $33.14; Applied Materials fell $2.13, to $42.57; and Xilinx fell $2.01, to $37.53. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index dropped 27.49 points, or 4.7 percent, to close at 555.54.
Ford fell $1.77, to $21.70, after it cut its earnings forecast for all of 2001 because of slowing sales and said it would eliminate 4,000 to 5,000 white-collar jobs by the end of the year. General Motors, one of the 30 Dow components, dropped $3.10, to $59.47; Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service said they might cut the credit ratings of G.M. and Ford.
Gap lost $1.92, to $21.43, after warning that its profits in its latest quarter would miss analysts' expectations. In response, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston and Prudential Securities cut their ratings on Gap's stock.
Microsoft lost $2.74, to $61.88, after the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the company's bid to delay lower-court proceedings against it while it pursues an appeal to the United States Supreme Court.
Scientific-Atlanta was the biggest loser on the Big Board yesterday, plunging $3.77, to $21.24, after the company, a maker of cable television equipment, withdrew its forecasts for its first fiscal quarter and for all of fiscal 2002, saying there was a slowdown in customer demand for new digital equipment.
PeopleSoft, a software maker, fell $2.34, to $35.85, after a judge ruled in favor of a former employee who sued the company because she was dismissed for calling attention to the company's failure to comply with affirmative action regulations.
Investors largely ignored yesterday's mixed economic data.
The Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit widened 3.3 percent in June, to $29.4 billion. But that figure was largely in line with analysts' estimates.
On a positive note, consumer confidence remains a bright spot in what is otherwise a sluggish economic environment. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 93.5 in August from 92.4 in July. The current-conditions index also rose to 101.7 from 98.6 in July.
Treasury prices rose yesterday as investors moved out of stocks and anticipated that the Fed would cut interest rates further to revive the economy. The 10-year Treasury note rose 27/32, to 100 10/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.83 percent from 4.94 percent on Thursday. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 28/32, to 99 11/32, while its yield fell to 5.42 percent from 5.48 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: FORD TO CURTAIL AUTO PRODUCTION AND CUT 5,000 JOBS 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that it was eliminating 5,000 salaried jobs in North America and planned to reduce production this fall, the latest signs that the auto industry may no longer be able to prop up the stumbling American economy.
 The Standard & Poor's credit agency responded to Ford's moves by warning that even more drastic measures were needed. S.& P. said it was preparing to downgrade the credit ratings of both Ford and General Motors -- a reflection of Wall Street's worries about the domestic carmakers' high costs and the growing market share of import brands. 
 Even with strong sales earlier this summer, G.M., Ford and Chrysler have had trouble earning profits because of the persistent strength of the dollar, which allows foreign makers to undercut their prices. And lately, sales have been gradually slowing at dealerships across the country despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate reductions that had been sustaining car purchases. 
Economists said today that the auto industry, rather than pulling the American economy along, is turning into a brake on growth that could help drag the nation into a recession. 
"Sales and ultimately production are going to go down another notch, and if that happens it might be another weight on the economy that's just too much for the economy to bear," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
Ford projected today that it would make 8 percent fewer cars and light trucks during the fourth quarter of this year than during the period last year. Such a reduction would require Ford to temporarily furlough thousands of workers across the Midwest, further damaging confidence in the economy. 
"At that level of production, that would imply some facilities would have to be temporarily idled," said George Pipas, a market analyst at Ford.
Even so, S.& P. said Ford's "efforts to reduce costs have been inadequate."
Martin Inglis, Ford's chief financial officer, confirmed today that the company had begun a broad review of its North American operations with an eye to further cutbacks by year's end.
In its announcement today, Ford said it planned to reduce its salaried work force of 50,000 managers and engineers by 10 percent through an offer of early-retirement incentives, mainly to those 50 or older with 10 or more years of service. While the great bulk of the job losses will be in the Detroit area, there will also be 200 in Canada and an unspecified number at Ford operations in Chicago and the Los Angeles area.
The company said the program's one-time cost would be $700 million, but that it would save $300 million a year in salaries and benefits. 
Ford also warned Wall Street today that even without the buyout program's cost, it expected to earn just 70 cents a share this year, instead of the $1.25 to $1.35 it predicted just a month ago. Ford shares fell $1.77, to close at $21.70. Shares of General Motors dropped $3.10, closing at $59.47.
Other automakers have not yet completed their fall production forecasts, but they are concerned about sales. "The market's not so strong this month," said an executive at one of Ford's rivals. Ford, though, is struggling more than other automakers because it has a shrinking share of the shrinking auto market. Its sales this year are down 11.6 percent, versus a drop of 4.7 percent for the market as a whole.
When sales briefly slowed last winter, auto executives made deep production cuts in January and February, and both Chrysler and G.M. rolled out early-retirement programs to reduce labor costs. But sales proved surprisingly strong in the spring as lower interest rates helped auto sales, and automakers began to schedule longer hours at factories again. 
Now, though, showrooms and factory parking lots are beginning to fill up with unsold sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans, as sales of these vehicles have slowed sharply -- except for car-based sport utilities, many of which are imported. Foreign-owned and domestic automakers are now planning to cut production of so-called light trucks in North America by 3.4 percent in September, according to Ward's Communications, an automotive data service in Southfield, Mich.
Production cuts could be even sharper, if manufacturers are being too optimistic in their projections of fairly vigorous sales as the new model year begins this autumn. 
Inventories of traditional cars are not a problem, because automakers have been more conservative about building large numbers of them. But because automakers earn almost all of their profits on light trucks, difficulties in that half of the market can quickly lead to cost cuts and job losses.
At the same time, the startling strength of the dollar in currency markets this summer has made it very hard for G.M., Ford and Chrysler to price their cars at profitable levels, even when auto sales have been fairly strong.
Foreign and domestic automakers have been engaged in a frenzy of discounting, with zero-percent loans available on many models. Foreign automakers have been able to absorb the discounts, because weak currencies have kept their costs down. This month, for example, Toyota announced that it would cut the price of its Camry sedan by $600. The cars are assembled in the United States, but many of the transmissions and other parts come from Japan.
Detroit automakers, by contrast, have watched their profits largely evaporate -- or turn into huge losses, in the case of the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler A. G. The combined after-tax earnings of Detroit's Big Three fell 61 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $2.04 billion, excluding one-time items and the cost of Ford's Firestone tire replacement program. The dollar has edged down in the last few weeks against the euro in particular, but remains far above the levels of two years ago.
As a result, all three Detroit automakers are under fierce pressure from Wall Street and credit ratings agencies to adopt cost-cutting measures, including job cuts. And cost reductions by automakers ripple quickly through the American economy, because the automakers are so enormous.
G.M. and Ford are still the only companies that each account for about a full percentage point of the nation's economic output; each is eight times the size of the Microsoft Corporation, for example. The auto industry is not just the biggest user of steel in the United States but the second-biggest user of glass and the third-largest buyer of textiles.
Sung Won Sohn, executive vice president and chief economist of Wells Fargo & Company, said that brisk auto sales had added half a percentage point to the nation's economic growth in the second quarter. Slowing sales, he projects, will subtract about three-tenths of a percentage point in the third quarter. "It's a big, pervasive impact," he said.
But Mr. Sohn and other experts cautioned that the industry is not struggling nearly as much as it had during the last recession, in 1991, which cost hundreds of thousands of workers their jobs as manufacturers shut assembly plants and auto parts factories. 
The sharp production cuts in the first quarter of this year allowed automakers to reduce inventories much more swiftly than in previous economic slowdowns. Supplies of unsold cars and light trucks have not rebounded to anywhere near the levels they reached last December.
Moreover, the economic effects of Detroit's production cutbacks and a strong dollar have been muted somewhat by the construction and expansion of numerous foreign-owned assembly plants in states like Indiana, Alabama and South Carolina. Japanese and European automakers have been gaining market share at Detroit's expense, but half their vehicles are assembled in the United States, where they provide tens of thousands of jobs.
Still, the strong dollar has clearly damaged Detroit's financial position, and the dollar's incremental retreat over the last six weeks -- it has lost 8.8 percent of its value against the euro -- has done nothing to reassure executives here. Trade figures released by the Commerce Department today showed that the nation's trade deficit in autos and auto parts widened in June, as $16.09 billion worth of automotive imports swamped the nation's $6.63 billion in automotive exports.
Stephen J. Collins, the president of the Automotive Trade Policy Council, a Washington lobbying group composed of Ford, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, said that manufacturers from many industries had opened discussions in Washington with farm groups and labor unions about forming a lobbying coalition in favor of a weaker dollar. 
"The impact of the dollar as a competitive factor causing real harm has been the subject of discussions for the last three or four months," he said.
Detroit is also suffering because foreign automakers have been building new factories in the United States to enter market segments that used to be high-profit American preserves, like full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. 
Toyota dealerships, for example, have been selling the new full-size Sequoia sport utility and Tundra pickup truck as fast as they arrive on lots, even as Ford dealerships become cluttered with unsold Expeditions and Excursions. 
And while Toyota is building its vehicles at a new plant in Princeton, Ind., both models were designed and engineered in Japan, so those costs were incurred in inexpensive yen.

HEADLINE: Moscow Journal; 
Red Square Is Suddenly Catching Up With Times

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
Red Square is such a vast affair, a sprawling stretch of windswept cobblestone and towering cathedrals, that it is easy for summer's swarms of tourists to miss its small charms, like the round dais from which czars addressed the masses. No one, on the other hand, will miss the skin cream ad.
 No one can. An immense photograph of a joyous family and its exceptionally clean pores, the billboard dominates the square's northern entrance, covering much of the breadth and four-story height of the State Historical Museum. 
 Visitors will find the sight arresting, as if someone had concealed the Treasury Building next to the White House with a gigantic banner peddling, say, yogurt.
Muscovites long ago stopped noticing. Thanks to a lucky confluence of events -- or a sad one, depending on one's point of view -- Russia's rococo old capital has become Europe's hothouse of billboards, an absolute thicket of signs beseeching the people to gamble, smoke, drink, wear skimpy underwear and expensive watches and visit strip joints, among other things.
One can gauge the explosion by the numbers. There are more than 14,000 standard-size billboards -- the 10-by-20-footers that line most streets -- up 20 percent last year alone, according to the Espar-Analytik market research firm. There are another 10,000 billboards, building-size banners and rooftop signs of other stripes.
The better measure, though, may be this one: Moscow today has roughly as many billboards as does London, and it has put up virtually all of them in the last 10 years.
As Andrei V. Beryozkin, the general director of Espar-Analytik, points out, these are the fruits of capitalism. There was a perception common across the old Soviet bloc that the presence of such luscious billboards was as sure a sign of arrival in the market economy as the old Communist slogans were of being ruled by the rigors of Marx.
The explosion of street advertising here and in other Russian cities also belies the old saw that Russians were rendered destitute by the country's two fiscal collapses during the 1990's.
Enough people are buying what the boards sell that outdoor advertising has become a $150-million-a-year business here, and big American and European companies have begun to invade the market. The most notable is the News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate, which has bought Russia's largest outdoor advertising company, APR City.
But even Adam Smith might be forced, after surveying the glut of cheesy ads that blot out Moscow's once graceful avenues, to agree that this city was at least more handsome when rooftop signs, and fewer of them, exhorted workers to greater glory instead of better vermouth, and smaller street banners praised Lenin's unswerving vision of a Communist utopia, not shoe store discounts.
While there is much wit to be found on the boards -- a long-running cigarette campaign that takes wry pokes at American power comes to mind -- taste is not a long suit. A prominent ad for dental services relies on a racist caricature.
So many boards use sex to rise above the clutter that the latest groundbreaking attempt, in which healthy young men and women seem to have literally and completely leapt out of their color-coordinated outfits, barely draws a glance.
In a way, Mr. Beryozkin said, the Soviet Union has itself to blame. "The landscape of Soviet city planners is ideal for advertising," he said. "There aren't that many major cities with a street system so well suited for placing billboards. The major highways are pretty wide, and there's room for boards."
By comparison, he said, most West European cities are rats' nests of narrow lanes suited largely for small signs, and advertising on freeways and other major suburban roads is tightly constrained.
But geography is only one of several forces driving the billboard's inexorable rise. Money, handed over and under the table, is another. Russian city governments own many buildings outright and license the placement of signs on the rest.
Billboard licensing fees net Moscow's cash-hungry government at least $25 million a year that federal powers cannot control. Both they and billboard companies have every incentive to open that spigot more.
In parts of Russia the licensing process is so greased by bribery that it has become a big moneymaker for city officials and a magnet for violence. Last week, for example, the chief billboard licenser in Novosibirsk, under verbal fire for razing billboards in an apparent attempt to shift control of the local ad market, was shot to death during a morning drive from his country home.
Askold E. Shestunov, whose outdoor advertising company Big Board controls signs in 15 Russian cities, said Moscow's licensing process was more orderly than elsewhere. But he conceded that his workers had waged fistfights with employees of a former associate who said the city had awarded the signs to him.
"Court proceedings will start in a month," Mr. Shestunov said. "We are almost 100 percent sure that everything will be decided according to the law."
That, Mr. Beryozkin indicated, may be an exception.
"Corruption of city bureaucrats in Russia is pretty much at the same level as in Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Eastern Europe," he said. "City authorities have this resource at their disposal, and they use it. It's one of the reasons outdoor is developing so fast."
Indeed, it is developing so fast that even the billboard magnates are starting to worry about where the business is carrying them.
Moscow's surfeit of licenses and deficit of any serious aesthetic or architectural rules has had predictable results. In most cities, boards are widely spaced and set back from roads. In contrast, Moscow's signs overpopulate a relative handful of major roads, hover on buildings, loom over sidewalks, hang from overpasses and pile atop and in front of each other.
On the eight-lane-and-more Garden Ring, which circles downtown Moscow, the ordinary billboards clogging what was once a flowery median have been topped by superboards nearly 100 feet high, and scores of building walls are sheathed in seven- and eight-story pitches for beer, insurance and soap.
Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov has a plan to rein in this profusion by banning large billboards from Moscow's historic center and restricting their placement elsewhere. Many billboard companies, fearful that they are creating too much of a good thing, believe it would be a good idea to keep outdoor signs limited, modest and therefore pricey.
Whether they have the discipline is another matter. Despite Mr. Luzhkov's effort to clamp down on licensing, workers still are putting up roughly 180 standard-size boards each month, securing licenses from who knows where. 
And that does not include countless other oversized billboards, bus shelter ads, street banners and, increasingly, building-size ads like the one pitching skin cream.
"It's outrageous when these large billboard structures prevent people from seeing monuments," Mr. Shestunov, of the aptly named Big Board, complained. "It cannot be justified by any amount of money.
"On the other hand, I think it's very typical of the Russian soul, this scale in everything. People like big things here."

HEADLINE: Selection Made for Treasury Dept. Post 

 BODY:
The Bush administration acted yesterday to fill the last major slot on its economic team by naming Richard H. Clarida, chairman of the economics department at Columbia University, to be assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy.
 Mr. 
Clarida's research has focused on the Taylor Rule, in effect finding that the major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, adhere to the practice of adjusting interest rates in response to inflation and excessive economic growth. The rule was formulated in 1993 by John H. Taylor, a Stanford University economist. Mr. Taylor now serves as the Treasury's under secretary for international affairs. 
 The other top economic advisers in the Bush Administration, in addition to Mr. Taylor, are Lawrence B. Lindsey, head of the National Economic Council, and R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Hubbard is also a Columbia economics professor. Mr. Clarida's nomination is subject to approval by the Senate.
Mr. Clarida, 44, who describes himself as a mainstream macro-economist, has been a Columbia professor since 1988. Before that, he taught at Yale University and served for a while as a staff economist on President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the University of Illinois in 1979 and a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1983.

HEADLINE: She Wrote The Book 

BYLINE:  By William Norwich; William Norwich is the entertaining editor of The Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Why do people let journalists go home with them? 
 Even if, as documented in the most upstanding glossies, the intercourse is of the safest sort, what motivates the rich and famous to open their portals to ink-stained wretches? 
 It is not a mystery, really. They have to. It is a requisite of capitalism. It is a rule written in an unwritten instruction manual somewhere. Arbiters are not created in a void any more than trees can fall in a forest if no one hears them. According to Thorstein Veblen, the author of "The Theory of the Leisure Class," a proudly acquisitive meritocracy keeps the system charging ahead, like a carrot dangling in front of a donkey. Someone always has to show and tell in order to stimulate acquisitive urges. Once the decorator clears out and someone else's ancestral portraits are hanging on your walls, it would be downright unpatriotic not to bring a journalist home. Unlike cable television and health care, upward mobility is an inalienable right. 
"By wearing the newest fashions, decorating and redecorating their several houses, demanding exquisite foods from their personal chefs and indulging in a frankly symbiotic relationship with the press, they create taste in this country, giving us Thorstein Veblen's conspicuous consumer as a role model," Charlotte Curtis said in "The Rich and Other Atrocities," a compilation of articles she wrote for The Times from 1963 to 1973.
Curtis's readers understood that society used to be about who one was or, at least, whom one knew, married or consorted with. Never was it about "who" one wore until the great marriage of convenience that was forged between society and a caffeinated fashion industry after World War II. While the columnist Eugenia Sheppard and the publisher John Fairchild chronicled this marriage -- in fact, they often acted as its matchmakers -- Curtis cast a wider net.
Born in Chicago, and raised in Columbus, Ohio, she began her newspaper career as a general assignment reporter with The Columbus Citizen after she graduated from Vassar in 1950. Curtis joined The Times in 1961, became the newspaper's style and family editor in 1965, an associate editor in 1973 and the editor of the op-ed page the following year. She was the first woman to have her name listed on the newspaper's senior masthead.
Curtis said that she liked to "get inside a person's skin and crawl around a bit." In 1963, when Clifton Daniel, then The Times's assistant managing editor, asked her to cover society, she seized the opportunity. The world was changing , and, for Curtis, "society" was the entire human race -- a swim perfect for uncharted, anthropological study. 
Curtis felt that society should be written about in a lively way, just as one might cover politics and sports. She also thought that political coverage benefited from dispatches with the same lively social details she observed whenever more than two people gathered. This opinion was considered quite modern in the 1960's, when the New Journalism was first being scrutinized. Curtis defined her brand of society writing like any other kind of news coverage: who, what, why, when and where and, if there was any, the significance of what happened. "We were in the business of telling the truth," she explained. "The notion used to be that all brides are beautiful, and all brides are not beautiful! But it was as though all wedding stories were written, 'and the beautiful bride wore, etc.' Well, I'm sorry, that doesn't have anything to do with reality."
She used words like they were X-rays, like Joan Didion's sentences without the conditional. "Mrs. Jerry Ohrbach wanted what she called 'an informal country house with antiques' and, after a year and a half and several million dollars she thinks that at long last she has it," Curtis wrote in April 1969.
She rewrote tirelessly on a manual typewriter and prepared extensively before an interview or event. According to copy-desk legend at The Times, Curtis could be killed but never cut. All her words fit or else she might sue for malpractice.
Curtis's mother was a diplomat who had been the first female field officer in the Foreign Service. Her father was a surgeon who taught her how to arrange the food on her plate so it represented a diorama of the internal organs of the human body. 
Asked in 1963 how she managed to succeed in what was then a man's world of journalism, Curtis replied that "feminine charms" never figured into her success. "Honey," she told the questioner, "I don't have any, damn it."
Her first marriage, right out of Vassar, ended less than three years after it began. The gentleman -- nice enough, she said -- did not understand that newspapering is not a 9-to-5 job. When she started at The Times, first as a home-furnishings and fashion reporter, she rented a small penthouse at 40 East 10th Street. Several years later, she bought it for $25,000. According to her biographer, Marilyn S. Greenwald, it amused Curtis that the apartment originally was the servants' quarters. 
Charlotte Curtis weighed about 100 pounds, including the pen and pad she took to dinner parties and always put on the table, even at Mrs. Astor's. "I'm never confused about who I am," Curtis explained. She wore pearls, French perfume and ladylike dresses, but kept a pair of royal blue sneakers in her office in case she needed to run to get a story. 
"It is not a rapier that she conceals beneath the satin and velvet of her impeccable prose -- it is a scalpel, and when her surgery is complete the victim may not even know he or she has undergone an operation," Harrison Salisbury noted. Truman Capote observed, "She has two ears and two eyes, and nothing escapes any of them."
In 1966, Curtis covered what Capote called his "little masked ball for Kay Graham and all my friends" at the Plaza Hotel. "Henry J. Heinz 2nd, the pickle king from Pittsburgh, wore nothing more complicated than a wedge from a paper plate with a nose cut through the center for his nose," she wrote, emphasizing the pickle king's nose. Curtis positioned herself behind Capote and Graham on the receiving line, and her account of the evening, which appeared in the next day's Times, included the 540 names of the guests she had written down in longhand. 
The international jet set, fueled with post-World War II enthusiasm, changed the map of society in the 60's. Society became anything, or anyone, that wasn't nailed down. Or, as Curtis put it, "overachievers who are forever exercising their money and power."
In Acapulco in 1968, Curtis found Warren Avis, an industrialist who sold his used-car business earlier in the decade, "padding around in bright orange shorts." He wanted a house large enough so "you'd never see the servants, and you don't." Avis's house was "so big, and so intricately designed that guests in the same general area aren't necessarily visible to one another." She continued: "The nearest thing to a front door is a gate with a bell at the top of a long and involved stairway that begins up the hill -- somewhere above Mr. Avis's roof. But what you do see are terraces leading to other terraces, all of which overlook the bay, a telescope for Mr. Avis to identify his pals on the yachts that come to call, several comfortably furnished marble living rooms and a bullhorn. Mr. Avis needs the horn to call anyone who has wandered off somewhere -- say, to the beach 150 feet below. But it apparently is never used to call the gang in to dinner.
"We aren't that formal,' he said."
In Anchorage, in 1966, Curtis observed Alaska's "Airplane Society," where everyone "of consequence" had his own plane and nobody walked, because "if you did, someone would think you had a flat tire or were out of gas," Mrs. Robert B. Atwood explained.
Curtis wrote: "Mrs. Atwood, a sleek, auburn-haired lady who gave black-tie dinners beneath three French crystal chandeliers until the 1964 earthquake swallowed her $100,000 log cabin, braves the snow in high-heeled black alligator shoes." The article continued: "I don't believe in putting on airs,' she said, 'but I don't see any reason why we have to be uncouth."'
For a brief period, a political conscience bestirred the swells. In November 1970, Curtis noted that spaghetti parties for 8 were replacing black-tie dinners for 24: "Whether because of the recession, inflation, Vietnam, campus unrest, the desire to get closer to nature, a new introspection or simply boredom with the old extravagances, a new lifestyle is emerging, and emerging quickly." The decorator Chessy Rayner said: "We've all changed. That giddy racing around is gone. It's a reaction to what's happening. If you're giddy now, you're insensitive to the world's problems."
That same year, Curtis covered a fund-raiser for the Black Panthers given by Leonard Bernstein and his wife, Felicia, at their Park Avenue duplex that was later chronicled by Tom Wolfe in "Radical Chic." The party's elegant slumming outraged many readers of The Times.
Bernstein asked Donald Cox, a Black Panther field marshal, about the Panthers' goals and tactics. "If business won't give us full employment," Cox responded, "then we must take the means of production and put them in the hands of the people."
Bernstein said, "I dig absolutely."
Curtis was not a snob about the American dream. She simply preferred to see its enchantments with her eyes open: "This will to move and change, whether aboard the Mayflower, the covered wagon, the automobile or jet plane, coupled with the inventiveness of a restless people who consciously fled the traditions of the Old World while eagerly seeking the frontiers of the new, has produced a frankly neophiliac quality to American life. New and different is good. Old and familiar is boring. The safe conclusion, therefore, is that whatever society is at the moment is not what it is about to become."
Curtis championed places other than Manhattan. "The decisions that matter most happen in places like Allentown and Sacramento. I'm adamant about spending all the time I can in places like that."
Cared for by her second husband, William E. Hunt, a neurosurgeon, she returned to Ohio, where she died from cancer in 1987 at age 58. 
But the comic vanities of the rich always interested her. From 1983 to 1986, she wrote a weekly column of social commentary for The Times covering the Gettys, the Basses and others prominent in Manhattan's booming 1980's economy.
"What would we do without the rich? They are the modern Medicis," Curtis once noted. "They set the pace aesthetically. Of course, I'm enough of a Puritan myself to believe a little opulence goes a long way, but I'm not sure the world would be a better place without them. After all, then everything would be polyester."

HEADLINE: The Downtowning Of Uptown 

BYLINE:  By Deborah Solomon; Deborah Solomon, a 2001 Guggenheim fellow, is working on a biography of Norman Rockwell.

 BODY:
As he so often does, David Hammons is sitting on a bench in Harlem, watching the passers-by. It is after 10 on a summer night, and the sidewalks are nearly empty. By day, 125th Street is a rock opera of sorts -- throngs of shoppers pick through bargain-price clothing as rap music blares -- but now the storefronts are dark, metal grates pulled down over their windows.
 Hammons glances across the street at the Studio Museum in Harlem, whose green-glass facade makes it look like an office building. "I want to sit facing the museum," he says in an amused voice. "I don't want to criticize the museum behind its back." 
 As it so happens, Harlem has been undergoing an art-world invasion in the past few years. The arrival of artists and their ilk might seem to be a purely positive development, although Hammons, who moved here in the 70's, sees it like this: "Harlem is under attack. White folks want it back." At 58, he himself is an art-world figure, an acclaimed sculptor who has created strange and lyrical works from plastic milk crates, barbershop hair, greasy paper bags, chicken bones and other detritus he considers emblematic of the American ghetto. During a blizzard, he once stood on a corner selling snowballs. They sold out. 
Hammons is famously elusive, so I was surprised when one day I picked up my phone and heard a voice whisper, "Do you know whose birthday it is?" 
A two-beat pause. "It's Che's birthday. Let's go out and smoke some Cuban cigars." 
Some Communist. In May, a sculpture by Hammons -- a wry, jarring piece in which a basketball hoop hangs from an ornate, Rococo-style backboard as if to suggest the unreachable goals of the urban black male -- brought $409,500 at auction. 
Hammons is a slight, sardonic man with perfect posture and the wayward charm of a contrarian. As he sits on the bench on this summer night, he instructs me in the fine art of observing pedestrians, or what he calls "reading the signs and symbols of the street." He insists there is more vitality on 125th Street than in any American art museum, where, he says, "there's nothing to look at. It's all dead. It's the grateful dead."
A teenage girl saunters by holding a big python. "When you carry anything exotic, people will look at you," Hammons says. "These people are dying for attention."
A young man appears with an African drum. "That's the first fax machine," Hammons says. 
A white jogger dressed in white whizzes by at a fast clip.
"He's probably an artist who heard about a place for rent," Hammons says, laughing ruefully.
The fashion forecasters in the art world are already posing the inevitable question: Will Harlem be the next SoHo or Chelsea? Money that migrated out of Harlem when the middle class departed to the suburbs in the 40's is beginning to migrate back, and cultural momentum has never felt as concentrated as it does right now. Artists of various races are staking out studio space, and there are enough hip galleries to attract visits from Park Avenue collectors in chauffeured cars. Bill Clinton, perhaps the most popular tenant on 125th Street, will borrow pictures for his office from the Studio Museum, which just came under the leadership of Lowery Stokes Sims and Thelma Golden, the two best-known black curators in the country.
Much else is in the works. Ask around, and you learn of ambitious projects that have yet to be publicly announced. Columbia University is drafting plans for an off-campus, open-to-the-public arts complex on 125th Street, west of Broadway. And the Museum for African Art, now in SoHo, expects to break ground next year on a blocklong building at 110th Street and Fifth Avenue, otherwise known as Duke Ellington Circle. Its planners speak of projected budgets -- of a "$40 million building" or a "$50 million building" -- as if a high price tag were roughly tantamount to the Palladian style or the Classical style as a mark of architectural distinction.
The art boom in Harlem is, of course, part of something larger. A general revival of housing stock is leading middle-class settlers to buy up 19th-century brownstones and restore them to Old World splendor. On 125th Street, the chief artery of black Harlem, the recent arrival of a Starbucks, a Disney store and the Harlem U.S.A. mall, a frosty glass box, represents what the marketing people like to call a business "flowering." Yet, in some ways, the art settlers may be more socially significant than the chain stores: art is the gilded arrow of capitalism, promising to turn vacant lots into gold. 
The truth is that a few good galleries can help a neighborhood in ways that 40 years' worth of poverty programs cannot. The middle class wants to live near art, open stores near art. The search for affordable studio space by American artists that began a century ago in Greenwich Village has proved that where art goes, money follows, and the ending is always the same: the neighborhood booms and the artists go bust, driven out by skyrocketing rents and their own restlessness, their desire for Something New.
Yet gentrification can strip a neighborhood of its character. And in Harlem that prospect is unsettling. For Harlem is not just another cool art enclave but also the most extreme and allegorical of American neighborhoods, the "race capital" of the world, as the writer Alain Locke once put it. Over the years, it has spawned its own aesthetic, one epitomized by the junk-into-art sculptures of David Hammons. He represents the populist street-based notions of art that have flourished in Harlem for decades -- and that are now clashing with museum notions of art. 
To be sure, you can't pretend that a vast divide separates museum art from street art. Hammons, for one, is a well-schooled artist who owes his street aestheticism to the assemblage tradition founded by Picasso in the early 1900's. Even his snowballs-for-sale are inconceivable without the precedent of Marcel Duchamp's "readymades." Nonetheless, in an age of numbing standardization, Harlem is one of the last places in the country that can still claim a local art culture, a culture caught up in the values of community as opposed to postmodern irony. In other words, the Harlem art boom is good for Harlem, but is it good for Harlem's art? 
Among art-worldings, it is impossible to talk about Harlem without talking about Chelsea, the Manhattan neighborhood in the West 20's that in the past few years has become clotted with galleries. Chelsea is commonly criticized as homogeneous, the avant-garde version of the suburban mall. Harlem, by contrast, offers the romance of the frontier, the mythic American grit and struggle in which art neighborhoods tend to specialize before the inevitable arrival of clothing boutiques and desserts drizzled with raspberry coulis. 
"Harlem is alive," says Jeffrey Deitch, a leading Manhattan art dealer interested in opening up shop in Harlem. "It's not fake. It's real. Chelsea was built out of nothing, and that's a defect -- it's too exclusively commercial. It's effective as a marketplace, but not much else."
Harlem, of course, also offers the lure of cut-rate rents. Ellen Gallagher, a 35-year-old painter who shows at the tony Gagosian Gallery, first became known for pristine, quietly funky paintings that look abstract but on close inspection yield up rows of minute black lips repeated like so many musical notes. "The reason I'm here is that I'm cheap," she says of her Harlem studio, adding that her monthly rent is $1,000 for as many square feet.
Other prominent black artists still on the young side speak about Harlem with a similar lack of nostalgia. "I feel no obligation to the community," says Gary Simmons, 37, who is having a survey show at the Studio Museum next year. "I'm not about Save the Whales. There's this romantic idea about the Harlem Renaissance, and that's pure garbage to me. I can't live in the past like that." 
Lately, the lofty and evocative phrase "Harlem Renaissance" has been bandied about as if it were newly relevant. But what, exactly, does it mean? The original Harlem Renaissance, which flourished in the antic 1920's, was not a renaissance at all. "It wasn't a rebirth of anything," says the cultural critic Stanley Crouch, "unless you count slave narratives, most of which were probably written by white people anyway."
The Harlem Renaissance was mainly a literary movement, the first self-conscious band of black writers in America. It produced a handful of minor poets (like Countee Cullen and Claude McKay) and one major one (Langston Hughes). But fewer Americans read poetry than dance, drink Scotch or make love, and in the popular imagination, the Harlem Renaissance is still defined -- affectionately if incompletely -- as a golden age of jazz, clubs and sex. 
If Harlem had a moment in the visual arts, it arrived a generation later. In 1941, Jacob Lawrence and Romare Bearden had studios at 33 West 125th Street, a ramshackle tenement with no heat and no locks on the doors. (It is adjacent to Clinton's current office.) Here, Lawrence produced his epic "Migration of the Negro" series, and Bearden also devoted himself to social realism. But the two artists remained tokens in an age when racism disfigured the art world, and it wasn't until the 80's in the East Village, when Jean-Michel Basquiat became an international sensation, that everything changed. His graffiti-laden paintings made the black street aesthetic attractive to white art collectors. As David Hammons says, "Basquiat was the one who crashed through the gate."
If any one place symbolizes the Harlem establishment, surely it is the Studio Museum. Dedicated to African-American artists since its founding in 1968, it has lately shed its genteel image. Lowery Stokes Sims, its director, was a curator at the Metropolitan Museum before joining the Studio Museum last year. One recent afternoon, we headed to lunch on Lenox Avenue, passing Sylvia's, the landmark soul food restaurant, "in search of the elusive salad," as Sims put it.
Sims is an understated presence beside Thelma Golden, the museum's chief curator, a petite, talkative woman of 34 who lives for contemporary art. Last spring, she organized "Freestyle," a survey of young artists that was feted by the media as a national event. (It opens at the Santa Monica Museum of Art on Sept. 28.) The exhibition came with a thesis. It introduced a generation of African-American artists whose sensibility is "post-black," as Golden says, a shorthand way of distancing the museum from the shrill racial politics of art in the 90's. 
What, exactly, is post-black art? In principle, it is an appealing idea. At a time when racism in America is said to be abating, post-black art assumes that it is obsolete to whine about a sense of victimhood. Nadine Robinson, one of the standouts in "Freestyle," is a prime example. She now has a self-portrait at the museum, a big, all-black, humorously sensual canvas that looks like a shiny shag rug. She made it from hair extensions, long strands of Chinese hair purchased by the bag. No one could mistake it for victim art; if it is pro anything, it is pro-beauty parlor. "I find it liberating to admit that I love straight hair," says Robinson, who is 32. "That's not the way of righteous blacks, who have dreadlocks and braids and don't imitate the dominant beauty aesthetic."
In some ways, the Studio Museum is much like the rest of the art world in its vulnerability to fashion and youth. Its critics accuse it of promoting "emerging artists" -- a hopeful phrase for recent art-school graduates -- at the expense of a lost generation of older black artists. They see the museum as a flashy symbol of Harlem's revitalization, offering more to outsiders than to longtime Harlemites. 
Lloyd Toone, a 61-year-old artist and retired art teacher, lives in an immaculately restored brownstone on West 121st Street. In his living room, I notice a few sculptures, free-standing heads with the blunt angularity of African wood carvings. Like so much art in Harlem, they are made from orphaned objects, in this case, old shoes gathered from local shoe-repair shops.
Toone runs a gallery out of his home, exhibiting his own work and outsider art from the South. When the subject of the Studio Museum comes up, he rolls his eyes and says, "I can't wait for Thelma to come knocking on my door and say, 'I discovered you."' 
His wife, Peggy Dillard, adds: "The Studio Museum has to embrace us as a community or they shouldn't be in Harlem. They should be on Fifth Avenue." 
"It's the Studio Museum of Harlem," he says, as if to reiterate the museum's obligations to local artists.
"It's the Studio Museum in Harlem," politely corrects his wife. Different preposition, same point.
Cynics might say that Toone's opinion is just sour grapes, the obstinate plaint of an artist who has worked in relative obscurity for decades. Yet that would not be fair, for his grievance is essentially aesthetic. While the Studio Museum may speak of a vogue for artists who are "post-black," the onerous issues of race cannot be brushed aside so summarily. Racism is real, and many artists who have endured its effects feel the museum is promoting a kind of art -- trendy, postmodern, blandly international -- that has turned the institution into a "boutique" or "country club," as David Hammons puts it.
Informed of such criticism, Thelma Golden says: "I don't have a response to that. I could give you a quote that could start a war, but that wouldn't be effective."
This is not to suggest that most Harlem artists voice a litany of complaints, a sense of disenfranchisement and fatigue. To the contrary, I was surprised by the number of artists I met who don't need the art world because they have their own art world. They specialize in community-based art, and they are less likely to exhibit in a museum than in their own homes, in tenements or even in the streets. 
Michael Bramwell is a 47-year-old artist who at times dons the uniform of a maintenance worker. For two years, he worked on a performance piece called "Building Sweeps -- Harlem," which required that he spend his Sunday mornings diligently sweeping the stoops and mopping the hallways of local tenements. He used a pine-based cleanser "to give the hallways that forest smell," as he says. 
Noble idea, but how is it any different from what a janitor does? "I am an artist," Bramwell replies soberly. "I wanted to challenge the myth that to live in Harlem means to expect crack addicts in the hallways." 
You might see Bramwell as a Minimalist of the tenements, clearing away the gunk of real life to reveal a shining ideal. On the other hand, making art for the community does not necessarily make a work of art distinguished. Leonardo's "Last Supper" also qualifies as community-based art; it was made for the folks of Milan. It is just aesthetic common sense that the best way an artist can serve the community is to create world-class art, art that will endure and enlighten over the centuries. 
Yet this view tends to get shouted down in Harlem, where other priorities prevail. "I don't want to be Matisse," says Brett Cook-Dizney, a painter with a sense of high social purpose. "My heroes are Thoreau and Gandhi and James Baldwin."
Cook-Dizney, 33, paints jumbo-size portraits of local residents -- teachers, preachers, the unemployed -- and nails them up to abandoned buildings around Harlem. He doesn't sign his portraits, insisting they are about something besides himself. They are eminently likable, big, jazzy pictures that appear to be teeming with brush strokes but in fact are done with cans of spray paint, the favored medium of graffiti artists. They are the street version of Chuck Close's giant heads.
"Part of my critique of Chuck's work is this: he's not kicking it in a democratic world," Cook-Dizney says one day over lunch at Strictly Roots, a storefront vegetarian joint where men sit playing checkers. "I wonder what the reaction to his work would be if he painted Asian maids instead of art stars."
It is impossible to know how much the Harlem gallery scene will expand in coming years. SoHo took 20 years to reach critical mass. But Chelsea became the world center of gallery mania in just two years -- it seemed to leap from one person to two people to six people to 6,000. Significantly and bizarrely, it began to flourish as an art scene before the area had any artists or even major art, just sumptuously renovated galleries in search of masterworks to hang on the walls. 
Harlem, by contrast, is full of artists but fairly devoid of galleries. There is no central gallery district. The most interesting of the contemporary-art galleries, the Project, is hard to find; it is tucked away in a modest building at 427 West 126th Street. No sign announces its presence. The place is run by Christian Haye, a tall, stylish man of 31 who began his career as a poet and art critic. Asked why he opened his gallery in Harlem, he says -- simply, brusquely, disparagingly -- Chelsea."
In the back room, you can get an advance peek at new pieces by Paul Pfeiffer. He and the gallery have made each other famous. At 35, Pfeiffer, who was born in Hawaii, has been acclaimed for his videos, which are shown on miniature screens and mingle such disparate subjects as basketball and the Bible. Last year he won the Whitney Museum's first $100,000 Bucksbaum Award, the largest prize anywhere for a visual artist, and he is having a show at the Whitney in December. Asked what he's up to these days, Pfeiffer says, as if on cue, "I've been looking for a studio in Harlem."
Pfeiffer, who is not black, has no relation to Harlem's past, but he can no doubt benefit its future. The mutually nurturing relationship between art and capitalism has often translated into real gains for a neighborhood; curiously enough, young artists intent on challenging society can wind up strengthening it simply by virtue of their presence. Granted, gentrification has its down side, pointing toward the Disneyfication of the universe. Yet only an alarmist could pretend that the art boom in Harlem will erase the neighborhood's fabled past. After all, neighborhoods can be gentrified, but people cannot. No one can gentrify David Hammons. 
We wound up lingering on the bench that night for three hours. It was light when we sat down and dark when we stood up. He sat through the sunset. He sat through dinner. He sat even when silences began seeping into our conversation, as if sitting itself were somehow the point, as if sitting were some kind of protest. A sit-down, perhaps. 
Indeed, Hammons suggested as much. "I want to sit across from the museum to show that I am not on their side," he said solemnly. "I am an artist, but I am not on the side of the art world."

HEADLINE: Hostile Environment 

BYLINE:  By Gregg Easterbrook; Gregg Easterbrook is a senior editor at The New Republic and at Beliefnet and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution.

 BODY:
Christie Whitman arrives at the home ballpark of the Lowell Spinners, the Boston Red Sox' Class-A affiliate in the old mill town of Lowell, Mass. The stadium rises atop a cleaned-up toxic-waste site and is the kind of place administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency go. It's a glinting citadel of the new and well made, wedged among boarded-up factories. But there is no crowd waiting, only a few baseball staff members. When she was governor of New Jersey, Whitman caused a stir wherever she went; many expected her to ascend either to the United States Senate or to the vice-presidential slot on the 2000 Republican ticket. Instead she now visits toxic-waste sites. "At least today is a clean day," Whitman notes. Often when she travels to inspect something, it's garbage or ooze or worse.
 This is pretty much a wasted appearance, so Whitman, who is a sports nut, decides to take batting practice. Aides urge her just to throw out a pitch, executive style. Undaunted, she steps into the batter's box and hoists a Louisville Slugger. Whitman is dressed to take cuts; she favors pant suits and sensible shoes. "If she gets a hit it's on the record; if she whiffs this is background," an aide whispers. Whitman knocks a few past the pitcher's mound. Her consolation: after this event, at least she won't be denounced. 
 Whitman's early tenure in the Bush cabinet has been rocky, to say the least. (Technically the E.P.A. lacks cabinet rank, but Whitman attends cabinet meetings, and Bush has said he favors legislation to make her America's first secretary of the environment.) She has borne embarrassments over the president's greenhouse decisions and the brunt of criticism that the new administration is anti-environment, though her own background on green issues is by and large centrist, even progressive at times. Whitman, it seems, has become the Bush administration's wind dummy. "That's what Colin Powell has been calling me at cabinet meetings, the wind dummy," Whitman explains. "It's a military term for when you are over the landing zone and you don't know what the winds are. You push the dummy out the door and see what happens to it." 
Whitman knew the job would be rough, because, she says, "in the E.P.A. it doesn't matter what the decision is, you are always making some group intensely mad." Enviros are furious if the E.P.A. doesn't impose rules, conservatives are furious if it does. Most cabinet jobs come with constituencies that have a built-in incentive to love-bomb the agency boss (with the implied promise of future cushy employment); also there's the joy of traveling around, handing out those oversize photo-op federal checks to flashing smiles. At the E.P.A., by contrast, there's just unceasing complaint and rarely a soft landing. The agency's two previous administrators -- William Reilly, a Republican, and Carol Browner, a Democrat -- were both highly accomplished, and neither left for plush jobs with big corporations or the environmental establishment. And instead of handing out checks, E.P.A. bosses spend their days telling people that they can't do what they want to do, or that they must correct mistakes at their own expense. Whitman, for instance, just handed General Electric a $480 million invoice for a dredging of the Hudson River to remove carcinogenic PCB's. 
But a role plummeting into the landing zone seems harsh even by the standards of the E.P.A. The Bush administration assumed office not knowing which way the wind was blowing on environmental issues, pooh-poohing global warming and energy conservation despite polls showing that a strong majority of voters, including most Republicans, want more done to protect nature. Now Whitman is scrambling to undo some of the self-inflicted damage. Her Hudson decision, for example, seems intended in part to avoid another brace of "Bush Cancels . . . " headlines. 
In addition to clashing with interest groups, Whitman must deal with administration figures who don't cotton to environmental niceties. As part of his energy strategy, Vice President Dick Cheney asked Whitman to review whether the E.P.A. should require emission reductions from old (mainly Midwestern) power plants and petroleum refineries that, owing to an exception in the Clean Air Act, are allowed to pollute more than new facilities. For the last several weeks, Whitman has been working through her decision on the issue, confusingly called "new source review" even though the subject is old facilities. (The decision was due to be announced Aug 17.) If Whitman decides to stand by new source review (as her office has intimated she will), Cheney and important lobbies like the Edison Electric Institute may blow a fuse. But if she does not, she'll face another kind of explosion; any action that could be seen as Whitman's easing off on pollution control to please energy industries could be devastating to her -- and the White House -- politically.
Why did Whitman want this post? "I didn't say I wanted the job; I said I took it," she replies pointedly. Whitman says she had hoped for United Nations ambassador, special trade representative or even secretary of state. Instead Bush offered her the E.P.A., maybe because he thought Whitman was the best woman for the job, maybe because a few years of making everyone "intensely mad" would diminish her as a future rival.
Not long ago, Christie Todd Whitman was perhaps the brightest female star within the Republican Party. She rose to prominence in her home state, New Jersey, with her near-upset of the seemingly invincible Senator Bill Bradley in 1990, then won the statehouse in 1993 and 1997. Her Republican credentials are impeccable: the Todds being her father, Webster, a wealthy developer and adviser to Dwight Eisenhower, and her mother, Eleanor, a Republican national committeewoman; the Whitman being her husband, John, grandson to Charles Whitman Sr., Republican governor of New York. Whip smart, conservative on economics and liberal on social issues (including abortion), she seemed a dream come true for a Republican Party short on female talent. 
Arriving at Trenton after her 1993 victory, Whitman declared New Jersey "open for business," grumbled about environmental prosecution of developers and cut the enforcement staff of the state's Department of Environmental Protection. New Jersey was then recovering from the early-1990's mini-recession, making jobs a priority for voters, while the mostly conservative intellectual circles in which Whitman traveled were aggressively anti-environmental, viewing tree huggers as enemies of prosperity. John Weingart, then an official of the D.E.P. and now at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, says that early in her governorship Whitman "gave the benefit of the doubt to anyone who had disputes with environmental rules." The protection-is-bad view would be so conclusively disproved by the combination of declining pollution and economic boom in the 1990's that today Whitman sounds almost indistinguishable from Al Gore when she says, "Ecological protection and economic development can go hand in hand." 
As the 1990's progressed, the economy strengthened and polls increasingly showed that voters wanted environmental programs, Whitman began to realign herself. She backed plans to speed cleanup of toxic-waste sites, reduce water pollution, safeguard shorelines, even to ban dog-walking on Cape May beaches to protect the piping plover. She endorsed federal action against high-polluting Midwest power plants -- the very issue she must now tackle at E.P.A. Most impressive, she put together a $1.4 billion state bond issue to place one million acres of New Jersey land into preservation status. 
Whitman then became interested in the reform of environmental law, which she views as "effective but cumbersome and too obsessed with process instead of performance." In 1996 she gave the keynote speech at Yale for the Next Generation Project, a loose coalition of academics and environmental regulators who want to replace the unwieldy web of dozens of overlapping ecological strictures with a few simple rules that give companies broad authority to make their own decisions, as long as pollution declines. Whitman has stayed close to the Yale project, which represents the environmental center: it wants improved protection but says there are too many rules and not enough cost-benefit analysis.
On Earth Day 1996, Whitman took some students canoeing on Rancocas Creek in New Jersey for a conservation photo-op. Reporters shouted questions about a Yale-inspired reform she had just proposed, to simplify state water discharge permits. Whitman shouted back that, yes, in some cases it would allow companies to pollute, but overall, water pollution would decline. It was a bad public-relations move: several editorials depicted Whitman as canoeing a scenic river after signing paperwork favored by industry. "This showed she was practicing green-scam, talking environmentalism and doing the opposite," says Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. 
Ultimately, however, nearly everything about the New Jersey environment got better under Whitman. Toxic emissions declined by half; days of dangerous smog levels declined by two-thirds. Thousands of toxic-waste sites and landfills were cleaned up. The Delaware River's health improved spectacularly. Recycling hit 60 percent, the best in the nation. But then, most environmental trends in most states were positive during the 1990's. Acid rain, a big issue of the first Bush presidency, has vanished from the political radar because acid-rain emissions went down so rapidly in the past decade. Whitman and Bush would come to Washington after a period in which all forms of pollution except greenhouse gases declined -- and yet polls show large pluralities believe pollution to be increasing. It's a recipe for unsettled politics.
As the 2000 elections approached, many expected Whitman -- barred by state law from seeking a third term as governor in 2001 -- to run for the Senate seat being vacated by Frank Lautenberg. Having nearly knocked off the popular Bill Bradley when she was still a virtual unknown, she might have seemed a shoo-in to defeat the Democratic political novice Jon Corzine. Whitman began preparing for a run, then stopped. She attributes her withdrawal to money, which Corzine rolled in. "When I started raising money for the Senate I went to 50 fund-raisers in just one month." she says. "How was I supposed to do the governor's job?" 
But there was also the real chance that if Whitman ran for the Senate she would have lost, possibly badly. Both her statehouse victories came by one-point margins over weak opponents. And throughout the 1990's, New Jersey grew increasingly Democratic; Gore would take the state in a walkover, and Corzine won despite minimal qualifications. Whitman had yet another incentive to get out of New Jersey politics -- to stay one step ahead of the posse. She had enacted state tax cuts, and the fiscal bill was about to come due. Remaining in the statehouse for the final year of her term would have forced Whitman to deal with a budget mess -- to say nothing of a racial-profiling mess, a lying-judge mess and the latest New Jersey auto-insurance mess. Perhaps that Metroliner ride to Washington would be appealing, even for a hot-seat post.
Whitman came to Washington determined to make the best of the office she merely "took." She steeped herself in environmental arcana, phrases like "combined sewer overflow" and "mercury deposition" tripping off her lips. She vowed to work with enthusiasm, almost like a candidate -- she has already traveled to all of the E.P.A.'s 10 regions and met with dozens of green and brown (corporate) groups, from the League of American Bicyclists to the National Pork Producers Council. 
But Whitman had scarcely been confirmed when she had her first wind-dummy experience. She flew to Trieste on Feb. 28 to meet the G8 environmental ministers and there declared that the Bush administration supported mandatory reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions, a commitment of the Kyoto global-warming treaty negotiated by the Clinton administration. Whitman did not clear her comments with the White House but did know that a Bush position paper said he favored carbon dioxide controls. Whitman flew home from Italy, and a week later Bush announced that he was abandoning such controls and called Kyoto "fatally flawed." International commentary called Whitman humiliated, cuckolded; every pundit in America spun out a column on how bad she looked. Greg Wetstone of the Natural Resources Defense Council said Whitman "suffered the most immediate and visible loss of clout ever for a cabinet officer." Some editorial pages called on her to resign. 
Whitman appealed to Bush to change his mind on Kyoto; she is the highest-ranking office holder ever to lead the E.P.A., and, as a fellow former governor, someone who can look the president in the eye. She wrote a passionate memo that someone leaked, to embarrass her. She has since talked to Bush many times about global warming at cabinet meetings but has never met with him alone on the subject. So far, she has won only his commitment that "America needs to have something that we are for." The idea that something must be done about greenhouse gases -- either through Kyoto or through an American domestic initiative -- has won prominent supporters close to Bush, including Powell, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, the deputy chief of staff, Josh Bolten, and the White House policy advisers Gary Edson and John Bridgeland, two moderates. The internal White House working group on climate change has been more or less taken over by Rice, to whom Whitman now speaks at least once a week, Rice having become her main contact within the administration's inner circle. That the right has begun to censure members of the global-warming team is a sure sign it is making progress with Bush; the columnist Robert Novak recently blasted the group for "pressing the president to look more and more like Al Gore." Whitman or Powell or both may attend a Kyoto conference in Morocco this fall, and they won't go unless they have something to announce. 
While commentary focused on the Greenhouse flip-flop, from Whitman's perspective the question was where it left her leadership. Whitman says that when Bush offered her the job at E.P.A., he told her the administration's ecology policy-making role would be hers alone. "I asked him what the role for the Council on Environmental Quality would be," Whitman says, referring to the White House advisory organization, "and he said: 'I don't even know what that is. I want you to be the environmental person.' " 
Defeated for the moment on global warming, Whitman decided to take the president at his word and make environmental decisions on her own. Her next big move: postponing a regulation limiting arsenic in the water supply.
Coming just a week after the Kyoto flip-flop, Whitman's arsenic decision seemed to confirm the worst suspicions about the new administration. News accounts featured adjectives like "stunned" and "outraged." In a typical comment, Bill Press of CNN declared that the administration had "declared war on the environment." News reports all pointed out that the National Academy of Sciences had conclusively shown a need to reduce arsenic levels. And though she had not actually canceled arsenic protection, but rather held for review a rule that wouldn't have taken effect until 2006, she concedes that it was "a dumb decision on my part politically, really dumb." Whitman adds that the dumbness was hers alone. Per her portfolio, she did not consult anyone in the White House; they learned of the decision in the newspaper, like everyone else. "Politically, I should have just let it go and allowed the courts to decide," Whitman says. Had she not held the arsenic rule, municipal water agencies would have sued to block it. Years hence a judge would have imposed a settlement, and the judiciary would have taken the blame for any faults in the outcome.
Following the one-two punch of kyoto and arsenic, conventional wisdom assumed that Whitman really had, as Bill Press put it, "declared war on the environment." Yet the majority of her official acts so far have been to uphold Clinton-Browner positions. Whitman imposed the maximum Hudson River cleanup. She has put into effect powerful new rules on wetlands protection and pesticide reduction. She endorsed Clinton's extremely strict standard for ground-water protection at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste storage site. She upheld a rule requiring power plants upwind of national parks to reduce emissions until the parks are clear. She signed a treaty banning dangerous "persistent organic" chemicals found in pesticides. Cheney notwithstanding, she has issued orders that Midwestern power plants reduce emissions. 
Most important, Whitman mandated that refineries alter diesel fuel to remove pollutants. A principal reason smog is declining is that gasoline has been reformulated to remove pollutants; Whitman's order extends the standard to diesel fuel. This is significant because public-health studies have shown diesel pollutants to be leading factors in both asthma and premature deaths from respiratory diseases. But hardly anyone knows Whitman took this action, imposed over the protests of the oil industry, Bush's core constituency. The way in which it was announced reflects how tone-deaf the administration is regarding the environment. The diesel rule received no political rollout, perhaps because it was started under Clinton, and the White House has shown great difficulty in saying anything that boils down to "Clinton was right about this." 
Another missed political chance came a few weeks ago, when Whitman offhandedly told a Senate hearing that she was working on a Yale-style proposal to simplify the rules involving reduction of emissions from power plants. Multiple, overlapping sets of rules would be replaced by a single standard that simply required overall pollution from power production to decline, but left it up to plant managers to figure out the details and authorized them to trade emissions rights in search of the cheapest solutions. This is the approach that has worked so well at cutting acid rain. But the plan was given a feeble name, the "multipollutant approach," which makes it seem as if the E.P.A. favors a greater variety of pollutants. With gazes fixed on wedge issues and the 2002 vote, Democrats have already begun calling Whitman's idea another "rollback."
Will Whitman become isolated as the moderate, abortion-rights representative in a mainly conservative administration? She bristles at this question, pointing out that fellow cabinet officers like Gale Norton, secretary of the interior, and Ann Veneman, secretary of agriculture -- Whitman has lunch with them monthly -- are also in favor of abortion rights, "and you never hear anything about that." She has learned from her experience with Kyoto, however, to listen more closely to the White House's script. After initially playing down the idea of conservation, the administration, especially the vice president, has recently been emphasizing it. So Whitman has adjusted her schedule to spend more time talking about E.P.A.'s Energy Star program, which endorses products that reduce energy use. She has not campaigned for greenhouse rules in public, a la John McCain and Joseph Lieberman, so as not to open a split with the president. Some part of her may sense inevitable confrontation, however. Asked how long she expects to stay at E.P.A., Whitman says that the president has her resignation letter in his desk. Reminded that it is tradition for cabinet officers to file an undated resignation letter, she explains, "What I mean is, I've told him that if I have to go he shouldn't think I would make it awkward." 
For some reason deeply seated in the party's psyche -- maybe that it simply cannot bring itself to admit that regulations are sometimes good for us -- Republicans keep failing to come to terms with environmental sentiment. Environmentalism is to Republicans what defense is to Democrats: the issue they just don't know how to deal with and really, really wish would go away. Bush is only the latest Republican leader to stumble on the environment, and Christie Whitman is trying to change that. But she may well end up tossed out of the plane just to see where she lands.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: Salient Facts: Bedbugs; 
Sleeping With The Enemy

BYLINE:  By Reena Jana 

 BODY:
 This summer, if the concierge at your favorite hotel says, "Don't let the bedbugs bite," take note. Bedbugs -- flat, reddish brown, wingless creatures -- are enjoying a feeding frenzy these days. Surviving on human blood, they attack only at night and leave red streaks on a victim's sheets as their calling card. Orkin, the Atlanta-based pest control company, estimates a 20 percent nationwide increase in bedbug calls in the last two years. Florida's hotels in particular have placed 10 times as many bedbug-related calls to fumigators since 1999, according to a University of Florida study released last month. Increased international tourism is to blame, suggests Phil Koehler, the urban entomologist that led the research team. And no hotels -- from hip boutique upstarts to rundown economy chains -- are safe. Tourists unwittingly carry them in their luggage, says Koehler, so every hotel is a potential target. "Bedbugs are just as happy eating in a five-star resort as a youth hostel."

BEDBUGS? NOT IN THIS HOTEL
Unsurprisingly, few hotels are willing to admit they might have a problem. "Our guests should safely assume that there are no companions with them in our rooms besides those that they've invited," says Vivian Deuschl, vice president of public relations for the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. But hotels may not even know bedbugs are hiding out in their plush sofas or heavy draperies. They can live on a single feeding of blood for up to six months, so even an unrented room could harbor them without any telltale signs. And many attacks go unreported; people often attribute their red welts to the more socially-acceptable mosquito.

TERMINATORS FOR HIRE
Hotels are also hush-hush about bedbugs because they're expensive to exterminate. On average, it costs about $300 per room per treatment -- not counting two weeks of lost room income. That's a big bill if the entire premises is treated, like one 173-room hotel in San Francisco that recently underwent fumigation. If you want to check your room, put a glue board under your bed. In the morning, show the manager if you've caught some, suggests Mike Waldvogel, an entomologist at North Carolina State University, "and tell them things will get ugly if they don't acknowledge your bedbug complaint." Some hotels may shrug off evidence. "Everyone knows even the finest restaurants have rats, so some of the best hotels will get bedbugs," says Mara Miller, director of housekeeping at Miami Beach's swanky Delano Hotel. "Travelers should remember they're the ones who might be bringing them into the hotels in the first place." Reena Jana

HEADLINE: Town Learning to Cope Without Millstone 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
FROM the time Northeast Utilities started building the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, it has been a financial windfall for Waterford, which taxes the property. At one point, the police officers in this town of 18,000 people drove modified Volvo sedans. Just this year, the town "found" $2.7 million that had been sitting in forgotten accounts.
 But electric deregulation, which has put a few more dollars a month into the pocket of most people in the state through lower utility bills, has been devastating for Waterford. The three Millstone generating plants, which once paid 80 cents of every tax dollar collected in town, now pay only 58 cents, and that will drop to about 26 cents over the next 10 years. 
 For Waterford, a small town heavily dependent on a single taxpayer, the declining assessment of the Millstone plants is the fiscal equivalent of three of the five New York boroughs suddenly being declared tax exempt. 
"Intellectually, those people who pay attention to what's going on do know it's coming," said John W. "Bill" Sheehan, a member of the town's Representative Town Meeting, a legislative body. "But I think many folks won't be conscious of its real impact until they get their first tax bill showing the increase."
The town has been given some breathing room through state legislation that will subsidize 100 percent of the tax loss this year, declining 10 percent each year until the subsidy is phased out in 10 years.
"It eliminates a rapid change, so the tax increase can be more gradual, and it allows the town to do more extended planning about how to handle the problem," Mr. Sheehan said. "It's not an sudden, stabbing, debilitating pain, but maybe you want to call it a steady ache that we can learn to live with."
First Selectman Paul B. Eccard said surveys had shown that people support a combination of tax increases and a reduction in services to address the revenue shortfall, but in an era when some towns are balking at a 4 percent increase in taxes, Waterford is looking at a minimum 7 percent increase every year for the next seven years.
"People are going to judge whether we're making a valid case for school class sizes, the amount of police coverage, the quality of our fire protection," Mr. Eccard said. "We'll be making the hard decisions about what programs are essential to the quality of life that we have, and what we should be paying for them."
But the town's boards and commissions are finding it difficult to get the message across. Randall H. Collins, Waterford's superintendent of schools, said the Board of Education tried last year to eliminate a program for gifted students as a cost-cutting move, but a public outcry forced its restoration.
"Every time you touch a program, there's an opposing force, and it seems it goes back in some form, but we're not going to be able to do that as we go through the budget the next few years," Mr. Collins said. "It's very tough to dismantle these programs."
From the 1960's into the late 1980's, as the Millstone complex was constructed, the tax revenue from the plants increased steadily. As the town entered the 1990's, officials were aware that over time, depreciation of the plants would cause the tax bills to drop, but two things accelerated the process considerably.
Two years ago, Northeast Utilities decided to shut down the aging Millstone 1 nuclear plant years ahead of schedule, as the cost of keeping it going outpaced the money it could make.
Then, last year, Northeast was required to sell the plants as part of the state's electric deregulation process. At the time, Millstone's assessed value was $2.9 billion. Based on the $1.3 billion price Dominion Resources of Virginia paid for Millstone, that assessment could have dropped to just more than $900 million. Dominion and the town, however, reached an agreed assessment of $1.04 billion for the next two years.
"We wanted to work very closely with the town to arrive at a mutually beneficial figure, so we tried to be flexible," said Pete Hyde, a spokesman for Dominion. At the same time, though, the plant could not agree to a tax bill that was too high because it must be able to compete in a deregulated energy market.
The new assessment makes Millstone's tax bill $12.3 million this year, not the $34.1 million the town had anticipated. If the state had not stepped in with a $21.8 million tax subsidy, the town would have been in serious trouble. 
Other towns are getting subsidies as well, for fossil fuel generating plants that are suddenly valued at much less than they were being assessed. But no town lost anywhere near the percentage of its tax base as Waterford.
Mr. Eccard, the first selectman, said the subsidies were fair for a number of reasons. First, Waterford hosted the nuclear plants, which provided almost two-thirds of the state's power at one point, when no other town wanted them. And because its tax base was so large, Waterford received almost no state education aid or other grants over the years.
"Millstone station is still a huge source of power for the entire northeast corridor. It is obviously a regional resource that is vital to our economic health and quality of life," Mr. Eccard said. "The value of these plants went down largely because of the deregulation, so the legislation providing the transition payments is fair and reasonable."
But the subsidies only prolong the problem, because next year, and every year until it disappears, the subsidy declines by $2.2 million.
If the town were to rely on tax increases to make up the difference, the bill for a house valued at $100,000 would rise from about $1,640 this year, to $2,924 in 10 years, not including any normal inflation.
Jared S. A. Clark, president of the Government Consulting Group of Franklin, Mass., which was hired to recommend ways for the town to adjust to its new circumstances, said he has studied other towns facing a loss of a major taxpayer, but Waterford is one of the more extreme cases.
"The choices that they are going to have to make are going to be very difficult," Mr. Clark said. "Often they are going to involve people's jobs and services that people are receiving. It will probably result in considerable tension between the public employee unions and the community."
The study compared Waterford's government to five other towns of comparable size -- Montville, Stonington, Berlin, Bethel and East Lyme. It found that Waterford spends, on average, one-third more on public services than the other towns. The school budget was about 15 percent higher than the average in the other towns, while spending on the police department was twice the five-town average.
The study made more than 140 recommendations, everything from using a single purchasing agent for the town government and schools, to closing one or more of the five fire stations in town.
George A. Peteros, the chairman of the town's Finance Board, said despite the attention given the problem at the local level, many people still have not accepted it.
Mr. Peteros said the town commissioned a survey of 1,000 residents that asked how they felt about an increase in taxes and what level of increase was tolerable. 
"The outcome of the survey was, no one wants to see a reduction in service, and yet at the same time, when asked what is the maximum tax increase would be acceptable, 57 percent said a 3 percent increase was the absolute maximum," Mr. Peteros said. "The two results were pretty inconsistent. People want to maintain the services, but they don't realize what it is going to cost to support them."
Mr. Peteros said he thought some portion of the shortfall can be made up without significant impact on services. For instance, the town's five fire companies each have two pumper trucks that are replaced every 15 years, at a cost of about $300,000 each. Instead, the town could replace them every 20 years, which is typical in other towns.
The selectmen have also begun reviewing every town government job when someone retires or leaves for another position. In the past when someone retired from the police department the town routinely filled it, but now dozens of positions have been eliminated by just shifting work.
"For a long time there was a situation where we were awash with cash and there was no motivation to be sure we were doing things efficiently and effectively," Mr. Peteros said. "Now it seems like culture shock."
Mr. Collins, the schools superintendent, said the town should be careful not to pursue false efficiencies, however. One recommendation made in the consultant's report called for the schools to buy their own fleet of vans for special education students, rather than use contract vehicles, but the schools found it would actually cost more money.
The school board is also committed to small class sizes, particularly in kindergarten through third grade, and the public supports that as well, he said, even though larger classes might be less costly.
"It's going to be tough, but I think by and large people are working together on this, and we'll get through it," Mr. Collins said. "At the end of 10 years, we'll still have great schools, and by the standards of the entire state, we will still be a wealthy town. It's important that we deal with this in a rational way so we don't destroy what Waterford is all about just because we think the sky is falling."

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Half Slip, Full Slip, Pink Slip

BYLINE:  By JUDITH LEDERMAN 

DATELINE: KATONAH 

 BODY:
FOUR women, all going through major job changes, sat in a parlor room at a Katonah salon. Instead of eating Oreos and bemoaning the stress of their situations, they were changing their images, relearning how to dress, accessorize and apply makeup to create a new look to go along with what would hopefully be new business luck.
 They were getting advice from Sari Martin, a Somers-based image consultant who has worked in Westchester for more than 20 years. Ms. Martin is the mastermind behind the "Pink Slip Workshop Series." 
 She works with each woman to discover the hues that complement her coloring, and the clothing styles that enhance her body type and personality. She created the workshop series last September to address the growing number of women who were facing layoffs, job uncertainty and other employment-related issues in a weakening economy. 
"Change is natural during life cycles, but getting pink-slipped is not," Ms. Martin said. "It is a crisis that forces us to re-evaluate. In that process it is important to determine who you are. Through these workshops, women learn to express who they are on the outside and it gives them more confidence on the inside."
At this particular session, the women had color and style sessions back-to-back in The Hair Wharf, a salon in Katonah. Along with getting advice, the women shared war stories about the corporate world, and discussed a shared desire to change their business luck.
Dorothy Kelly, a Riverdale resident, had lost her post as an executive recruiter. Although she had averaged about one interview a week since she was laid off in January, she was discouraged. She was considering resurrecting her teaching degree. Dressed in a long beige skirt and plum blouse, Ms. Kelly's clothes and makeup did not tell the story of who she really is, Ms. Martin said.
Ms. Kelly was surprised to learn that a trim, tailored look is more appropriate for her than her long skirt, and that her makeup colors need brightening. She haltingly sampled the color palette Ms. Martin introduced to her. Her face took on a warm glow.
Louise Sieviec had recently quit her job as a graphic designer for a company in Westport, Conn., that sells tour packages to travel agents, and was embarking on a new career in the field of health and nutrition.
"I hated what I did," she said. "I felt as if I were trapped in the wrong career. Now I'm on the right track, but I hate everything in my wardrobe."
Ms. Sieviec, a spirited personality, felt she looked "blah." She loves bright colors, but had no idea how to buy colors that make her look good. Dressed in a blousy dark gray shirt over leggings, Ms. Sieviec had brought items from her closet for Ms. Martin's input. Ms. Martin smiled mysteriously.
"By the time we're through, you will understand which are right for you and which to give away," Ms. Martin promised.
Ms. Martin studied her angular face and scrutinized her body. After determining that her colors are "warm spring," the group learned that Ms. Sieviec looks best in straight, boxy medium prints and angular lines. Ms. Martin also recommended that she lose the round glasses.
Gabrielle Thomas, a Mount Vernon graduate student employed as a social worker, was getting ready to launch a dot-com business. A career counselor recommended that she meet with Ms. Martin before presenting her proposal to venture capital firms.
According to Ms. Martin, Ms. Thomas has the natural drama that comes along with her six-foot height, but she hates wearing makeup beyond mascara and lipstick, and complains that she never is happy at the makeup counter and rarely buys anything. 
Ms. Martin explained that the cosmeticians were probably applying a yellow-based tone -- all wrong for Ms. Thomas's "deep winter" look. She applied blue-based tones and Ms. Thomas liked what she saw.
Lydia Sugarman, a Manhattan resident, was laid off last July from her job as managing editor of an online consumer advisory service. 
Ms. Sugarman didn't want to be an employee again, and had decided to build her freelance marketing business, and embark on Internet ventures of her own.
Like many New Yorkers, Ms. Sugarman has a lot of black in her wardrobe. She said black is powerful and it doesn't show dirt.
But when Ms. Martin put a turban on her hair and held different colors up to her face, she found that black was not in Ms. Sugarman's palette of suggested colors. Ms. Martin told her to use muted autumn colors like camel -- a tough pill to swallow for the "lady in black," but a look that she begrudgingly agreed does look good on her. The gamine style of clothes that Ms. Martin recommended turned out to be more fun than she thought they would be and she was relieved to find that there were things in her closet that met with Ms. Martin's suggestions. 
"I realize now that I give people a different impression than the image I thought I was projecting," Ms. Sugarman said. "I needed a more polished look -- without going the power suit, bow-tie look of the early 80's." 
Ms. Martin is used to creating business success stories. One saleswoman who came to Ms. Martin for advice a year ago is now a top performer in her company. Another woman went to Ms. Martin when she decided to leave her own business and re-enter the corporate world. She landed an executive job with a Fortune 500 company after only three interviews.
"When you go on an interview, you are dressing for yourself as well as for the person with whom you are interviewing," Ms. Martin said. "If you aren't comfortable, then you look and feel like you're wearing somebody else's clothes."
Ms. Martin offers two three-hour workshops: a color and makeup session, which helps women identify what is unique about their personal coloring -- hair color, eye color and skin tone -- and shows them how to enhance it with makeup and the colors they wear; and a style session, which helps them determine what lines of clothing are suited to their body shape, what lengths and accessories are appropriate, the perfect hairstyle and glasses, and how to reflect personal style through clothing.
Each session costs $145. Makeup costs extra, as do additional personal shopping sessions, eyeglass shopping sessions or closet evaluations, where Ms. Martin goes through a customer's closet and recommends what to keep and what to discard.
Women aren't the only ones who seek Ms. Martin's help. She also does workshops for men, although the demand is far smaller than it is for women's workshops. Often the men who come to Ms. Martin are changing a career or seeking a promotion, or are single and want to learn how to attract women.
Three weeks after the initial session, the women have an impromptu reunion to discuss their progress. Ms. Kelly is still unemployed and interviewing. Ms. Sugarman is picking up freelance business and using passion and fortitude to run her Web sites, Girl Groove and The Good Egg, in hopes of generating income. She's even starting to wear lighter colors, and bought a camel-color dress with a snakeskin belt and purse.
Ms. Thomas is wearing makeup and will take a one-week course in e-commerce for small businesses. She feels more confident as she puts together her venture capital proposal.
Ms. Sieviec has made the most dramatic change. Her hair is neatly coiffed, a shade lighter, and she is wearing a camel-color pants suit and funky rectangular glasses. Her makeup is perfectly applied. She confesses that much of her wardrobe has ended up at Goodwill, and that she drove the scarf saleswoman at Lord & Taylor nuts as she went through about 150 scarves.
"The inside is now matching the outside," Ms. Thomas said. 
Ms. Martin beams at her disciples, asking about each one's business success.
"The workshops help people see themselves more clearly," she said. "I don't want to change who they are. I want to help them stand more fully in their own light.

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
Arrow's New Boss Faces an Early Trial by Fire

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, Arrow Electronics, the giant distributor in Melville, was well on the way to a third consecutive quarter of record-setting sales and earnings, and its new chief executive, Francis M. Scricco, engaged in a bit of prognostication. In the company's earnings report last October, Mr. Scricco said that he saw no signs of a fundamental shift in the industry nor any indications of a market shift anytime soon.
 Whoops. That forecast will not land Mr. Scricco in the seers' hall of fame. Since Arrow's halcyon days last summer, the market pendulum has indeed swung. On July 24, Mr. Scricco announced he was moving forward with plans to lay off a total of 1,500 workers -- about 11 percent of Arrow's global work force of 14,000 -- and to close some operations. One way or another he plans to pare expenses by $100 million at Arrow, Long Island's largest publicly traded company, which sold $12.9 billion worth of electronics components last year. 
 The fundamental market shift had arrived, and in spades. 
Mr. Scricco, who is called Fran and whose last name is pronounced SCREE-coe, does not hide from bad news, and when he met with a reporter recently, he was prepared with charts that showed that Arrow's (and the industry's) last two quarters were the worst, in terms of declining sales, in the company's history. For the company and its investors, what consolation there is of late lies in the fact that competitors are also in a slump as purchasing executives postpone or cancel deal after deal.
"This has been a very severe downturn," said Steve B. Fox, a Merrill Lynch analyst in New York. While Arrow is fundamentally an excellent company, he said, "in this environment they can't help but be hit hard."
"We're talking about zero new orders industry-wide," Mr. Fox added. "You can't really go any lower."
His pessimism is shared by other analysts, who say that cyclicality is a given. The boom gears up when times are good, companies move forward with technology investments, and manufacturers pump profits back into new factories. Next, the market is flooded with more products than customers can buy, prices drop and profits wilt. And then the cycle resumes again.
This downturn's severity has been unusually fierce, and this spring it cut deeply into Arrow's profitability. The company posted profits of $7 million, or 7 cents a share, for the three months ended June 30, down a whopping 92 percent from the $84 million, or 84 cents a share, a year ago.
For Mr. Scricco, 51, the timing could not have been worse. It was just a year ago that he moved into the chief executive's office, succeeding Steve Kaufman, his mentor. Mr. Kaufman, who remains Arrow's chairman, is currently is on the faculty of the Harvard Business School, leaving day-to-day operations to Mr. Scricco.
Mr. Kaufman, 59, a former partner in the McKinsey worldwide consulting firm, groomed Mr. Scricco as his successor at Arrow for three years. He recruited him from Fisher Scientific International, the billion-dollar manufacturer and distributor of scientific equipment and supplies in Hampton, N.H., where Mr. Scricco was one of three group presidents. Before that, he was the president and chief executive of Inglis Ltd., a Whirlpool subsidiary in Canada. 
In moving into Mr. Kaufman's old position, Mr. Scricco replaced an almost mythic figure, said Robin B. Gray Jr., the executive vice president of the National Electronics Distribution Association in Alpharetta, Ga. "Steve is a charismatic visionary who helped lead the whole industry out of the warehouse era and into a new era" of "just in time" parts management, Mr. Gray said.
"Steve modernized the industry," he continued. "Fran has some mighty big shoes to fill."
As soon as he became chief executive last year, Mr. Scricco was immediately caught up in finishing the details of a major deal put in motion by Mr. Kaufman: the $840 million acquisition of Wyle Electronics from Veba Electronics, a subsidiary of Veba A.G. of Dusseldorf, Germany.
Mr. Scricco said he was continuing the company's strategic emphasis on value-added services begun under Mr. Kaufman. Arrow is trying to position itself as a vital link in its clients' logistics, rather than being just another vendor competing on price alone. But he acknowledges that the market has been hesitant to accept the new model.
Mr. Scricco said that despite some resistance, customers appreciate a distributor that does more than take orders. In this new environment, the distributor's employee teams up with the client, often spending hours at the client's office or plant, working with engineers and product developers in forecasting which components will be needed and when.
"Essentially we are a service business," Mr. Scricco said. "The service we offer is making sure the right product arrives at the right time in exactly the right amount."
Analysts say that this is a credible way to overcome the industry's notoriously tight profit margins, and the attempt to recast itself as a supply-side partner is not unique to Arrow. Avnet, its archrival in Phoenix, is following a similar path. The two companies divide just over half of the $38 billion a year North American market, leaving the other half to hundreds of smaller companies. Arrow and Avnet compete in similar head-to-head fashion in the global market as well.
Some analysts contend that the Arrow-Avnet rivalry shifted in Avnet's favor after it acquired Kent Electronics earlier this year. Smaller and perhaps more nimble companies may have an advantage over both Arrow and Avnet as logistics replace price as the major selling point, said Clarke Walser, an industry consultant in Arlington Heights, Ill.
"For a number of years, we've been seeing the big companies grow bigger and swallow up the smaller ones," Mr. Walser said. "Over the next few years, we may be seeing smaller companies growing faster and taking market share."
Robert Damron, an analyst at Tucker Anthony Sutro Capital Markets in Milwaukee, said that despite Arrow's current problems, he was optimistic about its future. "Arrow is viewed by the investment community as one of best-run electronic component distributors in the world," he said. "It's been very aggressive over the last decade, expanding globally in terms of internal growth and making dozens of acquisitions both inside the U.S. and internationally."
"This is one of the leading electronic distribution companies in terms of size, profitability and return on investment," he added. "Arrow has consistently been one of the best-performing distributors in the industry."
Mr. Scricco, who is often described as a team player, said he had gotten "pretty emotional" when he addressed a company-wide employee meeting to announce the planned layoffs and cutbacks, but he added that a number of employees had sent him e-mail messages saying they understood the action.
Mr. Kaufman said he felt bad about the timing of his successor's promotion, which exposed Mr. Scricco to a trial by fire early in his tenure. "Having been through five cycles myself, I stepped down when I did at a time when we expected the up cycle to continue another five quarters," Mr. Kaufman said. "I thought Fran would have the chance to assemble his own team and make whatever changes he needed to make" when times were flush. Instead, "two quarters later the industry totally tanked," Mr. Kaufman said, and Mr. Scricco had to deal with the crisis early on.
Mr. Kaufman expressed confidence that his successor would get through the current downturn. "What I learned during 18 years with Arrow," he said, "was that the bottom is never quite as dark as it seems, and during good times you're never as brilliant as you think you are."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Tarrytown; 
A Historical Stretch Along the Hudson

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
ONE recent summer evening, Cathy and Richard Chulla and their two daughters spread a blanket along the Hudson River and sat down to enjoy a refreshing breeze coming off the water. 
 The family was part of a crowd of Tarrytown residents who had gathered by the river that sultry evening not only to cool off but to watch an outdoor movie sponsored by the village. Tarrytown's proximity to the Hudson and the availability of such public events were two reasons the Chullas had limited their recent search for a house to Tarrytown. 
 "And the sunsets, too," Mrs. Chulla added. "They're among the most beautiful in the world." 
Mr. Chulla, an employee of Sleepy Hollow's water department, and his wife, who teaches second grade in Tarrytown, recently bought a three-bedroom house in the village for $399,000 after looking for two years. They had refused to consider other towns because they wanted to live where they "could walk anywhere, day or night, and feel safe," Mrs. Chulla said.
The mayor of Tarrytown, Paul Janos, said the village's quality of life "isn't that easy to find anymore 25 miles outside of Manhattan." Mr. Janos, a part-time mayor, who also owns the Main Street Cafe, said elected officials had worked to "keep a handle on overdevelopment" and the ills that often accompany it 
"For one thing, we've recently upzoned to decrease future density," said Mr. Janos, who was born in Tarrytown 46 years ago, just as the Tappan Zee Bridge opened. 
The bridge, which provided a link over the Hudson between Westchester and Rockland Counties, now carries I-287, Westchester's major east-west highway, and I-87 leading south toward New York City. Its opening was a watershed for Tarrytown, prompting development of office parks and hotels and generating new tax dollars. But it also caused, and continues to cause, traffic problems along Route 9, the main thoroughfare (also known as Broadway), and the side streets.
Mr. Janos was re-elected last year to a second two-year term on a platform of preserving the village and controlling development. When he was initially elected, much of his support came from residents who had been fighting a plan by the state Department of Transportation to straighten Neberan Road in the Tarrytown Lakes neighborhood. The road was already being used by drivers as an alternative to I-287, and residents did not want to encourage more traffic in the mostly residential area by making the road easier to navigate. The road was never straightened.
BUT if the housing market is any indication, Tarrytown's assets outweigh its traffic problems. Karen Stroub, the manager of DeCecchis Realty in Tarrytown, said residents enjoy the village so much that they rarely move away. As a result, Ms. Stroub said, only 29 houses and one co-op have been sold so far this year.
"I have a folder's worth of customers who will sell only if I can find them something else in Tarrytown," Ms. Stroub said. "It's a bit of a logjam."
Of the village's 5,200 housing units, less than 40 percent are single-family houses, with the median price $340,000. In Westchester County, the median price of a single-family house is $470,000. 
Almost 60 percent of the residences -- rentals, co-ops and condominiums -- in the village are in multiunit buildings.
Another agent, Eleanor H. Ross, who owns Tarrytown Real Estate with David Leggio, said she recommends renting in Tarrytown while waiting for the right house to come on the market, giving house buyers a chance to know the area.
Families like the Chullas -- who have two daughters, ages 10 and 13 -- say the schools are another reason to move to Tarrytown, which is part of the town of Greenburgh. Graduating seniors in the Public Schools of the Tarrytowns, which serves most of Tarrytown and all of Sleepy Hollow, a neighboring village in the town of Mount Pleasant, scored an average of 597 on the College Board verbal tests and 621 for math in 2000, the most recent year for which the district had numbers. Those results were well above the state average, which was 494 for the verbal test and 506 for math. Of the 130 students who graduated in 2000, 70 percent went on to four-year colleges and 19 percent to two-year institutions.
Last year, almost 900 students in Grades 7 through 12 attended Sleepy Hollow Middle School and High School at the campus overlooking the Hudson. The high school curriculum includes 16 advanced placement courses and 18 honors courses.
In all, there were 2,284 students in the district in January. Per pupil costs for 2000-2001 were $14,460 a student, said Andrew LaBella, the business manager for the district. 
Tappan Hill Elementary School houses prekindergarten and kindergarten classes. First-grade students attend John Paulding Elementary School. Second and third graders are at Winfield L. Morse Elementary School. Washington Irving Intermediate School, has Grades 4, 5 and 6.
The assistant school superintendent, Dr. Susan K. Heiferman, described the school district as "diverse economically and ethnically," with more than 40 percent of the students coming from Hispanic and other minority families. 
About 375 students in Tarrytown who live south of Route 119, an east-west road, attend the Irvington Union Free School District, which serves Irvington and part of the unincorporated areas of Greenburgh.
In all, 1,735 students attend Irvington schools: Dows Lane Elementary School (K-5), Irvington Middle School (6-8) and Irvington High School (9-12).
Per pupil cost in the Irvington district for the last year was $14,481. In 2000, 96 percent of the graduating class went on to college. College Board scores in 2000 averaged 552 for verbal and 572 for math.
Despite its relatively small size, Tarrytown has been home to a number of historical figures. After the Revolutionary War until 1849, when the Hudson River Railroad opened, the area flourished as a port. In the middle of the 19th century, river traffic slowed and factories sprang up, with the village incorporating in 1870.
BY the turn of the century, mansions had begun to appear on the hills overlooking the Hudson. Among the remaining mansions is Lyndhurst, a Gothic Revival structure now owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It was designed by Alexander Jackson Davis for Gen. William Paulding, a former mayor of New York City, and completed in 1838. It was later owned by Jay Gould, the railroad financier. 
Tarrytown has also been home to other tycoons, including William E. Dodge, a merchant and philanthropist; J. D. Maxwell, an automobile pioneer; and several members of the Lehman banking family.
Washington Irving, known for "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," who has been described as the first American to make his living solely from writing lived in Tarrytown, at Sunnyside, a pre-Civil War estate now open to the public.
Samuel L. Clemens also owned a house, which is now used by catering service. "It's a great place," Clemens said in 1902 about the village. "It has a lower death rate and a higher tax rate than any place on the civilized globe."
Another village landmark, the 800-seat Music Hall, is on Main Street, along with many antique stores and family-owned restaurants. The Music Hall was built in 1885 in the Queen Anne style by William Wallace, a chocolate manufacturer. Originally a venue for opera and vaudeville, it is one of the oldest theaters in Westchester County. It has been used for concerts, town meetings and cotillions. President Theodore Roosevelt once spoke on its stage.
Joan Baez, Tony Bennett, Dave Brubeck, Liz Callaway, Tom Chapin, Judy Collins, Dizzy Gillespie, Lionel Hampton, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Tito Puente, Gwen Verdon and Wynton Marsalis are among those who have entertained at the Music Hall. Mr. Marsalis is returning for two shows there on Oct. 27. 
Today, visitors can take in the Tap Kids Show at the Music Hall, where more than 40 young tap dancers from the United States and Canada will be performing.
For those staying for dinner, be warned. "They roll up the sidewalks early on Sunday evening in Tarrytown," Mayor Janos said. "Don't forget, it's just a small town at heart."

THE SUNNYSIDE OF LIFE: Washington Irving, who was born in 1783 and never married or had children, shared his home, Sunnyside (now a national historic landmark), with his brother Ebenezer and five nieces. Irving also used the pen names Dietrich Knickerbocker, Jonathan Oldstyle and Geoffrey Crayon. He often traveled in Europe, and in 1842 was named minister (what today would be ambassador) to Spain by President John Tyler. On Nov. 28, 1859, Irving died at Sunnyside surrounded by his relatives. He was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery at the Old Dutch Church in Sleepy Hollow.

Hidden Barriers to Health Coverage

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer covers health care for The Times. Her column on the economics of health care appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: jestei@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE best possible method for getting health insurance under the current system, of course, is to be gainfully employed by a company that offers coverage. That is not to suggest that all care is created equal. Some employers pay all the premiums, while some pay less than half. Some offer plain-vanilla H.M.O.'s, others a fuller range of plans. And some are strong voices for employees in disputes with insurers, while others do very little to help. 
 But it is also true that some employers raise the bar enough to prevent or discourage their own workers from getting the insurance they do offer. 
 Some companies insist, for instance, that their workers foot a big portion of the monthly bills, and the only plans they offer may have high premiums, putting them out of the reach of most lower-paid workers. Others require workers to endure long waiting periods before they can enroll, while most refuse to cover part-time workers. And the employers -- who are generally fed up with having to administer benefits and fight with insurance companies -- are often low-energy advocates for their workers when they face off with the insurers over coverage.
The Commonwealth Fund, a health care research foundation based in New York, found in a study this summer that high premiums and tight restrictions played a major role in keeping many workers without coverage, even when they are employed by companies that offer insurance plans.
The problems are most acute for low-wage earners -- those earning less than $20,000 a year. The Commonwealth Fund found that companies with few such employees insure proportionately more of their work forces. Sometimes, even a small increase in the amount employees must contribute toward their insurance is enough to persuade them to change or reduce coverage. A $10 increase in monthly contributions raises the probability that a worker will switch plans to 25 percent from 5 percent, the foundation said. 
Workers may also be discouraged by an absence of choices. About 87 percent of workers in small companies have only one choice, generally an H.M.O., when it comes to health plans. Tack on obstacles like exclusions of care for pre-existing conditions and a load of other restrictions, and it becomes cheaper and more attractive for some people to take their chances and pay for medical care out of pocket when they become ill. 
Most companies have waiting periods before new workers can enroll in health insurance. But the longer the wait, the fewer become eligible, apparently because some may leave their jobs or change their schedules to part-time work. The Commonwealth study found that about 30 percent fewer people were eligible for insurance in companies with waiting periods longer than four months, compared with those in companies with short or nonexistent periods.
"Employer eligibility policies play an important role in coverage," said Jon Gabel, a vice president of the Health Research Educational Trust, which contributed to the Commonwealth study. He added that one in four employees working for companies that offer insurance are ineligible because of the waiting periods and other restrictions.
State regulations requiring shorter waiting periods could address this issue, but regulations have not been a panacea when it comes to solving many health care problems, and often do not help to contain overall care costs.
And workers may find that their employers are not their best advocates when it come to battling insurance companies. Some workers may not want their help anyway, preferring to keep their bosses out of their personal business, even if that means opting out of health insurance. 
"If a worker needs mental health services, or has a drug-addicted spouse, or a daughter who wants an abortion or a son with AIDS," wrote Greg Scandlen, in last winter's issue of Health Care News, a trade newsletter, "the employer might well be the last person an employee would confide in."
Mr. Scandlen, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, also said that setting the same high premium for all workers would likely force lower-paid, younger new employees to decline coverage, leaving behind older, often less healthy participants. 
Among the industries surveyed by the Commonwealth Fund, the retail sector had the lowest rate of insured employees. That may be attributed to its high percentage of part-time workers and to the fact that its employees make an average monthly contribution of $46 for their insurance premiums, well above the $29 average among industries surveyed.
Are employers best suited to solve the problems of the uninsured and underinsured? Many health care policy experts contend that they are not, and that universal health care or medical savings accounts are better solutions. But for now, the social contract between workers and the best employers still includes health benefits. Bosses could do more, sometimes at little extra cost, to increase the percentage of insured workers in their midst.

Looking Up at Jersey City's Future . . .

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
Construction of the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1973 not only unseated the Empire State Building as the world's tallest building and transformed the Lower Manhattan skyline. It also heightened the contrast between the squat waterfront warehouses here and the skyscrapers across the Hudson.
 The twin towers have been surpassed; the new tallest buildings are the Petronas Towers in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, at 1,483 feet. But now the banner of "tallest" -- the tallest building in New Jersey, that is -- is again being raised on the banks of the Hudson, and another skyline will be transformed. 
 The Goldman Sachs & Company building at 30 Hudson Street is to rise 821 feet above the Jersey City waterfront when it is finished; the projected completion date is the summer of 2003. Whatever its street-level impact, experts say the building will have a big effect on the city's appearance, its prestige and even its self-image. 
"In some terms, you can say it puts you on the map," said Ron Klemensic, a Seattle-based structural engineer who is chairman of the Council on Tall Buildings, the international organization that officially doles out the superlatives. "For the community, it draws attention to what's happening there. Generally, at least those people who are in the building business -- contractors, engineers, architects -- all look at that as a positive thing."
Up to now, Goldman Sachs has played down the height of the building. Joel Brenner, the project manager, said the height "was dictated by some of the zoning parameters, which have very little do with the image statement that we wanted to make. 
"I think most of all," he added, "we were trying to create a quality work space that more or less you would find in Manhattan," which is where Goldman Sachs is based.
Whatever statement Goldman wants to make, the company hired the same architectural firms that designed the world's two tallest building projects, and preliminary renderings depict a soaring, clear glass column, tapering only near the top, refracting the daytime blues of the river and sky and the brilliant pinks and oranges of sunset. Cesar Pelli & Associates, which designed the Petronas Towers, is the project's principal architect, while Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, which designed the Sears Tower, now the world's No. 2, is laying out the interior.
"So, there is some cachet," said Mr. Klemensic.
The tall world is a small world, apparently, and Mr. Klemensic's firm, Skilling Ward Magnusson Barkshire Structural Engineers, worked on the World Trade Center.
The cost of the 1.36-million-square-foot building, which will have an adjacent complex that includes a 250-room hotel, an auditorium and a glass atrium, is $361 million, according to the company's estimate.
At the moment, the Goldman Sachs building is little more than a massive concrete hole in the ground that will house a four-story underground parking deck. But a steel framework is already beginning to sprout above the river's edge, and even the construction cranes scrape the sky. When completed, the supremacy above other local buildings of what the company refers to simply as 30 Hudson Street will be dramatically apparent. Goldman's monument to its own corporate glory will be 50 percent taller than what is now the state's tallest building, which is also in Jersey City's financial district, a 550-foot structure at 101 Hudson Street, occupied largely by another financial firm, Merrill Lynch.
And with just a few structures in Lower Manhattan exceeding its height, the new Goldman building will raise Jersey City's profile.
"I think it will be a powerful symbol for that area," said Prof. Mir M. Ali, of the School of Architecture at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, who is chairman of the architecture group of the Tall Buildings Council. 
"You kind of feel a bit small when you compare yourself to New York, so this will boost your ego somewhat," Professor Ali added. "Tall buildings -- from my experience, I can tell you this -- some people just love them, some people just hate them. There's few people in the middle."
Take David Ruff and Sara Abbas, a young couple living in the Paulus Hook neighborhood surrounding the Goldman site, where a 38-story apartment tower is rising simultaneously next door.
"I like it," Mr. Ruff, 25, a pharmaceutical marketing supervisor, originally from Atlanta, said of the mushrooming skyline. "It's more like living in a city."
"I don't like tall buildings, actually," countered Ms. Abbas, 26, a corporate events planner, who used to live in low-rise Park Slope, Brooklyn. "It takes away from the quaintness of the area." 
The city's new mayor, Glenn Cunningham, welcomed the Goldman building.
"We're proud to see it coming here," said Mr. Cunningham, who vowed to work with the company to establish training and job placement programs for local residents. "It's going to feed both the image and the reality of Jersey City as the financial capital of New Jersey."
Mr. Cunningham's predecessor, Bret D. Schundler, who is now the Republican nominee for governor, approved a 20-year tax abatement for the building. Terms include payments equaling 10 percent of the building's annual lease payments, estimated to be worth $3.6 million to the city, said Bill Ayala, a city spokesman. 
Goldman is also receiving state incentives worth an estimated $164 million over 10 years, under the New Jersey Business Employee Incentive Program, which gives employers back up to 80 percent of their employees' state income tax. 
And in a less tangible benefit at the federal level, the company gets an old friend in high places, moving into a state whose junior United States Senator, Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat, is a former Goldman Sachs co-chairman. 
Steve Sanders, a board member of the Historic Paulus Hook Association, a community group, said it was yet to be seen whether the local revenues and economic activity generated by more than 6,000 Goldman employees at the building will be worth the projected 1,880 cars arriving there each morning peak period.
"Obviously, a project of that scale has unknowable impact," said Mr. Sanders, who noted there were several public and parochial schools, as well as many elderly residents, in the neighborhood. 
The city planning director, Robert Cotter, said the plans for the 35-acre Colgate Redevelopment Area, which includes the Goldman site, take the additional traffic into account. That plan allows a total of six million square feet of office space, one million of which is already occupied plus 100,000 square feet of retail space and 1,000 apartments. Goldman employees are expected to travel by PATH and light rail trains as well as by car. 
"The carrying capacity is there," Mr. Cotter said. 
The Goldman building can be viewed as the literal apex of the waterfront's transformation from a belching industrial outpost to a glistening financial center that has already attracted the likes of Deutsche Bank, J. P. Morgan & Company and others. As the name of the redevelopment area implies, the Goldman building is rising on what was once a sprawling complex of Colgate factories and warehouses, where Palmolive soap was a principal product.
"Come a rainy day, you'd find soap suds on the streets," recalled Dolores Jaworowski, 69, a retired librarian who has lived all her life in a three-story 1841 row house on Warren Street, a few blocks inland from the Goldman site. "I used to sit by the window and watch the ships come in. Now, all I can see is the buildings."
And she is likely to be seeing more of them.
The redevelopment plan has room for nearly five million square feet more of offices, even after the Goldman building becomes the tallest stalk in the Garden State.
"That area is growing, but the area is also very small," Professor Ali said. "So the only way things can go is up."

Immature Cranberries Called to the Rescue

BYLINE:  By KIRSTY SUCATO 

 BODY:
At this time of year, Joseph W. Darlington, a cranberry farmer in Pemberton Township, normally bides his time. Like four generations of family farmers before him, Mr. Darlington waits for the fruit to ripen in the cool of autumn before the harvest in October, when the berries are at their most brilliant red. 
 But this year, Mr. Darlington, like more than a quarter of the state's cranberry growers, is preparing to flood his bogs just after Labor Day to capture a river of immature white berries. 
 An experimental beverage is turning the state's struggling cranberry industry upside down. It is white cranberry juice, a new product from Ocean Spray that is not as tart as the dark red brew. And it doesn't stain clothes. 
The drink, to be introduced nationwide in January, is part of an effort to increase consumer demand for cranberries and to lift growers out of their worst economic slump in 50 years. Ocean Spray is offering a bonus of up to 25 percent for the whitest fruit and, in the process, forcing some major changes in the cranberry industry. 
About 30 of New Jersey's 45 cranberry growers are members of the Ocean Spray Cooperative, the largest cranberry cooperative in the country. Of those, about 14 will be taking part in the program. 
"I guess it is the most changes occurring in a short period of time than any periods that have come before," said Mr. Darlington, the president of Joseph J. White Inc., the state's third-largest cranberry farm and a member of the Ocean Spray Cooperative. "This is certainly a period of more turbulence than ever before." 
He will devote about a quarter of his crop to the white berries, falling back on a second harvest of red fruit at the end of October. 
Growers are desperate for a way to increase prices, now the lowest since the 1950's. Last year, Ocean Spray growers got $11.23 for a 100-pound barrel of cranberries, compared with a high of about $60 in 1997. Production costs range from $15 to $45 to a barrel. 
Because of the hard times, Ocean Spray has laid off 40 workers at its manufacturing plant in Bordentown over recent months. Most farmers have not turned a profit in a couple of years and many did not even harvest last year because they could not afford to, said Edward V. Lipman Jr., a cranberry farmer and director of the Office of Continuing Professional Education at Rutgers University's Cook College. 
"I think the large farmers that are commercially efficient will ride this out; they see an end to it in maybe five years," he said. "If that doesn't happen, there will probably be a larger shakeout than what we're seeing right now." 
The problems date to the mid-1990's, when consumer demand was high, juice drinks were becoming fashionable, and medical studies showed that cranberry juice helped prevent urinary tract infections. Seeking to cash in on prices as high as $80 a barrel, farmers rushed to open bogs in Wisconsin and Canada. 
In New Jersey, where expansion is limited by state wetlands protection regulations, growers increased yields by introducing hardier varieties of plant, like the commonly used Stevens variety. 
But the growers soon produced more than they could sell, and in 1998, prices fell to $25 a barrel. This year, they are expecting to receive $17 to $22, with the white berries bringing an extra $1 to $6 a barrel. 
In an effort to reduce the glut, the United States Department of Agriculture ordered farmers to cut their production by 15 percent last year, and by 35 percent this year. For some, it will mean destroying hundreds of barrels of good fruit. Others will simply grow less. But it is still a painful remedy. 
"If we could have grown all of our acreage rather than setting aside, we probably would have had a record-breaking year," said Holly H. Rivera, the president of the American Cranberry Growers Association, whose family owns Haines & Haines Inc. in Chatsworth, the largest cranberry farm in the state. 
"It's kind of heartbreaking for a farmer to say 'We could have had a record-breaking year.' " 
New Jersey is the third-largest producer of cranberries in the nation after Wisconsin and Massachussetts, harvesting 3,700 of the 36,600 acres nationwide. Last year, the state's farmers produced 489,000 barrels, according to the New Jersey Agricultural Statistics Service. 
For now, farmers are hopeful that the new white cranberry juice will improve their fate. A pilot growing project in New Jersey two years ago gave Ocean Spray enough white berries to create three new cranberry juices, one a peach blend, one a strawberry blend and one a basic white cranberry. The juice tested well with consumers in California, said Marguerite Copel, Ocean Spray's vice president for corporate communications. 
But the project also revealed the danger of changing the age-old farming cycles. When farmers flooded the bogs for harvest in September, young vines died off. Farmers suspect it was the warmer water. This year, growers will flood only mature bogs early in the season, Mr. Lipman said. 
The new system, he said, is "a crap shoot." 
But farmers are willing to take the gamble. 
"We're saying, Hey, Ocean Spray is giving us really good innovation," Mrs. Rivera said. "We're willing to take that leap of faith."

RISING HOME PRICES

BYLINE:  By Karen DeMasters 

 BODY:
 Prices for existing homes in Bergen and Passaic Counties increased by 17 percent in the second quarter of the year over the same period last year, the third largest increase in the nation, according to a survey released last week by the National Association of Realtors. 
The biggest increases were in Sacramento, Calif., and Washington, D.C. The median existing home price in the Bergen-Passaic area was $276,800, sixth highest nationally. Of the New Jersey areas studied, the Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon area had the second largest increase with a 12.3 percent jump and a median price of $238,900. Karen DeMasters

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPS

 The state unemployment rate dropped to 4.0 percent last month from 4.5 percent in June, the first decrease of 0.5 percent since January 1993. 
Still, the number of jobs decreased by 3,800. Officials attributed the unusually large drop in the jobless rate to a shift in seasonally expected behavior, as students who entered the labor force in June stopped looking for jobs in July. Anne Ruderman

Workers of the World, Invest!

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
COMMUNISM hardly seems to belong anywhere anymore. 
 In its totalitarian Stalinist-Maoist form, the ideology has been dead for over a decade, and holdout nations that still call themselves Communist have almost all turned to capitalistic reforms to salvage sagging economies. Cuba's economy now relies less on sugar cane than shopping malls catering to wealthy tourists. Vietnam opened a stock market in Ho Chi Minh City last year. North Korea plans to offer American-taught business courses to a handful of students at Kim Il Sung University this fall -- though its leader, Kim Jong Il, still does a good job of playing the iconic yet enigmatic leader that the world once expected a Communist Party to produce. 
 In a final blow, the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, has said that capitalists should be welcomed into the world's largest Communist Party, of which he is chairman. An influential Marxist journal that dared to criticize the move was closed last week. 
So was all that sloganeering, sweat and slaughter over the last century for naught? 
Not necessarily. Absorbing free-market business practices does not mean communism is dead, according to Mr. Jiang. "In the past, our understanding of this issue was quite superficial and simplistic," he cautioned in a two-hour speech to honor his party's 80th birthday in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square. Human society "will inevitably move towards communism," he said. But, he added, "it is neither possible nor necessary to envisage or describe in great detail" how or when human society will get there. 
Mr. Jiang came up with this novel reading of communism from a surprising source: a 19th-century German sociologist, historian, economist and writer named Karl Marx. 
To explain the growth of capitalism in socialist economies, Communist theorists around the world are harking back to Marx's early writings, which suggest the Communist revolutions of this century may have come too soon. The "maturing" of capitalism is supposed to create an educated working class whose solidarity eventually overwhelms private ownership. 
To quote the sometimes bombastically verbose Marx directly (from the Deutsche-Brusseler-Zeitung, Nov. 11, 1847): "If the material conditions that necessarily result in the disappearance of the capitalist mode of production and with it the overthrow of the capitalist ruling class have not yet appeared in the historical process, but should happen despite this before history requires it, then the victory of the proletariat in overturning the rule of the capitalist class can only be temporary." 
In other words, communism (the lowercase, economic kind) can't be created by political movements (like uppercase Communist Parties) or social revolutions: it will arrive -- inevitably -- after capitalism burns itself out. 
Of course, Mr. Jiang didn't say exactly that. What he said was that the "advanced forces of production" in the "the primary stage of socialism" that China finds itself in does not just include workers. Calling any of them "capitalists," of course, is still politically incorrect; Mr. Jiang referred to them as "private entrepreneurs." 
The word "privatization" remains banned from his party's lexicon, though the Marxist concept of communal ownership has been conveniently expanded to include enterprises in which the state now owns a minority share. "Other forms of ownership" are also developing, Mr. Jiang noted in his speech. Reversing decades of party dogma, he said "a person's political integrity" should no longer be judged "simply by whether he owns property and how much property he or she owns." 
For China's Communist Party in particular, backpedaling is nothing new. Deng Xiaoping started by welcoming "intellectuals" back into the party in the late 1970's, reversing the anti-intellectualism of the Mao's Cultural Revolution. Party theorists have also been mining early Mao, before he tried to bypass the capitalist phase and move right into a communist economy with the disastrous Great Leap Forward of the late 1950's, the aggressive collectivization that ended up costing millions of Chinese peasants their lives.
FOR instance, in a 1940 speech, Mao envisioned coexistence with different social systems, including capitalism, during a long slow transition to socialism and later communism. The speech, "On New Democracy," was included in Mao's official "Selected Works," but it was ignored until now. 
Underlying the jargon is an attempt, common to all aging revolutionary Marxist parties that want to stay in power, to chart a future using Marxian theory that won't repudiate the Marxist ideology that put them in power in the first place.
"There are resources within the Marxist tradition, and more significantly in the writings of Mao Zedong, to let China's party leaders make the adjustments to capitalism they are clearly making while legitimately claiming to be following Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought," says Tim Cheek, a scholar of Chinese Marxism at Colorado College. "Like the Bible, it depends on which bits you quote." 
There's a strange contradiction lurking in all this revisionism: the United States is arguably farther along the road to Marx's communist Utopia. After all, the major means of production are collectively owned, thanks to the stock market and mutual funds. The country certainly boasts of an informed proletariat. And, as Mr. Cheek noted, "With our social security system and Medicare, we are far more socialized in practice than China, which has neither."
In practical terms, China's ideological adjustments, which are likely to be adopted into the Communist Party's charter at its 16th congress next year, are a perhaps inevitable attempt to co-opt the country's growing band of capitalists before they become a political force, possibly by joining one of China's other token political parties, which wield no power but at least present a legal framework in which to organize. 
Where this is heading is anybody's guess. Some China watchers say the party may eventually evolve into something akin to Europe's Social Democrats, albeit without willfully relinquishing the one-party system. And then they may follow in America's footsteps, which, if Marx was right after all, is heading toward communism. 
"The real message here is that communism is objectively where mankind is headed, but don't hold your breath and don't make the mistake of believing that we know how to map out a plan for getting there -- past experience has shown the folly that can lead to," said Ken Lieberthal, a China scholar and former senior director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
The Case For Buying Japanese Stocks

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
JAPAN seems adrift, a land without a plan.
 A year ago, its central bank puzzled many people when it raised short-term interest rates for the first time in a decade. This March it reversed course, and last week it said it would further loosen credit in an economy in which short-term borrowing is basically free. 
 None of this has helped. The country remains mired. 
Junichiro Koizumi, the new prime minister, is talking about shaking things up. But the Topix stock index is down about 13 percent this year. 
Todd Jacobson, co-manager of two Japan funds at Credit Suisse Asset Management, took some time last week to make a case for Japanese stocks. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Is there any reason to suppose that this effort by the central bank to flood the economy with money will have much effect?

A. The Bank of Japan was under tremendous political pressure to do something, and they buckled. Providing more liquidity into an economy that is experiencing deflation is clearly correct, but I don't think it will help much. Japan is in a recession. There is no question the economy is contracting.
What is important is that the Bank of Japan is showing they stand ready to provide sufficient liquidity to clean up the banks. Masaru Hayami, who heads the Bank of Japan, is basically telling the government that when and if it makes some structural changes which are deflationary, we will provide liquidity.

Q. What is the most critical change the government can make?

A. The focus is on cleaning up the banks. Corporations get about 90 percent of their funding from Japanese banks, compared to about 30 percent in the United States.
The capital bases of the banks have been depleted. They need more in the form of another round of public money coming into the system. 

Q. A number of Mr. Koizumi's predecessors have tried to mend the banks. What other changes is he proposing?

A. Koizumi wants to restructure government organizations that provide money for the economy. Two examples are a housing loan corporation and a highway development corporation. As a way of tackling Japan's budget deficit, which is huge, he wants to shut down some of these organizations, which take business away from the private sector.
But it will be very difficult for him to push through these reforms.

Q. How long will it take before these changes start to pay off?

A. It will take a number of years.
Koizumi has been very smart about taking his agenda to the public, building up support.
But he needs to act very quickly, because if he does implement everything he says he wants to do, it will cause a lot of economic pain. It is doubtful the Japanese really appreciate how much.

Q. What is the case for investing in Japanese stocks?

A. Japanese stocks are now at their cheapest levels since the mid-1980's. Compared to other markets in the world, it has become much more compelling. There is a lot of potential for upside surprises. But it is an uphill battle because the economy is so weak.
Japan is still a quite wealthy country, and the Japanese savings rate is very high. The exciting potential is if individuals put some of their money in financial markets. Equity ownership by individuals in Japan is under 10 percent. If they raised it to about 17 percent, which is what it is in Germany, there would be a massive move in Japanese stocks. 

Q. Your funds own 25 to 30 Japanese stocks. Which companies do you like?

A. Our style is to invest in the best companies in the country, companies that are well positioned globally and offer good value.
Historically, we have had a position in technology. In that area we like NTT DoCoMo, which is down about 13 percent so far this year and is very reasonably valued. We also like Sega, the game company, even though the stock is up 70 percent. And we like Nintendo.
We have some exposure to the banks. They were oversold and not owned by foreigners at all. We bought the highest-quality banks in the sector: Sumitomo Mitsui, UJF and Mitsubishi Tokyo. Mitsui Fudosan is a real estate company we own.

Q. Let's say the American economy is bottoming in the third quarter, and then starts to recover. Will that help Japan?

A. Stabilization in the U.S. would be great, but the technology sector there is still declining. You need the personal computer and cell phone market to recover. It is the key driver.

HEADLINE: PRELUDES; 
Fighting For the Check, Or Not

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I WAS all set to a write a grand feminist treatise on why young professional women don't care if men pay the check on dates. My thesis was this: Because women now make their own money -- and sometimes a lot of it -- being wooed financially is not as important anymore.
 And then I went out with a fledgling photographer who was counting his pennies. We ate at a fancy sushi restaurant (his choice) and had a fine time. Then the bill came. He picked it up. He hemmed. He hawed. 
 "What should we do?" he asked. "I'd like to get it, but I'm kind of broke."
"Me too," I said.
"But you're a journalist. You must have money."
"That," I said, "is an oxymoron."
We decided to split the check, which, I must acknowledge, was a big turn-off. I wanted to be taken out. I wanted him to pay. But he clearly didn't have his finances in order, and after a certain age (he was in his late 30's) that is about as appealing as milk-crate furniture. 
Still, my reaction disturbed me. Why did I care that he didn't cover my meal? Was I becoming shallow in my advancing age -- my early 30's? Had my feminist principles been tossed out the window with my Simone de Beauvoir anthologies? In college, for example, I never allowed a man to pay for me. Any woman would be doomed if she did; before long she would be ironing his shirts. So why did I care now?
"Men are supposed to pay for women," said Suzanne Lynn, 29, a friend of mine who grew up in South Carolina and is now a sales assistant at CTN Media Group in Manhattan. She is offended if a date doesn't see her to her front door. 
"But what if he makes less money than she does?" I asked. "Why can't we each pay our way?"
She looked at me as if I had two heads. "Because if a man is interested in you, he pays," she said. "Once the relationship is off the ground, the woman can kick in when she needs to. But if a guy doesn't pay for me at first, I assume he only wants friendship."
She was dead serious, and most women with whom I talked -- independent, strong, beautiful, accomplished types -- felt the same way, even in these tougher economic times, when men struggle just as much as women do.
My younger brother Ray, a stand-up comedian in Manhattan, says he always pays the bill on dates, "even if the girl asks me out."
"There's a feeling that women will think you're cheap if you don't," he added. "Plus, it's good manners. But women send mixed messages. I know some women who refuse to go out on a second date if the guy doesn't treat them the first time. They say they're their own person and can do whatever a guy can do, so why does it all boil down to the check?"
Theoretically, if equality is our goal, we should be thrilled to pay our way. For some reason, we are not. There is always the 75 cents-to-the-dollar argument -- that woman still don't earn as much as men, so men should pay -- but I think that more than economics is at work here. 
For one thing, traditional courtship has pretty much gone the way of dowries and arranged marriages. Most men no longer undergo formal familial grilling about their credit ratings. So what other options do modern suitors have? Paying for a date is a fairly safe way of indicating, and gauging, intentions, or at least future viability.
"There are so few rituals left -- why negate one of the last ones out there?" asked Gisela Williams, 30, a travel writer in New York. "It's nice for a guy to pull out your chair, or hold open the door or pour your wine. Paying for a date is right up there."
It also signifies desire and effort. When a man pays the check, he is saying, in effect, that she is worth the price of that tuna tartare, that he is willing to sacrifice for her.
Then there is the so-called macho factor. Many men I know like to pick up the bill; it makes them feel powerful and masculine. 
"I always pay for the woman," said Patricio Forno, 32, a civil engineer from Santiago, Chile. "No matter who earns more money, I pay. It's part of my culture, but it also makes me feel good." 
OF course, some sensitive men of the new millennium would rather split the bill or let the woman pay. And some women truly don't want men to pay, perhaps because they want to prove their own financial viability.
Andrea Schnoor, 32, isn't one of them. "I used to only pay my way, but now I let my date pay, especially at first," said Ms. Schnoor, a publicist in Manhattan. "When you get older you have a greater sense of self, and you realize that even if they do expect something in return you don't have to give it." 
One could argue that letting men pay empowers women. Sure, we can pay for ourselves; we're just smart enough not to.
If a man grabs a check, should a woman reciprocate by doing the same at a future time? Absolutely, assuming that she likes him. Should a woman pay if she has invited the man out? Definitely. And creativity -- finding other, nonmonetary ways to express affection and interest -- goes a long way on both sides.
Ultimately, of course, a successful relationship is about a million different things beyond the size of one's wallet. Still, a little well-placed wooing never hurts.

HEADLINE: Ms. Perfect Opts Out 

BYLINE:  By NELSON MUI 

 BODY:
TISH JOHNSON traces her secession from the rigors of day-to-day fashion maintenance to an evening at an Upper East Side restaurant, where an acquaintance asked how she was doing. 
 In the millisecond before Ms. Johnson replied, the woman eyed her up and down, studying both outfit and body with cool precision. "Oh, you're soooo thin," the woman trilled, scarcely concealing the enmity inside the compliment. 
 The encounter triggered a little epiphany for Ms. Johnson, 28, who has had a career as a junior fashion editor at W magazine and as a publicist. After years of swirling around the Manhattan merry-go-round of benefits, store parties and club nights that are the social life of choice for women in this set, Ms. Johnson decided she wanted off the ride. The pressure and expense of looking perfectly pulled together at work and on the town had sapped the fun from it. 
"I've opted out," said Ms. Johnson, who has left her job at a fashion publicity company to freelance as a marketing consultant. "I sent my designer clothes to the consignment shop." 
Instead of dressing to kill in just the right low-cut Chloe top and $400 sling-back heels, she reports part time to a Nike office on West 18th Street in khakis and running shoes. For evenings, she prefers a simple camisole, linen pants and low kitten heels.
For a number of New Yorkers like Ms. Johnson -- career women with the income and youth to pull off fashion's seasonal looks -- the increased stakes and the attention to appearances are proving overwhelming. These women are dedicated readers of the style bibles, up to speed on trends endorsed by the wardrobe-centric "Sex and the City." They might cheekily have accepted the label "fashion victim." But lately they have been feeling battle fatigue. They are waging a quiet revolt against luxury labels and regimes of hair coloring, eyebrow plucking, laser peels and waxing from underarms to legs. 
"People are so polished here, and I find it totally soulless, that slick New York career woman," said Amely Greeven, 27, a contributing writer for Harper's Bazaar. "Where has feminism got us? That world of the very high-profile woman, who's totally polished, it's fake and phony. It's all a myth we created working in fashion." 
Ms. Greeven is rare in publicly bemoaning the pressure placed on women by her industry. She recalled that when she worked at Vogue, "I used to go to work in what I thought was a cute outfit in the morning, but by the afternoon, I would have doubts and start to feel very nasty and grungy." Now she shuttles between a Midtown office and her home in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in jeans and T-shirts. 
Stacy Kelner, a corporate lawyer in her 30's, wants to reclaim her Saturdays for herself, not feel pressured to squeeze in a hair appointment. "You look around and you keep thinking there's always more you can do, but you have to draw a line," she said. "You start putting in streaks or color your hair. Then you keep having to do it regularly."
"It becomes a job," she added. "I've definitely opted out, and I'm not looking forward to opting back in." 
It is too early to know whether such dissenters are leading a trend destined to ripple through the ranks of working women, bringing gloom to $200-a-session hair colorists and the luxury merchants of Madison Avenue. Department store sales have been depressed all year, but that seems mainly a function of the slack economy and the failure of spring trends, like a 1980's revival, to excite customers. 
But there are signs that a reaction against the polished, high-maintenance look of the last few years could pick up converts. Many of the clothes in stores for fall represent a turn away from glittering, late-90's opulence and the often crass display of wealth worn on the back. Gone are the conspicuous logos and expensive reptile skins like crocodile and python. There are less pretentious looks, like military and equestrian chic. And denim, that most dressed down of fabrics, is expected to be very big this season, from Miu Miu shirtdresses to pantsuits that can go to the office. 
"Our theme for fall is contrast," said Jacqui Lividini, the senior vice president for fashion merchandising at Saks Fifth Avenue. "There's the option for the customer who wants to do the high-maintenance look, and there are other types of styles you can choose that are less extreme and still look pulled together. You don't have to put on a pantsuit with stiletto heels. You can opt out of high maintenance." She suggested a "novelty, dressy flip-flop" as an alternative to heels that still looks dressed up. 
And how is this for a shift in the wind? To some devoted viewers, even Carrie Bradshaw, Sarah Jessica Parker's character on "Sex and the City," looked this season like a parody of fashion direction. "They've gone over the top and unrealistic," said Kate Loudoun-Shand, who owns a textile design company that supplies Marc Jacobs and others. "It started out as the stylized glamour-girl look, but nowadays, maybe because of all the product placement, she's become this label junkie who probably wears things straight off the runway."
Since Eve bit into the apple and decided to clothe herself, women have grappled with the dressing problem. But the last decade has increasingly focused on high-fashion labels and expensive beauty treatments among women and girls, if not always men and boys, who have been allowed to slack off into everyday casual. 
A culture of assessing the best and worst dressed spread outside the usual ZIP codes and exclusive parties. Magazines like In Style and television shows like "Full Frontal Fashion" encouraged the masses to play red-carpet critic and try to imitate celebrities. Every ad, music video and television show is styled to the nines these days. 
"I think things have escalated," said Julie Krumholz, a vice president for marketing at Newsweek. "How many profiles have we all read about people who manage their schedules around their beauty and salon visits? You sort of roll your eyes, but then you see in certain circles it's true. You look at somebody like Katie Couric on the "Today" show, and she's had a transformation, she's wearing tighter clothes, heels. But you know Katie's highlights and other accouterments require a high level of maintenance." 
Valerie Steele, the fashion historian and museum curator at the Fashion Institute of Technology, pointed out that the beauty and fashion standards of celebrities, once remote, have filtered down, with many women feeling the pressure to live up to them. 
"The very polished, stylish, soignee look was once for a minority of celebrities and socialites," she said. "But now that's spread to a lot more women, who feel they have to look that way. America's traditionally been an antifashion country, but everyone's become so much more visually literate that women are a lot more visually aware. Just the other day at a party, everyone was talking about how everyone was doing Botox. It's like you start to feel you're a Neanderthal if you don't do it."
Some single women say the pressure derives from the widespread impression that there are fewer available men than women in the big city. "There are all these incredibly toned, accomplished, well-educated women competing for a limited pool of men," said Kathy Reilly, a marketing consultant in her mid-30's. "My friends are Harvard and Wharton M.B.A.'s, and we're all striving to better and better ourselves, while these men have their pick." 
Lately, Ms. Reilly is having less of the game. She has been wearing pressed designer jeans to her job as vice president for marketing for the Equinox Fitness Centers. On dates, she favors jeans, flats and hair pulled back rather than blown out. 
"For me it's all about finding the happy medium, about doing the full day of beauty when it's warranted and going out in a ponytail and jeans and being confident," she said. "I'm happier with it. Hopefully, with the economy having a correction, the over-the-top manias will subside somewhat."
She said that her dressed-down look goes over well with men. "Often it's only the women who notice all the effort anyway," she said. "With some guys, I think the appeal diminishes when they think of having to live with the high maintenance of it all."
To some, the fatigue with showy looks is reminiscent of the early 90's, when fashion reacted to 80's excess by donning minimalist sackcloth in shades of gray and beige from the Gap. Ms. Greeven, the fashion writer, is even predicting a return to grunge. "But even when you're doing a grungy thing, you have this moment when you still feel you have to do it right," she added somewhat ruefully.
Ms. Steele offered this caveat: Even if the fashion pendulum swings away from soignee looks, appearances will still matter. The status game will continue, as it did in the early 90's with minimal fashions made with extremely luxe fabrics that discreetly announced to those in the know the high price tag." 
She added: "All those homeless people probably felt just as bad being stepped on by somebody in a gray Armani suit, as opposed to a hot pink Lacroix dress. I don't think the priorities of showing off will ever change."

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Some Funds Try to Read Your Mind

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH HARRIS 

 BODY:
THE developing field of behavioral economics, which blends economics and psychology, has attracted much attention recently, as many people hope that it will lead to insights that can help investors avoid falling prey to fads like the Internet bubble that popped last year.
 But so far, attempts have failed to fully harness for investment the work of academics like Richard H. Thaler, a professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and the field's leading figure. 
 The handful of mutual funds using the theory have a decidedly mixed record.
But Mr. Thaler says research by him and others holds practical promise, even if Wall Street peregrinations cannot be fully fathomed just yet. 
"There's been more progress on the individual cognitive psychology over the last 20 years than on mass psychology," Mr. Thaler said. "If we had a model that would have been able to tell us when the Internet bubble would break, believe me, we would have used it. So it's easy to say in hindsight that there was some sort of euphoria for two or three years and that euphoria has died. But nobody has the tools, at least as far as I know, that allow you to forecast these changes in these moods."
Still, he is trying to capitalize on developments when possible. Fuller & Thaler Asset Management in San Mateo, Calif., the firm of which he is a principal, has been investing privately for nine years, trying to put the academic theories to work using real money. And it has been quite successful. It says it has produced a 21 percent annualized return for the growth style of investing, about double the gain of its benchmark, the Russell 2500 Growth index. Over the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen an average of 14 percent a year.
But while the strategy may be working for the firm's separate accounts, one of the two public funds that Mr. Thaler helps to advise has not distinguished itself during its shorter life span. The two are the Undiscovered Managers Behavioral Growth fund, managed by Frederick W. Stanske, 43, and the Undiscovered Managers Behavioral Value fund, managed by Brendan S. MacMillan, 33. Both funds require $250,000 investment minimums. 
The growth fund, with $120 million in assets, returned an annualized 2 percent from July 1998 through last Thursday, compared with 7.5 percent for the average mid-cap growth fund, according to Morningstar Inc., and 3 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500. In 1999, the fund led its category with a 65 percent return, but a year later, it fell behind, dropping 27 percent. As with most growth funds, the returns "stink now," Mr. Stanske said.
"Obviously," he added, "we had too much tech exposure, even at the beginning of the year."
The value portfolio, by contrast, which Morningstar classifies as a small-blend fund, has done well during the market downturn, along with other value investments. The $35 million mutual fund has gained an average of 25.2 percent a year from its inception in December 1998 through Thursday, according to Morningstar. This year, it is ahead by 15.5 percent through Thursday, beating its peer group, which rose 5.5 percent on average.
Both funds operate on the theory that people bring biases to their investment analysis and that these are reflected in prices. And because most people are unaware of their biases, they usually do not adjust their investing. Mr. Stanske and Mr. MacMillan try to find such patterns in the market, and to exploit them. 
Terrance Odean, an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who also specializes in behavioral finance, said, "As long as a large-enough majority of people are making these little mistakes, there's probably an opportunity to make money by being on the other side." 
But in practice, the funds share some stock-picking similarities with other growth and value portfolios, even if they are rooted in Mr. Thaler's work. For example, Mr. Stanske seeks "underreaction" when considering stocks for the growth fund. That occurs when analysts and investors believe too firmly in their estimates of what companies will earn in a given quarter and overlook signs to the contrary.
Mr. Stanske cites his finding that analysts dismissed strong earnings from Coach Inc., a maker of handbags and briefcases, when concern rose about leather prices. But he observed that investors appeared not to notice that Coach was relying less on leather than it had in the past. Mr. Stanske said he bought the stock at the beginning of the year "in the 20's." It closed at $33.65 on Friday.
As for the value strategy, Mr. MacMillan said he tried to identify "overreaction" to companies that had experienced a long period of underperformance by looking for signs that they were beginning to improve.
He pointed to Sola International Inc., a maker of eyeglass lenses, whose shares were unduly depressed, he said, by the emergence of laser surgery. Investors had largely ignored a new management's efforts to correct longstanding corporate problems. Mr. MacMillan said he bought shares in the $5-to-$6 range last summer; the stock closed at $14.22 on Friday.
FULLER & THALER is not alone in developing investments based on behavioral concepts. ABN AMRO Asset Management runs two such funds, with assets totaling 160 million euros, or $146.9 million, focused on European markets; it also has one for Japan. The European funds are ABN AMRO Ratio Invest, which began in April 1999, and the ABN AMRO Behavioural Finance, which opened to new investors in May 2000.
The Ratio fund gained 3.1 percent from inception through July, lagging behind its European benchmark, which returned 8.4 percent, according to Arjen B. Pasma, the ABN AMRO Ratio portfolio manager.
The funds follow neither growth nor value investing styles, Mr. Pasma said. Rather, he uses a model that identifies stocks out of favor or undervalued because of emotional or psychological factors.
"If you want to exploit irrationalities, you should use something that is rational or emotionless like a model," he said.
But nobody in the field pretends to have found the key to easy riches. "The problem with investing is you can't be just a psychologist," said Robert J. Shiller of Yale University and a proponent of behavioral economics. He said that all successful investors become involved in the industry to which they commit money and become aware of how other investors might overlook some developments and overemphasize others. "People like Dick Thaler are so rare in the investment world that he probably has a niche, an advantage that he can exploit," he said.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
These Days, Layoffs Compete With Loyalty

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE Harvard Business Review, in its current issue, displays a glaring contradiction. One author argues passionately that American companies require loyal employees to operate efficiently, and that means shunning layoffs. Turn the page, and the next article, titled "The Right Way to be Fired," argues that in today's world, only chumps fall into the loyalty trap.
 No attempt is made -- by the authors or the magazine's editors -- to resolve this contradiction, or even to recognize it. "I don't see the conflict," Suzy Wetlaufer, the editor in chief, said in an interview. "Human beings have complex minds and they can grasp the idea that organizations need to build trust, but the possibility of layoffs is always there." 
 Loyalty and layoffs. These are indeed two realities in uneasy coexistence today. By all the traditions of the American workplace, the loyalty of a company to its employees, and vice versa, is still valued as a source of mutual trust, greater effort and rising profits. But in the 21st century downturn, loyalty's enemy -- the layoff -- is also winning acceptance as standard business practice, even among the reluctant victims. Reflecting this new respectability, the prestigious Harvard Business Review gives layoffs and loyalty equal status in its summer issue, but without debating or mentioning the consequences. Many hope there will not be any.
"We have decided to rely on layoffs, to fold them into the corporate culture, and we are trying to minimize the impact on profits and performance," said Kathryn Shaw, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University.
The issue is simple. What is the best way to get people to work as hard as they can, and in doing so, raise output, revenue and profits? Loyalty generates the necessary trust and commitment, says Frederick F. Reichheld, a management consultant and the author of the other Harvard Business Review article, "Lead for Loyalty," as well as two books on the subject. His research, he said in an interview, shows that if a counter clerk, for example, increases his attention to customers by 5 percent, "you will kick up profits by a shocking amount." That extra effort requires commitment to an employer. The commitment comes when employees feel comfortable. And comfort requires, among other things, no layoffs or very few.
But layoffs are no longer minimized; they are often the first response to a corporate setback. The employee who ignores this fact of life is in for a shock, in the view of Laurence J. Stybel and Maryanne Peabody, authors of the Business Review article in support of layoffs and partners at Stybel Peabody Lincolnshire, a consulting firm. Their advice: Do not allow yourself to develop the view that you are indispensable to your company or that company is family. Prepare for the next job and watch for "exit" signals. "Being terminated should not come as a surprise," Mr. Stybel and Ms. Peabody write.
They are essentially in the "free agent" camp, which argues that a company's productivity and profits will rise if its employees are motivated not by loyalty but by their own needs. They will work hard not out of commitment to their employer but to develop their skills and thus their value in the job market, or because the work itself interests them, or to impress their co-workers and others in their field. This "network" will then help them land the next job. 
"If you put out less effort per hour, then productivity is undermined," said Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of DYG, a polling firm. "But suppose you expect something better to come along. You give a lot until it comes along."
There is even the view that fear of layoffs -- job insecurity -- works as well as loyalty in motivating workers. That is the conclusion that Paul Osterman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, draws from his research in the workplace. "Companies are finding that they can achieve their goals by maintaining a certain level of fear in the work force and that leads people to work hard," Mr. Osterman said.
So what is the answer? A back-of-the-envelope calculation, based on interviews with a dozen experts, suggests that loyalty -- undiminished by layoffs -- is the more profitable approach. That is particularly the case at companies with long-term goals that require commitment and continuity. Oil exploration is an example. So is pharmaceutical research. "Exxon talks of 20-year projects and they need people to hang around for 20 years," said Peter Capelli, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "You are hurt if they leave and you lose their experience."
But these are all preliminary findings. Layoffs have only recently matched loyalty in social status. Corporate America is freer than at any time since World War II to fire people at will, and the consequences are as yet unexplored. This column is an appeal to fire up the exploration. For starters, the Harvard Business Review might try to fill in the blank in the summer issue.

HEADLINE: Let the Surplus Go 

BYLINE:  By Robert M. Dunn Jr.; Robert M. Dunn Jr. is a professor of economics at George Washington University.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
An absurd debate is going on in Washington over who is to blame for the horrors of a declining federal budget surplus. The truth is that the fall in the surplus should be welcomed, given the current state of the economy, and politicians should be trying to take credit for it.
 The evidence is now overwhelming that the American economy started to slow in the early summer of 2000 and that we are now in, or close to, a recession. The percentage of the nation's manufacturing, mining and construction potential that is actually in use started dropping sharply in mid-2000 and, at 77 percent, is now at its lowest level since 1983. Corporate profits are plummeting. The unemployment rate has increased only to 4.5 percent from a low during the recent boom of 3.9 percent, but several companies have announced new layoffs that will worsen it. Preliminary numbers showed very slow growth in our country's output of products and services in the spring, and The Wall Street Journal reported Aug. 14 that the final figure is likely to show that output actually fell. If so, and if the July-to-September numbers show another drop, we will officially be in recession. 
 A federal budget surplus should decline in an economic downturn like this one, and attempts to "protect the surplus" by cutting expenditures, as some Republicans wish, or by increasing taxes, as Democratic leaders in Congress have suggested, are madness.
The federal budget automatically moves toward smaller surpluses or to a deficit in a recession because as tax receipts are declining, transfer payments, like unemployment benefits and food stamps, increase. This pattern is actually a good thing. The transfer payments and even that part of the lost revenue that is attributable to taxpayers falling into lower brackets are so-called "automatic stabilizers." And the existence of those stabilizers is the dominant reason the American economy has been less volatile since World War II than it was in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Our system of progressive taxes and financial help for the poor, as introduced in Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal during the 1930's, assures that in a recession, disposable personal income declines by much less than gross domestic product does. That not only supports the standard of living of the unemployed, but also sustains demand for consumer goods and services. This, in turn, helps maintain employment and sales in the industries that produce consumer items. Employees in those industries keep drawing incomes that they can spend, further supporting the economy.
Companies' investments in plants and equipment typically fall sharply in a recession, but consumers' spending declines only slightly. People may delay buying new cars and major appliances, but producers of most things that people buy usually get through recessions with only modest harm. The system of automatic stabilizers is critical, and any attempt to tamper with it in hope of restoring the surpluses would be worse than futile.
Personal consumption is now the only source of strength in the American economy, and it may be shaken by stock market losses that make families feel poorer. This gives particular importance to maintaining the public's disposable income at a fairly high level. While no one is proposing direct cuts to the automatic stabilizers, some Republicans have proposed other cuts -- in military spending and help for farmers, for example -- that would offset the stabilizers' calming effect.
The timing of the recent tax cut, with its $300 rebate for anyone who paid that much in income taxes last year, now looks smart. Both the current rebate and the promise of additional tax cuts in the future will encourage Americans to spend more now. The timing may have been accidental. The Bush campaign did not know when he first proposed the cut that a recession was on the way, and Congress may have been similarly unaware when it decided to include the rebate. But many clever political moves are more luck than planning.
Some Democratic senators risk becoming reincarnations of Herbert Hoover (who raised taxes in 1932 to balance the budget) by arguing that we must increase taxes to protect Social Security from problems that will emerge after 2020. Are they really suggesting that we prolong and deepen a recession in 2001-2002 to deal with problems of retirees in 2020-2030? Even by Washington standards that is nutty. The way to protect Social Security is to return quickly to a booming economy that will produce larger tax receipts in a year or two. Suggestions by Democrats that the recent tax cut should be reversed after the 2002 elections could frighten Americans into spending less now, which is certainly not the route to recovery.
Let the automatic stabilizers, aided by a well-timed tax cut, do their job. This is not the time to worry about a declining surplus or even a modest deficit. Get the economy rolling again, and big surpluses will return. To paraphrase Richard Nixon, we should all be Keynesians now.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/David G. Herro And Michael J. Welsh; 
Oakmark International Small Cap Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
TO value companies for their $110 million Oakmark International Small Cap fund, David G. Herro and Michael J. Welsh, the co-managers, use complementary approaches.
 "I view the valuation process almost as an academic exercise," said Mr. Herro, who was trained as a theoretical economist. Mr. Welsh is a certified public accountant with experience in valuing privately held businesses or small pieces of big, publicly traded ones. The fund's companies are bigger, Mr. Welsh said, "but the process is the same." 
 Together, they look for high-quality businesses outside the United States that sell for bargain prices. A low stock price "is insufficient for us," Mr. Welsh said from their offices in downtown Chicago. "Companies have to possess a management team that's actively involved in building shareholder value."
The fund returned 20.6 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 1.6 percent for its peers in the foreign stock category, according to Morningstar Inc. It returned 3.3 percent for the 12 months ended Thursday, putting it in the first percentile among the 733 foreign stock funds in the category; on average, those funds lost 25.5 percent.
Mr. Herro, 40, and Mr. Welsh, 38, work for Harris Associates, the fund's adviser. They also run the $900 million Oakmark International fund.
For the small-cap fund, the managers use a bottom-up investment approach to look for overseas candidates with market capitalizations of $100 million to $1 billion. The fund avoids countries like Russia and China because it cannot effectively apply its criteria to them.
"Not only is corporate governance nonexistent in Russia," Mr. Herro said, "but audited accounting standards are not really prevalent." In China, he added, corporate boards typically represent the government, not shareholders.
To find value, the managers screen companies based on ratios of total capitalization -- market capitalization plus long-term debt -- to earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT. The ratio compares the price of the business to the cash flow it generates, Mr. Herro said.
Unlike many other money managers, they do not eliminate depreciation from their calculation of operating profit. "In most cases, depreciation represents an ongoing capital expenditure, which is needed for the company to keep growing," Mr. Herro said.
The valuation screens reduce the pool to 300 to 400 companies. To pick their 75 to 100 stocks, the managers work with four analysts who dig into how each company is run.
Mr. Herro and Mr. Welsh spend about 40 percent of their time on the road, meeting with companies' managers. "We visit with the sole purpose of assessing how and why they invest their free cash flow," Mr. Herro said. "That's more important to us than their sales growth or whether they'll make their earnings projections."
Companies that can earn more than 15 percent above their cost of capital should reinvest free cash flow in operations, he added, or otherwise use it to pay down debt, buy back stock or pay dividends.
That is why they have about 8 percent of the fund's assets in Japan versus 20-plus percent for their benchmark, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Australasia Far East index.
"Japanese companies have accumulated huge amounts of cash on their balance sheets," Mr. Herro said, "but their return on equity is only in the high single digits."
The fund has 6 percent of its assets in South Korea. 
"They've opened up their economy and started to clean up their corporate governance problems," Mr. Welsh said, "but stocks are still priced as if they were in a crisis."
One South Korean favorite is Hite Brewery, whose stock they began buying in July 1997 at 20,000 won; the shares now trade at 43,500 won. Hite, based in Seoul, has nearly doubled its market share for beer in South Korea over the last six years, to about 60 percent, Mr. Welsh said, adding that declining Korean alcohol taxes would increase consumption. "Beer drinking is not as saturated an industry as it is in the West," and a new brewing plant has already increased profitability, he said.
Another favorite is Kone, a Finnish maker of elevators and escalators. "They generate good cash flow, which they're putting into R&D to develop new competitive products," Mr. Herro said. The business is attractive because it generates steady service revenue from equipment it has already installed, he added. 
The managers originally bought shares at the equivalent of 29 euros in April 1995; on Friday the shares closed at 87 euros.
In December, the managers bought shares of Meitec, a Japanese temporary employment agency for engineers. "They're in an industry that should explode as Japan restructures and reforms its labor practices and lets companies become more efficient over the next three to five years," Mr. Herro said. He added that Meitec's percentage return on capital was in the high teens and that management was using cash flow wisely to hire more engineers and buy back stock. The fund paid 3,500 yen for the shares; they are now at 3,550 yen.

HEADLINE: When the Numbers Just Don't Add Up 

BYLINE:  By KARL SCHOENBERGER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
INDUS INTERNATIONAL, a computer software maker, moved to Atlanta from the frenzy of Northern California's high-technology scene earlier this year, after it paid $4.3 million to settle a passel of investor lawsuits accusing it of fraudulently overstating revenue.
 Executives of the once-profitable company, which sells software and services to help large corporations manage their assets, say they are confident that its revenue growth is back on track and that its bookkeeping problems are history. 
 But Indus International is not out of the woods. Not yet.
Back in San Francisco, officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are completing parallel investigations of the accounting methods used by the company in late 1999 that led to the investor lawsuits. They are expected to announce their findings late this month. People close to the investigation said that both civil and criminal charges against the company and former employees were under consideration in the case. 
Indus, in a document filed last week with the S.E.C., disclosed that it had been cooperating with the S.E.C.'s formal investigation and had offered to settle the matter without admitting or denying wrongdoing. J. Michael Highland, chief financial officer of Indus, said the company otherwise had no comment on the S.E.C. and Justice Department investigations.
As if things were not difficult enough for Indus and other technology start-ups that managed to survive the Internet collapse through brutal restructuring and job cuts, many are now under investigation by law enforcement authorities for the way they recorded the ringing of their cash registers during the feverish competition of Nasdaq's bubble years. 
Responding to widespread concerns that investors were not always given reliable financial information in that time of frantic revenue growth, regional offices of the S.E.C., the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States attorney's office here are cooperating in a legal crackdown on accounting violations. 
A tough law-enforcement response to accounting irregularities, of course, is not new. In the past year, federal investigators have pursued cases of irregularities at companies like Waste Management, Cendant and Sunbeam. But now the government is turning up the heat in Silicon Valley, home to a preponderance of questionable accounting, particularly among software companies, during the Internet boom. 
Over the last four years, nearly one in five accounting restatements -- red flags for potential misconduct -- have been by companies in California, according to a study by Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm. (Arthur Andersen was itself the recent subject of an S.E.C. civil sanction for the way it audited the books of Waste Management, the trash-disposal company, and agreed to a settlement without admitting or denying civil fraud allegations.) In the same four-year period, the total number of restatements for all industries has nearly doubled, Arthur Andersen's report said. 
So far in the technology sector, federal investigators and prosecutors here have set their sights on relatively small companies, where a high proportion of problems center on what accountants call improper "revenue recognition" -- the recording of revenue that does not exist. It could be, for example, from a pending sale that is misclassified as completed, or a service contract in which money has not yet changed hands.
The Arthur Andersen study of accounting restatements from 1997 to 2000 showed that 27 percent of the restatements nationwide had been filed in the software and computer industries. About 62 percent of the software companies involved had annual gross revenue of less than $100 million.
The rise of accounting fraud investigations, specifically related to overstatement of revenue, reflects a serious white-collar crime trend in the high-technology sector in recent years, said Leslie B. Caldwell, chief of the securities fraud section for the United States attorney's office here. 
"The pressure to do this in the technology industry was intense because the expectation for growth was so high, and it wasn't sustainable," she said, without commenting on specific cases.
The inquiry at Indus International focused on revenue for the third quarter of 1999. According to the shareholder lawsuits against the company and former executives, the revenue total included sales derived from "irregular contracts," money that was not received during the quarter in question. Last October, Indus International agreed to settle the suits for $4.3 million without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
Previously, Ms. Caldwell said, her office waited for the S.E.C. to refer cases for criminal investigation. But now, "we're taking the bull in our own hands," she said.
"There are a number of matters under investigation of corporations that cooked their books to meet Wall Street's expectations -- expectations that the companies themselves created," she added.
Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, a trade group, said accounting problems in the software industry had arisen because of what he called vague rules covering sales of licensing agreements, which resulted in many companies claiming revenue that they expected to receive.
"The rules for revenue recognition were a bit cloudy, not just for software companies but for any company that delivers services over time," Mr. Miller said. His organization, he said, was not making excuses for executives who intentionally violated regulations. "Yes, there was pressure to drive the top line," he said. "But you can never justify misconduct."
Ms. Caldwell's unit of seven lawyers, responsible for expediting complicated and paper-intensive securities investigations, was created in February 2000 by Robert S. Mueller, United States attorney for the Northern District of California, whom President Bush chose to serve as director of the F.B.I. 
Matthew J. Jacobs, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office here, said Mr. Mueller had made the prosecution of accounting fraud a major objective because of its prevalence in both economic booms and declines. Mr. Mueller was not available for comment, the United States attorney's office said on Friday.
In its most prominent case to date, Ms. Caldwell's team obtained indictments last September against two former executives at McKesson, the pharmaceutical and medical technology company based here. The defendants were charged with accounting fraud related to the 1999 merger of McKesson and HBO & Company, a software company based in Atlanta. Prosecutors said $9 billion in shareholder losses resulted. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the case is in the pretrial phase. 
THE F.B.I. and federal prosecutors here are investigating about 50 cases of possible criminal securities fraud in the district, more than a dozen of them focusing on companies suspected of accounting fraud.
In addition to Indus International, at least six small and medium-size software companies in Northern California are under federal criminal and civil investigation, according to officials. Among them is Critical Path, a San Francisco company that sells e-mail messaging technology to other businesses and reported $135.7 million in sales last year. In February, after an internal investigation that led to the departure of its chief executive and two other executives, Critical Path restated revenue for the third and fourth quarters of 2000, subtracting a total of $19.4 million from what it had claimed. The company's share price plummeted and class-action suits were filed, contending deception and fraud. Critical Path has said it is cooperating with investigators.
In another case, the S.E.C. filed a civil complaint last September in Federal District Court here against three former executives of the Cylink Corporation, a Santa Clara company that makes cryptographic software for computer network security, accusing them of violating accounting rules by recognizing spurious transactions as sales in quarterly earnings statements. The complaint said Cylink recognized more than $900,000 in revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 1998 for sales in which some customers were given a three-month window to cancel their orders. 
"When senior officers are involved in this kind of conduct we're going to hold them responsible," Robert L. Mitchell, head of the S.E.C.'s enforcement office in San Francisco, said when the complaint was issued. "Companies only act through individuals." The S.E.C. settled a separate administrative "cease and desist" proceeding with the corporation. In the civil litigation against three former Cylink executives, each was accused of securities fraud, circumvention of Cylink's internal controls and falsification of records.
IN July, according to court records, one of the former Cylink executives, Thomas Butler, who had been vice president for sales, signed a consent decree, without admitting or denying the charges, agreeing to pay a $100,000 fine and forfeit a $25,000 bonus he had been awarded by Cylink for his sales performance. Litigation against the two other defendants is still pending. Robert Fougner, Cylink's general counsel, said that he and other company executives could not comment on the case. 
In cases in which criminal charges are brought against company executives, potential penalties can be harsh. In addition to fines imposed by the S.E.C., a conviction of an executive on a criminal securities fraud charge can result in a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine as high as $1 million. Conviction on a lesser charge, like wire fraud or conspiracy, carries a maximum five-year sentence and $250,000 fine. 
Until recently, the pace of these investigations had been plodding, owing to their complexity and a shortage of resources. For example, Scorpion Technologies, a software company that was based in Los Gatos, Calif., and is now defunct, was accused of fraudulently claiming as much as $3.6 million of its $12.4 million in reported 1991 revenue. The S.E.C. filed civil charges and federal prosecutors indicted company executives on securities fraud charges in 1996. The last of the Scorpion defendants, John T. Dawson, was indicted in 1999. Last November, he pleaded guilty to charges that he had helped create offshore companies that masqueraded as buyers of Scorpion software products. Mr. Dawson's sentencing hearing is set for Oct. 2.
The Justice Department has a high threshold for criminal prosecution in these cases, with a distinction being made between misleading accounting practices and criminal fraud, Ms. Caldwell said. A suspicious accounting trick, by itself, cannot be the basis for seeking an indictment without other facts establishing deliberate fraud, she said. 
Some major technology companies, including Lucent Technologies, have been subject to recent class-action suits contending irregularities in the way the companies accounted for their growing revenue before their businesses weakened. The S.E.C. started examining Lucent's books last November, after the company had disclosed an accounting problem, fired an employee and filed a restatement lowering its revenue for its fiscal year 2000 by $679 million. 
Lucent, however, seems an exception. For now, at least, it appears to be the smaller technology companies that are receiving the most scrutiny.
A common thread in the companies under investigation is the restatement of quarterly financial results after internal accountants or outside auditors have found problems. A restatement almost always results in plunging stock prices, indignant investors and shareholder class-action suits.
The S.E.C. has strengthened its investigations of revenue-recognition cases since its former chairman, Arthur Levitt, warned of what he called the erosion of the quality of financial reporting in corporate America in a speech at New York University in September 1998 and announced tightened enforcement. Mr. Levitt said he was concerned that "the motivation to meet Wall Street earnings expectations may be overriding common-sense business practices."
"Too many corporate managers, auditors, and analysts are participating in a game of nods and winks," he added.
INVESTOR advocates like Barbara Roper, director for investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, have expressed concern that Mr. Levitt's successor, Harvey L. Pitt, a Wall Street lawyer, may take a less aggressive approach on enforcement. Mr. Pitt, a former general counsel for the S.E.C. who, while in private practice, represented Ivan F. Boesky, who was convicted of insider trading, has advocated streamlining S.E.C. regulations.
But Mr. Pitt assured the Senate Banking Committee at a confirmation hearing in July that he would "ensure vigilant enforcement of sound rules that protect all investors against fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative misconduct."
Charles D. Niemeier, chief accountant for the S.E.C.'s division of enforcement in Washington, said the agency took action in 100 cases of suspected financial disclosure fraud last year, compared with 75 in 1998 and 40 in 1991. Fifty-seven of last year's cases involved revenue-recognition problems, Mr. Niemeier said.
He described a snowball effect -- the possible compounding of revenue-recognition problems from quarter to quarter. 
"Once a company goes down the path of earnings management, it's very difficult to get off, because artificial earnings become the floor of future earnings," said Mr. Niemeier, who also serves as co-director of the S.E.C.'s new Financial Fraud Task Force. "What starts out as a small accounting problem by the end becomes monumental. It's like having a noose around your neck, and you're the one tightening it."
Software companies like Indus, Critical Path and Cylink are particularly susceptible to encountering accounting problems -- and accusations of fraud -- because of the complex nature of the licensing agreements they must negotiate to sell their products. Unlike service providers in other industries, software vendors have relied heavily on a customer base of dot-com start-ups, many of them now insolvent or financially unstable. 
Indeed, the software sector figured prominently in the roster of federal securities class-action lawsuits filed in 2000. It was the single biggest industry category -- 18 cases out of the total of 107, or nearly 17 percent of those involving accounting violation charges., according to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The study also showed a sharp increase in total cases involving companies in the computer services, electronics and telecommunications industries -- to 45 percent of the total last year from 34 percent in 1999. 
The securities class-action suits may be a rough barometer of the severity of the problem, law enforcement officials say. But the real test for federal investigators is determining whether accounting violations were isolated errors or a part of a pattern of deception known as "revenue management," in which corporate officers act with the intent to bend accounting rules or to cover up past mistakes. 
"The cases we take on involve the corporate culture, the true situation at the top of the organization, where the boss says, 'We have to make these numbers or else,' " said Ms. Caldwell. "The Justice Department is not interested in renegade salespeople."
At Indus International, the accounting problems appeared to be limited to one quarter, and the company's board took swift corrective action, issuing a restatement of the revenue in question and restructuring the company's upper management.
At issue in the case was a practice said to be common among many companies, including those in software, that artificially inflates revenue to meet ambitious growth targets by pushing products and licensing agreements on customers. It often involves transactions in which money does not necessarily change hands. Such deals typically pivot on undisclosed side letters or confidential agreements laying out terms allowing distributors to return unsold products, for example, or default on financing.
Joan P. Platt, the chief financial officer at Indus in 1999, said in a brief telephone interview that the use of side letters by the company's sales force -- without the knowledge of company accountants -- caused the revenue-recognition problems under investigation. She declined to elaborate. Ms. Platt, a 20-year veteran of Coopers & Lybrand, resigned from Indus in December 1999 to join MarketWatch.com, a financial news service, as chief financial officer and vice president for finance. 
The management realignment that coincided with Ms. Platt's departure led to the replacement of the company's chief executive, William J. Grabske, in early January 2000 by Kent O. Hudson, who had been a full-time management consultant at the company. At the end of that month, Mr. Hudson and his new management team issued a statement saying that the company's third-quarter 1999 revenue had been overstated by $5 million, "all of which related to licensing fees."
Mr. Grabske, who led the company during the period when the problems occurred, could not be reached for comment last week.
The adjustment lowered revenue for the quarter to $45.8 million and reduced net earnings to $1.1 million from $3.5 million. The company later reported net earnings of $23.8 million for all of 1999 on revenue of $178.5 million. Last year, the downturn in the industry cut the company's revenue by 18 percent and left it with a net loss of $58.7 million.
Results for its latest quarter suggest that Indus is getting back on its feet: revenue rose 32 percent, to $43.1 million; its net loss was $6.7 million, including the effects of an $8 million restructuring charge, compared with a net loss of $20.2 million a year earlier. Its stock price, which hit a bottom of $1.50 in December, now trades at $7.10.
COMPARED with Lucent's financial accounting restatements of $679 million and the problems that have befallen that company, the amount of shareholder equity lost in Indus's case seems inconsequential. Indus's $4.3 million class-action settlement was also relatively small. To settle its lawsuits last year, Cendant, the big real estate and travel company, paid $3.5 billion -- more than 10 times greater than the second-largest federal securities class-action settlement in history, which was paid by the network equipment company 3Com, also last year. In proportion to income, however, the settlement by Indus was a significant burden for the company. 
Federal regulators have taken action against some big companies. The S.E.C. penalized Arthur Andersen, the big accounting firm, in June, obtaining a $7 million fine for Andersen's failures at Waste Management, which led to a $1.43 billion restatement of revenue in 1998. 
The S.E.C. would not comment on other Fortune 500 companies that may be under investigation, but there are clues suggesting possible targets.
Federal investigators say they monitor Stanford Law School's securities class-action clearinghouse, a database of court records that includes a wide variety of accounting fraud charges against public corporations of all sizes. The number of cases tracked by the Web site, at securities.stanford.edu/index.html, has been climbing rapidly since the Nasdaq plummeted last year. Many of the lawsuits contend wrongdoing in allocations of shares in initial public offerings. More than 270 cases have been reported so far this year, versus 211 for all of last year.
Bill Parish, an independent investment portfolio manager and financial analyst in Portland, Ore., is one of many investment professionals who blame the accounting industry for the rise in accounting irregularities. An accountant who formerly worked at Arthur Andersen's Portland office, Mr. Parish said the big accounting firms had placed too high a priority on expanding their lucrative tax advisory and business consulting operations in recent years, at the expense of traditional accounting services. As a result, the firms have become less rigorous in examining client books and lack the necessary independence as auditors to challenge irregular practices, he said. 
The S.E.C. civil fraud complaint against Arthur Andersen in June is a case in point, he said. 
"If you want to know how these things are allowed to happen, you have to look at the accountants," Mr. Parish said. "There's been a collapse of the integrity of accounting profession. In a way, I feel sorry for the C.E.O.'s."
But the circumstances behind accounting fraud are rarely simple, and fault is hard to pin down, said Harvey Kelly, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who practices forensic accounting, the examination of books for possible legal violations. The lines are particularly blurry in the high-technology industry, he said, where there are "increasingly creative transaction structures."
Accounting for the revenue from these transactions is a challenge. "The accounting industry and the regulators have come out with guidelines for this," Mr. Kelley said, "but it's not uncommon for the creativity of the business side to outpace the rules."

Taking a Longer View Of Living in the Minors

BYLINE:  By GEORGE GMELCH; George Gmelch, a professor of anthropology at Union College, is author of "Inside Pitch: Life in Professional Baseball" (Smithsonian Institution Press, 2001), from which this is adapted.

 BODY:
It was my first road trip in 24 years. As the Birmingham Barons' bus pulled out of the parking lot of Hoover Met Stadium in Alabama -- destination Jacksonville, Fla., then on to Orlando, for eight road games -- Manager Tony Franklin stood up to introduce me.
 "I'd like you to meet George Gmelch," he said. "He's an anthropology professor at Union College who is studying your lives as ballplayers. I don't know why anyone would find what you do interesting, but that's his business and he's a whole lot smarter than me." (Laughter.) 
 "Anyway, he was a player in the Tigers' organization in the 60's, so he knows his way around. I want you to help him any way you can." 
The players turned in their seats, craning to get a good look at me.
I smiled a lot, trying not to show my nervousness. I appreciated Tony's remarks, but I no longer knew my way around. I was not even sure I could talk baseball anymore. 
It wasn't long before I realized how different the world of pro ball in the 1990's was from my day. We'd only gotten a mile from the ballpark when the team bus pulled into a Blockbuster. Half a dozen players piled off and returned with an armful of videos. That night, during the 13-hour ride to Jacksonville, "Die Hard," "Lethal Weapon," "Road Warrior," "RoboCop 2" and "The Abyss" were shown. Around 4 a.m., during "Robo Cop 2," I wadded bits of paper napkin and stuffed them in my ears. Players who weren't watching the movie listened to music on their Walkmans and intermittently slept.
In the 60's, team buses were often old and cramped. The air conditioning was so weak you weren't sure if you'd be cooler with the window open or closed. Players passed the time playing cards and trivia games, looking out the window and talking. Someone usually had a guitar, and others would join in singing.
Riding with the Barons in 1992 launched me on a five-year adventure as a baseball anthropologist. After a few summers observing the minor leagues, I shifted to the majors, where I paid daily visits to the ballpark, arriving with the players in the early afternoon and staying through the evening. My initial fears about being accepted by today's players fortunately proved groundless: ballplayers with few exceptions turn out to be ideal subjects -- cooperative, forthcoming and generous with their time.
On the Barons' bus, the banter and fellowship I so fondly remembered from my day was missing. In exchange, as on other team buses I rode in Albany and Jamestown, N.Y., between 1992 and 1999, there was comfort: legroom, bigger seats, large clean windows, a toilet in the rear, reliable air conditioning, and TV and VCR. When one player's Walkman broke, he told me he didn't know how he was going to survive the trip. On the Barons' bus, when I mentioned this later to Franklin, who, like me, grew up in the pre-personal-electronic era, he said: "Those things have ruined road trips. They've taken all the fun out of them."
On that Florida trip and others, I was struck by the players' lack of interest in the passing scene. As a young ballplayer I learned a good deal about the U.S.A. from bus and train windows. On a 24-hour train trip from the Tigers' spring training base in Lakeland, Fla., to the Carolina League town of Rocky Mount, N.C., I got my first glimpse of the South, of tarpaper-roof shanties clustered near the tracks, of black people sitting outside on crates and makeshift benches. Having grown up in a middle-class suburb of San Francisco, I had never seen this kind of poverty before or so many African-Americans in one place.
In 1992, that same route looked much like the rest of the country: the same fast-food restaurants, gas stations and retail outlets. No wonder the players had little curiosity about it. In the 1960's, my roommates and I had decorated the walls of our new digs with maps; today's players put up posters.
Baseball people like to say that the game doesn't change. But it certainly looks different to this old-timer. Agents, arbitration, autographs as commodities, baseball chapel, Baseball America, baseball cards for minor leaguers and free agency are all new. As are wacky mascots and nightly promotions. And there are many more specialists -- closers, midrelievers and the d.h. New technology, like radar guns, electronic scoreboards, Diamond Vision, and video have also changed the look of the game.
Things that are absent include Sunday doubleheaders, heavy bats, infield chatter, high-cut stirrups and ribbing the opposing players.
The men who play the game today are different. They are more ethnically diverse and international. Asians and Australians, many, many more Latinos, but fewer African-Americans. Though today's players don't always have great baseball smarts, they are better educated. About half have gone to college, a rarity in the 1960's.
The cliche that today's ballplayers are bigger, stronger and faster than ever happens to be true. Claims that the 1927 Yankees could beat today's Yankees are fantasy. Players train better and drink less; physical training is far ahead of where it was in the 1960's.
Biodex machines and StairMasters strengthen and condition muscles throughout the year. Even on road trips, the Barons were shuttled to a local gym for a daily workout. Every team now has a full-time trainer (big league teams have three) looking after players and applying new science. In my day, "training" consisted of taping ankles and rubbing liniment on sore muscles, usually done by the clubhouse boy.
New protective equipment, such as ear flaps on batting helmets, helps prevent injury. Injuries are down and recovery times are shorter because of the use of ultrasound, micro-current and interferential therapy. Although there are still too many pizzas, burgers and hot dogs, diet has also improved. Fruit and veggies are now standard fare in postgame spreads.
But in view of the fact that the average salary of $2 million is more than 100 times greater than the 1967 average of $19,000, I assumed minor leaguers would also be prospering. Not so.
What most minor leaguers make today, after inflation, is less than what my teammates and I made 30 years ago. Except for the few who receive large signing bonuses, rookies earn so little ($900 per month) that some depend on their parents' credit cards to get by.
Low salaries also mean that today's players do not consider a career in the minor leagues and instead leave pro ball once they realize there's little chance of making it to the majors. With few players over 30 playing Class AA or Class AAA, minor league baseball has lost the cagey veterans it once had and the finesse they brought to the game. Maybe that explains, too, the lack of hazing, which was prevalent when I played.
To a great extent, changes in pro ball -- increased diversity, individualism, professionalism and globalization; new technology; a growing wage gap -- reflect changes in the larger society.
What hasn't changed is the allure of the game for those who play it. "I'd give anything to go back to May 1984," a former Class A ballplayer told me about the month he broke into pro ball. "My biggest regret is that I didn't seize the moment, that I didn't realize that this was my shot. I think back and wonder: how did I dare have my mind elsewhere, when all I had to do was suck it up and give it my all for a few hours each day? Now I'll never know how far I could have gone."
I am no different. A chance encounter during spring training with Gail Henley, a manager of mine in the Tigers' organization, brought home to me how powerful that appeal was for me even after three decades and a fulfilling career as a professor.
Henley and I were chatting about the old times -- the crazy pranks and personalities -- when suddenly my curiosity got the better of me, and I blurted out the big question, the one that had bothered me all these years: Was I a real prospect? I'd always wondered if I could have made it to the big leagues. Although I often batted cleanup and was twice promoted in midseason, my batting average fluctuated wildly from one season to the next. 
And I was released from baseball prematurely, my career ended by a threatened libel suit stemming from a newspaper article I wrote about racism in the Southern town where I was playing.
Henley hesitated before answering. "No," he said softly. "You were good, but never a real prospect. You weren't the complete package. You were lucky to get out of baseball when you did and go on to graduate school."
Now, finally, I know. What do I feel? A pang, disbelief, some defensiveness, but also an odd sense of relief. Henley's assessment put an end to my springtime fantasies about the life I might have lived.

The Blockbuster Culture of Summer

BYLINE:  By VERLYN KLINKENBORG 

 BODY:
Summer dwindles, even as high August comes. The roar of summer culture has reached its climax, and the county fairs are beginning to kick in. They are the grace notes that really signal the beginning of this season's coda. Since June, every arena, every theater, every amphitheater and grassy bowl in the country has sponsored a festival, a jamboree or a concert series of some sort. Rock-and-roll retirees are giving it one more go wherever they can, and so are the senior citizens of hip-hop. Opera glimmers from upstate New York. The fringe binges downtown. Everyone in the middle tries to see "The Seagull" in the park. Summer is still what New Haven used to be -- a place to open out of town -- and it's also still the mainest of the mainstream. 
 More than anything, we seem to want from summer culture a mingled sense of where we are and what we're seeing. Consider the drive-in movie, a staple of summer culture, now nearly gone. It was a strange amalgam and a perfect expression of the way Americans love to engage and disengage in culture at almost the same instant. The screen flickered against the night sky, and disembodied voices spoke beside the car window in a monophonic rasp. But whatever happened on screen, it could not quite preclude your awareness of the setting, the oddness of sitting in your own car, the intimacy even in the midst of a crowd. 
 That dual awareness of setting and the work itself is a part of any truly cultural experience, even when we talk of being transported. Strictly speaking, I suppose, there is something almost illegitimate about being moved by a symphony when it is performed outdoors and the light is falling and the humidity isn't too high. That is surrendering to the atmosphere as much as to the music. 
In most cases, the special intimacy of the summer season of dance, bluegrass, jazz and classical music is dwarfed by that other summer season of mass-produced artifacts for a mass audience. As this summer has demonstrated, America seems to be more and more preoccupied with the machinery of mass culture, with gross receipts and first weekends and audience share, numbers that are often more entertaining than the products whose fates they measure. This is the summer when it dawned on the networks that we knew all along they were showing reruns during school vacation. (The movie studios still don't think we know.) That's how we got "The Fear Factor," a show that can best be described as extreme "Friends" -- three guys, three girls, great bodies, ambiguous jobs, ridiculous situations. This summer, it isn't criticism enough to say that the big movies were worse than a gnat in your eye. You must also say that they tanked in their second weekend. 
It's usually heretical to ask what culture is for. But the sober answers -- the ones that artists and philosophers have been struggling with for centuries -- have been replaced by a circular one. Culture is to support the industry of culture. Entertainment is to support the industry of entertainment.
Some reports suggest that cultural spending has fallen this summer, especially if by culture you mean the zeppelins of summer diversion -- the concert tours, the blockbuster movies, the gargantuan theme parks. If so, it's not only because the economy has cooled even as ticket prices have risen. It's also because no one likes being trapped in a circle of diminishing returns. Even summer has to offer something more essential than the democratic sensation of having seen "Jurassic Park: The Rerun" the same weekend everyone else in America saw it. VERLYN KLINKENBORG

Profit Warnings Take Another Toll on Prices

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Bleak messages about the future of corporate profits overshadowed better-than-expected economic data last week, and kept stocks mired in negative territory.
 Investors paid little attention to an increase in housing starts, retail sales and consumer confidence and a decrease in first-time unemployment claims. 
 Instead, they focused on downbeat forecasts from companies. Wal-Mart said it would not meet profit goals for the second half of the year, and Ciena said fourth-quarter sales could fall as much as 20 percent from third-quarter levels. Dell Computer, Ford Motor and Gap all helped lead a broad-based decline on Friday, after each company weighed in with doubts that its profits would revive soon. 
 Investors are also looking ahead to Tuesday, when a Federal Reserve committee is widely expected to cut interest rates. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 175.47 points, or 1.7 percent, to 10,240.78. The Nasdaq composite index fell 89.46 points, or 4.6 percent, to 1,867.01. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 28.19 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,161.97. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.83 percent from 4.98 percent the previous week. SHERRI DAY

Flintstone Futurama

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; Paul Krugman's column will appear on Tuesday.

 BODY:
It is true that advertisers have special sensitivities.
 Pizza companies sometimes don't buy commercials on shows that have bloodshed, fearing the unappetizing juxtaposition with tomato sauce. 
 Phone companies have been known to avoid advertising on crime shows featuring ransom calls.
Still, there was something chilling about Procter & Gamble's decision to pull its ads from an Emmy-nominated episode of the CBS show "Family Law" because the company was worried about a story involving gun ownership. 
P. & G. is not prudish. It advertises on soap operas, where hotties hop in and out of bed all day. But, as The Times's Bill Carter reported on Friday, the company is sensitive to political "hot-button issues."
CBS apparently replaced the episode -- in which the law firm defends a woman whose son shoots himself with her handgun -- with a different episode because it felt it would never make up revenue lost from P. & G. at a time when advertising is in a deep slump. CBS also said that this summer it wouldn't repeat other episodes -- dealing with the death penalty, abortion and interfaith marriage -- that troubled P. & G. 
Other TV executives and producers cringed at the prospect that advertisers would be able to dictate the content of shows.
Lately, it seems, there's a whole lot of chilling going on.
Cesar Chavez organizing a grape boycott to advance the cause of migrant workers gave way to Tom DeLay trying to organize a boycott of CNN to advance the right-wing agenda.
Once the tactic of the disenfranchised -- invented in 1880 by Irish tenant farmers to isolate a punitive British overseer named Charles C. Boycott -- boycotts are now the tactic of the enfranchised.
The Bush White House says it will boycott journalists at Talk magazine because the September issue features a fantasy fashion layout, with two sultry models playing the Bush twins in pink frosted lipstick and pink feather boas behind bars.
(Everyone is sympathetic to the Bushes' desire to shield their daughters. But sending Jenna, still on probation, to L.A. to be a summer intern at Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, which produces "The Sopranos," and be exposed to the wild Hollywood party scene is begging for tabloid trouble.)
Growing up with "The Jetsons," "Star Trek," the General Motors Futurama exhibit at the World's Fair with lunar colonies and underseas resorts, and Disney's "Tomorrowland Speedway," we imagined the 21st century as sleek and expansive, a cascade of creativity and invention in the arts, technology, science and medicine.
But the combination of the narrow Bush vision and shrinking economy is creating a climate where everything feels crimped, more about limiting expression than liberating it.
We face the jarring prospect that some of our top scientists may move to England, where they won't face the same strangling curbs on stem cell research, which is bound to go forward even without President Bush holding up his little "Stop" sign. Expatriate scientists are redolent of American artists in the 20's who flocked to sophisticated Paris, far from Prohibition and Calvin Coolidge.
We've had the Age of Enlightenment and the Age of Aquarius. Now we're in the Age of Arrested Development.
Never mind the interplanetary cooperation presaged in "Star Trek." We're retreating from planetary cooperation. America has grown insular, isolationist, paranoid.
Nothing leaps ahead. Power clings to the passe, retreating from the cutting edge, running safe TV shows, choosing scientific stasis. Everything -- from Washington's trashed international treaties to the coal-and-drill Bush environmental policy to Hollywood's tedious remakes and endless parade of World War II and Cinderella-themed movies -- looks backward, not forward.
Our missile shield, more science fiction than science, has become a metaphor for our passive, defensive, retro crouch.
In the name of Captain Kirk, how did this happen? How did we end up charting a course to timidly go where every man has been before?

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company has been in the news lately over safety issues, declining sales and job cutbacks because of the weak economy. But William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman, at least wants Ford to be known as the car company that saved Detroit from drying up. 
 With the Detroit area gripped by drought, Ford Motor has stopped watering the lawns at 17 Michigan factories and cut back on car washes for executive and company cars. The moves saved 500,000 gallons of water a day. 
 Mr. Ford, 44, who enjoys a reputation as the auto industry's most environment-friendly executive, said Ford Motor had saved up to five billion gallons of water a year since 1996 through conservation methods. That is the equivalent of 30 minutes of flow over Niagara Falls, Mr. Ford said, and a lot of car washes. Micheline Maynard

HEADLINE: With Fears Fading, More Gays Spurn Old Preventive Message 

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
He is safe most of the time.
 Use-a-condom safe. Protect yourself and your partner safe. Are you positive or negative safe? 
 But there are also times when Seth Watkins, or Twilightchild, as he is known in the personal advertisements he places on the Internet, is not so careful.
For example, when he visits the back room of the Powerhouse, a bar on Folsom Street, and has unprotected sex with men he does not know. 
Or, when, lonely and "in a depressed state," he drinks too many Malibu pineapples and finds someone he hopes to see again, as happened one night last summer, he said, the night he believes he became infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. 
Mr. Watkins, 24, is an H.I.V. prevention educator and counselor in San Francisco. He knows how H.I.V. is transmitted and how to avoid becoming infected.
But like an increasing number of gay men in San Francisco and elsewhere, Mr. Watkins sometimes still puts himself and possibly other people at risk.
"I don't like to think about it because I don't want to give anyone H.I.V.," Mr. Watkins said. Yet his lapses also do not draw the concern and censure from his peers that they might have even a few years ago.
His friends, he said, all take similar chances. He is acquainted with more than a few men who practice barebacking, as unprotected anal sex has come to be called. And in the gay newspapers he reads, condom use, once a rallying call, has become a subject of controversy and debate.
Twenty years after the AIDS epidemic emerged in the United States, public health experts are facing a new and perplexing challenge: AIDS, once a bold and flamboyant killer, a "T. Rex in the living room," as one expert put it, now seizes its prey more quietly. New treatments can keep the disease at bay, and hyper-vigilance is no longer always an easy sell.
So prevention workers in San Francisco find themselves desperately preaching to a choir they thought was long ago converted: gay men, who were among the first to contract AIDS in this country, the first to demand attention for the disease and money to fight it and the first to mobilize safe-sex campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus.
In many cases, the prevention slogans that galvanized gay men in the early years of the epidemic now fall on deaf ears. Many gay men remain meticulous in taking precautions, and many are in long-term monogamous relationships. But surveys of gay men in San Francisco and in other cities indicate that an increasing number, young and old, H.I.V. negative and H.I.V. positive, are engaging in high-risk sexual behavior.
Unprotected anal intercourse, which carries a high risk of transmitting the AIDS virus, is becoming more common in bars and in sex clubs, at so-called circuit parties, where illicit drugs are used frequently, and in private sexual encounters, many of them arranged over the Internet.
The complex psychology that underlies sexual risk-taking is in most ways no different among homosexual men than among heterosexuals, and informal surveys suggest that risk-taking is increasing for gay men in other urban areas, too. But public health experts here track new infections and high-risk sexual behaviors more closely than in many cities.
For example, one survey by the Stop AIDS Project, a nonprofit organization in San Francisco, found that the number of men who reported using a condom "every time" during anal sex dropped to 49.7 percent in 2000 from 69.6 percent in 1994. In that same time, the survey found, the number of men having such unprotected sex with more than one partner increased to 48.8 percent from 23.4 percent. One-third of those men said that they either did not know their partners' H.I.V. status or that they knew it was different from their own. 
At the same time, public health officials say, a variety of indicators used to monitor the spread of H.I.V. suggest that, after years when new infection rates among gay men here were stable or declined, they are now on the rise. And nationally, studies have indicated that H.I.V. infection rates are increasing among young gay men. 
"I think the promiscuity of the 1970's is back," said Dr. Virginia Cafaro, an H.I.V. specialist in San Francisco, who said she was seeing more men who were newly infected, and hearing more accounts of high-risk sexual behavior in the gay men she treated.
"The party scene is much more active, the sex clubs are back in bloom and the Internet is just an incredible avenue for people to meet," Dr. Cafaro said. "They go on line, introduce themselves and an hour later there's a stranger at your door."
In surveys and interviews, some gay men say that where once they received pressure from sexual partners to use condoms, they are now pushed to avoid them. At a focus group, convened in June by the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies of the University of California at San Francisco to try to understand why risk-taking is increasing, one man put it this way: "You pull out a condom and they say, 'Why are you using that?' "
Dr. Mitchell H. Katz, the director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said health officials were now dealing with a different problem that required more sophisticated prevention tactics.
"Certain death was a powerful motivator for safe sex," Dr. Katz said. "If you don't realize that H.I.V. has changed, you wonder, How can these guys be doing this after all we went through, after all we've lost?"

Better Drugs, Less Fear
Only a few years ago, gaunt men in wheelchairs haunted the streets of San Francisco's Castro District. The dark blotches of Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer linked to AIDS, flowered on cheeks and on forearms. Funeral homes struggled to meet the demand for their services.
With the advent of drugs that prolong lives, though no one knows for how long, those daily horrors have faded. Instead, there are men tied to endless pill-taking regimens, who may suffer debilitating, occasionally fatal, side effects. But they look healthy, and they have returned to offices, gyms, restaurants and bars, restored to full -- and fully sexual -- lives. 
And as the obituaries have slowed, the balancing of safety and danger that is a theme in every life has shifted.
"If unprotected sex now equals longtime therapy," said Don Howard, who has been active for many years in AIDS-related issues in San Francisco, "all of a sudden a lot of people who were scared are taking a whole lot of risk."
In the years since protease inhibitors began extending lives, for example, a generation of young gay men have come of age without ever burying a friend or visiting a hospital room.
At the Cafe, a bar on Market Street that draws a younger gay crowd, a 21-year-old man says he has never known anyone who has died of AIDS. He worries about becoming infected, but he sometimes forgoes a condom anyway. 
"It feels good," he said, "because there's no rubber."
For him, and for others like him, exhortations about H.I.V. are like cautions about cigarettes, illicit drugs or driving too fast, warnings from "old people" about distant dangers.
Older men have seen AIDS do its worst work, but some are weary -- weary enough 
to take bigger chances.
"The prospect of going through the rest of your life having to cover yourself up every time you want to get intimate with someone is an awful one," said John, 44, who found out in March that he was H.I.V. positive. John spoke on condition that his last name be withheld for fear it would cause difficulty on his job.
"Now I've got H.I.V. and I don't have to worry about getting it," he said. "There is a part of me that's relieved. I was tired of always having to be careful, of this constant diligence that has to be paid to intimacy when intimacy should be spontaneous." 
He took his own precautions, he said, but almost never used condoms, though he had watched friends die of AIDS. "There is no such thing as safe sex," said John, whose partner is also H.I.V. positive. "If people want to use condoms they can. I didn't go out and purposely get H.I.V. Accidents happen."
But later he added, "I guess I could be seen as getting too comfortable with the level of risk I was willing to take."
Or simply trying, perhaps, to deal with an unending fear.
"Gay men are out there wanting to meet people and every encounter is fraught with anxiety," said Dr. Thomas Coates, the director of the AIDS prevention study center here. "The equations that people use are often idiosyncratic and hard to understand."
Among men who are H.I.V. positive, most go to great lengths to avoid transmitting the virus.
"I would sooner cut off my arm than expose my lover to H.I.V.," as one man put it.
But there are some infected men who argue that it is not their obligation to help prevent the spread of H.I.V. This is a view shaped in part by the practice in public health of aiming AIDS prevention campaigns only at the uninfected, in the belief that H.I.V.-infected men, already stigmatized, should not be further burdened.
"There is a huge continuum of sentiment about whether H.I.V.-positive men have any responsibility toward people who are negative," said Dr. Andrew Forsyth, a health psychologist at the AIDS prevention studies center here.
Dr. Forsyth added: "In any other virus you'd involve people who were infected. Here, there's this sense that you don't involve people who are positive."

Arguing Acceptable Risks
Some gay men argue that with drug therapy prolonging lives, H.I.V. has become just one of many hazards and that unprotected sex is a calculated risk, not unlike others that rational people take every day.
"There is an interesting dialogue going on in the gay community," said Dr. Ronald D. Stall, chief of the behavioral intervention research branch of the H.I.V. prevention branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which convened the National H.I.V. Prevention Conference in Atlanta Aug. 12-15. 
"What we're seeing is a voicing about barebacking," Dr. Stall said. "But the larger issue is helping gay men find strategies that are going to allow them to have full sexual lives without transmitting H.I.V."
Some gay writers blame public health officials for continuing to rely on a "sky is falling" approach that, they say, deals neither with a changed epidemic nor with the realities of men's sexual lives.
For example, Michael Scarce, a writer in San Francisco and the author of a controversial 1999 article in POZ magazine titled "A Ride on the Wild Side," contends it is unrealistic to expect gay men to use condoms every time they have sex for the rest of their lives.
Barebacking, Mr. Scarce pointed out, in many cases involves H.I.V. positive men having unprotected sex with men who are also positive, a practice many people might see as a reasonable risk, though some scientists have speculated that this practice might transmit more virulent strains of the virus. 
But in any case, Mr. Scarce argues, safe sex was originally promoted as a stopgap measure, a temporary solution until medical experts "figured out what's going on."
"We've never really gotten back to gay men and said, 'Medical science is not going to have a cure around the corner and what does this mean for safer sex to become a permanent part of your life,' " he said.
In fact, on the X-rated Web site Barebackjack, the site's host compared the decision of an H.I.V. negative man to have unprotected sex to skydiving.
And some men -- a tiny minority, according to public health experts and advocates for AIDS prevention -- actually court infection with H.I.V. or transmit the virus to others who express a wish to be infected, practices that have been called in the press "bug chasing" and "gift giving."
Yet to Jeff Getty, a founder of Survive AIDS in San Francisco who has lived with H.I.V. for two decades, any rationale for unprotected sex is incomprehensible.
"I can't imagine someone being H.I.V. negative and taking risks with this disease," Mr. Getty said. "This morning my back is out again, I have sciatica, I have a herpes shingle going right up my back. I'm just now finishing all my drugs. Yesterday I had to take injections to make my bone marrow grow, and my life is no fun. Sometimes I wish I were dead.
"If somebody was H.I.V. negative, and I could transport them into my body for a few days and let them feel the pain, I think they'd have a whole new understanding about the risks they're taking."

Strong Emotions, Human Lapses
On a kiosk at the corner of Market and Castro Streets, a poster that is part of a prevention campaign by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, shows two men in a sexual embrace. 
"He'd tell me if he's negative," one man is thinking.
"He'd tell me if he's positive," the other man thinks.
"How do you know what you know?" the poster asks.
Fatigue, denial, rebellion or political philosophy may underlie some high-risk sexual encounters.
But far more common, say psychologists who study risk behavior, are the simple lapses of human nature and the elaborate rationalizations the mind is capable of producing. 
Many men, like Mr. Watkins, who said he always carried condoms in his pocket and had them at his bedside the night he believes he became infected with H.I.V., have every intention of staying safe, yet are derailed by a night of loneliness, a plunge into depression, a beer too many, too much speed or cocaine or a sexual attraction so powerful they are, at a critical moment, caught off guard.
Such missteps are hardly the exclusive province of gay men; they are familiar to any woman who has left her diaphragm in the dresser drawer, to any former smoker who decides to have "just one," to any partygoer who, knowing he is intoxicated, still gets behind the wheel.
Lines are drawn, then crossed. Assumptions remain unquestioned, questions remain unasked. Promises are made, then broken. 
Joseph Simons holds a degree from Northwestern University, speaks four languages fluently and as "a good Catholic boy" growing up in St. Louis he prayed the rosary after Mass every Sunday.
But one night, recovering from the breakup of a relationship and driven by anxiety and compulsion, he donned his Levi's and butterscotch vinyl jacket, drove to an adult bookstore, paid $3 to enter a grimy, dimly lit booth with a hole in the wall and had unprotected sex with two men.
"I certainly didn't look at my calendar and say tonight's the night I'm going to the bookstores," Mr. Simons said.
But he wonders how his "highly functional" self fits with the man who had sex "in a dark booth on Folsom Street."
Mr. Simons said he used to have nightmares about AIDS. Once, he woke in a cold sweat, turned on the lights, retrieved a can of red spray paint from the closet and wrote "K.S.," for Kaposi's sarcoma, on his bedroom wall, as both a reminder and an exhortation.
He takes antidepressants now, and they help. But they can do nothing about the virus now in his body, which he is convinced he contracted that night at the bookstore. 
For Vince, a vice president of an online services company, who spoke on the condition his last name not be used, risk came with a spur-of-the-moment impulse to visit a sex club after seeing a movie with friends.
"I was definitely in a period of depression," he recalled. "I've always used a condom previously. I also have been very, very conservative sexually just in general because so much is unknown still."
But with the man he met that night, he acted differently. 
"I'd never actually experienced unprotected sex before," Vince said. "And there was just something about that particular circumstance and that particular person. I don't know how to describe it. It just appealed to me; it made it seem like it was all right."
He was terrified afterward, as was Justin Lampe, a 30-year-old nurse who, late one December night, believing he might have become infected with H.I.V., wrote with red ink in his journal: "Red means stop. If I am, I have to find the strength to find hope and happiness in my life. If I'm not, never let me forget this red ink and the feelings of terror I'm going through."
Both men sought treatment at a clinic at San Francisco General Hospital, which offered antiviral drugs and counseling to people who had reason to believe they had just been exposed to H.I.V. In some animal studies, such prompt treatment has been shown to prevent infection. And in health workers exposed to H.I.V., such preventive treatment has been found to reduce infection by 81 percent. Both men remain H.I.V. negative.
Dr. Michelle Roland, an assistant professor at the University of California at San Francisco and a principal investigator in a study of post-exposure prevention, said that many men who sought such treatment were depressed, and that depression often underlay their ambivalent behavior.
"They're all walking in expecting to be told that they've been bad," Dr. Roland said, "and instead I tell them, 'I'm so glad you came in, we can really help you.' " 
She drew an analogy to women's often-conflicted feelings about their use -- or failure to use -- birth control and to other efforts that people make, in the face of strong temptations, to bring their behavior in line with their best interest. 
"In my own experience," Dr. Roland said, "once you let yourself cross that line even for a second, you've screwed it up completely. It's extremely difficult to stay clear."
Studies indicate that a variety of circumstances increase people's vulnerability to sexual risk-taking. For example, gay men who were sexually abused as children, a study by Dr. Jay Paul and his colleagues at the AIDS prevention studies center here suggests, are more likely to engage in unprotected sex as adults. Drugs and alcohol play a large role. 
And in one study, still unpublished, Dr. Grant Colfax, the director of H.I.V. Prevention Studies at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, and his colleagues found that men who met sexual partners on the Internet were more than four times more likely to have unprotected sex with a partner of unknown or opposite H.I.V. status.
In addition, many men, like many women, have little skill in negotiating condom use, and little desire to interrupt an amorous encounter for a technical discussion of the chances of being infected with H.I.V.
"For the positive guy, the fantasy is that he's not infected and he's not a danger to other people," said Dr. Walt Odets, a clinical psychologist in San Francisco and the author of "In the Shadow of the Epidemic: Being H.I.V. Negative in the Age of AIDS." "For the negative guy, the fantasy is that his partner's not infected and the negative man is not putting himself at risk."
And sex without condoms exerts a strong attraction.
"There are natural, important, powerful feelings about having unprotected sex," Dr. Odets said. "No one has ever liked condoms, men or women. They make a statement in the middle of this potentially intimate act that you might kill each other."
For a man to disclose that he is H.I.V. positive, Dr. Odets said, involves delicate timing and complicated emotions -- including the fear or being rejected or appearing weak.
Mr. Watkins, for his part, said that neither he nor the man he took home that night brought up the subject.
"We were just so attracted to each other," he said, "and we wanted to have sex. Neither of us was in a state to really want to discuss it."
Afterward, when the man, still very drunk, went home, Mr. Watkins said he cried a little because he felt lonely and wondered what he had done and why he had done it. He cried again when he learned he was infected.
"I have had to come to terms with the fact that I wasn't always practicing what I was preaching," Mr. Watkins said.
He tries to draw the lines more firmly now. He has his rules, the things he will and will not do.
But he is only human. "I came to realize I was just another gay man," he said, "and I was allowed to make mistakes too."

A 1997 Mayoral Hopeful Thinks Globally Now
She could not have the city as her stage, but she does have the world as her focus.
 Four years ago, in New York City's previous mayoral election, Ruth W. Messinger not only decisively lost her bid to unseat Rudolph W. Giuliani, but found herself bounced back to private life after two decades in public office. Weeks after she was defeated as the Democratic challenger to City Hall's Republican incumbent, Ms. Messinger's second four-year term as Manhattan borough president ended, leaving her no public post in which to nurse her wounds. 
 But Ms. Messinger, who had also served 12 years as a City Council member from Manhattan's West Side, soon began a new stint, sans spotlight but with a searchlight for ferreting out worthy community-improvement projects across the globe, especially in poor countries. 
She became president of American Jewish World Service, a philanthropic organization that provides money and skilled volunteers to small-scale projects involving health, education, economic development and the like, in countries from Central America to Asia to Africa.
These days, Ms. Messinger often still pops up in the news media in a political context, as when journalists covering New York's current mayoral race mention her in recalling the previous race, or seek a sound bite from her on today's contest -- or when she herself sticks a toe into the campaign, as when she endorsed Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, for mayor.
But while New York City politics "stays in my blood," Ms. Messinger, 60, said last week, it is only a peripheral part of her present life. 
The onetime warhorse of West Side politics wades worldwide these days, heading her group's efforts in dispensing annual grants of $10,000 to $35,000 to projects like AIDS education and care in South Africa, Kenya and Uganda; agricultural and community development in El Salvador and Honduras; and small-business initiatives for women in Zimbabwe, Peru and Haiti.
"Most of that work is not that different from the work of community-based organizations in New York," Ms. Messinger said, calling her old involvement with such organizations as a councilwoman and borough president a good grounding for her current job.
But her work nowadays, she said, is different in one welcome way: "You occasionally get a free weekend."

Officer's Killing Ground May Get Another Life
It was a site that symbolized the savagery surrounding the 1980's crack epidemic.
In February 1988, a rookie police officer, Edward Byrne, was murdered -- shot in the head five times -- as he guarded the home of a drug-case witness in South Jamaica, Queens, an area that was a battleground between the police and crack-dealing gangs. Four dealers were convicted of the killing, and all received 25 years to life in prison. Their leader was convicted of having ordered the murder, to retaliate against the police for his jailing in a weapons case, and was sentenced to a life term.
When the witness was relocated, the city bought his house, hoping to use it for a police purpose. But that and other plans fell through, vandals battered the two-story structure, and the city razed it in 1992, leaving a vacant lot at 107-05 Inwood Street.
Now, life may return to the site. The city sold it at auction in March for $255,000 to Millennium Homes LLC of Manhattan. The company's principals did not return phone calls last week, but an employee said housing was planned for the plot.

In Connecticut and New Jersey, Urban Poverty Confronts Leafy Affluence

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
On South Orange Avenue a decrepit stretch of liquor stores, ramshackle grocery marts, and darkened bars in Newark's impoverished West Ward -- the idea that New Jersey could be the wealthiest state in the nation seems not only far-fetched, but downright ludicrous. 
 The same could be said on East Main Street in Bridgeport, the largest city in Connecticut, which, of course, is New Jersey's main rival for the who's-richest crown. Or, for that matter, on many streets in Hartford or Camden or New Haven or Paterson or Waterbury, poor cities all. 
 Nevertheless, new Census Bureau statistics show that New Jersey and Connecticut are indeed the most prosperous states in the most prosperous country in the world with median household incomes above $50,000. On South Orange Avenue today, this fact was met with disbelief and not a little scorn. 
"Ha!" said Thomas Cook, 66. "Ha, ha!" he laughed, pausing from doing repair work at the Cozy Corner lounge. Mr. Cook said he tried to retire in 1995 after a heart attack but could not afford to stop working. "I've worked harder since I retired," he said. "I intend to move out of here."
There is, it turns out, a mordant sidelight to the pageant of prosperity that has played out recently as New Jersey and Connecticut renewed their rivalry for the title of the nation's richest state. Along with high income figures, the states share the pattern of enormously wealthy suburbs and almost universally distressed cities.
In many ways it would be hard to come up with better symbols for income inequality in America than New York's neighbors. There are few places in the United States where the line between urban poverty and suburban plenty is so persistent and so stark. "It's amazing how you are struck in the face with this reality when you live in New Haven or you live in Newark," said Cory Booker, a Newark city councilman who has lived in both cities. In either place, he said, "If you drive around outside the city, you see some of the largest houses in America."
The rich-state, poor-cities phenomenon is carried through in several similarities between New Jersey and Connecticut, experts say, including a decidedly suburban mind-set; a host of political, social and economic issues that hinder urban revival; and the fact that neither state is quite as rich as statistics suggest. 
"There is one huge hole every time the census reports income statistics," said David Rusk, a writer and a scholar on cities. "They treat a dollar as a dollar as a dollar everywhere, but the cost of living varies enormously." New Jersey and Connecticut, he said, "aren't as wealthy as they seem." 
A recent cost of living study by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit analytic organization in Washington, found that the annual budget for a family of four in New Jersey and Connecticut needed to be 10 percent to 50 percent above the national median. Or, as Jon J. Shure, the president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, put it: "A family making $30,000 in New Jersey is in a whole lot more trouble than somebody making $30,000 in Mississippi." 
Mr. Shure, who runs a liberal nonprofit group that analyzes state issues, said he believed that the new income statistics were misleading. "I would argue that we show up as No. 1 in household income because some people in New Jersey are so rich they skew us and make us look so rich that you wonder why we have urban blight, when in fact we have a lot of poor people and a very high cost of living."
Mr. Shure and other experts noted that poverty remains concentrated in the states' biggest cities partly because the suburbs have the great preponderance of the residents and hence the political power.
Slightly more than 15 percent of New Jersey residents live in the eight largest urban centers and just 20 percent of Connecticut residents live in the state's six largest cities. Those numbers contrast sharply with a state like New York, where 42 percent live in New York City alone.
"Connecticut is a very suburban state," said David MacDonald, communications director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action, a coalition of nonprofit social service groups. "It's a factor politically in that it's hard to get people to pay attention to these issues." 
In New Jersey, officials said, the big cities simply do not have political muscle anymore. "Their influence and prominence is relatively minimal in the state, and that is part of the historic pattern in New Jersey," said Herbert Simmens, the director of the Office of State Planning. 
"Fifty years ago, the population of the urban centers and the areas around them were about equal to the rest of the state," Mr. Simmens explained. "It's gone from 50-50 to less than 25 percent, and for the urban centers it's just over 10 percent." 
Because the cities have such a small percentage of New Jersey's population, Mr. Shure said, "They don't have much clout in the Legislature." And many suburbs that once looked to New Jersey cities as centers of employment and commerce no longer do, he said. "Cherry Hill, which is next to Camden, doesn't look to Camden for anything anymore," he said. 
Cliff Zukin, a political scientist and pollster at Rutgers University, said many suburbs not only do not need the cities anymore but actually resent the high cost of providing services to them. 
"We already have many of the suburban legislators enraged at how much money is going to the schools," he said. "So they don't really want to do anything else. They don't want to take any more out of the suburban taxpayers' pockets to pay for urban revitalization."
The same tilt of power exists in Connecticut, said Shelley Geballe, co-director of Connecticut Voices for Children, an advocacy group. "It's in the suburbs," she said of political power in the state. "We don't have the votes."
One question, she said, is "How do you build the understanding among suburban legislators that it's in their interests and in their district's interests to have the cities function well?" 
A number of policy thinkers, including the former labor secretary, Robert Reich, have warned about dire consequences of the widening gap between rich and poor in the United States. And some lawmakers, like Representative Martin Olav Sabo, a Minnesota Democrat, have even suggested new laws that would discourage outsized salary packages for corporate executives. 
"I just think it breaks the cohesion of a society," Mr. Sabo said of the wealth gap. "From the end of World War II, for a number of years, as income grew in this country, it grew fairly uniformly over all parts of the income spectrum. It has reversed recently. Most of the growth in the private sector is at the very top."
New Jersey and Connecticut cities declined so far as a result of a number of similar factors, experts said, particularly a drop in manufacturing and the departure of the middle class from cities to the suburbs. There is also a component of racial segregation that goes hand in hand with economic segregation, experts said. 
"Minorities are much more likely to live in major cities than elsewhere," Mr. Shure said. "Poor minorities live in cities but poor whites are as likely to live outside the city as inside the city." 
In Connecticut, good manufacturing jobs have been replaced by a mix of much higher- or lower-paying jobs in the service sector, Ms. Geballe said. "The irony in Connecticut at this point," she said, "is we have become so stratified that you have communities like Stamford that are desperate for people who do low-wage jobs, like clean the office buildings, but they can't afford to live in that community." 
Sabrina Gray, 46, who has lived in Newark all her life, said she knows there is wealth in New Jersey's suburbs, but it does not cross the line into Newark. "They say we're the richest state," said Ms. Gray, who was laid off last month from her job as a customer service supervisor. "But I don't see it in Newark. I don't see it in East Orange. I don't see it in Irvington." 
Ms. Gray said that she realizes that downtown Newark is being revitalized, one result of which is the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, but that she feels detached from the process. "I would have liked to work at the arts center," she said. "But I didn't even hear about how to interview for those jobs. You don't see minorities getting the jobs." 
"If we are doing so well, why aren't more people prospering?" she asked. "Why aren't more people feeling it?"

HEADLINE: Insurance Cost To Homeowner Climbs Sharply 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Across the country, the cost of insuring a home is climbing sharply and is expected to continue doing so for several years. Prices are rising at more than twice the 3 percent average of recent years, and by more than 10 percent in many states.
 Allstate, the second-largest home insurer, has been leading the way, with increases of 10 percent to 25 percent in several states. State Farm, the largest home insurer, has been more reluctant to raise prices, lifting premiums 6 percent to 10 percent in a handful of states. Safeco, the eighth largest, says it expects increases to average more than 25 percent for its 1.5 million customers this year. 
 Though other companies are more circumspect than Safeco about overall insurance rates, analysts say higher prices are almost certain to spread. "These are shock increases," said J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. 
Insurance companies, which set their own rates, state by state, and zone by zone within each state, are responding to profit pressures. The companies are earning less on their investments and on certain types of personal policies while reeling from a surge in weather-related claims in the last few years. In addition to raising rates, some companies are also forcing homeowners to pay more out of pocket after they file claims.
Rising home values compound the situation for some people, since higher rates come as the values of their policies increase. And the average increases often mask outright price surges for those living in areas singled out by insurers.
In Texas, for example, Tricia Beaugh wound up with sticker shock on the renewal of her policy. In May, Allstate raised the cost of the $94,000 policy on her three-bedroom brick veneer house in Humble, near Houston, to $670, up 56 percent, from $430 the previous year.
"It was like 'Oh, my God,' " said Mrs. Beaugh, who sells advertising in the Yellow Pages. "We had pretty much figured out to the penny what we could afford for the mortgage, maintenance, insurance and taxes. We ended up having to finance the insurance, pay by the month."
Insurers have long tried to keep prices low on homeowners' policies as a way to lure customers into their profitable auto insurance business. But the profits on auto policies have shrunk, leading companies to raise auto rates last year and now to insist that home insurance be profitable.
"Now that auto insurance profits are slipping, the auto business can no longer afford to, in effect, subsidize homeowners' coverage," said Robert Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. "That's why, along with the rising cost of building materials and an increase in weather-related claims, these rates are going up today and are likely to keep going up for the next several years."
Insurers are also very dependent on the returns on their investments, which have dwindled. They invest their customers' premiums until they have to pay out claims. When those investments are doing well, said Jay Angoff, a former insurance commissioner in Missouri, companies are more apt to keep their prices low than when returns are weak.
Mr. Hartwig said he expected prices for home insurance to rise by an average of 6 percent this year, double the average annual increase for the last decade. That would mean an increase of about $30 on the policy of about $500. But that average obscures some sharp moves, like Mrs. Beaugh's. In Texas, Allstate says rate increases have averaged 25 percent, bringing the average cost of coverage to $950, up $190.
The industry says the last few years have brought far more than the usual run of hurricanes, tornadoes, hailstorms and flooding rains. This has led to a rise in claims as prices of building supplies have increased. Insurers also are seeing a jump in claims in Texas and other coastal states for toxic mold, which can contaminate houses after water damage.
But Texas is not the only state where Allstate is moving aggressively. It is raising its rates by an average of 10 percent in Illinois and Wisconsin, 15 percent in Oklahoma, and, soon, 15 percent in Missouri and 17 percent in Iowa. 
"We clearly see an increase in the overall costs of the business, and we're moving to address those profit issues," said Frederick Cripe, the senior executive for pricing at Allstate.
In New York, Nationwide, the state's third-largest home insurer, is raising rates 9.9 percent in September, while Safeco has raised rates 15.7 percent.
In Connecticut, Royal Sun Alliance has raised rates 8.3 percent this year; CGU, 9.5 percent; and a dozen other companies are up an average of 5 percent.
In New Jersey, State Farm, which says it intends to abandon auto insurance in the state because it cannot make a profit, has applied for a 6 percent increase on homeowners' policies. 
Several insurers -- including Nationwide, the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and the Farmers Insurance Group -- refused to provide information on rate changes. But regulators in Missouri said that Farmers, operating through its Mid-Century Insurance Company unit, raised prices there by 16.2 percent in June.
Insurance companies are said to be trying to cut costs as well as raise rates. Agents say they have noticed a trend toward discouraging and rejecting homeowners' claims. "We're under tremendous pressure to produce profit," said an agent in a Western state, who did not want his name used for fear of angering his employer.
Insurance executives say they are not making it harder for customers to collect claims, but some companies acknowledge that they are cutting back on claims' handlers to save money. Fewer people may mean delays in settling claims, analysts say, giving insurers more time to hold and invest customer premiums.
Over the last few years, before the new wave of price increases, insurers quietly chipped away at the benefits in their home policies. Only a few years ago, if a house insured for its full value of, say, $100,000 was destroyed, the insurance company would replace it, even if the cost ran to more than $100,000. Now the payout is usually limited to, say, 25 percent more than the insured value.
Instead of applying deductibles of $250 or $500, once standard, many companies now impose a deductible of up to 5 percent of the value of houses in the hurricane-prone Atlantic and Gulf coasts. On a home insured for $100,000, the owner would pay the first $5,000 in damages.
In Florida and some other coastal states, insurers have persuaded regulators to let them drop hurricane coverage from their home insurance policies and sell it separately.
Though most insurers seem to be pushing to make their homeowners' policies more profitable, State Farm remains something of a holdout. The company, which covers one of every five homes, is raising rates most on the East Coast and in Southern states where hurricanes and tropical storms are a threat. Its rates have risen 9 percent in South Carolina this year, 7 percent in Louisiana, 6.5 percent in Florida and 6.4 percent in Mississippi.
But it has been keeping homeowners' rates steady in many states, and even cutting them in others in hopes of keeping customers. Undercut by smaller carriers offering auto insurance at lower prices, State Farm is gambling that it will rebound from its losses by gaining market share, insurance analysts say.
Phil Supple, a spokesman for State Farm, said the company was simply playing to its strengths and taking a longer view. As a mutual company without public shareholders, it does not feel Wall Street pressure for short-term profits.
Ira L. Zuckerman, an insurance industry analyst at Nutmeg Securities in Fairfield, Conn., said that underpricing had been widespread in homeowners' insurance and that Safeco's increases would lead to others. 
"If you are a competitor of Safeco, and Safeco is raising prices 25 percent," Mr. Zuckerman said, "maybe you can raise your prices 15 percent and still be competitive."

HEADLINE: In a Competitive Race, Family Ties Can Have Both Benefits and Drawbacks 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Between dance numbers at a talent show at a youth center in the Bronx two days ago, Helen Diane Foster was introduced to about 100 young people and their parents. In a short greeting, Ms. Foster, a candidate for a City Council seat, discussed the need for students to master their education and to take pride in themselves.
 But some of the evening's most telling words came just before Ms. Foster spoke. She was introduced by City Councilman Wendell Foster, the incumbent who has spent 24 years at City Hall, and who is her father. He applauded his daughter's quest to become "the first black woman elected to the City Council in the history of Bronx County," and said that if a child following in the political footsteps of the parent is "good enough for the Bushes and the Kennedys, it is good enough for the Fosters." 
 Mr. Foster's words underscored how his career has been both a plus and a minus for his daughter's campaign, giving it its very potency while creating some difficulties. Ms. Foster, 35, the assistant vice president of legal affairs at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, enjoys significant name recognition by being the daughter of a politician with longstanding tenure. On the other hand, it has also made her the object of criticism by some politicians who suggest that she is seeking to capitalize on her family name.
 Ms. Foster is running in one of the most competitive races in a season of highly charged contests. One of her opponents in the race is Michael Benjamin, who has a history as an aide to several Bronx politicians, including Assemblywoman Aurelia Greene, Councilman Adolfo Carrion Jr. and United States Representative Jose E. Serrano. Mr. Benjamin, 43, a member of the executive committee of the Bronx Democratic Party, has been endorsed by a wide range of labor groups and Democratic elected officials in the Bronx, including Fernando Ferrer, the borough president.
 The third candidate in the Democratic primary is Anthony Curry, 41, a staff member at the city's Human Resources Administration who previously ran shelters for homeless people.
Mr. Curry has been endorsed by State Senator Pedro Espada Jr., who is running for borough president.
 In their campaign appearances, each of the candidates extol their ability to understand the concerns of the residents of the 16th Council District, which extends from Highbridge on its western side, through the Claremont, Morrisania and Concourse Village to the east.
 Mr. Benjamin says that he has become familiar with the issues in the district from his years of working with elected officials. "I have worked in the offices of many of the people who have served this community and the Bronx," he said. "And I have been involved even at the most local level, having served as a chairman on a local community board."
 Mr. Curry said that one of his priorities would be to seek ways to develop the waterfront area in the western border of the district, along the Hudson River, for recreation and commercial use. He said his work with neighborhood youth and civic groups offered him a better perspective of the area's needs. "I have lived in the Bronx all of my life, and I know this area better than any of the others," Mr. Curry said.
 He derides Mr. Benjamin, saying that his opponent's candidacy represents nothing more than the handiwork of party bosses. He criticizes Ms. Foster even more sharply, accusing her of operating a "leisurely campaign," saying that a weeklong trip she took to the Caribbean a month before the primary "indicates that she doesn't have enough respect for the voters to even get out there and talk to them. She is only running on her father's name. They want this to be a coronation."
 The district, which is largely black and Hispanic, includes some attractive, middle class apartment buildings, including the Art Deco complexes along the Grand Concourse and in Claremont and Highbridge. But the district also includes some of the city's poorest residents, high rates of asthma and high unemployment.
 All three candidates have made education reform the centerpiece of their campaign discussions. Mr. Benjamin, for example, has advocated enhanced professional development training for teachers and principals. Ms. Foster has called for a program under which repayment of student loans would be waived for teachers who volunteer to work in low-performing schools and improve that performance.
 In addition, all three have emphasized the need to develop better relationships between the police and the residents in the district, who, they insist, have an abiding fear of officers.
 Ms. Foster raised the most money in outright contributions, $81,258. But she has so far failed to qualify for public matching funds. Mr. Benjamin has raised about $44,000, but has received another $75,280 under the city's campaign finance program. Mr. Curry has raised about $13,000, but has also failed to receive any matching funds.
 Mr. Benjamin said he rarely discussed the issue of family succession, preferring instead to talk about education and low property taxes. "But, if voters ask me my view about it," he said, "I just ask them: should any one family control a district for more than 25 years?"
 Ms. Foster, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said she was unfazed by such criticism. "If the voters think I have nothing to offer, then they will cast their votes appropriately on Sept. 11," she said. "But in the meantime, I think that once they hear my views and my background, they will realize that I have something to offer."

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Fund for AIDS Patients Is Frozen in Bureaucracy 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
In the battle against AIDS, it was considered a bold step. Zimbabwe would impose a 3 percent tax on personal and corporate income to pay for a national AIDS trust, which would help care for the country's thousands and thousands of citizens infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
 But more than a year after the government began collecting the tax, most of the millions of dollars raised so far sit unspent, mired in a bureaucracy that has frustrated many people who welcomed the trust's creation. 
 Even as the tax passed into law in January 2000, some people wondered about the government's stewardship of such money. The country was in the early stages of an economic crisis that has only worsened, and then, as now, there were many demands on the government. 
Still, advocates for AIDS care hoped that the enormous suffering caused by the crisis would ensure that the money reached the country's poor people infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and the families struggling to care for them.
"People in principle liked it, liked the idea of sharing the burden, of looking after the people who are infected," said Chiedza Musengezi, the director of the Women and AIDS Support Network in Harare, the capital.
But so far, it has seldom worked out that way. 
Instead, the board of the National AIDS Council, a government agency that coordinates AIDS policy and was in charge of distributing the money, was dissolved in March after the Health Ministry decided that the council did not have the legal authority to manage the trust. Some critics accused the ministry of playing politics, saying that the board was dissolved because its chairman was a supporter of the Movement for Democratic Change, the leading opposition party. 
Whatever the motives, when the operations of the national AIDS trust were effectively halted, only about $4 million had been distributed, and right now at least $25 million is waiting to be spent, Dr. P. David Parirenyatwa, the deputy health minister, said in an interview.
Like its neighbors in southern Africa, Zimbabwe has been hit hard by the AIDS epidemic. At least 25 percent of the country's adults are estimated to be H.I.V. positive, according to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS agency. 
A new study looking at more recent statistics, conducted by the Health Ministry and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reports that about 35 percent of the country's adults are now infected, Dr. Parirenyatwa said. He said the study had not been released because the ministry was not sure the numbers were accurate and wanted to re-examine the study's epidemiology. 
If the numbers are true, Zimbabwe's percentage of adults with H.I.V. would be roughly equal to Botswana's, which is the highest in the world, and that would increase pressure on Zimbabwe to find a way to distribute the money from the AIDS trust.
Dr. Parirenyatwa acknowledged the problem of disbursing the money and "doing it quickly enough," and he promised that it would soon be flowing steadily. But he said the Health Ministry simply wanted to make sure the money reached the right people.
"It's a no-win situation, really," he said. "When we started disbursing, we did it very quickly, but then people started complaining that you are giving to people who are not deserving, so now we are very careful."
Dr. Sunanda Ray, the director of the Southern Africa AIDS Information Dissemination Service in Harare, said many of Zimbabwe's problems in distributing the money could have been avoided and should have been corrected by now.
"People are trying to provide the services on a shoestring," Dr. Ray said, "and they are feeling the urgency, and it just seems outrageous that the bureaucrats are not able to respond." 
Whatever the source of the money, distributing it quickly and fairly is emerging as a crucial challenge for many African countries as more AIDS money comes their way, Robert Hecht, an associate director of Unaids, said in an interview from Geneva.
No other country has an AIDS tax like Zimbabwe's, but some, like Cameroon, are using debt relief savings to expand their AIDS budgets, while others, like Botswana, have been able to allocate more of their own budgets to fight AIDS. 
With its deepening economic and political turmoil, Zimbabwe faces an even more dire predicament. Hunger and unemployment are rising, making it harder for families to care for their dying relatives. More than ever, people with AIDS need the sort of basic support that the national AIDS trust was set up to provide, things like blankets and pain relievers.
Last month, in a display of frustration, hundreds of people staged a demonstration to protest the problems with the trust fund. 
"If every person sees it on their pay slips, they feel they're contributing to this national cause," Mr. Hecht said, "but if nothing is happening and they don't see any movement, people become cynical. They say, 'What's happening to the money that I'm contributing?' "
Indeed, the frustration at the pace of distribution has fed suspicion among ordinary people. Some worry that the money will become a tool in the pre-election patronage machine of the ruling party, which must contend with national elections next year and a serious challenge from the opposition. 
Others suspect that the money is somehow being manipulated by the cash-strapped government to pay for other needs like fuel imports or military expenses in the Congo. 
Dr. Parirenyatwa denied such rumors. "If the money is for H.I.V., then it must be used for H.I.V.," and it must not go to Congo or to offset any other costs, he said. "Some of us are doctors. How could we do that?"
In the coming weeks and months, Dr. Parirenyatwa said, the National AIDS Council will resume distributing money, with hundreds of thousands of dollars now set to go to each of the country's 81 local district governments, which now will have a central role in how the money is spent in their communities.

Early Swimming Lessons

Q. Is it is safe to teach babies to swim?

A. Linda Villarosa, who writes about health and fitness for Science Times, responds:
 In the last decade, there has been a proliferation of infant and toddler aquatic instruction programs. Most of this instruction does not focus on teaching these children to swim, however, but is intended to get them used to being in and around water. For example, the Y.M.C.A. of the U.S.A. notes that 60 percent of Y's offer infant-parent aquatics classes for children 6 months to 3 years old. These classes teach aquatic readiness to encourage babies and toddlers to become more comfortable in the water. 
Even without training, a child can perform rudimentary swimming movements in the water at about 1 year old. But, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children are not usually developmentally ready for swimming lessons until after their fourth birthdays.
Research shows that most children under 4 lack the neuromuscular coordination to master traditional swimming strokes. Although some children learn to swim earlier, younger children generally require longer instructional periods to learn the skills than children who have turned 4 or even 5. Having children begin lessons before 4 does not mean they will eventually be better swimmers than those who take lessons later.
More important, experts warn that infant and toddler programs cannot prevent children from drowning. Some experts say they worry that early swimming classes can give a false sense of security to parents, who might let their guard down in and around water. Drowning is the leading cause of unintentional injury and death among children under 5. 
Even if a child has been enrolled in an aquatics program, parents should still remain within arm's length, said Dr. Gary A. Smith, director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. A child younger than 5 who has some competence in swimming should still be supervised closely.
If parents put their infant, toddler or preschooler in an aquatics class, Dr. Smith said, they should avoid any program promoted as a way to decrease the risk of drowning. There is no doubt that aquatics can help children develop water skills, he said, but such programs do not make children drown-proof.

The Economics of Recycling

Q. In New York City, for recycling purposes, we assiduously sort our trash: paper, metal, plastic. And then the proper truck picks it up in a special load. Aside from the environmental benefit, is there any economic benefit to New York City?

A. Kirk Johnson, who covers the environment for the metropolitan desk, responds:
The immediate economic benefits to New York City from its recycling program are not huge. And they are not easily measured. About 1,000 mostly low-wage jobs have been created in the private sector -- doing work like sorting kinds of glass -- along with several hundred public-sector jobs. An unknown number of additional labor hours are paid out by the city's big apartment buildings, where maintenance employees sort the categories of glass, metal and paper. And the city will earn about $4 million this year selling into the waste-paper market, where prices can fluctuate wildly. 
Officials at New York City's Department of Sanitation are also the first to admit that by pure utilitarian standards -- taking into account only the taxpayers' money with no thought for the environment -- recycling is inefficient. Scooping up all the city's millions of tons of rubbish with no time or labor wasted in sorting or in specialized pickups would save pots of money in the short term. 
There is a myth that recycling will eventually cover its cost, said Robert Lange, director of the Bureau of Waste Prevention, Reuse and Recycling at the Department of Sanitation. But that will never happen, he said. The best the city can hope for, he said, is that revenue from selling recyclable material pays for a small part. The larger goal, he said, is to cut the city's waste, and to the degree that recycling helps do that, its ultimate benefit could be huge.

HEADLINE: Street Theater and Graffiti: Belarus Dissidents Make News by Making Noise 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: BORISOV, Belarus, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
It was just outside this fraying and thoroughly Soviet city, residents note with some pride, that guerrilla forces handed the French dictator Napoleon his final defeat in 1812, during his army's disastrous winter retreat from Russia.
 But that was 189 years ago. What is more interesting is what guerrillas are doing here to Belarus's own quirky dictator, President Aleksandr Lukashenko, right now. 
 Mr. Lukashenko, who was democratically elected in 1994 and two years later extended his term in a referendum that outsiders say was rigged, has spent his time casting Belarus in a Soviet mold, with disastrous results. 
The economy is a shell, and the population has been nearly cowed by a vast security network and the disappearances of a succession of political opponents and former cronies of the president who fell from favor. 
But now, three weeks before a presidential election that could actually test the durability of Mr. Lukashenko's one-man rule, stickers proclaiming "Time to clean out!" have begun popping up on office-building walls. 
Last Wednesday, the police seized eight people after 100 demonstrators abruptly appeared and linked arms in the asphalt-covered town square, almost in the shadow of Lenin's statue. Four more dissidents were arrested Thursday, eight more today -- indeed, roughly 100 since March.
Such sustained, guerrilla-style protest is new to Belarus, but not to Europe. A similar protest movement, called Otpor, or Resistance, was crucial in unseating the Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic last October. 
In Belarus, once a Soviet republic, the movement is called Zubr, the word for a bison that is to Belarus what the bear is to Russia and the eagle is to the United States. Proponents of Zubr say it is the country's fastest-growing youth movement, with thousands enrolled in 60 towns and cities since its founding in January. 
The movement's overriding goal is to show Belarus's legendarily passive population by vivid example that it is possible to challenge authority. The gamble is that Zubr can rouse enough people, and rattle enough of Mr. Lukashenko's enforcers, to make it impossible for Mr. Lukashenko to rig the results of the elections, on Sept. 9. 
"Most of the population is against the present regime, but they think the regime will win anyway," Dmitri Borodko, the 26-year-old coordinator in the Minsk region for Zubr, said during a chat in one of Borisov's spartan cafes. "People just don't see signs of struggle. But if they see someone struggle against Lukashenko, they will begin to believe." 
Some Western diplomats and veterans of Belarus's democratic opposition believe that Mr. Lukashenko is already in deep trouble. "What is most important is the percentage of people who want to see Lukashenko re-elected" -- only 36 percent in one recent poll, said Andrei Sannikov, coordinator of the human rights group Charter '97.
"Our main concern is whether people will turn out for the election. He'll definitely lose if the turnout rate is 70 percent. If it's 80 percent, he'll be simply demolished."
But within Belarus's democratic opposition, there is disagreement over whether Zubr's street theater and graffiti will backfire in a conservative population, and grumbling about the group's mysterious and easy access to computers, slick protest materials and even the black T-shirts its members wear as a symbol of dissent.
The Serbian group Otpor was sustained with American money. It is assumed that the United States or some other Western nation or group is backing Zubr, hoping to repeat Serbia's success. 
Conversations with dissidents and journalists here and in the capital, Minsk, suggest that success against Mr. Lukashenko may be difficult in any case. 
True enough, Belarus's splintered political opposition has managed this time to choose a single candidate, a national union leader, Vladimir Goncharik, to face Mr. Lukashenko. Mr. Goncharik, like most politicians, is a middle-aged former Communist apparatchik. He is not even marginally charismatic, and his campaign seems to be barely breathing. 
Mr. Goncharik effectively has no access to radio or television, and he is mostly ignored by all but a handful of independent newspapers. In Borisov, a city of 150,000 barely 50 miles east of the opposition's Minsk headquarters, the proprietors of one large independent newspaper said they had yet to hear from the Goncharik campaign, while city officials are already are making speeches for Mr. Lukashenko and dispatching canvassers. 
That many here give the opposition even a shot at beating Mr. Lukashenko is testament to the president's deep-seated and apparently spreading unpopularity.
Mr. Lukashenko has so blackened his record with economic and political disasters that his support has dived in recent polls. Inflation has run in triple digits, farm production has sunk; airline flights shriveled from 35,000 in 1995 to just 5,700 in 1998; the percentage of paved roads is dropping. A growing share of the nation's tax revenues has gone into a presidential fund that is not publicly accounted for. 
The president has been especially crippled by credible accusations this summer that his personal security force engineered the disappearance and apparently the execution of some of Mr. Lukashenko's political and personal enemies.
Attacks on political and social critics have risen sharply in the last two years. Last week alone, at least five independent newspapers and political or civic groups lost computers and other equipment in break-ins. Since 1999, a number of opposition leaders, including Mr. Sannikov, of Charter '97, have fled Belarus either temporarily or for good after death threats.
What is most chilling, however, is the disappearances: Mr. Lukashenko's former interior minister, Yuri Zakharenko, in May 1999; the opposition leader Viktor Gonchar and a friend, Yuri Krasovsky, in September 1999; Mr. Lukashenko's onetime personal photographer, Dmitri Zavadsky, who fell from grace for his television reporting on smuggling, in July 2000.
In June, two investigators from the prosecutor general's office fled to the United States, where they accused some of the government's top security aides of setting up a death squad that had murdered up to 30 critics. 
The State Department has deemed the accusations credible; Mr. Lukashenko has called them an election-year provocation by his political foes. On July 20, as the Minsk-based independent newspaper Den prepared a special issue on the missing men, its offices were broken into and hard drives containing the issue's copy were taken from three computers. 
It is this climate of fear, says Mr. Borodko, Zubr's coordinator in Borisov, that his movement is combatting, by staging regular, open protests against Mr. Lukashenko's rule.
Zubr's origins are perhaps intentionally mysterious. Mr. Borodko said only that it was formed last January when some 40 leaders of youth group were summoned to Belavezh Preserve, a vast park where Soviet leaders met in 1991 to dissolve the Soviet Union -- and not coincidentally, the Belarus home where the Zubr roam. 
Like the Serbian group Otpor, Zubr's rules are simple. 
"The first principle is that there is no violence," Mr. Borodko said. "We reject violence in this struggle. The second is to show strength -- not to be afraid of wearing these T-shirts. There are cases where people have been beaten up because of that." 
Some fellow opposition members bristle at such boasts. In an interview, one called Zubr a "corrupted" opposition that had crafted its message and tactics to attract Western money. 
Mr. Borodko, who says he has been a dissident since leaving the army in 1997, takes that as an insult. He was forced from his job as an accountant in 1999, he says, after working with democratic forces to stage a vote on a shadow parliament. He now supports his wife and daughter by working for the human-rights group Vesna -- and is summoned to militia and K.G.B. offices roughly twice a month for interrogations.
After taking over Zubr's operations in Minsk, he said, his office was broken into in May and a computer and fax were stolen.
"The militia hunts down guys in these T-shirts to arrest them," he said, asking of Zubr's critics: "What do they call a serious organization?"
As for money, "I don't know where the central office gets it," he said. "I can only say where we get it. There are a lot of patriots in Borisov. They can't wear the T-shirts because their businesses would be dead. The T-shirts, stickers and computers we get form the central office. The rest we get here." 
Dissidents have protested against Mr. Lukashenko's rule before, of course -- 50,000 marched in Minsk last spring, by generous estimates -- but Zubr's tactics are both broader and more audacious.
One goal is to take protest outside Minsk, where antipathy toward Mr. Lukashenko is widespread, into the country, where his support is strongest. Zubr members have been walking across Belarus this summer, trailed by a K.G.B. car, visiting collective farms to stump for the opposition.
Another apparent goal is to stand out. Earlier this summer, Zubr members were arrested after they staged a play in which men in white coats chased a raving man wearing a hockey mask and carrying a hockey stick.
The joke was not lost on Belarussians: Mr. Lukashenko, a big hockey fan, is prone to public rants and displays of excess -- like closing a highway so he can Rollerblade -- that have earned him a reputation for kookiness, and worse.
The protesters got off scot free. Because their play did not mention Mr. Lukashenko by name, they argued, it must have been the police and prosecutors who judged the crazy, stick-waving actor to be Belarus's president.
But Mr. Lukashenko had the last word. Not much later, he issued a decree that banned wearing masks in public.

HEADLINE: The Watch For Whales Is Outpacing The Hunts 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: VICTORIA, British Columbia 

 BODY:
Hour after hour this summer, high-powered inflatable boats roar out of the harbor here, loaded with tourists dressed in orange safety suits scanning the waves of the Salish Sea for an orca, or killer whale.
 On the water, the orca pods, or families, are easily located from a mile away -- not for their distinctive dorsal fins, but for clusters of up to 40 tourist boats, from companies like Seafun Safaris and Prince of Whales. 
 Whale watching has mushroomed from one company on Vancouver Island in 1980 to 50 companies plying the Canadian-American waters here. Using a tracking network of underwater microphones and human spotters on land, air and sea, companies now tell visitors that they have a 98 percent success rate for whale-watching expeditions. 
The explosion of whale watching here in the Pacific Northwest is part of a surge worldwide. Today watching whales generates far more money than harpooning them. 
During the 1990's, the number of people going on whale-watching tours nearly tripled, hitting 10 million to 11 million in 2000, according to a report by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, a nonprofit group devoted to protecting whales, the world's largest mammals.
"We've always maintained these magnificent creatures are worth far more alive than dead," Fred O'Regan, the group's president, said on releasing the report in late July. "Now we can prove it."
Whale watchers paid more than $300 million for tour tickets last year and far more for land-based costs surrounding the tours, the report says. In contrast, the wholesale value of whale meat sold last year in Japan, one of the last major whaling nations, was put at $32 million. 
While a dead whale provides a one-time value, a live one can provide more lasting economic benefits by returning to shore communities where whale-watching tours are offered. In the 1990's, the number of communities around the world offering such tours roughly doubled to 492, according to Erich Hoyt, author of the Animal Welfare report.
Growing at 12 percent a year in the 1990's, or triple the annual rate of international tourism, whale watching attracts more than a million people a year in the United States, Canada and Spain. South Africa and Australia are fast behind. "In late 1980's whale watching just took off," Mr. Hoyt said in a phone interview from Edinburgh. "Now it is starting to translate into a political impact."
In Iceland, one of the last countries to give up whaling, the number of whale watchers was 30,330 in 1998, up from 200 in 1994. Whale watching is also growing in Norway and Japan, the two major nations that still hunt whales. In Japan, 100,000 people are estimated to take the tours. 
"The Japanese and Taiwanese are some of our best customers," Anton Roberts, co-owner of Seafun Safaris, said at the docks. 
Japan, a nation that largely feeds itself from the sea, says that each year it needs to catch about 500 whales, mostly minkes, to study their impact on fish. With Japan's whale catch today less than 10 percent the 6,000 level of the 1960's, Masayuki Komatsu, head of the Japan's Fisheries Agency, maintained a hard stance, calling minke whales "cockroaches of the sea."
In Washington, Shunji Yanai, Japan's ambassador to the United States, said recently that the whaling debate should be based "not on emotion, but on scientific reasoning" He added, "Some people say that whales eat more fish than mankind."
Here in the Pacific Northwest, some people complain that whale watching is too much of a good thing.
"People who are watching whales from shore are appalled by it," said Kari L. Koski, coordinator of Soundwatch, a boater education program run by the Whale Museum of San Juan Island, in Washington. "We see high speed and erratic behavior -- zooming in front of them and stopping in front of them."
Studies have been inconclusive about the impact of tour boats on whales. What is known is that in the last five years, the three pods of killer whales around here have declined about 20 percent, to 78 this summer. 
While noise pollution from motorboats may contribute, the main culprits are a sharp drop in salmon, their favorite food; the one-time practice of capturing whales here for aquariums; and man-made toxins.
"We are the visible thing," Mr. Roberts, of the tour company, said. "What can't be seen are the PCB's, the whales taken into captivity, the salmon disappearing."

HEADLINE: After a Decade, Scars Linger In a Healing Crown Heights 

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER and FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
Ten years after Crown Heights exploded in New York's ugliest spasm of racial violence in decades, the neighborhood's black and Jewish residents conduct joint picnics and ice-skating parties, even a police-supervised Halloween parade. There is a storefront mediation center, a black and Jewish mothers group, and an effort to add black youngsters to the private Jewish security patrols.
 Black and Jewish leaders have one another's beeper and cell phone numbers. 
 Prominent members of the Hasidim like Rabbi Jacob Goldstein and Rabbi Shea Hecht can ask Edison Jackson, the black president of Medgar Evers College at the City University of New York, for help and facilities for a computer training program and summer swimming. The area's black politicians, particularly Democratic Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., once at odds with the Lubavitchers, a Hasidic sect, have made their peace and in turn can rely on their solid bloc of something over 3,000 votes. 
In the years since the chaos of August 1991, blacks and Jews in this densely populated, economically distressed Brooklyn neighborhood have made major efforts to create institutional and informal ties. But despite the efforts of the leaders, the elected officials and lots of the neighborhood's ordinary residents, many of the old differences and distrusts remain, buried just beneath the surface. These are communities that, almost by definition, lead separate lives even as they live side by side.
There are still strong emotions surrounding the night exactly 10 years ago when a car in the entourage of the Lubavitcher rebbe spun out of control, crushing 7-year-old Gavin Cato as he played with his bicycle. Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year-old Hasidic scholar from Australia, was fatally stabbed three hours later, caught by a mob racing through the streets shouting "Jew, Jew."
For two more days and nights hundreds of black teenagers rampaged unchecked, burning police cars, looting, hurling bottles and beating people. Blacks and Jews clashed as the police stood by.
"I wish we had all these beeper and phone numbers for each other back then," said Chanina Sperlin, executive vice chairman of the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council. "There seems to be little tension; it's not a crisis anymore," said Jesse Hamilton, executive director of the Crown Heights Service Center, who is black. "Everybody is much more in tune," said Assistant Chief Joseph Fox, the Brooklyn South police commander.
Crown Heights, a neighborhood of 134,140 people, is a quiet place these days. Like much of the city, it has less crime and more construction, although the city's decade of boom times has not produced appreciable economic gains for either blacks or Jews. On the blocks at the epicenter of the rioting, there are now fewer blacks and more Hasidim, and at the neighborhood's fringes, more affluent whites from adjacent neighborhoods have begun to make inroads.
Ten years of immigration, too, have infused the neighborhood with Koreans and Nigerians, many of them illegal immigrants. And the police, who a decade ago were the source of disgruntlement for blacks and Jews, are now praised by both. 
On a recent hot August evening, near the corner of Utica Avenue and President Street, where the riot began, teenagers played raucous basketball. There was nothing to mark the spot nearby where Gavin Cato died. The makeshift memorials are long gone. A girl swooped from sidewalk to street on a fancy bike.
"There is a little healing so far, but not much," said Clemsford David, born in Guyana, a nurse at Kings County Hospital who lived through the rioting. "There are really two cultures that are different."
Today, there is to be a kind of ceremony -- celebration would hardly be the word -- marking the anniversary with a street fair for children and a banquet at the Brooklyn Museum. It is sponsored by Project CARE, for Community Alliance Revitalization Effort, a three-year-old group of dozens of black churches, Lubavitcher organizations, police precincts and government agencies.
And so while the neighborhood remains largely poor, with everyone struggling over scarce resources for housing, education and medical care, not every issue is viewed reflexively through the prism of race. When blacks met with commanders of the 71st Precinct to complain about the extra protection given to Jewish religious leaders and synagogues, they were offered the same accommodations, but realized they were not needed, said Owen Augustin, bishop of St. Augustine's A.O.C. Church.
The leaders are vigilant for possible friction points. Last year, for example, the Jewish Community Council won a housing rehabilitation grant in a traditionally black area. In the past, that might have spurred fears the Lubavitchers were about to jump the informal border. Instead, meetings produced assurances to black leaders that the housing would be preserved for the black residents.
But the new alliances also have their limits. Some blacks are still angry because they think Jews wield undue influence. Some see Hasidim buying the stately houses on President Street and sitting on the local school board even though they have their own school system. There are still grumblings that they are taking over the neighborhood and that the police are in their pockets.
Nowhere are the enduring differences more stark than the way blacks and Jews view the two deaths from 1991.
Many blacks feel that the driver of the car that killed the youth escaped justice; he is now living in Israel. "There is a segment of the black community that continues to grieve and feels that an injustice was done and there was not equal treatment," said Dr. Jackson.
Jews angrily reject any such equating of the deaths. "It's a tragedy what happened to the Cato family. But what happened to Yankel Rosenbaum was a murder," said Mr. Sperlin. "There are still murderers out there. The two incidents are very different."
Certainly, Carmel Cato, the father of Gavin, feels the sense of injustice most deeply. Mr. Cato still insisted that Gavin and his cousin Angela, 7, who survived being hit by the car in the rebbe's entourage, lay mangled and burned on the ground for at least 20 minutes while a Jewish ambulance whisked away the car's driver.
That version of events, contradicted by official city accounts, spread through the neighborhood that night.
"Every day I think about it," Mr. Cato, a hospital worker who has since moved out of Crown Heights, said of that night. "I cannot heal. I don't know how all these people can go around and say there is healing. They never reach for me."
The differences bubbled up, too, the other night, as a group of neighborhood women gathered at the mediation center to talk about a decade of change. They were proud of the roles that women played in groups like Mothers to Mothers, which since 1992 has brought together black and Jewish mothers to talk about their fears and dreams.
As a latecomer arrived, some women cooed congratulations for her new grandchild. Others ticked off the times they had exchanged family photographs and enjoyed interracial outings.
But then Carol Meltz, a black mother of four who is a retired social worker, spoke up. A 30-year neighborhood resident, she said the riots showed a rage among young blacks that too many still overlook or portray as the work of outsiders. 
"The riots broke out because of frustration and despair," Mrs. Meltz said, her voice trembling. "I know how people felt. You had no power. Political power. Things don't happen in a vacuum."
"So why did they have to take it out on the Jews?" snapped Rivka Katzen, a Jewish woman.
"Because they were there," Mrs. Meltz snapped back.
The women's exchange was quickly smoothed over. But it showed how close to the surface and how raw the feelings can still be. Mindful of the power of language, many community leaders simply call what happened in 1991 "the incident." Most others do not talk about 1991 at all.
But the rage among young black men with no jobs and few prospects is the same now as it was 10 years ago, says Richard Green, executive director of the Crown Heights Youth Collective. They are not the ones taking part in the new interracial coalitions. Mr. Green said he knew many of the young rioters from the neighborhood. He called them society's ghosts because they do not vote, work or attend school. Their children and their younger siblings, he said, often share their fate.
"Their anger is an outgrowth of idleness, a lack of feeling accomplished as human beings," Mr. Green said. "When it's compounded, it goes into rage. We have to be able to go after what caused these youths to do what they did."
If anything, the flow of mostly illegal immigrants from Nigeria, Korea and the Middle East into Crown Heights has created new possibilities for conflict, he said.
"From Utica to Atlantic Avenue, do you have any idea of how many villages you travel through?" Mr. Green said. "And we don't have any ambassadors to these enclaves. They all carry their own nationalistic attitudes." He added, "At least now the Hasidic village is talking to the African village. What about the Korean village?"
When the No. 3 train disgorges at the Kingston Avenue station in the evening rush hour it is a stunning sight: bearded Lubavitcher men in black suits and hats climb the stairs alongside Rastafarians with dreadlocks.
"Even though we live together, we don't know much about each other," said Yossi Stern, one of the leaders of the Lubavitcher security patrol. Steve King, 29, who is black and works on Franklin Avenue as a barber, concurred: "Things are so-so. Everybody goes their own way."
Actually, of all the changes that have occurred in Crown Heights since 1991, one of the more significant happened within the Lubavitchers themselves. Menachem M. Schneerson, the charismatic rebbe, died without an heir at the age of 91 seven years ago. One side effect was that the huge crowds who gathered for his appearances -- or even a rumor he might be at a window -- no longer filled the surrounding streets, with the attendant police attention.
Outsiders thought the Lubavitchers might fall apart. Instead, despite some internal political and spiritual wrangling, they have thrived, sending thousands more emissaries abroad in their worldwide Chabad outreach movement. And their numbers are growing within the neighborhood.
"They can't build quick enough to cope with the growth in the community," said Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, Rabbi Schneerson's longtime secretary and assistant who functions as a kind of chief executive of the international movement. "We are building schools, our synagogues are overflowing. I'm very upbeat about it."
But the Lubavitchers' intense inward looking spirituality -- some in Crown Heights still believe the rebbe may yet return as a Messiah -- their devotion to family and religious ritual largely ensures they live separately from their black neighbors.
"The melting pot, it just doesn't exist. You're not going to have that social dynamic," said Rabbi Goldstein, the chairman of Community Board 9 since 1980. "People say to me, 'You're living in a ghetto.' Well, I like my ghetto."
Mr. Hamilton, the director of a social services center, agreed, saying, "The Hasidic community is a very closed community. They don't socialize with the rest of the community that much." But, like some other black leaders, he expressed admiration for their ability to organize, saying "they do their homework better." He added, "They don't leave any stone unturned."
Dr. Robert Feldman, a Lubavitcher doctor who lives and practices at Kingston Avenue and President Street, where many of the clashes took place, thought back to the riots late one night, recalling his fear as he stitched up victims while a mob raged outside. "We didn't have any problems before. It was racially mixed, but it was nice," he mused.

HEADLINE: Why Risk Our Social Insurance? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Thomas R. Saving, a member of President Bush's Social Security reform commission, revealed that he has no case in his Aug. 12 Op-Ed article arguing for privatization of Social Security accounts. 
 Mr. 
Saving asserts that Social Security costs will be 25 percent higher than today in 2016, 54 percent higher in 2025 and 69 percent higher in 2050. If most people had a clear understanding of how much Social Security costs today, this would be a responsible way to present future cost projections.
It would be more normal to express the projected cost increases as a share of gross domestic product. For 2015 it would be 0.86 percentage points higher than today; for 2025, 2.06 percentage points; and for 2050, 2.39 percentage points. This projected rate of increase in Social Security spending is actually smaller than what we saw in the last 50 years.

HEADLINE: Between Hotel and Home 

BYLINE:  By JANET PIORKO 

 BODY:
THE name Ritz-Carlton, synonymous since 1927 with a hotel in Boston, is now associated with another kind of lodging there: the Residential Suites at the Ritz-Carlton Towers, apartments for stays of 15 days or more. With a "soft opening" in June, they are part of a complex still under construction that will include the Ritz-Carlton, Boston Common, the company's second hotel in the city, set to open in early September with 193 rooms and suites; a 100,000-square-foot athletic club, Sports Club/LA, also opening in early September; a 19-screen theater (now open), and 309 condominiums.
 The Residential Suites have cable TV, VCR, DVD, stereo, in-room safes and dedicated fax machines, as well as housekeeping, concierge, access to the health club and room service. 
 The project -- the first such venture associated with Ritz-Carlton -- is one of the more luxurious examples of extended-stay accommodations, which make up the fastest growing segment in the lodging business, according to Mark Skinner, a partner in the Highland Group, a consulting and research company in Atlanta specializing in the field.
Their number has grown from 52,000 such units in the United States in 1995 to 212,000 last year, Mr. Skinner said. Although around a third are what he calls upscale, such as the properties of Residence Inn by Marriott, only a few are deluxe.
Four Seasons also has its name associated with such units; there are 50 short-term serviced apartments on top of the Four Seasons Hotel Houston and 16 at the Four Seasons Hotel Chicago.
Typical guests are executives relocating, lawyers trying a case and film crews. "We have the lion's share of the film and entertainment industry in Vancouver," said Judy Ahola, a spokeswoman for the 397-room Sutton Place Hotel in Vancouver, which has a 164-suite tower called La Grande Residence for minimum three-night stays.
Extended-stay lodgings cost less than comparable hotels, said Mr. Skinner. At the Residential Suites, based on a 15-day stay, a one-bedroom apartment, ranging from 700 to 1,300 square feet, costs $235 to $310 a night. The Ritz-Carlton, Boston Common will charge $495 for a 350-square-foot room.
New York City has been fertile ground for this lodging. Millennium Partners, the developer of the new Ritz-Carlton Boston project, has owned the Phillips Club near Lincoln Center since 1996; it has 96 extended-stay units and 92 units for short-term stays and ownership through a residential club. The Envoy Club, which opened in 1998 with 57 units on East 33rd Street, plans to open a property on the Upper East Side of Manhattan this year; another, at 425 Fifth Avenue, at 38th Street, is planned for next year. Manhattan East Suite Hotels, with 10 properties, is spending $12 million to renovate its Dumont Plaza, with 248 suites at 34th Street and Lexington Avenue.
Because extended-stay lodgings offer value, Mr. Skinner expects they will hold their own even in a softening market. He said that statistics for the first half of the year show that this type of accommodation is weathering the economic downturn better than the overall lodging industry.

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS; 
A New Car Phone (No Strings Attached)

BYLINE:  By MINDY SINK 

DATELINE: BOULDER, Colo. 

 BODY:
FOR most of the past decade, Cellport Systems has been researching and developing a safer way for motorists to talk on their wireless phones while on the road. Sure, there are headsets and other devices on the market that allow people to talk and keep both hands on the wheel, but critics say that those, too, can pose safety problems.
 Now, as public sentiment grows against the use of hand-held cellular phones while driving, Cellport finds itself in the spotlight with its next generation of hands-free, headset-free technology. Drivers use simple voice commands to operate the phone, while the sound is channeled through the car's speakers. And Cellport's system is compatible with most major brands of cell phones. 
 Last month, Cellport, which is privately held, signed a $48 million, two-year contract to provide its voice-activated cell phone system, known as the Cellport 3000 with Voice Command, to the Ford Motor Company. Ford will offer the option through dealers this fall in the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable sedans and the Ford Windstar minivan, and early next year in the Lincoln Town Car. 
"So the stars aligned, and thank God we lived long enough to see them align," said Pat Kennedy, the chief executive and a founder of Cellport. "We were, oddly enough, way ahead of our time."
Mr. Kennedy, 48, uses phrases like "so one thing led to another" and words like "magically" to describe the business connections that led to seven patents, global partners and the contract with Ford.
Mr. Kennedy has always been drawn to the telecommunications industry even though he received a degree in international economics from the University of Buffalo. Just out of college in 1978, he began working for Hatfield Associates, a telecommunications consulting firm in Boulder, then started Cellular Solutions Inc., a cell phone accessories business. He and his former boss, Dale N. Hatfield, worked together again in the early 1990's, along with three other colleagues in the industry -- Hiroshi Sakurai, Michael Braitberg and Richard Chandler -- to eventually form Cellport. Before Cellport was founded in 1993, the partners began developing and patenting their wireless technology.
In their first year of business, Cellport's founders lived rather modestly, driving old cars and eating plenty of pizza for dinner. Their fortunes began to change later that year, when a phone company industry group agreed to provide $500,000 to finance research. That money kept the company going until 1995, when AT&T Wireless provided a cash infusion of $2 million. In exchange for financing, Cellport agreed to share research results and to allow John Thompson, then the chief financial officer at AT&T Wireless, to serve on its board. Mr. Thompson helped Cellport secure more than $3 million in additional financing from other industry sources.
BUT the streak of good news came to an abrupt end in 1998, when the company presented its first product to investors and received a lukewarm reception. "They said, 'kudos because your core concept of universality is spot on, but it's a little big and clumsy,' " Mr. Kennedy said. Soon after, Mr. Braitberg left the company, although he remains a stockholder.
FLV Fund, an investment firm based in Belgium, helped Cellport back on its feet in 1999 with a $7 million investment. Philippe Vercruyssen, senior investment manager at FLV Management USA, a subsidiary, now also serves on Cellport's board. But Cellport's biggest break came last year, when it received a $22 million investment from Cisco Systems. That enabled the company to add offices in Tokyo and Detroit and to expand its work force to 100, from 27 just a year ago.
Dressed casually on a recent Wednesday morning in a brightly colored shirt, khaki shorts and black loafers, Mr. Kennedy offered a demonstration of the Cellport 3000. As he drove through the office parking lot in Boulder, he kept both hands on the steering wheel and his eyes on the road as he "dialed" the phone with spoken commands. He then repeated the process with several different cell phone models, rapidly attaching and detaching them from pocket adapters that fit a phone into the system's cradle, known as the docking station. The phone sits snugly in the cradle, where the phone battery is also recharged, and will not become a flying object if there is a sudden stop, he said.
The Cellport kit is wired to the car's electrical system. It has a small microphone, mounted on the rearview mirror, that can be wired through the stereo speakers and is intended to pick up even soft voices. It is activated only when the user says, "Cellport, dial" in English. The system, which can be programmed for speed dialing, cannot be activated accidentally by singing along with the radio, for example, though loud noices like those from a nearby lawnmower or from screaming children in the back seat of the car could interrupt an outgoing call.
"Then you've got a user-functionality problem," Mr. Kennedy said.
Incoming calls mute the car's audio system, and an external antenna improves signal strength and reduces the problem of dropped calls. 
While other companies -- most notably Motorola and Nokia -- already have relationships with Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and BMW to provide voice-activated phone systems as dealer options, Cellport's advantage is the near universality of the pocket adapters. Cellport said it had designed them to accommodate 70 percent of cell phones on the market. 
The Cellport 3000 system sells for around $250 at retail outlets, although installation could run an additional $100 to $200 and individual adapters costs $60 to $100.
Mr. Kennedy said his company was constantly updating software as new cell phones were created. "Even though it looks like a hardware appliance company, the reality is we're really a software company," he said.
This year, Cellport says it expects to earn a profit of $4 million to $5 million, compared with barely break-even results in previous years. Earnings could grow as the market for hand-held alternatives increases. About 15 million hands-free phone units are expected to be sold next year worldwide, generating $3 billion in revenue, according to Cellport. The company said it had sold almost 20,000 of its hands-free units this year.
"It's the simple stuff in life that sells, and it's just inevitable that universal hands-free is going to become as common as the cup holder," said Douglas M. Daniels, Cellport's vice president for business development, who helped sell the product to Ford.
Mr. Daniels said a large fleet customer of Ford, which neither Cellport nor the automaker would identify, had approached Ford with a problem: It had a hands-free policy for all company cars. "Our main motivation was customer demand," said Kurt Kaiser, North American manager for vehicle personalization at Ford.
Ford officials said they were unsure of the exact price of the Cellport option for customers, although Mr. Daniels said it would probably be under $400 on most cars. The kit can also be retrofitted to many older-model Fords.
CELLPORT began manufacturing under contract in Mexico at the start of the year and the deal with Ford began to take shape this spring. "It was catalyzed in a sense of crisis by the New York state law," Mr. Kennedy said.
This summer, New York became the first state to enact a law banning motorists from using hand-held cell phones while driving. It takes effect on Nov. 1.
Other states may follow suit. Since 1995, legislators in at least 45 states have proposed banning or restricting the use of cell phones while driving, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. More than 300 cities and towns also have laws prohibiting the practice, along with 20 countries worldwide.
A New England Journal of Medicine study in 1997 concluded that phone use in a motor vehicle quadrupled the risk of an accident. An estimated 3 percent of drivers nationwide use hand-held phones, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
While he was impressed with the Cellport technology, Felix W. Ortiz, a New York State assemblyman who spent years advocating legislation to prohibit drivers from using hand-held cell phones, said he did not think that the company's product solved the safety issues. "People should not be driving and talking at all," said Mr. Ortiz, a Brooklyn Democrat.
Bill Johnston, a psychology professor at the University of Utah who has studied how cell phones affect driving performance, agreed. "It's like a filter tip on a cigarette in that it might help a little bit," he said. "The problem is diversion from driving, just the conversation itself."
Mr. Kennedy said he was not lobbying to ban hand-held phones in cars. "We take the position with the cellular industry that, yes, consumers need to be responsible for their own behavior," he said.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Why Investors May Find Arbitrators on Their Side

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
AS investors watch their portfolios wizen, complaints of broker misdeeds rise at the National Association of Securities Dealers. The group, which runs the nation's largest arbitration system handling investor grievances, reports that through July, 3,950 cases had been filed, 25 percent more than at the same point in 2000. 
 But how many disgruntled investors will succeed in their cases? Will arbitrators view them, as many in the securities industry do, as greedy opportunists trying to recover losses of their own making by picking the deepest pocket around? 
 One authority on securities arbitration says that for several reasons, many investors will fare well. Lewis D. Lowenfels, at the New York law firm Tolins & Lowenfels, said stock investors' immense losses since last year and the troubling conflicts of interest coming to light among research analysts and other brokerage firm employees will encourage arbitrators to give plaintiffs at least some of what they are seeking. 
"The tech stock bubble and conflicts at brokerage firms will be central to their decisions," Mr. Lowenfels said. "And given the unpredictability of panels, brokerage firms are going to be more inclined to settle."
Not every case will be a winner for the plaintiff, of course. But Mr. Lowenfels' argument is borne out by Merrill Lynch's recent payment of $400,000 to settle a case brought against it and its high-profile Internet analyst, Henry Blodget.
A Supreme Court case in 1987 confirmed that investors cannot file claims against brokers in court if they had agreed to bring them to arbitration, as most are required to do in order to open brokerage accounts. So investors have little choice about where they air their grievances. Surprisingly, Mr. Lowenfels said, arbitration may be kinder to beleaguered investors today than courts would be. 
To win a federal fraud case, for example, an investor must prove intent on the broker's part. Not so in arbitration, where many panels have ruled against firms for recommending unsuitable investments to clients or for failing to supervise brokers. Intent to defraud was never at issue. 
Arbitration may be more fruitful for investors, especially those suing over losses in stocks recommended by biased analysts, because in federal court, investors can bring a fraud case only if they bought or sold based on the recommendation. Arbitration, on the other hand, allows for cases in which an investor already owned the stock and simply held on because of the analyst's call. 
Finally, Mr. Lowenfels argued that in some arbitration opinions, panelists have said they were concerned about treating plaintiffs equitably even if it meant appearing to go beyond the law to do it. "In these cases, plaintiffs receive at least some portion of their demands," he said. "But in a court of law, the same claimants would probably have received nothing." 
Investors are in the midst of the worst bear market since arbitration was mandated. If throngs of them prevail, it will come as an unpleasant surprise to brokers who cheered when they won the right to compel investors to arbitration rather than the courts. They felt that arbitration panels -- made up of industry executives, lawyers and business people -- would be more conservative than juries of people unfamiliar with investing. 
But now, Mr. Lowenfels said, "in a number of important areas, arbitration panels seem to have reached beyond existing legal authorities to expand the rights and protections accorded to the investing public." 
Wonder which brokerage will be first to stop forcing its clients into arbitration?

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
Restoring the Queens' Glamour

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
THE Queen Elizabeth 2 was recently docked at Pier 90 in Manhattan, at the start of a cruise up the Northeast coast, in all her regal glory and internal contradiction.
 Plaques commemorating royal visits lined a wall near the slot machines. Mementos from the glory years of trans-Atlantic travel filled a display case, looking forlorn compared with the shiny goods for sale in the on-board mall. 
 A larger anomaly is less apparent on the ship. Carnival Cruise Lines, a Miami-based company that grew rich promoting cruises for the masses, now owns Cunard Line Ltd. and with it this icon of British seafaring tradition. 
Fittingly, the recently appointed president and chief operating officer of Cunard, Pamela Conover, also reflects this complexity. Her accent is properly British, her speech carefully measured and her demeanor reserved. But underneath that is a woman who never attended college, who rose from bank teller to company president and who now must oversee both the largest ocean liner building project ever undertaken and the huge marketing effort to help it succeed.
Despite such pressure, there is not a single crack in the facade. "You could think of it as a challenge," she said over lunch in the Princess Grill aboard the QE2. "I prefer to think of it as an opportunity."
Opportunities appeared to come up in regular progression in Ms. Conover's successful, but not flashy, career. Her greatest claim to fame was a a 1992 speech at a cruise industry convention in which she correctly predicted that the industry would consolidate from 24 companies to just a handful. 
Ms. Conover, who is 45 and now lives in Key Biscayne, Fla., was born in Thailand to a British family. Her father worked for an international trading company. She went to high school in England and was preparing to study geography and anthropology at the University of London. "I couldn't face it, so I put it off for a year," she said, and took a bank teller's job at a Wells Fargo branch in London.
She passed through a series of clerical positions and took courses in credit analysis and accounting. Wells Fargo sent her to New York as a loan officer in 1979. When she asked a former Wells boss who worked at United States Lines, a container ship company, for a reference, he mentioned a job there -- assistant treasurer. She was hired in 1981.
Contacts with Citibank led the bank to hire her four years later for its ship finance division. Carnival was a customer, and then a suitor. She joined the cruise line in 1994. "Part of it is being in the right place at the right time," she said. "Part of it is hard work. Drive."
Her first assignment for Carnival was not a success. She was president of the Epirotiki Cruise Line, in which Carnival had invested. The Greek family that had controlled the company resented her attempt to exercise control, Ms. Conover said. "My job was to get in there and run the company and take over, and there were inevitably differences," she said.
Carnival pulled out after a year and made Ms. Conover vice president of the strategic planning department before moving her to Cunard, newly acquired, as chief operating officer in 1998. The title of president was added in February. 
Cunard, established in 1839 to carry mail between Britain and North America, grew into a storied line, launching ships like the Lusitania, Mauretania, Aquitania and the queens -- the Mary and the Elizabeths, first and second. 
But several changes of ownership over recent decades left it money-losing and demoralized. The signature event was a disastrous 1994 cruise in which pipes exploded and toilets erupted on the QE2, causing a passenger uproar.
Carnival bought the line from Kvaerner A.S.A., a Norwegian shipbuilder, in May 1998 and merged it with its Seabourn Cruise Line, which runs small, expensive vacation cruises. 
The next month, Carnival announced plans for the Queen Mary 2, the largest ocean liner ever; it is scheduled for its maiden voyage at the end of 2003. It will take over regular Atlantic runs from the QE2, which will stay in service for regional cruises.
But soon after the Cunard acquisition, the luxury segment of the cruise industry, which includes Cunard, weakened sharply because of the downturn in the economy. Under Ms. Conover, Cunard's Web site (www.cunard.com) now offers a sweepstakes to win a free trans-Atlantic trip, and advertises a low trans-Atlantic fare of $1,225, including a return economy-fare plane ticket. 
The Seabourn-Cunard marriage, meanwhile, has floundered. Each line lost focus under combined management and marketing, Ms. Conover said. She has created separate managements and is selling three of Seabourn's six vessels.
Along with those problems, Ms. Conover has to oversee the building of the $800 million QM2 in a French yard; the project has faced unexpected expenses from new safety regulations -- which, for example, require Cunard to build not only the hull but also the superstructure out of steel. Some analysts view the project as folly, given the weakness in the market and what they regard as the fading appeal of trans-Atlantic ship travel.
"I think that's a dumb move," said Jason N. Ader, leisure analyst at Bear Stearns. "They're never going to get the returns on that."
Ms. Conover's tone stiffens slightly when asked about the criticism. "One, we have one of the most famous brand names," she said. "Two, we have the backing of the one of the largest and most successful cruise companies in the world. And three, we have assembled one of the finest management teams in the business."
Demographics are on Cunard's side, Ms. Conover contended. Older baby boomers are edging toward retirement. Younger ones are receiving inheritances. The number of North American cruise passengers has risen steadily. 
HENCE the urgency in relaunching Cunard's image, one of Ms. Conover's priorities. In July, Cunard gave its advertising account to the New York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day and hired a New York public relations firm, M. Silver Associates.
The aims will be to recall the Cunard Line's aristocratic British associations while portraying it as a floating resort, with theater productions, convention facilities, course offerings, concerts and the trappings of luxury. 
Do the images clash? Not to Ms. Conover. Passengers want both the modern amenities and the trappings of a bygone era, she contended. Ultimately, she said, a trans-Atlantic cruise is about "giving people the ability to step back."

HEADLINE: SCHOOLS' BACKING OF BEHAVIOR DRUGS COMES UNDER FIRE 

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE and MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Children return to classrooms this fall amid an increasingly pitched battle over Ritalin and other drugs used to treat millions with behavioral and emotional problems in school. 
 Some of Ritalin's competitors are breaking with 30-year-old international marketing restrictions to advertise directly to parents, selling the idea that drugs may be the answer to their children's problems in school. At the same time, state legislatures are moving to prevent schools from recommending or requiring that parents put their children on medication. 
 Last month, Minnesota became the first state to bar schools and child protection agencies from telling parents they must put their children on drugs to treat disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D. In October, Connecticut will go a step further when a new law takes effect prohibiting any school staff member from discussing drug treatments with a parent to assure that such talk comes only from doctors. Similar bills have been introduced in Arizona, New Jersey, New York, Utah and Wisconsin. 
The legislative push is a reaction to what its advocates call overprescription of the drugs. They say an excessive reliance on Ritalin and several competing drugs is driving parents away from traditional forms of discipline and has created a growing, illegal traffic in what are potent and dangerous speed-like stimulants.
Last year, doctors wrote almost 20 million monthly prescriptions for the stimulants, according to IMS Health, a health care information company. Most of those prescriptions were written for children, especially boys. The drugs had sales last year of $758 million, 13 percent more than in 1999.
The political concern comes as producers of the drugs have begun an advertising campaign that is unparalleled in spending and technique. 
In the back-to-school section of this month's Ladies' Home Journal, tucked among the ads for Life cereal, bologna and Jell-O pudding, are three full-page advertisements for the A.D.H.D. treatments. 
The ads evoke a sense of Rockwellian calm. Children chat happily next to a school bus. A child's hand gently touches the hand of an adult. In one, for the new drug Metadate CD, an approving mother embraces her beaming son as the drug itself is named and promoted.
This is a first. Metadate CD, like Ritalin, Adderall and similar drugs, are what are known as Schedule II controlled substances, the most addictive substances that are still legal. (Schedule I drugs like heroin and LSD are illegal.)
In keeping with a 1971 international treaty, such controlled substances have never been marketed directly to consumers, only to doctors. There is, however, no federal law to prevent drug companies from doing it. Yet the new magazine advertisement by Celltech Pharmaceuticals, the British maker of Metadate CD, states, "Introducing Metadate capsules. One dose covers his A.D.H.D for the whole school day."
Terry Woodworth, deputy director of the Office of Diversion Control of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said, "We have had a 30-year agreement with the pharmaceutical industry not to advertise controlled substances." 
"Celltech has stepped up and beyond everyone else," Mr. Woodworth said, "by advertising a drug with a high potential for abuse." He said the campaign could have "diplomatic repercussions" and that Celltech had been recently asked to stop.
Ian R. Garland, chief operating officer of Celltech, would not comment on discussions with drug enforcement officials but said that the advertisements had been reviewed by regulators at the Food and Drug Administration and comply with federal regulations. Celltech also said the ads were aimed at parents whose children had already received a diagnosis of A.D.H.D.
The F.D.A. said the drugs could be advertised as long as their dangers are described in the ads.
McNeil Consumer Healthcare, which makes a drug called Concerta, and Shire Pharmaceuticals, a British company that makes Adderall, are also advertising directly to consumers, but they are not naming their products. Instead, parents are urged to call a toll-free number to request that brochures be sent to them. That information mentions the drugs by brand name as one treatment option.
Mr. Woodworth of the Drug Enforcement Administration said such ads -- McNeil is running 60-second commercials on cable television networks like the Discovery Channel and A&E -- still violate the spirit of the international protocols. Officials of both companies say they are not promoting a brand and are not breaking any law.
Some parents and doctors say they welcome the new drugs and the publicity which, they believe, helps inform parents of new treatments. Little is known for sure about how the drugs work, but they seem to help children with attention-deficit disorders to focus.
Concerta and Metadate CD work longer than Ritalin, the best known of these drugs, so children who take them do not have to see the school nurse at lunch for a booster dose. That avoids embarrassment and reduces the risks associated with drugs being stored at school.
Some physicians who have done research on Ritalin say the state laws are too severe. 
"To argue that these treatments are inappropriate or ineffective just flies in the face of a scientific knowledge base that is impossible to ignore," said Howard Abikoff, director of research at the Child Study Center at New York University. "You can't close your eyes to this. It's made differences that are monumental in the lives of these kids and their parents." He was one of the principal researchers in a National Institute of Mental Health study of Ritalin that found that medication was more effective than behavioral therapy in treating A.D.H.D.
Dr. Lawrence H. Diller, a behavioral pediatrician in Walnut Creek, Calif., who wrote a book called "Running on Ritalin," said that as the ads have appeared, parents have begun asking for the drugs by name.
Celltech has created a Superman-like character with "CD" emblazoned on his chest. "A new hero for ADHD patients is here!" pronounces the company's brochure. Dr. Diller said a Celltech sales representative gave him such a brochure which seemed intended to be passed on to parents. But the company said the brochures were meant only for doctors and pharmacists.
Evelyn Green, a teacher in Chicago and the president of CHADD, Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, a nonprofit group that represents people with the disorder, said that one of her sons has been taking medication -- first Ritalin and now Adderall -- for eight years.
Some parents may not be aware of the new longer-acting drugs, Concerta and Metadate CD, which have genuine benefits for many chidren, Ms. Green said. "The danger of the ads," she said, "is that parents could get the message that medication is all there is." 
The problems associated with these drugs have escalated. The Drug Enforcement Administration says Ritalin and other stimulants are among the most frequently stolen prescription drugs. Some students are crushing and snorting pills for a speed-like high; in Orem, Utah, an elementary school principal was sentenced to 30 days in jail after he stole his students' Ritalin pills and replaced them with sugar pills. 
The Journal of the American Medical Association in February 2000 noted a "disturbing" rise in the number of prescriptions for stimulants and anti-depressants for children under 5, most of whom are too young, according to the drugs' labels, to take them. 
"Before they came out with these, how did we grow up?" asked Lenny T. Winkler, a nurse and state representative who sponsored Connecticut's new law. "If a child has a problem and it's diagnosed properly, I support that. But I think teachers are far too quick to blame the problem on attention deficit, and say to parents, 'This is what needs to be done.' "
Children who take medication for emotional or learning problems in school tend to be labeled "learning disabled" under special education laws, and now account for over half of those in special education.
The diagnoses for many of the problems have long been controversial, in part because there are no blood or lab tests for attention deficit disorders, or even for schizophrenia or depression.
Sales of Ritalin, which was approved in 1955, have been declining for years as doctors prescribe lower-cost, generic versions. In 1999, Adderall overtook Ritalin. Adderall was first sold in the 1960's as a weight loss drug. Its success has changed Shire from a small company with offices in a farmhouse into an international pharmaceutical firm.
Now McNeil's Concerta has captured 16 percent of the market.
Metadate CD was approved in April. Mr. Garland said the company felt forced to advertise to parents after the other companies did so.
Novartis, the maker of Ritalin, has not advertised the drug directly to consumers. It is, however, preparing two new drugs similar to Ritalin that it hopes the F.D.A. will approve in the next month. Regina Moran, a spokeswoman, said the company did not know yet how it would market those drugs.
The Connecticut legislation began with Ms. Winkler's work as an emergency room nurse, where she said she saw more and more children coming in who were on psychotropic drugs, from stimulants to antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, and requiring metabolic tests and cardiograms. "Why, unless these drugs have some impact on the other body systems, would we have to do these tests?" she said. Then she began receiving calls from constituents who complained that schools had encouraged them to put their children on drugs, even, in some cases, making it a condition of attending class or after-school.
In Millbrook, N.Y., Patricia Weathers said her son's school told her to put him on Ritalin in first grade. By fourth grade, he was showing signs of severe anxiety, she said, chewing his clothes and paper. When Mrs. Weathers took him off the drugs, she said, the school called the state's office of child protective services and accused her of medical neglect.
"You have the school psychologist, the teachers, the principal, all bombarding you, saying this is the only way to go," she said. "I fell for it, and I believe most parents fall for it. They want to do what's right for their child, and if the professionals are telling them this is right, you think, 'They must be right.' "
She, like many parents who think Ritalin is overprescribed, complain that there is no scientific basis for the diagnosis of the disorders for which it is prescribed.
"You can't tell me they all have this brain disorder during the school year, when during the summer they're fine," said Mrs. Weathers, who now instructs her son at home.

The President's Textual Relations

BYLINE:  By KENNETH CMIEL; Kenneth Cmiel, a history professor at the University of Iowa, is the author of "Democratic Eloquence: The Fight Over Popular Speech in 19th-Century America."

 BODY:
WHEN George W. Bush took to the airwaves to speak about stem cell research, he performed a presidential duty with a long, hoary tradition behind it: urging the nation to confront a moral issue fundamental to its future. But how he spoke says a great deal about the means Americans use to persuade each other at the opening of the 21st century. 
 The speech was cited by political analysts as a defining moment for the new president, and indeed, since it was his first national, prime-time address as president, it did much to establish Mr. Bush's public persona and clarify the tone of his administration. Other presidents have addressed the nation on vital matters -- George Washington in his Farewell Address, Abraham Lincoln in his Second Inaugural, Jimmy Carter in his "malaise" speech. Mr. Bush's exposition of the ethical dilemmas surrounding stem cell research may not have the long-term gravitas of those well-known speeches, but it is part of the same genre. 
 Yet the president did two remarkable things in his speech. First, he freely admitted he had to wrestle with the ethics of the issue. Second, he carefully recited arguments of the differing points of view. Both strategies are extremely rare in the annals of presidential speechmaking. Chief executives like to be decisive, seeing their words as action, a way to move the nation in a specific direction. Historically, presidential oratory is short on soul searching. By highlighting the complexities of the issue, Mr. Bush established himself as a baby-boomer president, using boomer oratory.
George Washington's 1796 Farewell Address to Congress is best known for its caution against getting politically involved with Europe. But the speech largely pondered how the nation would hang together. Could regions and factions keep from breaking the new republic into pieces? Temperamentally, Washington wasn't too far from our current president. Patriotism, respect for religion and skepticism about radical political innovation were Washington's themes. But unlike Mr. Bush, Washington did not hover over his own ruminations. After quickly mentioning his "reflections" on the subject, Washington then spoke firmly and confidently for well over an hour about what he thought the country needed to know. 
While Washington was sure and paternal; Mr. Bush tried to succeed by grappling. Stem cell research is a "difficult and complex issue." The more we know, the "less certain" we are. Experts suffer "widespread disagreement." Even as he made firm declarations about the sanctity of life, Bush highlighted the conundrums. Even the certainties don't save the nation from uncertainty.
This is new. Ronald Reagan's words, just as much as Washington's, were unaffected by personal moral dilemma. President Bill Clinton might have been a notorious discusser but he kept this backstage in White House bull sessions. In public, he was smooth and assured. 
Mr. Bush's rumination speaks to the issue, the man, the times. Stem cell research is indeed complicated. To admit uncertainty is no weakness. And for a president who has no pretensions to being an intellectual, it doesn't hurt to advertise he has gone to school on the topic. But there is one more thing: the second baby-boomer president, perhaps instinctively, sees that personal authority no longer comes from being a father figure to the nation. He can't be like Washington, or even like George Bush, his own father. Credibility is now won by joining in the nation's anxieties. You win by showing we're in it together. Mr. Clinton felt our pain. Mr. Bush shares our confusions.
A large part of Mr. Bush's speech was his careful recitation of both sides of the argument. He acted as the nation's schoolteacher, explaining, in simple, straightforward prose, what the stakes were. But he also painted a picture of a nation divided. Experts disagreeing; families agonizing; "even many of the same faith" reaching "different conclusions." 
This last is not a part of presidential oratory. It has been far more common for presidents to assume a national community exists and to present disintegration as a threat. Washington, in 1796, spoke of the common "habits, manners and political principles" of the American people. Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the 1936, defended "the average man" against a band of "economic royalists." President Reagan promised to transcend special interests and represent "this breed called Americans."
Even where it was patently absurd, this was the trope adopted. As the Civil War drew to a close, Lincoln was desperate to claim a shared community. "Both sides read the same Bible and pray to the same God," he asserted in his Second Inaugural Address.
Mr. Bush, however, spoke not of shared beliefs but deep disagreement, reporting the sort of divide that cable guys like CNBC's Chris Matthews focus on -- two nations, elites versus working stiffs, the coasts versus the heartland.
YET unlike a pugnacious talk show host, Mr. Bush was looking to conciliate. That is what made his neutral recitation of the different sides so important. At least on this issue, Mr. Bush can't affirm community by calling the nation back to its common core, the way Washington, Lincoln or Roosevelt did. The divides are too deep.
Here, though, the nation can find community by listening to each other. Respectfully hearing the other side is a way to make the divides palatable. It is a standard technique in business management -- making sure everyone feels listened to. Mr. Bush, a Harvard Business School graduate and former C.E.O., is, no doubt, well versed in this sort of tactic. In a country where there is no common culture, we don't agree, we can just listen. 
There will be other occasions where the president can ritually affirm community. But Mr. Bush's address on stem cell research was a reminder of how hard it is to use standard oratory when faced with today's broad cultural divides. It is also a reminder that Mr. Bush, like his immediate predecessor, is a boomer president facing boomer credibility issues. These presidents will have to find their own voices.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 19 about presidential oratory through history misstated the form of George Washington's farewell address. It was not a speech; Washington gave the text to a Philadelphia publisher, David Claypoole, who printed it in his newspaper, The American Daily Advertiser. The address was then reprinted in major newspapers around the country.

Software Niche Offers A Rare Tech Bright Spot

BYLINE:  By CAROLINE WAXLER 

 BODY:
INVESTORS have been warming lately to a software sector called electronic design automation as a way to capture some growth in the generally depressed technology area.
 Companies in this sector make software tools that allow semiconductor companies to design chips as well as to make verification software that ensures that chips work properly. While E.D.A. companies do rely on the semiconductor market, which is slowing, their proponents assert that their growth is not directly tied to that production cycle. 
 "E.D.A. tends to be shielded from downturn," said Walden C. Rhines, chief executive of Mentor Graphics, an E.D.A. company in Wilsonville, Ore. "In a semiconductor recession, we might grow slightly less, but we don't have negative growth." 
These stocks have held up relatively well in a rocky market. Led by three big public companies, Cadence Design Systems, Mentor Graphics and Synopsys, the sector is down 15 percent for the year, compared with a negative 24 percent for the technology-heavy Nasdaq. (Avant has beena leader, too, but legal issues have been weighing on the company, knocking shares down 60 percent. When Avant is included, the sector is down 26 percent this year.)
"Semiconductor companies are loading chips up with more functionality than ever before, said Jessica Kourakos, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. The number of transistors on the largest chip has risen sharply -- to about 160 million from 100 million a year ago, said Gary Smith, an analyst at Gartner Dataquest, an information technology research firm. 
As a result, the complexity of E.D.A. software tools needed to design those chips increases. In some cases, these upgraded packages cost four times as much as the systems they replaced, Ms. Kourakos said.
Though semiconductor revenue and volumes are falling in tandem, such a double decline does not occur often. And E.D.A. companies are still relatively well off, benefiting from a tendency among companies suffering a sales slump to try to design their way out of trouble. 
Mr. Smith estimates that the $4 billion E.D.A. sector will increase its revenue by 19.4 percent this year, though others consider that estimate high. Not surprisingly, several companies have made highly successful public offerings in the last 18 months.
Another plus for these companies is that spending for the tools comes not from customers' capital expenditures, which tend to be slashed in tough times, but from research and development budgets, which in high tech are less subject to cutbacks.
In terms of management, most of these companies are significantly improving their accounting. Previously, they would recognize a substantial amount of revenue up front, which often tempted customers to place orders on the last day of the quarter, knowing that the company, desperate to make its numbers, would be likely to offer a significant discount. Now they bill customers more routinely, increasing the consistency of their revenue flows. In the short run, however, the switch can reduce earnings.
Each of the four principal companies has its own niche, and customers are expected to stay with their providers. 
"Unless the start-up company has very differentiated technology," Ms. Kourakos said, "customers will think twice before giving business to somebody who may not be around in six months."
Another factor benefiting the incumbents is Avant's legal troubles, said Bill Frerichs in the Portland, Ore., office of D. A. Davidson, an investment firm. In May, Avant pleaded no contest to criminal charges of stealing trade secrets from Cadence, and a civil case is pending. 
Blum Capital Partners in San Francisco, a private investment partnership that buys big stakes in companies so it can take an active role in management, has built a nearly 6 percent position in Synopsys over the last year. Jose S. Medeiros, a Blum partner, encouraged Synopsys to use the cash on its balance sheet for a $500 million stock repurchase, and a second such deal is on the way.
REPURCHASES are possible because E.D.A. companies, with operating margins that historically have been about 20 percent, tend to generate large amounts of cash. They have stock prices that generally run 18 to 30 times earnings.
But while the fortunes of these companies are not closely tied to the semiconductor cycle, their stocks could still suffer from misperception. Investors might think the two groups should move in sync, said Eric Fischman, an analyst at MFS Investment Management, a mutual fund group in Boston, "but that's not correct."

Its Luster Made Empires Rise and Fall

BYLINE:  By ALLEN BARRA

 BODY:
IF Gen. George Armstrong Custer, Christopher Columbus, King Tutankhamen, Sir Francis Drake, Adolf Hitler, the Roman emperior Constantine, King Philip II of Spain, Francisco Pizarro, King Midas, Richard Nixon, a late-19th-century Boer, a 13th-century Venetian banker, the robber baron Jay Gould and the ancient Inca ruler Atahualpa all found themselves seated at a dinner party, what on earth would they talk about? According to the four-hour mini-series that has its premiere on the History Channel this week, the common conversational thread would be gold.
 One of the History Channel's most ambitious and comprehensive productions, "Gold!," with Roger Mudd as anchor, was filmed a high-definition TV (the better to catch all that glitter) on six continents. It will be shown simultaneously in 60 countries, including virtually all of the nations whose rises and falls are inextricably bound to the history of gold - from Italy, where the growing city-state of Venice sacked Constantinople during a crusade and ran off with the gold that would finance its new commercial empire, to the United States, which used the discovery of gold in California in 1848 and, later, in the Black Hills of Dakota as leverage to expand an already vast territory. 
 The French novelist Honore de Balzac knew what he was talking about when he wrote, "Behind every great fortune there is a crime." The story of "Gold!" is largely one of crime on a gigantic scale, of conquest fueled by a greed that even Michael Douglas's Gordon Gecko in "Wall Street" might shrink from, of mass murder and destruction and often slavery, all inspired by a lust for gold.
 "Well, say that's half the story," said George Miling-Stanley, the World Gold Council's manager for gold market analysis and chief historical consultant for "Gold!" "It's not all apocalypse."
 "That's usually the way it begins," he added, "as when the Spaniards and later Sir Walter Raleigh plunged into Central and South America in search of El Dorado. God alone knows how many Incas were slaughtered by Pizarro. It must have seemed like the end of the world to Mexicans when Americans and people from all over the world poured into California - or to the Boers when the Britsh Army captured the South African gold mines - or to the Australian Aborigine or the Sioux Indians in the Northwest United States when white prospectors invaded their world.
 "But the simple truth is that without greed to lead the way, civilization would have been very slow to arrive at many of these places. So you might say gold has considerably sped up the process by which civilizations are created, and in many cases it has paid the bill for it."
 Abbe Raven, executive vice president and general manager of the History Channel, said she was horrified when the research for the show started to come together. "I began to see what some people over the centuries had been willing to do for gold," she said, estimating Hitler's stash from the gold supplies of conquered nations and from individual sources, like the teeth of corpses, at over $230 million (about $2.5 billion today).
 "It was reassuring to know," she added, "that at least some of history's criminals paid the price for their brutality."
 And some did not, Mr. Milling-Stanley pointed out. "Jay Gould tried to corner the gold market in 1869," he said. "In doing so, he set off a panic which lives in historical memory as Black Friday. It hurt or ruined hundreds of thousands. Gould's reward was an estimated $11 million in profits, an absolutely staggering sum for the time."
 Where did the idea for an in-depth study of such a broad subject begin? "It sort of evolved out of ideas tossed around in conference," said Ms. Raven.
 "We're always looking for subjects that people know something about, but what they know is the tip of the iceberg. That's how it was with all of us and the subject of gold. Everyone is fascinated with gold, but how many of us really understand what an incredible force it's been in the history of civilization? The more we uncovered, the more fascinating it seemed. It really felt like we were on to something new, and there aren't many subjects like that left."
 Found on every continent except Antarctia, gold has penetrated virtually every culture on the globe, becoming perhaps the most universal symbol of wealth and power for more than 60 centuries (during which, it should be added, the oldest-known gold has scarcely tarnished).
 "The History Channel always looks for what we call the comprehensive subject," said Brian J. Kelly, the executive producer, director and writer of the mini-series. "We like ideas that encompass a wide range of thoughts and personalities. Well, what could possibly take in more than a history of gold? Religion, perhaps? But you might have a hard time getting certain cultures at certain times to even recognize someone else's beliefs as religion. But we haven't yet found any culture that couldn't recognize gold, no matter where it was from."
The first episode of the mini-series, "The Gold Wars," to be shown on Tuesday, explores the roles gold has played in the history of conquest, including the Spanish conquistadors in the New World; the British piracy of Spanish gold and the defeat of the Spanish Armada; the invasion of Sioux Indian land in the West and Custer's defeat at the Little Bighorn; and the British conquest of the world's richest gold fields in South Africa.
 "This s sort of the noisy episode, the one with all the big battles," said Mr. Kelly. "By the time viewers have watched this, we hope to have given them gold fever," Which is the title of the second episode, on Wednesday night, which traces the mad rushes for gold in California, Alaska, Australia and South Africa. "The Stuff Of Dreams," on Thursday, examines the mythology of gold - from the legend of King Midas and the coffin of King Tut (made from more than 240 pounds of gold) to modern-day treasure hunters who seek out ancient tombs and the wrecks of treasure ships for a living. The final episode, "Cold Hard Cash," on Friday, shows the practical effects gold has had on the lives of ordinary people, from economies fueled by the first gold coins used as currency to the roles Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon had in getting the United States off the gold standard for all time.
 "We may be off the gold standard as far as money is concerned," said Mr. Kelly, "but gold will always be with us. In the course of an average day somebody will use the expression 'gold record' or 'gold medal' or 'good as gold' or 'golden years' or whatever. As long as permanence and excellence are valued, the mythology of gold lives on."

HEADLINE: Bush's Gift to America's Extremists 

BYLINE:  By Alan Wolfe; Alan Wolfe is the author, most recently, of "Moral Freedom: The Search for Virtue in a World of Choice."

 BODY:
Those who will lose the most from President Bush's decision to allow limited federal financing for stem cell research are not people who suffer from Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injuries. The twin forces of science and capitalism will undoubtedly unleash their magic, and if a cure is to be found, they are likely to find it -- here or, more likely, abroad.
 The real losers are pro-life moderates and ethical scientists. Both are likely to discover that their efforts to move American politics away from polarizing issues like abortion and capital punishment will be stymied by the president's actions. 
 Before Mr. Bush made his decision, Republicans with impeccable conservative credentials -- including Nancy Reagan and Senators Orrin Hatch and Connie Mack -- urged him to support federal financing. Mrs. Reagan knows something about living with Alzheimer's, a disease that stem cell research may help cure. Mr. Hatch, a Mormon, is a figure of considerable moral stature among conservative Christians. And Mr. Mack, a Catholic opponent of abortion, was moved by his family's terrible experiences with cancer.
On the surface, the president's decision to allow federally financed research to the 60 cell lines or colonies already established would seem to support the views of these conservatives. In fact, it does the exact opposite. The president might have said that already destroyed embryos contain the gift of life for those suffering, through no fault of their own, from nature's illnesses. Such a statement would have put the Republican Party behind a pro-life position that celebrates the human capacity to triumph over adversity and realizes the full potential of every human life.
Instead the president defended his position to limit stem cell research by resorting to a narrow definition of the beginning of life that emphasizes that, "like a snowflake, each of these embryos is unique with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being."
This kind of rhetoric is harmful to Republican efforts to develop a forward-looking pro-life position -- one that is as nuanced as the president's actual decision on stem cells. For one thing, it undermines the case for his own recommendations. If the most important feature of an embryo is the potential life it contains, then it would be as wrong to use already destroyed embryos as it would be to destroy new ones. This, in turn, would render any support for any stem cell research immoral. Indeed, such research, in profiting from the innocent death of a future human being, would be, as one conservative critic of the president put it, little different from taking gold from the teeth of Holocaust victims. More important, the president's equation -- a potential human being's interests are the same as those of a real person fighting a real disease -- leaves scant room for Republican compassion for the ill. 
The president's decision is also not helpful to scientists searching for a middle path between no research and an "anything goes" approach to discovery. At a recent meeting convened by the National Academy of Sciences, for example, Mark Siegler, a bioethicist at the University of Chicago, and Irving L. Weissman, a Stanford biologist who studies stem cells of the bone marrow, were highly critical of the advocates for human cloning invited to address the session.
For many Americans, scientists and non-scientists alike, stem cell research, because it offers the promise of reducing human suffering, is morally justifiable, whereas cloning, which threatens to destroy what is genuinely unique about each human being, is not. But by restricting federal support to research on already existing stem cells, the president's decision will encourage private efforts at cloning research. As any conservative economist can tell the president, private firms are more interested in maximizing their profits than obeying ethical guidelines, and if their search for profit takes them in the direction of cloning, the government will not be there to stop them.
Even ethical scientists will find it difficult to act responsibly under the president's policy. They can now write their grant proposals. But what happens if there are not, as the president said there were, 60 available lines of stem cells or if efforts to produce stem cells from non-embryo sources prove frustrating?
The president might have offered such scientists some reassurance that he would be flexible and help scientists engage in ethically responsible science. Instead he followed up his speech by ruling out any modification in his stem cell policy and suggested that he would veto any legislation that would broaden it. That message seemed designed to tell conservatives that even though they may not have liked his initial decision, they ought to be pleased by his determination to stand by it. 
Under such circumstances, scientists, once they find themselves up against the limits imposed by the president, will face the prospect of having to stop their research, no matter how promising it may seem. Surely, some of them will conclude that the more ethical course would be to continue their work, even if they must turn to more radical methods like creating new embryos through what is called therapeutic cloning. While such cloning is legal in Britain, it would bring scientists to an ethical conundrum that never would have been approached under a more flexible policy. 
From the limited polls that have been taken on this issue, we know that Americans wanted Mr. Bush to advance research with astonishing potential and to reassure them that, in so doing, the United States would not cross some terrible line into unthinkable evil. Instead the president implicitly told them, as they will no doubt explicitly soon discover, that we will tightly restrict research, forcing scientists to turn to an unregulated private sector, while at the same time he fed conservatives the rhetoric that such research is the moral equivalent of fetal farming. 
The president's position, intended to be a compromise, will encourage extremists on all sides. As a result, an issue that was not even at the periphery of people's consciousness a year ago will have been transformed into a culture war that need never have happened.

HEADLINE: The PC? That Old Thing?; 
An Industry's Founding Father Has Better Things to Do

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: COCHRAN, Ga. 

 BODY:
ED Roberts still recalls the day in late 1975 when William H. Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, walked into his office, anxious and depressed. A rail-thin young man with a voice that cracked when he was excited, Mr. Gates had just turned 20. People were stealing his software, he complained, and the prospects for his fledgling company appeared dim.
 "I'm going to quit," Mr. Gates said, according to Mr. Roberts. "There's no way I'll make money on software." 
 To help tide a needed supplier through difficult times, he took Mr. Gates on as a $10-an-hour contract worker. 
Mr. Gates has a different recollection. Sure, software piracy was a serious threat and there were lean times, he said in an e-mail interview last week. But the reason he did hourly contract work for about four months, he said, was to write some special test software to catch defects in the computers made by MITS, the Albuquerque company that Mr. Roberts ran.
In any case, Mr. Gates's fortunes would later improve.
Early this month, Mr. Gates, now the world's wealthiest person, and 300 other alumni of the early personal computer industry gathered for a lavish dinner party in San Jose, Calif., to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the I.B.M. PC. I.B.M.'s entry into the personal computer business in August 1981 was a watershed, a seal of approval by the standard-bearer of corporate computing, pulling the PC into the mainstream.
Newspapers, magazines and television news programs have weighed in recently on the I.B.M. PC's birthday, ranging from memoirs of reporters' first PC's to accounts of the team behind the I.B.M. machine. Rarely mentioned is the acknowledged father of the personal computer -- H. Edward Roberts.
On the evening of the self-congratulatory celebration in Silicon Valley, Mr. Roberts was resting after another long day as a physician in this small town about 115 miles southeast of Atlanta. He is known as "Dr. Roberts" these days.
He may seem a forgotten figure today, but Mr. Roberts was the kingpin of the personal computer industry for a brief, bracing few years in the mid-1970's. He was the president of Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems, or MITS. In early 1975, MITS introduced the Altair, the first inexpensive general-purpose microcomputer. It used Intel's new 8080 microprocessor, which, unlike the logic chips that animated calculators or electronic watches, could be programmed to do all manner of tasks.
THE Altair was a real computer, almost as if a room-size mainframe had been shrunk down to the size of a breadbox. That is what Mr. Gates, then at Harvard, and his friend Paul G. Allen, who was working for Honeywell in Boston, grasped instantly when they saw the MITS Altair on the cover of the January 1975 Popular Electronics. They plunged into writing a version of the Basic programming language that could run on the small machine.
For a couple of years, MITS was the dominant company in an industry that was just taking shape. Its starring role was short-lived, as Mr. Roberts sold MITS in 1977 amid a legal dispute with Microsoft that left him embittered for years. But during its brief run as the leader, MITS pioneered innovations and set the pattern that the personal computer industry still follows. 
The MITS-Microsoft partnership established software as a separate business in personal computing. Its pricing policies also made software piracy irresistible to many. MITS created "open" hardware standards enabling independent component suppliers to sell add-on equipment, and opening the door to producers of clone machines -- just as I.B.M. did with its PC in 1981. 
MITS began the phenomenon of computer magazines for users, starting with a newsletter called Computer Notes. Its grandly named First World Altair Computer Conference in 1976 in Albuquerque was the forerunner of today's computer conventions. 
It opened its own stores and promoted the formation of local computer clubs, traveling from town to town in the MITSmobile, a blue, slightly refurbished mobile home. Mr. Gates drove the MITSmobile, among other duties.
"All the roots of the industry started with MITS," said David Bunnell, a former MITS employee.
Mr. Bunnell, who headed a chapter of the radical Students for a Democratic Society at the University of Nebraska before eventually finding his way to Albuquerque and MITS, recalled that working for MITS was about more than money -- especially at the $110 a week he was paid. There was a whiff of the revolutionary economic and social change that might occur if the power of computing was put into everyone's hands.
"It really felt like being at the center of the universe," recalled Mr. Bunnell, who went on to found some of the most successful computer magazines, including PC Magazine, PC World and Macworld.
The contribution of Ed Roberts -- like that of all innovators, especially in computing -- was to take what proved to be an important step that built on decades of work that preceded him. Ever since general-purpose computers appeared immediately after World War II, there was a continuing effort in universities and research centers to try to make them more personal, in the sense of being easier to use and more widely accessible beyond the computing priesthood of experts.
Indeed, the Basic language that Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen squeezed down to run on the Altair was developed in 1964 by two Dartmouth professors, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz, to let liberal arts students try their hand at programming. The two professors were motivated by the belief that computing was becoming so important to the economy and society that educated people should understand the technology, and they devised Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, or Basic, to run on a time-shared computer at Dartmouth; students could tap into it from Teletype terminals. Throughout the 1960's and early 1970's, time-sharing was the way that most people gained access to computing.
Still, there was a big difference between giving people access to computing time and giving them their own machines. Others, like Intel, made the technological building blocks, but MITS put them together for the first time in an affordable machine. The basic Altair 8800 was priced at $397. To make it do anything useful or entertaining, most users bought extra memory boards and other add-ons that might double the price or more, but it was an extraordinary product for its time.
Over the years, people have credited others with inventing the personal computer, including the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, Digital Equipment, Apple Computer and I.B.M. But Paul E. Ceruzzi, a technology historian at the Smithsonian Institution, wrote in "A History of Modern Computing" (MIT Press, 1998) that "H. Edward Roberts, the Altair's designer, deserves credit as the inventor of the personal computer." He added that the "utter improbability and unpredictability" of having one of the 20th century's most significant inventions spring to life at a little electronics shop in Albuquerque had prompted many people to search for other sources.
"But Albuquerque it was," Mr. Ceruzzi wrote, "for it was only at MITS that the technical and social components of personal computing converged."
SITTING in his office here in Georgia, where an Altair 8800 rests on a corner shelf, Mr. Roberts regards his role in the personal computer revolution with a certain bemused distance. "Let's not kid anybody," he said. "We were there at the right time, when things fell into place and we were there to put them together."
Mr. Roberts is blunt, even pointed, when discussing the MITS days. At 59, he is 14 years older than Mr. Gates and tends to regard the Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen of those days almost as a teacher may view a couple of students. Mr. Allen, the MITS director of software as well as co-founder of Microsoft, was the older, more mature of the two; Mr. Gates, never a full-time MITS employee, was brilliant but disruptive.
Mr. Gates, Mr. Roberts recalled, was "a very bright kid, but he was a constant headache at MITS."
"You couldn't reason with him," he added. "He did things his way or not at all."
Yet colleagues from the MITS days also recall that Mr. Roberts, a former Air Force officer, had a dogmatic streak as well. Physically imposing -- heavy-set and 6-foot-4 -- and at times authoritarian, he often intimidated people, but not Mr. Gates. "Unlike the rest of us, Bill never backed down from Ed Roberts face to face," Mr. Bunnell said. "It was kind of funny really, this little skinny kid standing up to Ed. When they disagreed, sparks flew."
Despite the past confrontations, Mr. Roberts clearly admires what Mr. Gates has built at Microsoft. "Don't get me wrong," he said, "I'm very impressed with his accomplishments." But what Mr. Roberts finds irritating is what he regards as the historical revisionism surrounding Microsoft and Mr. Gates. "The notion that he envisioned all this from the beginning -- I just have to laugh," Mr. Roberts said. "I was there."
BY 1977, MITS was suddenly facing fierce competition from a host of start-ups making microcomputers, some of which were Altair clones. Mr. Roberts sold MITS to Pertec, whose main business was making disk and tape drives for mainframes and minicomputers; it never did make a dent in the personal computer business. The purchase price was about $6 million, and Mr. Roberts, the largest MITS shareholder, walked away a millionaire a few months later. 
He agreed not to design microcomputers for five years -- an eternity in computing, but a condition that Mr. Roberts, weary from years of entrepreneurial struggle, accepted. "When I left Albuquerque, I figured the only decision I wanted to make was whether to turn left or right at the end of the road," he recalled. "That lasted about 10 seconds."
At first, Mr. Roberts put his energies into farming. He bought 1,000 acres of farmland in southern Georgia, not far from where some relatives lived. He raised cattle, hogs, corn and soybeans. After a few years, Mr. Roberts switched course and decided to revive a high-school dream of becoming a physician, earning his medical degree in 1986 from Mercer University in Macon, 35 miles northwest of Cochran.
Oddly, it was his youthful interest in medicine that sidetracked him into computing. He grew up in Miami, where his father ran a household appliance repair service. Mr. Roberts said he was not an outstanding student, but scored well on a test that gained him entry into a program at the University of Miami for promising students. He worked with doctors who were doing experimental heart surgery, and he built a basic relay computer for a heart-lung machine. 
"We used a lot of electronics, and that's how I got into it," Mr. Roberts recalled.
Like so many scientists, physicists and mathematicians who fell into computing in the 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Roberts found the computer tools compelling and abandoned his intended field. He went to Oklahoma State University and graduated with a major in electrical engineering. In the mid-1960's, Oklahoma State was one of the few universities that gave undergraduates direct access to the school's mainframe computer, instead of making them submit programs to white-coated operators who were the only ones authorized to touch the precious machines.
The open policy at Oklahoma State, Mr. Roberts recalled, was "really a bold idea at the time." He programmed engineering problems in Fortran on an I.B.M. 1620, and the power of computing "opened up a whole new world," he said. "And I began thinking, 'What if you gave everyone a computer?' "
It would be years before microprocessor technology made that goal attainable. But Mr. Roberts said his vision at MITS, beyond survival, was always that "if you give bright people computers, some amazing things are going to happen."
"It proved to be true," he said.
When Mr. Roberts sketched out his design for the Altair in the summer of 1974, MITS owed about $300,000 to its creditors, having been battered by the boom-and-bust cycle in the electronic calculator business. When he took his personal computer idea to his bankers, they were skeptical but advanced him $65,000 more. Their reasoning was that if MITS could sell 200 Altairs, the bank could recoup some of its original loan. After it went on sale in 1975, orders for thousands streamed in.
Mr. Roberts wanted the Altair to be expandable, so more memory and other hardware could be added. To make that possible, he and a colleague, William Yates, designed the machine's "bus" -- which acts almost as a highway system, with 100 separate channels, or paths, for data to travel. The Altair bus, later known as the S100, became the industry standard, allowing others to add innovations but also opening the door to competitors.
"The Altair really had an open architecture, and in that way it set the stage for the I.B.M. PC," said Paul Freiberger, a consultant at McKinsey & Company and co-author with Michael Swaine of "Fire in the Valley" (McGraw-Hill, 1984), which chronicled the PC's early days.
With the wisdom of hindsight, the business mistake Mr. Roberts may have made was to try to navigate in a brand new industry with a strategy of control that seemed borrowed from the old mainframe days. Such tactics, some former colleagues and industry observers say, included trying to have stores sell Altairs exclusively and trying to curb Microsoft's freedom to sell its version of Basic to other computer companies. "Ed Roberts couldn't control the field, a field that was just beginning," Mr. Freiberger said.
In 1977, Microsoft won an arbitration case in a contract dispute with MITS and Pertec about the sales and ownership of the Gates-Allen version of Basic -- a judicial error, Mr. Roberts says, while Mr. Gates says it was foolish for Pertec and MITS to pursue the case in the first place. It had the effect of breaking all ties between Microsoft and MITS. Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen left for suburban Seattle, while Mr. Roberts soon departed for Georgia.
IN Cochran, where he has been a physician since 1989, Mr. Roberts appears to have a flourishing general practice, which supports 10 employees. His clinic has a modern laboratory. He has written specialized software for some of his clinical test equipment. Each of the several offices has a computer, all of them linked by a network that Mr. Roberts installed. He is a good customer for Microsoft's products. "I do use the Netscape browser, though," he noted.
Mr. Roberts expresses no regret about his decision to walk away from the industry he helped create. "I think I'm making a fairly substantial contribution here," he said. "Maybe not to the wider world, but I think what I do now is important."
As for Mr. Gates, Mr. Roberts said they met once a decade ago, at the wedding of a former MITS employee. "And I had a nice long conversation with Bill," he said.
Mr. Gates recalled the wedding. "I made a special effort to spend time with Ed and let him know how important his work had been," he said. "Ed made an incredibly significant contribution to the industry and got the whole thing started."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your condemnation of authoritarianism in Central Asia (editorial, Aug. 16) merits another qualifier: the Karimov regime in Uzbekistan also tortures "thousands of religious Muslims" and citizens who express political opposition to the government. The United States should make it clear to these Central Asian states that they will not receive our aid in the name of preventing Taliban-style fundamentalism if the price is the blood of their nonconformist citizens. 
 Many Central Asians with whom I've worked say that the political climate is worse than the postwar Soviet period. Add economic incompetence and ordinary corruption to severe political repression, and you have a formula for regional instability.

Despite the free minutes, low rates and other sale pitches, quality of service remains an issue for wireless customers.

BYLINE:  By Susan Stellin 

 BODY:
OPEN just about any publication these days and there are likely to be advertisements for wireless phone service, promising hundreds, if not thousands, of monthly minutes, equipment rebates, free long distance and advanced digital services like Web access or the ability to send and receive e-mail messages.
 With the number of wireless subscribers in the United States hovering at about 40 percent of the population, and 25 percent of those users switching providers every year, wireless companies are scrambling to entice more consumers to sign up for a cell phone or jump ship from a competing provider in exchange for a better deal. 
 But noticeably absent from these pitches are appeals to basic quality-of-service issues that most wireless users deal with daily. The common complaints are poor sound quality, inadequate coverage, dropped calls and confusing billing practices -- not to mention the growing tendency of customer service representatives to give callers the address of the company's Web site rather than an answer. 
Wireless service providers point to surveys indicating that consumers primarily choose a cell phone plan based on price and coverage, and they note that prices have gone down as coverage has improved. 
In its most recent annual survey of wireless users, released earlier this year, the Yankee Group, a research firm, found that 62 percent of the respondents cited price as a factor that would keep them from switching to another carrier, while 43 percent cited improved coverage. 
And the average price per minute for cellular service has certainly dropped, to 21 cents a minute last year from 54 cents in 1996, according to the Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm. 
Even so, customer satisfaction may be a criterion lurking in the wings. The Yankee Group survey found that, on average, customers say they are only "somewhat satisfied" with their wireless carriers and rate the carriers' overall performance in the "neutral" range, about 3.8 on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). 
Moreover, subscriber perceptions changed from the Yankee Group's survey in 1999 to the one in 2000. Perceptions of carrier performance deteriorated in three of five categories: voice and sound quality, customer service and feature offerings. In the other two categories, coverage and value for the money, ratings remained the same. 
Wireless users "are not absolutely dissatisfied," said Knox Bricken, a Yankee Group analyst, adding, "There's just a lot of room for improvement." 
Whether market forces or regulators are going to improve the situation remains to be seen. Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat whose Congressional district straddles Brooklyn and Queens, says the government should step in. In April, he introduced the Cell Phone Service Disclosure Act, which seeks to improve service quality through more oversight. 
The bill would require the Federal Communications Commission to monitor cell phone service on factors like dead spots, dropped calls, busy signals and improper billing. It would also require the agency to collect and publicly report cell phone complaint statistics. 
"At the very least, Congress and the F.C.C. should demand better service -- or at least better disclosure," Mr. Weiner said. "This is a unique utility in that it's entirely unregulated. There's not even anyone to complain to about your bad cell phone service." 
While Mr. Weiner argues that the F.C.C. should take a more active role in monitoring wireless service quality, as it does with traditional phone service, the agency is in no rush to step forward. An F.C.C. spokeswoman said it was the agency's policy not to comment on pending legislation. But David Furth, a senior legal adviser in the agency's wireless bureau, did discuss some of the differences in regulating wireless and land-line phone service. 
"It's very different because the whole legacy of monitoring the wire-line system comes out of the old Bell monopoly days," Mr. Furth said, noting that the nation's wireless customers generally have a choice of several carriers, which is "not the case, or less the case, on the wire-line side." 
In general, he said, the F.C.C. refrains from "over-regulation" of service quality. And with wireless service in particular, there are practical challenges, he said, including how to monitor multiple systems that use different technical standards. 
Even so, the F.C.C. is interested in gathering more and better information about these issues, Mr. Furth said. "That's the only way," he added, to figure out if there is a service quality issue that the market isn't dealing with." 
And the carriers themselves are quick to say that they are addressing service quality concerns. Lillian Hessel, a vice president for marketing at AT&T Wireless, said the company expected capital spending to total $5 billion in 2001. Eighty percent of that will be spent on improving the capacity and quality of its existing network, she said. 
Ms. Hessel also said that the company had a policy that lets customers change their calling plans at any time to reflect their use patterns. Such flexibility, she said, "has really been the predominant underlying satisfier that our customers have told us they wanted." 
Jennifer Walsh, a spokeswoman for Sprint PCS, said it would spend $1.5 billion this year to expand its network capacity and fill in coverage areas. "We add 250 and 300 cell sites every month for fill-in capacity and expansion," she said. Ms. Walsh also noted that customer satisfaction had been improving by the company's internal benchmarks, including a downturn in the number of customers who cancel their service, though she declined to provide specific figures.
For its part, Verizon Wireless announced plans this year to increase its customer service staff 6 percent, as part of a three-year, $100 million plan to improve its call center. And in a speech at the Supercomm communications conference in June, Dennis F. Strigl, chief executive of Verizon Wireless, called on the industry to focus on "the basics of the business," including network congestion, price plan confusion, bad roaming experiences and long waits for customer service. 
Otherwise, Mr. Strigl warned, "the wireless industry could find itself in the cross hairs of regulators who want to regulate our service levels."
Representative Weiner, meanwhile, is counting on customer frustration at all levels to spur his legislative effort. 
"All of the captains of industry and leaders of Congress are walking around cursing their cell phones, just like the rest of us," Mr. Weiner said. "Which is why I think sooner or later this issue is going to burst."

HEADLINE: Bluetooth Wireless Stumbles at the Starting Gate 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
Lounging in bed on a recent Saturday morning, David Bolan, an executive with a Silicon Valley startup, lifted his thumb from the remote control and caught his first glimpse of his livelihood on the screen.
 There, a reseller was hawking 6,000 I.B.M. notebook computers left over from a crashed-and-burned company. The flameout must have been recent; the machines featured a new wireless technology called Bluetooth, for which Mr. Bolan's company, Pico Communications of Cupertino, Calif., designed networking products. Although the program conveyed a grim message about the high-technology meltdown, Mr. Bolan was thrilled when the announcer proclaimed Bluetooth the coming wave of unplugged communications. 
 "This is awesome," Mr. Bolan, vice president for business development at Pico, recalled thinking. "The consumer is finally starting to be educated about Bluetooth." 
Last year was supposed to be the breakout year for Bluetooth technology, which carries information on radio waves among mobile phones, personal computers and other devices equipped with a Bluetooth chip. A fleet of products -- from cordless phone headsets to PC adapter kits -- were to have begun their cascade into the American market.
The vision was alluring: cell phones and computers could synchronize their contact lists as soon as they were within 30 feet, hand-held computers could send documents through the air to a nearby printer, and laptops could surf the Web using a phone's cellular network. In several years, supporters argued, every electronic device or appliance -- from computers to microwave ovens -- would use a Bluetooth chip to talk automatically with other devices.
Bluetooth supporters said chips would soon cost less than $5 and run on little power, allowing device makers to build the chips into each cell phone or hand-held device without worrying about battery drain. Encouraged by some of the world's largest electronics manufacturers, analysts estimated that nearly 1.5 billion Bluetooth-ready devices would be sold by 2005, creating vast communications networks between devices and appliances.
But the cascade turned out to be a trickle -- Bluetooth was still not ready for mass production. Chip costs remained high, and devices sometimes refused to talk to each other. A handful of products began appearing on the market last September, but in small numbers and at high prices. These were normal growing pains for a young technology, but two years of boasting brought publicity to its troubles.
Industry leaders say that with a new set of technical specifications and a more stable platform, Bluetooth is finally ready to pick up speed later this year, and take off in 2002. Motorola, Ericsson, 3Com, Compaq, Toshiba and others have early Bluetooth products, including phone and PC adapters, on the market, with plans to increase distribution later this year, and Palm will offer a Bluetooth expansion card for its m500 series of hand-helds units by the end of the year.
"We are going to drive it to become ubiquitous," said Michael Mace, chief competitive officer and vice president for product planning for Palm, which wants to enable its devices to communicate wirelessly with PC's, phones and other machines. 
But while engineers fine-tune Bluetooth and major manufacturers declare its rise is imminent, troubles have emerged. First, with the souring of the economy, corporations -- usually the first to adopt new technologies -- have cut budgets. Second, sales of handhelds and cellular phones, expected to be market drivers for Bluetooth, have plunged. And last, another wireless technology, originally expected to complement Bluetooth, came in and stole much of its thunder.
The other wireless networking standard, called IEEE 802.11b, or Wi-Fi, has picked up strong momentum among information technology managers and technology savvy consumers. Wi-Fi networks allow computer users to connect to the Internet wirelessly from Starbucks coffee bars, as well as from some shops, airport and hotel lounges and corporate offices and college campuses.
Supporters of both technologies say there is room for both in the marketplace. But if Wi-Fi succeeds in adopting Bluetooth's most attractive attributes -- low power consumption and cost -- it could be used in a wide range of small devices, which could then use the Internet to communicate with each other. This script, some observers predict, could render Bluetooth a well-planned, heavily financed failure.
The development of Bluetooth goes back to 1994, when researchers in Ericsson's labs began work on a way to make hands-free cell phone calls without using cables. They found their solution in radio waves. Unlike infrared, which enlivens television remote controls and allows users of hand-held computers to beam their business cards to one another, radio waves can travel through walls and in many directions at once, up to about 30 feet. They used little power -- a crucial feature for devices that run on batteries. And, at least in theory, the radio chips could be made small and inexpensive, so they could be built into every phone.
In 1998, Ericsson assembled a special-interest group to begin developing this technology for the general market. The first members were the cell phone maker Nokia, the computer manufacturers I.B.M. and Toshiba, and the chip maker Intel. Jim Kardach, an Intel technician and amateur historian, dubbed the wireless standard "Bluetooth," after Harald Bluetooth, a Scandinavian king who unified Denmark and Norway in the 10th century. The imagery was simple: the technology would bring together devices just like King Bluetooth linked the two countries.
Joined by other technology leaders like Microsoft, Compaq Computer and Lucent Technologies, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group -- which now numbers 2,500 companies -- began suggesting that Bluetooth was the wireless technology that futurists awaited. In the beginning, they envisioned Bluetooth replacing cables to carry information not just within, but between devices, creating so-called personal-area networks unencumbered by wires. 
In this Bluetooth-enabled future, proponents say, travelers will walk into airports and be instantly recognized by their devices. The airline's computer system will send, via radio waves, the passenger's boarding pass, departure gate and flight status directly to the handheld or cell phone. On the road, a car with a broken fan belt can diagnose its troubles and contact a repairman through the network.
"We're banking on the consumer marketplace to win with Bluetooth," said Francis Dance, telematics services project manager for BMW of North America.
For that to happen, Bluetooth chips need others to talk with. But the price of chip sets has not declined nearly as fast as expected. Mr. Mace, the Palm executive, said his company will begin placing a Bluetooth chip set inside every handheld when chip sets costs less than $10, about half their price today. In the meantime, Palm and other manufacturers are relying on kits that add Bluetooth to existing devices. The kits can cost $200 per device, an expensive price to eliminate cables.
As Bluetooth struggles toward widespread release, Wi-Fi has enjoyed a surprising emergence into the mainstream. Wi-Fi is a wireless local area network; instead of linking devices through an ad hoc connection of radio waves like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connects devices directly to an established Internet network. While Bluetooth sends and receives information at speeds similar to a dial-up modem, Wi-Fi is closer to a high-speed cable modem or digital subscriber line. Wi-Fi also has a much wider range, up to 300 feet, compared to 30 feet for Bluetooth. 
The tradeoff for the faster transmission rates is that Wi-Fi uses much more power than Bluetooth. The largest manufacturers support both technologies, envisioning a market in which Bluetooth connects small, battery-powered devices like phones and handhelds, while Wi-Fi connects laptops to the Internet. Compaq and other companies have designed modules that contain both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, allowing notebook users to construct their network based on their needs. "This isn't Betamax versus VHS, where one of them is going to win and one's going to lose," said Steven Andler, vice president of marketing in the computer systems group of Toshiba America Information Systems.
Many industry observers, however, believe that Wi-Fi could cut the legs out from under Bluetooth before it can reach critical mass. In last week's edition of Fortune, J. William Gurley, a general partner in the Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark Capital, composed an obituary for Bluetooth, titled "Bye-bye, Bluetooth." As the first in the market, Mr. Gurley wrote, Wi-Fi can drive down costs as shipments increase, putting Bluetooth on the defensive as it tries to grow. "Bluetooth will fail to be relevant," Mr. Gurley predicted.
Microsoft, a backer of both technologies, dealt a blow to Bluetooth's image in April when it said its new desktop operating system, Windows XP, would initially support Wi-Fi, but not Bluetooth. Microsoft said it would wait to include software support until it saw production-ready Bluetooth products.
That tack was echoed elsewhere. "The last thing we want to do is take a new technology to market before it's mature, and get a huge black eye," said Randy Roberts, director of digital convergence for Nokia, which has released only one Bluetooth product, in Europe.
Richard S. Siber, a partner in the communications and high-tech electronics division of the consulting firm Accenture, says that both technologies will gain in popularity and thrive, each carving out a different portion of the wireless market. 
If the two do co-exist, though, engineers must learn to solve interference problems. Both technologies use the 2.45-gigahertz band of the unlicensed spectrum. Users of the unlicensed spectrum do not have to pay telecommunications carriers for air time, but the airwaves can get crowded quickly. If transmitters are positioned too close together, Bluetooth radio waves sometimes disrupt Wi-Fi connections. Future generations of Wi-Fi and similar high-speed wireless technologies will probably move up to 5 gigahertz, which could ease some of the crowding.
Bluetooth supporters will try to gain a foothold in handheld devices and cell phones before Wi-Fi's engineers can ratchet down the power and chip price. They also hope to ride the wave of new high-speed cellular networks, known as 2.5G and 3G, expected to begin service in the United States in the next year.
With new products about to start flooding the market, industry executives say 2002 will be the year that makes or breaks Bluetooth.
"We've been accused of hyping the technology," said R. E. Bryan, global area manager of Ericsson's technology-licensing division. "I say, I don't apologize. Yeah, we're about a year late, but I think all the potential of Bluetooth is still there, and it will come."

 WPP Is Said to Be Near A Rival Offer for Tempus
WPP Group, the British advertising firm, plans to make a formal offer for Tempus, the media-buying agency, that values the company at about $636 million, people close to the talks said. The bid is an attempt to trump a rival offer from Havas Advertising of France.
WPP is expected to file its offer with British regulators today, although it does not have the support of the Tempus board, a condition that WPP had sought. Instead, Tempus will withdraw its support for the Havas offer and remain neutral during the bidding. Page C2.

HEADLINE: Homeownership That's Too Important to Risk 

BYLINE:  By Charles W. Calomiris and Robert E. Litan; Charles Calomiris is a professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School. Robert E. Litan is director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.

 BODY:
One of the lesser known economic successes of the past decade has been a significant improvement in giving low-income people access to the credit they need to buy homes. In 1998, 13 percent of all new mortgages were so-called subprime loans -- made to borrowers who lack established credit histories, as many poor people do -- compared with 5 percent in 1994.
 Subprime loans carry higher interest than is charged to most borrowers, who are in the "prime" category, but this is because subprime borrowers are more likely than others to default. Lenders charge rates and fees consistent with the risks. If banks, in particular, did not do this, regulators worried about their safety and soundness would crack down on them. 
 There is a dark side to subprime lending, however: loans that have been labeled predatory. The term is applied most often to loans made to uninformed, low-income, elderly and minority borrowers who are pressured to sign new mortgages or refinance their current ones on onerous terms.
In loan "flipping," for example, homeowners are tricked into complex refinancing even when it is disadvantageous to them. In "equity stripping," they end up paying high fees that substantially erode their equity in their homes. In the worst cases, these practices end in borrowers' losing their homes.
The Senate Banking Committee has been holding hearings on predatory lending and considering whether to introduce a bill to halt it. Such a bill would probably put limits on prepayment penalties, refinancing fees and credit life insurance premiums. Clearly, lenders cannot be allowed to engage in practices that amount to fraud or that prey on Americans least equipped to defend themselves. Yet what many policy makers may not realize is that federal officials already have ample legal authority to stop predatory lending. They haven't done enough with it in the past, but that is changing, and it could change more.
The Federal Trade Commission has the authority to stop deceptive trade practices, and it is now using that power to investigate whether Citigroup tricked borrowers into paying high costs on subprime loans. The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to regulate subprime lending practices and is in the process of adopting new rules that would help prevent flipping and equity stripping.
New laws on the pattern of some already passed at the state and local level could do great harm by discouraging lenders from making any subprime loans at all. Laws that effectively limit fees and interest in mortgage contracts are tantamount to usury ceilings, which have generally been eliminated for a good reason: They force lenders to ration credit and thus deny funds to some borrowers. 
In North Carolina, the Legislature enacted a statute in 1999 that punishes flipping and imposes new regulatory burdens and risks on high-cost lending. Since then, subprime mortgage lending by finance companies in the state to borrowers with incomes below $25,000 has dropped by nearly 50 percent. For those with incomes between $25,000 and $50,000, the drop has been one-third.
There are sensible ways to reduce predatory lending. The Federal Reserve Board could require lenders to inform borrowers fully about prepayment penalties -- both by telling them personally and through easily understood documents. The Fed can adopt rules to curb loan flipping, though if it does so, it should make clear to lenders what type of refinancings are permissible -- those that substantially reduce the borrower's monthly payment, for example. New government-financed counseling programs for borrowers are also a good idea. And the Fed, the F.T.C. and the Department of Housing and Urban Development should send testers, masquerading as subprime loan applicants, to make sure lenders aren't engaging in predatory practices.
This is the sort of regulation that can stop predatory lending without taking back any of the new access to home ownership that millions of Americans have gained through subprime loans.

HEADLINE: Making Way for Pentagon Reform 

 BODY:
Trying to reform the Pentagon can break the spirit of the strongest defense secretary. The resistance of hidebound military commanders and pork-addicted Congressional leaders is difficult to overcome, as Donald Rumsfeld is finding. Unfortunately, he has made the job even harder by mishandling some of his first initiatives and has sounded as if he may be losing his nerve about cutting unneeded weapons programs. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld took office in January as a convinced reformer who had learned about the Pentagon's inefficiencies during his first tour as defense secretary, in the mid-1970's. He understood that the spending required to ready America's armed services for 21st-century needs and technologies would have to be financed by doing away with obsolete cold-war doctrines and weapons programs. But he has stumbled in the early innings by misplaying relations with Congress. He needs to mend his ties with Capitol Hill in the months ahead when military reform is likely to face its most crucial budget tests. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld's conception of a reshaped American military is becoming clearer as the Pentagon reviews he commissioned earlier this year near completion. He rightly wants to do away with the notion that the Pentagon must be ready to fight two major regional wars at once. Mr. Rumsfeld prefers a more flexible approach that should allow for reductions in overall troop strength. 
To carry out this new strategy, the review panels are expected to recommend a variety of smart steps, including lighter tanks and artillery for the Army, unmanned flying drones for the Air Force and smaller combat ships for the Navy. The details will become clearer late next month, when the Pentagon is due to present the comprehensive review of military programs and strategy required by Congress every four years. Those findings will become the basis for the 2003 military budget, the first to be fully shaped by the Bush administration. 
Creating a more effective, flexible and cost-efficient military will require substantial spending shifts. President Bush's extravagant tax cut has left the Pentagon with little money for expensive new weapons systems. What little there is will likely be used to pay for the administration's ill-conceived and hasty effort to build a missile shield. Just sustaining present defense spending into 2003 would cost nearly $350 billion a year. Significant increases above that level are simply not affordable. 
Mr. Rumsfeld will have to unsparingly eliminate programs. The Navy and Air Force do not need to develop three different new tactical fighters. The Army should not be spending precious dollars on the expensive new Crusader artillery system, which is too heavy to serve a more mobile ground force. The Pentagon needs to carry out a new round of base closings, eliminating up to 25 percent of existing installations. 
To win Congressional backing for these steps, Mr. Rumsfeld will have to consult more closely with lawmakers. Congress recently rebuffed Mr. Rumsfeld's bid to retire a third of the B-1 bomber fleet and has reacted coolly to his request to establish a new base-closing commission. Better advance work would have assured a warmer welcome for both worthy proposals. 
Despite Congress's inherent affection for military programs that generate economic activity in home districts, many senators and representatives from both parties recognize that military reform is necessary to assure American security in the 21st century. Mr. Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney, a former secretary of defense, must do a better job of working with them.

HEADLINE: WORLD'S ECONOMY SLOWS TO A WALK IN RARE LOCK STEP 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN with EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19 

 BODY:
The world economy, which grew at a raging pace just last year, has slowed to a crawl as the United States, Europe, Japan and some major developing countries undergo a rare simultaneous slump.
 The latest economic statistics from around the globe show that many regional economic powers -- Italy and Germany, Mexico and Brazil, Japan and Singapore -- have become economically stagnant, defying expectations that growth in other countries would help compensate for the slowdown in the United States. 
 The $33 trillion world economy is still likely to expand this year, as it has every year since the Great Depression. Of the top economies, only Japan's total output seems likely to shrink, and even bearish forecasters expect the world to grow at about a 2 percent rate, a bit faster than during international slumps in 1982 and 1991.
Still, many experts say the world is experiencing economic whiplash, with growth rates retreating more quickly and in more of the leading economies than at any time since the oil shock of 1973. And this time there is no single factor to account for the widespread weakness, persuading some economists that recovery may be slow in coming. 
"We have gone from boom to bust faster than anytime since the oil shock," said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist of Morgan Stanley, a New York investment bank. "When you screech to a halt like that, it feels like getting thrown through the windshield."
The biggest surprise is the sluggish performance in Europe, especially Germany, where leaders had until recently thought that they could escape the American slowdown.
Germany's economy, Europe's largest, came to a standstill in the second quarter of this year. Italy and the Netherlands are showing practically no growth. And France's relatively frothy economy has slowed sharply as both consumers and businesses have cut back spending.
One result is that Europe, with a combined economy about as big as that of the United States, is in no position to take over as the locomotive of world economic growth.
"On balance, I'd say that the likelihood of continued difficulties here and abroad is higher than the prevailing view of most economists," said Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary who is now chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup.
The Bush administration still puts a relatively bright gloss on the picture. Administration officials say the combination of tax rebates, a sharp drop in interest rates and minimal inflation should provide a powerful stimulus to consumer spending and business investment that will help the American economy turn around later this year or early next year.
In its latest forecast to be issued formally this week, the White House sharply reduced its estimates of domestic growth this year to 1.7 percent from the previous estimate of 2.4 percent; those levels are well below the growth rates of recent years. 
But the White House expects a sizable swing next year, forecasting growth of 3.2 percent then. That suggests that America could serve as the growth engine for the rest of the world as it was through much of the 1990's. 
R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House council of economic advisers, said the slowdown among America's peers was worrying. But he also said that the reasons for weakness were idiosyncratic, varying from place to place, and that there was no reason to expect that international problems would drag the United States or Europe into recession.
"It might feel like a recession in some places," he said, "but I don't see an outright recession here or in Europe."
Not long ago the United States hoped to have more help. European policy makers confidently predicted last spring that the region would grow at about its long-term potential rate of 2.5 percent. They also acted as if they were certain that their new common currency and the growing economic integration of Europe made the region more independent and less vulnerable to outside economic turbulence.
But as events unfolded, they were blind-sided by problems right at home. Domestic demand for consumer goods and industrial machinery around the region is so tepid that it offers no source of growth at all. European companies seem convinced that the real future growth markets are not at home but in the United States, Asia and Central Europe, so domestic investment has lagged. Many forecasters now predict that growth will be less than 2 percent this year, not much better than the United States.
What is striking about Europe's slowdown is that so much of it is linked to domestic weakness, what Daniel Gros of the Center for European Policy Studies describes as long-term "speed limits" on European growth. Exports are actually slightly ahead of last year, which was one of spectacular growth. Yet consumers at home are clutching their pocketbooks. BMW's worldwide sales, for instance, were up 9.7 percent in the first half of this year, but up only 1.1 percent in Germany. 
Higher energy and food prices are one big problem for the region. Partly because of a perceived inflation threat, the European Central Bank has resisted intense political pressure to cut interest rates, though it may do so this fall. Relatively high interest rates have put the brakes on regional economies.
But Thomas Mayer, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, said price shocks were only part of Europe's woes. He also faults the unwillingness of political leaders to liberalize the labor markets and give employers more freedom in hiring and firing. France and Germany have taken steps to bolster the power of unions and make it more difficult for companies to lay off workers.
"That is the sort of thing we should especially try to avoid right now," Mr. Mayer said.
Closer to home, Mexico has been in recession since April, with its economy shrinking for the third straight quarter. Brazil, the largest Latin American economy, has suffered soaring interest rates and a persistent energy crisis. It is now teetering on the brink of contraction, official estimates show.
The situation in Asia looks no better. Singapore, one of the region's most advanced and open economies, has tumbled into a severe recession that some economists say is the worst the island nation has suffered in at least 15 years. Japan once again slipped into recession territory as its government battles stubborn deflation. Nearly every other major economy in the region, with the notable exception of China's, has seen growth plunge despite months of interest rate cuts.
While many economists do believe that this downturn is cyclical, there are at least two schools of thought that suggest that a more problematic and longer-lasting slump is under way.
The first is the worry that widespread malaise is the flip side of the record-setting United States-led expansion of the 1990's. Greater world integration in trade, finance and technology fueled the expansion. But increased interdependence -- trade now accounts for about a quarter of world output, double its share 25 years ago -- means that much of the world can move down in tandem, just as it moved up in tandem, some economists say.
"This is the first recession in the modern era of globalization," said Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley. A rapid increase in trade was a primary factor in the 1990's expansion. But with both imports and exports slumping in the United States, the world's largest consumer, the pain of the downturn is widely shared among the nation's trading partners.
Most of the top industrial economies have similar woes, due mainly to the collapse of the boom in technology spending in both the United States and Europe. That collapse has hurt corporate profits and investment returns. And without steady earnings from foreign subsidiaries, it may take companies considerably longer to overcome the slump.
"The bubble we had in this country was really a global bubble," Mr. Roach said. "Now it has popped."
Mr. Rubin of Citigroup agrees that economic interdependence might have greased the spread of the American downturn. But he said the world would be better off if countries, especially in Europe, had done more to integrate their economies.
He said the combined weakness of most of the biggest economies presented a challenge to policy makers. The United States and other leading nations need to energetically defend free trade, fiscal discipline and the spread of technology, or they risk a backlash that could cloud prospects.
"This is a very complex period in which the U.S. even more than usual must exercise leadership," he said. "Without that, we may not have a continuation of these forces of changes, and that would have a lasting adverse impact." 
Another prevalent concern, popular among conservative commentators, is that policy mistakes have caused investors to lose faith in many individual currencies, undermining confidence broadly. This is particularly true in emerging markets like Turkey and Brazil.
But these economists also take central bankers to task, saying the dollar has been too strong, and the euro and yen too weak.
David Malpass, formerly an economic official in the back-to-back Reagan and Bush administrations and now a managing director with Bear Stearns in New York, said weak currencies and falling commodity prices worldwide were a threat to growth that central bankers have failed to counter.
Consumer prices are falling in Japan and now in some other economies like Hong Kong. In the United States and Europe, prices are rising modestly, but corporate profits and equity values have sagged, hurting business and consumer sentiment, Mr. Malpass says. 
Deflation shows up most clearly, Mr. Malpass said, in a measurement known as nominal economic growth that does not -- as statisticians normally do -- factor out price changes, up or down. He estimates that nominal world growth is falling at a 1.1 percent annual rate this year and will stay negative next year. 
Jack Kemp, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, said policy makers in the United States and Europe had failed to recognize the severity of the downturn. He said both taxes and interest rates were too high to balance a creeping deflationary trend that threatens to undermine the achievement of the last decade.
"President Bush and his top aides know that things are worse than they imagined," Mr. Kemp said. "I'm disappointed that they're not as concerned as they should be about the global economy."

HEADLINE: Art on Streets Till the Cows Come Home 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
When five nieces and nephews came to visit Beverly Minear here, she took them to do what millions of Americans are doing this summer: strolling through the streets, looking at funny statues.
 The streets of Cedar Rapids have been decorated with more than two dozen life-size statues of couples modeled after the figures in Grant Wood's painting "American Gothic." But these couples are nothing like Wood's staid Midwesterners. They range from Uncle Sam with the Statue of Liberty to a pair of punk rockers. 
 "There's a huge variety because they symbolize all kinds of things," Ms. Minear said as she snapped a picture of one of her nephews clowning with the punks. "The city has really embraced this whole project, and I'm amazed to see how many people are coming here just to see it." 
The idea of placing these colorful sculptures along the streets of Cedar Rapids did not spring full-blown from some local planner's imagination. It is part of a trend that began two summers ago in Chicago and has become a nationwide craze.
The Chicago project, in which 340 life-size cow statues were placed along city streets, was a huge success. City officials said it brought Chicago $200 million in additional tourist revenue. 
Numbers like that do not go unnoticed, and last summer a handful of other cities jumped on the animal bandwagon. New York copied the cow idea, working with a Connecticut company, CowParade, that has made money by importing the concept from Zurich, where it originated. Other cities worked on their own, including Cincinnati, which commissioned pigs, and Lexington, Ky., which went for horses.
This summer the craze has burst full blown over the entire country. Streets in dozens of cities are now adorned with life-size or larger-than-life figures of people, animals or things. There are lizards and flamingos, dolphins and salmon, angels and flying horses, and of course more cows.
The main force behind the rapid spread of these shows is not artistic but financial. Sponsors pay for the works, tourists come to see them, and when the show is over, they are auctioned for charity. The auction of the cows when the Chicago exhibition ended had been expected to take in $250,000 for local charities but raised $3.5 million.
Chicago is staging a second outdoor show this summer, "Suite Home Chicago," a display of 350 pieces of wildly decorated furniture. Popular favorites include an Egyptian throne and a sedan chair, complete with crimson parasol, perched atop a richly bedecked white elephant. 
In all the cities, each piece of art is decorated by an artist or would-be artist. The figures are covered with gumdrops or mirrors, painted in homage to past masters or simply designed to make people laugh.
"Part of the attraction is artistic, and part of it is that it gives people a chance to interact with other people in a public place, which isn't that common these days," said Nathan Mason, curator of special projects for the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs. "People gather around these objects and start talking to strangers. That's very important to creating a sense of community."
Is it art? Detractors scoff at the very idea and dismiss the figures as decoration at best, kitsch at worst.
"It's hard to consider it real art," said Mary Gray, an urban historian, who has written extensively about art in public places. "Some of the pieces are made by artists, which is certainly one criterion for art, but the whole thing has perhaps gotten out of control. I don't think it's dangerous, but a lot of them are very ugly. Some of these pieces are even tied in to the stores they're in front of. It makes me wonder what's coming next year, and if it will be even more unappealing."
Others applaud these projects for giving artists needed visibility, raising people's awareness of art, helping local economies and serving as focal points for civic pride. Even critics admit that the projects can inject a welcome note of whimsy into city life.
Many artists welcome the chance to participate. Martie Holmer, an artist in New York who made a cow covered with images of Delft tiles for last year's display there, said she first considered the idea "really quite stupid" but was persuaded to participate after seeing the enthusiastic responses of friends who had visited Chicago.
"I decided it was O.K. to make it clever as long as it wasn't cute," Ms. Holmer said. "During that summer I met hundreds of people from Brazil, from China, from Iowa, even a homeless guy in a wheelchair. Every one of them absolutely loved the whole idea."
Charities have been drawn to the idea because of its extraordinary success as a fund-raising tool. The average bid for cows displayed in Chicago during the summer of 1999 was nearly $25,000, with the highest-priced one bringing more than $100,000. Buyers included business owners and people who wanted yard decorations.
Animals are the most common subject for this summer's displays. More than 200 lizards, some of them nearly six feet tall as they rear up on their back legs, decorate the streets of Orlando, Fla., in what organizers call a display of "Art Gecko." Forty-one sheep are the attractions at the "Ewe Review" in Rochester, Mich., which was once a center of the wool industry.
Mythological beings are also popular. Dallas is installing 200 interpretations of the winged horse Pegasus, three of them decorated by the well-traveled 60's pop artist Peter Max. Los Angeles chose angels, but while some found the display inspirational, one famously provocative local art critic, Mat Gleason, denounced it as "garbage on the streets" that reminded him of "a kid's finger-painting class."
Human figures have established a beachhead, too, and not just in Cedar Rapids. St. Paul is featuring 102 versions of Charlie Brown of the "Peanuts" comic strip, who is depicted wearing lavish jewelry, playing a bagpipe and working as a barber.
A project called "People Figures" has placed about 200 life-size mannequins on street corners and in malls and parks around St. Louis. One is a clown on a bicycle; another, an abstract group of figures, is sponsored by a mental health clinic and is intended to provoke reflections about mental illness.
Letters to newspapers about the St. Louis project reflect the same division of views that have surfaced in other cities. Most have been positive, praising the display because it "looks cool" and "makes me feel we are a vibrant community." But there are dissenters. One man wrote that artists who participated "should all be made pariahs, not just for the lousy art or whatever toned-down thing they want to call it but for making St. Louis just that much more difficult and humiliating for the people who take art, and the endeavor of making it, seriously."
In Baltimore, 120 six-foot-long fish decorate the street this summer. There is one with feathers, another painted with astral constellations and a third dressed like Elvis Presley, clutching a peanut-butter-and-banana sandwich in its fin.
"Not since Super Bowl mania painted the town purple and black has Baltimore displayed its goofy streak on such a grand scale," The Baltimore Sun reported.
A group in South Baltimore that is not connected to the project took advantage of it to create its own fish made of garbage as a complaint about poor refuse collection.
The idea for the Baltimore show, like many of those this summer, came from a local resident who saw Chicago's cows in 1999 and returned home determined to help stage something similar.
Cities that use creatures or objects other than cows plan the displays themselves, but those that choose cows work with CowParade, which bought the copyright from the originators in Zurich. CowParade provides undecorated cows and various forms of assistance in organizing the project.
"We're the largest producer of public art in the world," said Jerry Elbaum, president of CowParade. "There are a lot of copycats and a lot of different forms out there, but the cow has the absolute perfect size and dimensions. It's also probably the only animal in the world that is universally known and liked. If you're talking about fish, we don't have any connection with them except that we eat them."
Not all the projects are limited to a single city. One is spread over a 27-city area around Tampa. That region is nesting ground for most of the world's loggerhead turtles, and to honor them and raise people's awareness of their value, the local aquarium has organized a display of about 100 provocatively decorated turtle sculptures.
Local businesses pay $3,700 each to sponsor a turtle, or $2,700 if they know an artist who will work without charge or if they want their turtle decorated by schoolchildren. As in most cities, each artist is offered a cast plastic animal to decorate but may choose instead to start from scratch in wood, metal or some other medium.
"I saw it as an opportunity to combine public art with environmental awareness," said Jay Goulde, an organizer of the Tampa project. "I'm not wild about the cow-crazed merchandising machine that has made a lot of money off this for some people. But other than that, almost everyone is doing these projects for a good cause."
In just two years this craze has become so well established that Chicago, the city where it began, has opened a show at which objects from no less than 50 American and Canadian cities are on display. The show, appropriately housed at Lincoln Park Zoo, includes a shrimp from Beaufort, S.C.; a mermaid from Norfolk, Va.; a corn on the cob from Bloomington, Ill.; and a moose from Whitefish, Mont.
"An incredible number of people are coming into the zoo and having their pictures taken with these creatures," said Kevin Bell, the zoo director. "Something about them really seems to grab people."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Mayoral Hopefuls Look at Health, But Their Focus Is a Narrow One

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, the candidates for mayor have turned their attention slightly, from public safety and education toward health care. While their proposals and ideas differ around the edges, they have homed in on the two issues they seem to believe command attention: the city's 1.7 million uninsured residents, and its troubled public hospitals.
 But in so narrowly focusing their interests and proposals, most of the candidates have overlooked or misinterpreted other key health care questions in the city, such as where people are to get care once they are placed in a health care plan. Further, many of the candidates' proposals depend on state or federal acquiescence. 
 Nearly every candidate has cited the enrolling of more children into public health insurance as a key goal. But Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker and candidate, has presented by far the most aggressive plan for doing this.
Mr. Vallone would like to see the city pick up the tab on the premiums currently paid by parents whose children do not qualify for Medicaid but are eligible for Child Health Plus, another form of the government insurance program. Those premiums range from $108 to $180 a year per child, and could cost New York $147 million. (Mr. Vallone also wants to extend a prescription drug benefit to older New Yorkers with incomes of up to $43,000 a year, at a price of $260 million.) 
Mark Green, the public advocate, and Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, have openly mocked Mr. Vallone's plan, saying the economy is too uncertain to promise that amount of money to one area. But the issue of premiums may be the wrong one to focus on. Various studies have shown that a modest premium, while prohibitive to some parents, does not usually keep them from enrolling their children in health insurance. The premiums also remove the stigma that a free public program carries.
"There is some data that suggests that some low income people feel more ownership of the health care program if there is a nominal pay-in," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund. Premium subsidies, he said, "would not be my first choice given a finite amount of resources."
Most of the candidates have also insinuated that there have been no efforts at enrolling eligible children in government health insurance. But this is the one area where public and nonprofit groups have already made inroads.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who made it a goal during most of his administration to remove people from public programs, did an about-face last summer and began to use city agencies to enroll people in insurance programs. Since then, this initiative has enrolled 140,000 children in government insurance programs. Further, the Health and Hospitals Corporation has enrolled 71,000 in Medicaid and currently has 65,648 children in Child Health Plus, while the state has contracted with nonprofit groups to help enroll thousands more children in the last few years.
There are other barriers to getting coverage, like a state law that mandates a face-to-face interview for applicants, and cumbersome forms. But the mayor can only advocate changes in these state requirements. Likewise, most of the candidates have called for allowing legal immigrants to get Medicaid (they are barred under federal law from receiving it until they have been in this country for five years) and for women who are illegal immigrants to qualify for prenatal care, something the federal government also said recently it would stop paying for. But these are issues that the state and federal governments must take up.
What is more, few of the candidates have been willing to take on the city's frayed primary health care system, which has been battered down by poor reimbursement rates from both public and commercial insurance and often does not exist in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods. 
"There has been a lot of focus on getting kids enrolled," Dr. Redlener said. "That is very important. But insurance without infrastructure is not access to health care. But no one talks about it because it is expensive." A Community Service Society study last year found that 300 more primary care doctors were needed in poor neighborhoods.
Both Mr. Green and Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, have called for increased Medicaid reimbursement rates to help improve primary care services.
But just as integral to the problem as Medicaid is managed care, which the city's academic medical centers also are grappling with. While hospital reimbursement levels from health maintenance organizations have improved in the last year, rates for primary care and pediatric doctors remain low, a crucial problem since the city has a mandated goal to move all Medicaid recipients into managed care plans over the next few years. These managed care rates have kept nonpublic hospitals from making money in primary care as well. Yet during a three-hour health care forum last week, none of the candidates even mentioned managed care reimbursements. "That is strange given that we have two million residents on Medicaid and managed care is their future," said David Sandman, a program officer at the Commonwealth Fund, a health care research foundation.
Only Mr. Ferrer has mentioned the role that the nonpublic hospitals, which are tax-exempt, should be playing in serving the uninsured or in building primary care clinics, perhaps with city aid. "I understand that they have a lot of things to think about," said Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation. "But they are missing the big picture here, which is that if any mayor wants to provide free care they have to think of how funding is going to be arranged."
The candidates, especially Mr. Green and Mr. Ferrer, often attach themselves to the conventional wisdom about the Health and Hospitals Corporation, citing it as nearly insolvent and not living up to its duties as a health care provider of last resort.
Mr. Green said in his health care speech at New York University that the corporation "runs a large operating deficit every year." In fact, the corporation broke even for five years until this year, and has made budget cuts, fired consultants and consolidated services in ways that the city's equally troubled academic medical centers have not dared. Its bond ratings are the same or even better than those of many of the city's hospitals, like Mount Sinai and Beth Israel. 
And while Mr. Ferrer criticized the corporation for removing hundreds of beds from the system, health care policy experts agree that is precisely what most hospitals should be doing as more and more care has moved from the hospitals into outpatient settings. "H.H.C. has done a really nice job in trying to control costs," said Liz Sweeney, director in health care rating at Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: Ransom for a Stolen Chagall: An Israeli-Palestinian Peace 

BYLINE:  By C. J. CHIVERS 

 BODY:
Two months ago, when a painting by Marc Chagall was stolen from its place on the wall in the Jewish Museum, the authorities were confounded. The theft was discovered the morning after the museum held a cocktail reception attended by more than 200 potential witnesses, and the painting vanished with little trace other than a lone metal screw that was left on the carpet.
 Now, the authorities said, there is an equally confounding clue. 
 The museum has received a letter from someone claiming to be involved in the theft and making a demand far outside the world of curators and exhibitions. It is not money the letter writer seeks, nor fame, but something far more elusive: the painting, the writer said, will not be returned until peace has been achieved between Israel and the Palestinians, the authorities and a museum official said. 
The incident appears to be a highly unusual instance of art being stolen for political ends. The last time anything comparable happened, one art expert said, was the 1994 theft of Edvard Munch's "Scream," which was briefly the subject of demands from abortion opponents in Norway. In that case, the painting was recovered, and the authorities said the demands were made by someone who had not actually taken the painting.
In the Chagall theft, the letter to the Jewish Museum was postmarked in the Bronx on June 12 and signed by an organization that F.B.I. and police officials said they had not heard of, the International Committee for Art and Peace. The authorities said they had no other evidence of its existence. 
Although they were not sure whether the theft was driven by a genuine political motive, the authorities were confident that the letter itself was not a hoax. The envelope also contained information about the work that could come only from someone in possession of the 1914 oil painting on canvas, "Study for 'Over Vitebsk,' " showing a man floating above a village. 
"Our investigation to date supports that whoever sent this letter has knowledge about the whereabouts of the painting," one investigator said, adding that it was not clear whether the letter was sent by the thief or an accomplice.
People with political motives have long sought to control the display of art, and some political organizations -- like the Taliban in Afghanistan, Serbian nationalists in Sarajevo and the Nazis in Europe -- have actively campaigned to destroy it. But the authorities and art experts said that the motive for theft is almost always economic.
"There are very, very few political thefts," said David Shillingford, a spokesman for the Art Loss Register, an international service that maintains a database of more than 100,000 pieces of stolen art. "If you talk about theft and not destruction, you can go back many years, before the Second World War, before the First World War, and you're talking about a handful of cases."
The letter in the Chagall theft was typed on 8-by-11-inch paper and mailed inside a plain envelope, the investigator said. Only the address was handwritten. Its arrival at the museum, at Fifth Avenue and 92nd Street, was kept secret until after it had undergone extensive forensic testing, but museum officials were quite relieved, a spokeswoman said. "We are extremely distressed about the missing painting, and this communication gives us hope for the possibility of recovering the work," said Anne Scher, the spokeswoman.
Law enforcement officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to release the letter or to show it to a reporter. But they said the writer apologized for embarrassing the museum and said the painting was "being taken care of." 
The officials cannot tell whether the letter writer's sympathies lie with the Palestinians or Israel, the investigator said, and it was not clear exactly what peace conditions would secure the painting's return.
"Study for 'Over Vitebsk,' " valued at $1 million, was on loan to the museum from a private collection in Russia. It was taken from an exhibition, "Marc Chagall: Early Works from Russian Collections," which opened in April with the display of 56 works Chagall completed from 1908 to 1920, including paintings, drawings and murals for the State Jewish Chamber Theater in Moscow.
The theft occurred sometime between the start of a cocktail reception for singles on June 7 and the next morning, when a custodian found a small screw on the carpet near where the painting and its frame had apparently been forced from the wall. The 8-by-10-inch painting was small enough to have been hidden in a briefcase or even under the thief's shirt, officials said, 
F.B.I. agents and detectives from the Police Department's major case squad have interviewed nearly 300 people, including most of the people who attended the cocktail reception, and nearly 20 people who called investigators with tips after the museum offered a $25,000 reward in mid-June.
"There were a lot of leads that we had to cover, and they have all been ruled out," one investigator said.
Officials said they hoped that the letter's demands might prompt a new round of tips to the F.B.I. at (212) 384-1000 or at the Police Department's Crime Stopper line at (800) 577-TIPS.
Munch's "Scream" was stolen from Norway's National Gallery in Oslo on opening day of the 1994 Winter Olympics, so the thieves managed to capture the attention of the international news media. Five days later a Norwegian abortion opponent, trying to take advantage of the publicity, hinted on a radio show that the painting might be returned if the national television station would broadcast "The Silent Scream," an anti-abortion film.
The film was not shown, and after the police recovered the painting later that year, they said the abortion opponent was not involved in the crime.
The Chagall case has put the Jewish Museum in an unenviable position, Mr. Shillingford said, since the museum's staff and Chagall's admirers cannot reasonably be expected to have any influence over the peace process in the Middle East.
"If you compare it to the case of the Munch, the people were asking in that instance whether it was realistic or not to play a film clip," he said. "In this case, they are asking for something, while I'm not saying that it's not going to happen, it's not going to happen because a Chagall painting was stolen."

 CORRECTION:
A picture on Monday with an article about a ransom note received by the Jewish Museum for a stolen Chagall work was published in error. It showed a lithograph of Edvard Munch's "Scream," at the Metropolitan Museum, not the actual Munch painting, which was stolen in Oslo in 1994 and recovered later that year.

HEADLINE: Packed Race For an Office Few Voters Understand 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
In this most crowded of primary seasons, no major race is shaping up to be more crowded than that for public advocate, a position that has existed for less than a decade. But even though so many candidates are aspiring to an office that sometimes looks as if it involves little more than needling the mayor, few New Yorkers seem to know or care who any of the contenders are. 
 On a recent weekday morning, the former Mayor David N. Dinkins was introducing his good friend and colleague Betsy Gotbaum to the faithful on West 125th Street. By virtue of Mr. Dinkins's presence, resident after resident pledged to support Ms. Gotbaum, only to turn, midstride, and ask, Just what does the public advocate do, anyway? 
 As for who is running, don't ask Representative Charles B. Rangel, who endorsed State Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer some months ago. A recent Saturday morning found the two at Sylvia's on Lenox Avenue, rasping at each other over various chicken parts and grits about how to excite voters enough to get them to the polls come Sept. 11. At one point, the congressman said to Mr. Stringer, "You know, I hardly know who's involved in your race." 
And who could blame him? With seven hopefuls vying for the Democratic nomination and at least two other candidates expected on the ballot in November, the race is one of the most complicated knots within an already tangled election.
Among the celebrity candidates, there is Willie Colon, the salsa performer and producer who announced first for Bronx borough president but then switched to public advocate; Ms. Gotbaum, a presence in the public and nonprofit sectors since the Lindsay administration; and Norman Siegel, the civil liberties lawyer who has been a noisy champion of many causes for decades.
There are two term-limited City Council members, Stephen DiBrienza and Kathryn E. Freed, both of whom have made names for themselves as pugnacious populists, Mr. DiBrienza as chairman of the General Welfare Committee and Ms. Freed as chairwoman of the Contracts Committee. There is also Mr. Stringer, an Upper West Side liberal who grew up in local politics.
And then there is Sheila S. Flaxman, a first-time candidate who was helped to the ballot by George N. Spitz, the perennial gadfly who is running for mayor. Ms. Flaxman, an audiologist and speech-language pathologist who has raised less than $2,000, said she did not have a campaign manager but added, brightly, that she did have a treasurer. 
Political consultants and candidates say that the field is so crowded in part because the job is so vague and because it does not seem to require any hard-core skills like, say, the finesse with a calculator demanded by the comptroller's position, which has attracted just two Democratic candidates.
"It's a job that you can make what you want out of it," said Michael K. Zumbluskas, a Reform Party strategist and public advocate hopeful known as the Big Z. "And it can be very effective as a bully pulpit."
As Mr. Stringer put it, "It has some power, but it also doesn't."
As ombudsman for consumers of city services, the advocate processes thousands of civilian complaints about government bureaucracy and investigates ineffective agencies and programs. The advocate also has certain responsibilities regarding the city's public awareness campaigns and appoints members of various city commissions and boards.
The public advocate, who is elected to a four-year term and earns an annual salary of $150,000, presides over City Council meetings and can introduce legislation but votes only to break a tie. And, as the current officeholder, Mark Green, is fond of saying along his campaign trail for mayor, the public advocate is next in line to succeed the city's chief executive in the event he becomes unable to serve.
Stan Altman, dean of the school of public affairs at Baruch College, questioned whether the office, created from the position of City Council president when that job was eliminated by charter revision, is truly necessary. Still, he said, "You could say that you can never have too many watchdogs," adding, "It's an independent platform from which you can talk about issues that really affect the city." 
As a result, the office has been defined as much by the one who sits in it as by the one who sits a notch above. "I ended up being an activist Democrat next in line with an activist Republican mayor," said Mr. Green, the city's first public advocate.
Many of the candidates also say that in the next administration, widely expected to be friendlier to the next public advocate, the role will be redefined. "It's probably going to be a Democratic mayor, and even if it's one of the Republicans, it's still going to be a Democratic mayor," Ms. Freed said. "So it can't be just about criticizing the mayor." 
Like the mayor's race, the primary for public advocate is sufficiently crowded as to all but insure a runoff. The election, consultants say, will in the end come down to who has the clearest message, enough money to get it out to the masses and the organizational muscle to get supporters pulling levers on primary day. And then there is the effect of what Jacques DeGraff, president of the New York chapter of the National Action Network, the Rev. Al Sharpton's political organization, and an adviser to Ms. Gotbaum, called the "X-factor" of the election: the impact of people who will be galvanized to vote, perhaps for the first time, by the many insurgent City Council candidates. 
Within the political mainstream, Mr. Colon's candidacy remains an enigma, with some consultants saying that he was pressured to run for public advocate to help draw out Latino voters citywide to ensure that Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, at least makes it into a runoff. For his part, Mr. Colon said that he switched to the public advocate race "for the sake of unity in the Bronx, because there was going to be a real bloodfest" in the race for borough president.
Unlike the other candidates, Mr. Colon has generally skipped the forums that have been going on for months, and appears to be running his own kind of campaign. He has not yet filed any financial information with the Campaign Finance Board, and has not reached the $125,000 threshold in political contributions to receive matching funds. Although matching funds are considered to be critical for all but the wealthiest candidates, Mr. Colon said that he was unconcerned with making television commercials, and that he has a multimillion-dollar name.
In terms of his platform, Mr. Colon talks primarily about getting a fair share of the economic pie for the boroughs outside Manhattan. "The public advocate can go to federal court and based on federal issues make sure that the money that's coming from Albany" is distributed fairly, Mr. Colon said.
He also said that he would aggressively pursue civil rights abuses in city agencies and work to bring housing to the waterfronts, but offered few specifics.
Mr. Siegel, the former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, envisions an activist office with satellites in the boroughs staffed by volunteers and calls race relations the single most pressing city problem.
"People know who I am and that I have been a voice, especially for people who are powerless in this city," he said. Like Ms. Freed, he also talks of the need to reach out to constituents turned off by government.
Ms. Gotbaum offered a different approach. A fan of working within the system, she is married to the former labor leader Victor Gotbaum and has deep ties to the city's political and moneyed elite. She has been an adviser to three mayors, she was parks commissioner under Mr. Dinkins, and was director of the Police Foundation and president of the New-York Historical Society.
Among her priorities as public advocate would be making sure that people are aware of the benefits to which they are entitled, expediting construction for low- and middle-income housing and monitoring the School Construction Authority.
Ms. Freed has been chairwoman of the Council's Contracts Committee for six years, work that she said did not get "the big headlines," but was directly relevant to being public advocate because it revolves around ferreting out inefficiencies and other problems in the way the city conducts its business.
Another City Council member, Mr. DiBrienza, also said that he can bring experience to bear on the office and said that he hopes to involve members of the new Council in his efforts to uncover and fix problems. One of the two candidates from outside Manhattan, Mr. DiBrienza often speaks of the need to listen to the people he governs and has fought the city over welfare programs and children's services. He has also been active in commercial development in Park Slope and Cobble Hill in Brooklyn. 
Mr. Stringer is the organizational candidate, having secured the endorsements of scads of political clubs and Assembly members. Mr. Stringer, who said he began his career in politics when Percy Sutton appointed him to a Washington Heights community board as a teenager, points to passing domestic violence legislation as a signature achievement. Mr. Stringer, like the other candidates, has been traveling the five boroughs campaigning. "Part of the beauty of New York right now is that you can't win from the Upper West Side of Manhattan," he said. 
On the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Ms. Flaxman said that she is running because she cares about people and has a unique perspective from having "seen what goes on" in hospitals and schools and from having managed a business (her private practice). She was inspired to enter the race at a meeting of the National Women's Political Caucus where the organizers encouraged women to run for office, she said. She picked public advocate in part because her local councilman, A. Gifford Miller, is so popular, and she said she is hard at work campaigning and fund-raising.
"I know I'm behind," she said. "But I'm determined."

HEADLINE: Global Arms Sales Rise Again, and the U.S. Leads the Pack 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
International arms sales grew 8 percent last year, to nearly $36.9 billion, with the United States further consolidating its stature as the supplier of choice, especially in developing countries, according to a new Congressional report.
 American manufacturers signed contracts for just under $18.6 billion, or about half of all weapons sold on the world market during 2000, with 68 percent of the American weapons bought by developing countries. 
 Russia followed, with $7.7 billion in sales, then France with $4.1 billion, Germany with $1.1 billion, Britain with $600 million, China with $400 million and Italy with $100 million.
The statistics are contained in a study, "Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1993-2000," published by the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress. The report, updated each year, is one of the most authoritative resources on weapons sales available to the public. 
The author, Richard F. Grimmett, notes in an introduction that developing nations remain the largest market for weapons, and a growing one.
"Despite global changes since the cold war's end, the developing world continues to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by conventional weapons suppliers," wrote Mr. Grimmett, a specialist in national defense at the research service.
Worldwide arms sales rose in 2000 for the third year in a row. The previous year, international weapons sales were nearly $34 billion, when measured in constant year 2000 dollars. The value of sales agreements with developing nations was $25.4 billion in 2000, the highest in constant dollars since 1994.
The two leaders in arms sales, the United States and Russia, both increased their new contracts in 2000.
The report is studiously nonpartisan. But its findings will doubtless offer more material for human rights and arms control organizations that criticize the American government -- Democratic and Republican administrations -- for preaching peaceful relations abroad while allowing American contractors to continue arming the world.
Certain details also underscore national security challenges for the new Bush administration.
The study documents a small but tangible supplier-buyer relationship between Russia and Iran during a time when President Bush is pressing Moscow to end the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. One inducement that administration officials said they might put on the table is to buy Russian interceptors for a missile shield; another would be to offer joint development for high-technology sensors, communications systems or "kill vehicles" of an eventual missile system.
At the same time, however, administration officials express concerns that a Russia-Iran arms relationship could compromise American technological secrets shared with Russia, in addition to destabilizing the region.
There are two ways to track the flow of arms: by sales contracts and by deliveries. 
The study found that between 1997 and 2000, Russia agreed to sell Iran $300 million in weapons, measured in constant 2000 dollars. During that same period, Russia delivered to Iran $800 million in arms.
"In late 2000, Russia served public notice that it again intended to pursue major arms sales with Iran, despite objections from the United States," the report states.
The administration's arguments for a missile shield beyond the limits of the ABM Treaty cite Iraq and North Korea as the major threats, and as the report notes, "Iraq was once a major purchaser of advanced weaponry from Russia," but not since the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
"Russia would clearly pursue new major weapons deals with Iraq, if current U.N. sanctions on Iraq that ban Iraqi arms purchases are lifted," the report states.
Russia's principal clients for weapons are India and China. But Moscow enters into joint production deals with those nations, which raises the possibility that eventually they will make the arms domestically, curtailing purchases despite Russia's desire to earn hard currency.
The report also cautions on China's role in the arms market, stating, "With a need for hard currency, and some military products (especially missiles) that some developing countries would like to acquire, China can present an important obstacle to efforts to stem proliferation of advanced missile systems to some areas of the developing world where political and military tensions are significant."
After reaching a peak of $2.7 billion in weapons sales in 1999, China dropped to $400 million last year. Pakistan remained a major buyer.
The increase in sales by the United States, from $12.9 billion in 1999 to nearly $18.6 billion, was powered by a $6.4 billion sale of 80 F-16 fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates.
The Emirates, by virtue of its blockbuster purchase of jets from the United States, led the developing world in signing weapons contracts in 2000, with $7.4 billion. India, which signed $4.8 billion in sales deals, ranked second, followed by South Korea, which signed $2.3 billion in contracts.

HEADLINE: Doctors' Dirty Needles Spreading Disease in China 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: LUOPING, China 

 BODY:
A worried Dou Zhe rushed into Dr. Wang Yujia's storefront clinic carrying a precious bundle. "He's sick," announced Mr. Dou, unwrapping layers of colorful blankets from his 2-year-old son, a chubby, listless boy in a blue jumpsuit. "He's normally mischievous, but since tonight he's hot. He just wants to sleep -- he won't eat or play."
 Dr. Wang, a kindly weathered man in a long white coat, determined that the boy had a red throat and a fever of 102. He had a cold, one that would almost certainly pass on its own in a few days. 
 Nonetheless, Dr. Wang drew up what has become an all-too-common rural Chinese cure -- a syringe filled with four different medicines -- and plunged the needle filled with yellow goo into the screaming boy's behind. 
"We always come to see him, because he's a good doctor," Mr. Dou, a construction worker, said with a note of satisfaction. "My boy's had lots of shots."
China's love affair with injections and infusions is becoming a medical nightmare, spreading illness rather than curing it, experts say.
In large part because syringes and needles are often inadequately sterilized in rural China, experts say the overuse of medical injections helps explain the alarming spread of blood-borne infections in China, particularly hepatitis and, to a lesser extent, AIDS. 
Today, 60 percent of Chinese have had hepatitis B, compared with just 1 percent in the United States and Japan. Some 150 million Chinese have the chronic variety of the infection, which over time causes liver failure and liver cancer.
"To a large extent the very high rate of hepatitis B has to do with unsafe injections and excessive injection for common illness during childhood," the United Nations Common Country Assessment for China said in 1999.
The problem of needless shots is particularly severe in rural areas, where doctors often have little formal medical training and receive extra income for each injection they give, and where patients and doctors alike see shots as a sign of progress.
Dr. Wang, for example, is not really a physician, but a former farmer who learned his basics when he was appointed a "barefoot doctor" under China's Communist system in the 1960's. In all, he has received just two years of medical training, and that in the mid-1980's, when Western medicines were not available in the countryside.
And so when a little boy arrives with a cold, he draws up an injection composed of two antibiotics that are unnecessary and will promote resistance, an antiviral drug that has no use against the common cold and a powerful steroid that will only make his immune system less able to fight infection.
A 2000 survey of medical care in 40 rural counties conducted by Unicef and the Chinese Health Ministry found that 47 to 65 percent of children had received injections as treatment for their last cold. 
While it is extremely rare for children in the United States to get shots aside from immunizations, many Chinese children get more than half a dozen a year.
But far more important than the immediate side effects of these freewheeling injections is the risk of acquiring devastating disease, since, as in much of the developing world, rural Chinese doctors try to cut costs by reusing potentially contaminated equipment.
While there is no evidence that this 2-year-old suffered lasting harm from his shot, in one 1999 study, Chinese researchers found that 88 percent of injections in a large rural county were unsafe, most often because doctors reused needles and syringes after inadequate or no cleaning.
The Health Ministry has encouraged clinics to switch to disposable needles and syringes, but even those are sometimes reused, or cleaned and repackaged in a large underground market, according to medical experts here and reports in the Chinese press.
Such practices have probably also contributed to China's emerging AIDS problem, though scientists believe that H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, spreads less efficiently than hepatitis by this route. Statistics on the spread of H.I.V. in rural areas have been shrouded by official secrecy and many victims do not even know that they are infected.
"We already know many people have been getting hepatitis from shots," said one health expert who has worked extensively in China. "And that worries me a lot about the spread of AIDS."
Although there is now a hepatitis B vaccine that is widely used in the United States, it is expensive and not included in the Chinese government's free vaccination programs, so a majority of poor rural children do not get it.
Government officials have acknowledged the problem of unsafe injections and have repeatedly tried to ensure proper use of sterile medical equipment and better regulation of its manufacturing and disposal. But the problem has been difficult to stop.
"Unfortunately, rural doctors often rely on medicines and shots for income, and the farmers think they need an IV to be cured," said Zhu Ling, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who studies health care. Even rudimentary clinics in rural China now have rows of IV bottles hanging ready along the wall.
Government regulations allow rural medics to charge only pennies per visit, but they may add fees for the medicines and shots. With only minimal training, many do not understand how to use many of the medicines that line their shelves, or even the risks of injection or failure to use proper sterilization techniques.
Dr. Wang owns one of many private clinics in this small city in China's far southwest, and he is clearly more careful and conscientious than most of his competition. 
He is proud, for example, that he has switched to disposable plastic syringes and needles, which he unwraps to give 2-year-old Dou Youjun his shot and then quickly deposits into a large cardboard box on the floor overflowing with others like it.
In many rural clinics, used syringes and needles sit on the counter, waiting for reuse. 
In a December 1999 study in The Chinese Journal of Epidemiology, 56 percent of rural doctors said they changed equipment only if they could see blood in the syringes.
But it is not at all clear that Dr. Wang's disposable syringes will be disposed of properly. In theory, and according to official government policy, used disposable needles and syringes should be destroyed, since they are made of materials that can not be fully cleaned.
But here, Dr. Wang said, his box is picked up once a week by someone who "takes care of them." 
"These can't be used more than once," he said. "They need to be taken off and sterilized first."
Most rural doctors know little about what happens to their discarded equipment, but there is ample evidence that it sometimes makes its way back to the bedside.
At a huge "recycling center" just outside the Fourth Ring Road in Beijing, a migrant worker in a padded gray jacket who gives his name as Mr. He reaches into a metal bin and pulls out a massive tangle of plastic IV tubes, with needles still attached.
In this vast open yard where hundreds of small traders in paper, metal, cardboard and plastics sort through the detritus of life in Beijing, unmarked trucks from hospitals and clinics routinely deliver syringes, blood bags and IV tubes, often with fresh blood still clinging to the side.
"It's a good business, since medical plastics sell for much more than ordinary plastic," said Ren Xinyang, a skinny 30-year-old, standing in a stall littered with old needles.
Most of the plastic from this center goes by truck to Wenan in Hebei Province, about 60 miles outside Beijing, a place renowned for its wholesale plastic market.
Every yard in Wenan is littered with plastic castoffs. In one tidy compound, owned by a family named Jiang, bags of dirty medical waste are the raw material of a business that nets $5,000 a year.
Behind a white tile wall, blood-tinged syringes and needles are fed into a large manual grinder that spits out bent needles and deposits plastic fragments on the other side, which are given a cursory wash in a shallow cement pool before being packed away for sale.
The plastic is then used to make heavy-duty plastic sacks, a family member said.
But there are also bags of whole syringes. And although family members insist that they do not sell those anymore, they acknowledged that they had in the past. "Two years ago, people from Henan and Zhejiang would come to buy whole syringes, and we got a much higher price than selling scrap," Ms. Jiang said.
In the last year, Chinese newspapers have covered several police raids on small backyard factories that were illegally cleaning and repackaging disposable syringes. One such workshop in Zhejiang Province held more than 14 tons of used single-use medical equipment, including more than four tons of needles, The Legal Daily reported.
Since most Chinese get so many shots, it is nearly impossible to prove that any one injection was responsible for disease. But doctors say the cumulative effect is obvious from China's alarming problem with hepatitis B.
Hepatitis B causes pain, nausea and fatigue and can become a chronic infection, leading to liver failure or cancer of the organ. Liver cancer, rare in the West, is the leading cause of cancer deaths in China.
Hepatitis B can be transmitted three ways: during childbirth, through intercourse or through infected medical equipment or transfusions. Research suggests that a huge number of children are getting the disease after birth but before they are old enough to have intercourse, making injections the by far most likely explanation in their cases.
In one study, 9 percent of pregnant women had active hepatitis, meaning that at most 9 percent of children could get it at birth. But by age 6, the researchers found, 34 percent of children were infected.
Other research has found that the likelihood that a 2-year-old had contracted hepatitis was directly proportional to the number of injections he or she had. 
Among toddlers who had one to five shots, only 12 percent were infected. Among those who had 6 to 10 shots, 25 percent were infected. And among children who had 11 to 20 shots, the figure was a whopping 62 percent.
At a recent medical conference, Dr. Liu Shijing estimated that 30 to 40 percent of hepatitis B in China resulted from medical exposures, and some foreign experts put the number even higher.
"Shots should be preventing this disease," said the medical expert who has worked in China, "but you can see from the numbers that now most are getting it from shots."

Mississippi Seen as Magnet For Patients' Rights Suits
If Congress makes it easier for injured patients to sue health insurance companies, lawyers in Mississippi will be well prepared. The state has gained a national reputation as a place where consumers fare well in court -- so well that Mississippi has become a magnet for liability lawsuits. "If Aetna, Prudential and Cigna lose the battle over a patients' bill of rights, there's nothing they will fear more than having lawsuits brought against them in Mississippi," the president of the state medical association said.

What the Cows Have Wrought
Colorful sculptures of people, animals or things have popped up in dozens of cities as a craze that started with cows spreads across America. There are lizards and flamingos, dolphins and salmon, angels and flying horses, and, of course, more cows. The main force behind the rapid spread of these shows is not artistic but financial. Sponsors pay for the works, tourists come to see them, and when the show is over, they are auctioned for charity. A1

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
'Best' List For Colleges By U.S. News Is Under Fire

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Be careful if you ask Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., to discuss the U.S. News & World Report annual "America's Best Colleges and Universities" issue.
 Suddenly, a genteel conversation with a bow-tie wearing college president can turn into something like a wild-eyed rant. 
 "The criteria are ludicrous," Mr. Botstein said last week. "It is the most successful journalistic scam I have seen in my entire adult lifetime. A catastrophic fraud. Corrupt, intellectually bankrupt and revolting." 
Call it revolting or call it masterful, the best-colleges issue of U.S. News will hit newsstands on Sept. 10. and will burnish or dull the reputations of colleges and universities across the country, stir already addled adolescent hormones and cause status-conscious parents of high school students to run for the Xanax.
Since its debut in 1983, the annual list has achieved a totemic respect, especially for well-to-do parents willing to spend any amount to get Junior into Harvard (No. 2 on last year's list, after Princeton).
The issue's publication each year causes bitter rivalries among colleges and universities, which feel an effect in the number of applications each time the institutions rise or fall on the list. And students often depend on the annual issue, if not the numeric rankings, at least for reliable basic information about colleges and universities. And, of course, it sells magazines.
But many educators have long questioned its value. And now a former director of data research at U.S. News is publicly debunking the list's fundamental criteria.
In the September issue of The Washington Monthly, Amy Graham -- who oversaw the list at U.S. News for two years until her resignation in 1999 -- argues that the manner in which the magazine gathers data and ranks colleges "defies common sense" and produces misleading results. 
The article, "Broken Ranks," whose co-author is Nicholas Thompson, an editor at The Washington Monthly, says that "the highly influential U.S. News & World Report annual guide to 'America's Best Colleges' pays scant attention to measures of learning or good educational practices." 
The rankings, the article says, "primarily register a school's wealth, reputation and the achievement of the high school students it admits," and give too much weight to data like an institution's wealth and the College Board scores of the incoming freshman class.
"That's like measuring the quality of a restaurant by calculating how much it paid for silverware and food: not completely useless, but pretty far from ideal," the article says.
Other information the article says is given too much weight includes the opinions of college and university presidents, who rank peer institutions -- a factor that makes up 25 percent of an institution's score -- and the generosity of alumni giving. Not enough attention, the article argues, is paid to the satisfaction of the students.
Peter Cary, the U.S. News director of special projects, who oversees the annual issue, said he disagreed with Ms. Graham and other critics. For example, Scholastic Assessment Tests "are a measure of the braininess of the entering freshman class, and by extension the braininess of the student body," he said. 
Even in the drowsy days of August, within academia the article by Ms. Graham and Mr. Thompson has sounded a call to rhetorical arms. Judith Shapiro, the president of Barnard College (No. 29 on the 2000 list of best liberal arts colleges), said that she had always questioned the basic data upon which U.S. News relies. 
"It's the old story about the drunk looking for his car keys under the lamp post -- because the light is good there," she said. 
Ms. Shapiro said that while she was happy to see information about colleges made available to the public by U.S. News, she disagreed with the idea of rating colleges. The things that make up a college's appeal are not factors that can be numerically measured, she says. "But we know the answer to that," she said. "It sells magazines."
The list has indeed spawned a profitable side business for U.S. News & World Report, at a time when newsstand sales are sinking for all magazines and advertising revenue for U.S. News is down 20.5 percent for the year, through July.
Last year's best-colleges issue of U.S. News, dated Sept. 11, sold 56,444 copies on the newsstand, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. That was about 40 percent higher than the magazine's typical newsstand sales.
Time, Newsweek and Business Week also publish guidebooks or special issues that scrutinize almost every educational institution, from private boarding schools to business graduate programs to graduate classes in entomology. 
Kenneth Auchincloss is the editor of Kaplan/ Newsweek's "How to Get Into College," which was released last week. It sells about 100,000 copies a year. But it does not rank colleges, he said. "We have never been comfortable trying to quantify in numeric terms the various criteria that go into making a college good or less good," Mr. Auchincloss said. "And we don't want to devote the resources to doing an elaborate statistical analysis that frankly we don't think is valid." 
Ms. Graham, who has a doctorate in economics from the University of Virginia (No. 20 on the best universities list), is now working as a statistical researcher for the state of Virginia. She said she left the magazine because the editor who hired her, James Fallows, had left.
Mr. Fallows, as it happens, has an article in the current Atlantic Monthly about college admissions, "The Great College Hustle," which addresses in part how colleges battle each other for the U.S. News rankings.
Ms. Graham said she wrote her article because she wanted to see the list makers conduct additional research among the students themselves before ranking the institutions. 
She also said that using alumni donations as a gauge of student satisfaction is a "vastly unreliable" measure, which, she wrote, "depends in large part on alumni wealth and how many pesky sophomores man phone banks."
Mr. Botstein of Bard (No. 39 on the liberal arts list) agreed that alumni giving was not a useful criterion. "What does that mean?" he said. "That you created some passive set of people who sit back musing and consider their 20's were the best part of their lives?" 
And Ms. Shapiro of Barnard said the attention to wealth "feeds a serious academic arms race" that is unhealthy for colleges. 
But Mr. Cary of U.S. News said the wealth of an institution indicated its health. "How many labs they can set up?" he asked. "How much can they pay their faculty, and what kind of faculty they can attract?"
The magazine works hard to make the list as accurate and fair as possible each year, Mr. Cary added. 
"We are not strangers to criticism," he said. He meets with college presidents, deans of admissions, high school guidance counselors and other educators at lengthy meetings throughout the year. "These are not placid discussions." 
One of Ms. Graham's specific recommendations is that the U.S. News ranking should integrate results from the National Survey of Student Engagement, supported by the Pew Foundation. Mr. Cary said that he was eager to include more information from students and that he had already considered the Pew research.
"But they only had data from 276 colleges," he said. And the participating institutions had insisted that the student information not be made public, Mr. Cary said.
Stephen R. Lewis Jr., the president of Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., (No. 6 on the liberal arts list), said that the ranking was not necessarily bad and not necessarily good. "The question should not be, what are the best colleges?" Mr. Lewis said. "The real question should be, best for whom?"

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Licensing Famous Art, Digitally

BYLINE:  By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
More than a decade ago, a tiny start-up called Corbis set out to buy the rights to digitally reproduce many of the world's most revered paintings and photographs. The idea, in the view of the company's owner and founder, was that people would someday decorate their homes with digital artwork by displaying the images on flat-screen monitors. 
 These days, Corbis is still owned by its founder, Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, who designed his home to display digital artwork on flat-screen monitors. But Mr. Gates has little to do with the day-to-day operation of the company, whose mission has evolved. 
 After acquiring 11 companies and the digital rights to dozens of other major collections, Corbis has settled into the business of licensing images to news outlets, publishers and advertising companies. And while Corbis may not have changed the way homes are decorated -- other than Mr. Gates's -- the company and its chief competitor, Getty Images, have permanently altered the media licensing business. 
 Today, Corbis and Getty Images, both based in Seattle, fulfill slightly more than half their orders online, delivering the requested images to customers over digital networks. A process that only a few years ago might have required several weeks of a photo researcher's time can now take only a matter of hours, or minutes. 
 But the real change in this nearly $2-billion-a-year industry is the extensive consolidation that has taken place. In the last few years, Corbis and Getty Images have gobbled up nearly all of North America's major collections. And both have deserted the unproven consumer business almost entirely, instead refocusing themselves in the business-to-business market. 
 In 1995, Corbis took the biggest step when it bought the Bettmann archive, perhaps the most significant collection of historical photographs, including some 12 million images. While the archive generates only 7 percent of Corbis's revenues, its prestige draws attention to the rest of the Corbis collection, which includes the photographic archive of United Press International; Saba Press, a news agency; and Sygma, a documentary photo agency based in Paris. 
 At the same time, Corbis has the rights to license digital reproductions of works from the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia; the Ansel Adams collection; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; and the National Gallery in London. 
 Despite its ownership of some of the image industry's greatest collections, in this business Mr. Gates's company is not the 800-pound gorilla. That status belongs to Getty Images, the only publicly traded company in the image-licensing business and the largest industry player by a long shot. 
 Founded by a pair of former investment bankers, including Mark Getty, an heir to the Getty oil fortune, Getty Images controls 26 percent of the market while Corbis has 6 percent. Not bad for a company that did not enter the market until nearly six years after Mr. Gates laid down his stakes. 
 Since its founding in 1995, Getty Images has bought more than two dozen collections, including Europe's largest historic assemblage of photographs, the Hulton. Last year, Getty bought two competitors, the Image Bank and Visual Communications Group, for $183 million and $220 million, respectively. In 1999, the company paid $116 million for art.com, a wall art company, but sold it earlier this year to refocus on its core image-licensing business. 
 With the major collections already acquired, what is left? The remaining two-thirds of the image-licensing and stock photography market is a fragmented lot, made up of small, often local or single-subject, collections. Nearly every city has a handful of image-licensing companies serving local needs. But those, too, may soon find themselves looking for a buyer -- assuming they cannot come up with the money to digitize their own collections and retool their businesses for e-commerce.
Getty Images, for example, spent nearly $130 million in 1999 and 2000 converting its prints and negatives to digital files and building its distribution network, and is expected to spend an additional $70 million this year, said Keith Gay, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco. And Corbis will spend millions to finish digitizing the Bettmann archive as it transfers the collection to an underground storage site in Pennsylvania. 
"Our view is that 100 percent of sales in North America will be on the Internet in three years, and we don't need a major technology invention to make it happen," said Jonathan Klein, chief executive of Getty Images, and the person generally credited with establishing Getty Images' early lead. The international market is trailing the North American market by about two years, Mr. Klein says. 
 Analysts also say digital is the only way to go. "If you don't do it electronically, you're going to go out of business," said Peter Appert, media analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown 
 While Corbis and Getty Images compete, they also seem to have settled into fairly complementary roles. Getty Images' primary business is selling to advertisers and commercial publishers. Corbis, on the other hand, emphasizes editorial work, licensing its images primarily to news organizations and magazines. 
 But with advertising spending down, so is the number of news and magazine pages -- and thus demand for the offerings of Getty Images and Corbis. Getty Images' revenue is down about 3 percent compared with last year -- well off growth in excess of 20 percent the last few years. The company is forecasting revenue this year of just under $500 million.
 "Clearly, the industry is more cyclical that we used to think," Mr. Appert said. 
 And as for Corbis, after 12 years in existence, the company has yet to show a profit, and earlier this year laid off 79 of its 1,300 employees. But its fortunes may be about to change; company executives say it is on track to become profitable in the fourth quarter of 2002. Steve Davis, who shares the title of chief executive with Anthony Rojas, estimates Corbis will have about $140 million in revenues this year. 
 Both Getty Images and Corbis may find there are other ways to expand, even in the currently dismal economic climate. For starters, Mr. Gay said, they may begin to capture business from the $5 billion-a-year custom photo industry.
 He said that many media companies would just as soon buy a photo than hire a photographer -- assuming they can find just the image they want. With the continued digitalization of photography, the search can only get easier.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 23, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about efforts by two companies, Corbis and Getty Images, to license digital collections of photos and art misstated Corbis's relationship to the consumer market. While the company has expanded into the licensing of images to news outlets, publishers and advertising companies, it also still sells images to consumers; it has not largely deserted that market.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Companies with collections of photographs are spending millions to digitize the images, in part because of deterioration.

HEADLINE: Debate Over National Monument Emphasizes Old West-New West Divide 

BYLINE:  By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: LOMA, Mont., Aug. 14 

 BODY:
On a treeless, sun-baked hill near here where two rivers flow together, the explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark came to a critical decision in 1805: they would follow the Missouri River and not the Marias in their quest for the Northwest Passage. The call was the right one, for the Missouri led to the headwaters they sought.
 Decision Point is just one of the sites included in a proclamation signed by President Bill Clinton in January that turned this rugged, sparsely settled region dotted with cattle and nuclear missile silos into the Missouri Breaks National Monument, one of several such monuments Mr. Clinton created at the end of his term. 
 Now, Montanans are squaring off over efforts to roll back Mr. Clinton's decision, which created the new Missouri Breaks National Monument around the 90,000-acre Wild and Scenic River corridor, which encompasses more than 495,000 acres, including 82,000 acres of private land.
The monument designation did not need Congressional approval, which many in the West see as an abuse of federal power. Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, concerned that local residents did not have enough say in the process, has asked states to come up with ways to reduce the size of the monuments or relax restrictions. On Tuesday a committee appointed by Gov. Judy Martz, a Republican, voted to recommend that the federal government shrink the national monument to 90,000 acres.
Supporters of the new monument in Montana contend that Governor Martz stacked the committee with monument opponents. 
"Committee members held proponents who testified in complete disdain," said Hugo Tureck, a rancher near Coffee Creek, outside the monument, and a director of a group called Friends of the Missouri Breaks. "It was very transparent." 
This is a familiar battleground in the West, where the agriculture, mining and drilling of the Old West economy go up against the environmental enthusiasm of the New West economy, based on tourism, hunting and fishing. 
And with the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition in 2004 expected to attract thousands of tourists, the monument is seen as "a golden goose that can lay eggs into perpetuity," said Marv Hoffer, a Lewistown city commissioner. 
"This is one of the few areas in the country where you can experience the West as Lewis and Clark saw it," said Stephen E. Ambrose, the historian and author of "Undaunted Courage," a book about the expedition.
"It's the most pristine part of the Lewis and Clark Trail," said Mr. Ambrose, who is working to keep the present boundaries. "It is precious to all Americans and it needs to be protected."
Meriwether Lewis was especially taken with the breaks, which are jagged white, dun and red sandstone cliffs that have been sculptured by wind and water into strangely shaped spires and hoodoos. "As we passed on," Lewis wrote in his famous, and often misspelled, journal, "it seemed those seens of visionary inchantment would never have an end."
In a sign of how the battle lines have been drawn over the breaks, the city commission of Lewistown, the hub of central Montana's ranch country, voted 5 to 0 in July for a resolution to protect the Missouri Breaks "to the greatest extent possible."
David Byerly, the former publisher of The Lewistown News-Argus and a Fergus County school board member, said that in Lewistown, a town of 5,800, 135 children graduated this year. The class of 2013 will have 85 members. "The rural way of life is a precious thing," said Mr. Byerly, who supports the monument. "But if you look at the numbers out there they're scary. We might want to freeze it in 1950 here, but it's not going to happen. The monument won't replace agriculture, but it's a ray of hope and we should grab it."
But some ranchers are infuriated because, they say, too much private land was included in the monument boundary. 
Matt Knox, a rancher near Winifred, Mont., and founder of a group called Missouri River Stewards, said the government had promised to acquire private land for the monument only on a "willing seller" basis.
"But if they want it bad enough, they can make us willing sellers by changing regulations and making things difficult," Mr. Knox said. "It's a scary process."
Craig Flentie, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management in Lewistown, said that while private lands lie within the boundaries of the monument, they would not be affected by monument regulations.
Monument status does not allow new leases for such uses as mining or oil and gas drilling, but allows existing uses, like ranching, to continue if they do not conflict with the goal of the momuent. The government is still working out details of its plan for the monument, with public participation.
There is a deep and abiding mistrust of the federal government in some communities in the West. At Tuesday's meeting ranchers posted a sign that said "U.S. Government, stop stealing private land," and a small boy carried a sign that read, "Don't let the feds take my daddy's farm." But despite some outbursts, the issue has simmered, not boiled. 
Some argue that it is a mistake for ranchers, many of whom use cheap federal grazing land and receive crop support payments, to fight the designation. 
"These ranchers are bringing the public to focus on the idea of subsidies, and we are cutting our own throat," said Mr. Tureck, who leases public land well below market cost, as do many in the breaks. "It makes the ranchers look extremely selfish. They don't want to share public lands with the public."

HEADLINE: TALKING POLITICS: Greenwich Village and SoHo; 
Concerns About Maintaining Successes of the Giuliani Era

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Richard Fitzgerald, a 49-year-old chauffeur who lives in Greenwich Village, was settled on a bench on a hot and muggy morning in Washington Square Park the other day. A police officer on a horse clip-clopped up a path to the side. Children crowded a playground, while dog owners ran their unleashed pets through a fenced-in field.
 And there was barely a drug dealer or homeless person in sight, an absence that Mr. Fitzgerald, who has been spending afternoons in the park since he was a teenager, noted with fresh approval and lingering astonishment. 
 "Oh, God, there is almost no way to measure how much improvement he has done," Mr. Fitzgerald said, the unnamed "he" being the city's soon-to-depart mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. "I've lived here for 30 years, and I've hung out in this park for 30 years, and I feel so much better than I did 10 years ago," he said. "This park has really turned around. It's gotten cleaner, it's gotten safer." 
In the view of advisers to the mayoral candidates, there are few neighborhoods in New York where the quality-of-life improvements of the past eight years can be better measured than in the 66th Assembly District. It is a middle-class, mostly low-rise downtown patchwork that includes some of New York's most picturesque neighborhoods: Greenwich Village, SoHo, TriBeCa, Chelsea and Battery Park City among them. Its residents voted overwhelmingly against Mr. Giuliani when he was first elected mayor in 1993, and then voted to re-elect him in 1997. It was a Democratic district settling in behind a Republican mayor, in one sign of how politics in New York were changed over those eight years.
These days, voters in the 66th are pleased about the health of their city and the vibrancy of their neighborhoods, a reflection of the sentiment found in much of New York in a poll taken last week by The New York Times. They talk of tranquil parks, anxiety-free strolls at night, a bustling local economy, cleaner streets and a city that they seek to enjoy, rather than escape on summer weekends. 
And while Washington Square Park may still have its ragged edges, many of the residents who use it say the improvements over the past eight years are striking.
But with three weeks to go until the mayoral primary, there are signs of anxiety as voters begin to consider the imminent departure of a mayor whose interest seemed so closely tied to middle-class neighborhoods like these. 
"I am worried about the future," said Steven Man, 55, an optometrist who is a registered Democrat. "I don't know what will happen from here. It could go back to the way it was. I'm really not sure, and that troubles me."
And there is some concern about whether the next mayor -- who will come from what remains, for most people, an unfamiliar cast -- will, by choice or ability, continue the priorities that Mr. Giuliani has embraced. "None of the guys out there are qualified to do it; everybody out there is scary," said Andrew Nathan, 37, the former owner of a restaurant on Prince Street, Frontiere, which he closed a month ago as he prepared to move out of the city. (Mr. Nathan, a strong Giuliani supporter and a Republican, said the timing of his own departure had nothing to do with the change at City Hall.)
There are more than a few people like Marianne Salerno, 60, a medical assistant who lives in the West Village, who said they would vote for Mr. Giuliani again, were he not barred from seeking re-election by term limits. "I'm a little apprehensive," she said.
Still, this is the part of New York where the Reform Democrat movement came alive, and that produced Edward I. Koch (he still lives just off Washington Square Park), Bella S. Abzug, and the birth of the modern gay rights movement, at the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street. Thus, if there is something approaching an approving consensus on some of Mr. Giuliani's policies, the mayor himself is another matter: many people do not seem unhappy that the city's first Republican mayor in 20 years is about to leave the stage.
"I think the city is a little bit safer -- and that's good," said Ilsa Gilbert, a writer of librettos, poetry and short stories, who lives in the West Village. "But I'm wondering at what cost. So I'm going to be glad that someone else is going to be mayor."
And if some voters are not upset at Mr. Giuliani's departure, they are nonetheless judging his successors by the benchmarks that he set for his government.
When asked the problems they wanted the next mayor to focus on, voters more often than not pointed to the kind of second-tier governmental functions that implicitly suggest an overall satisfaction with the way New York is delivering such basic services as police protection and garbage pickup. 
They talked about the park system -- which Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker and a Democratic mayoral candidate, recently identified as the one governmental department he would never cut as mayor -- or noise on the street, or municipal recreation programs, or cleaning up graffiti, or widening the new bicycle path along the Hudson River.
In a part of the city that has historically been identified with activist government, there was distress that parts of the city that had been of great concern to past Democratic administrations -- in particular, poorer New York -- had been neglected by Mr. Giuliani. 
Brian Herlihy, 28, who works for a fiber optics company, said the next mayor had to "focus a bit more on distributing the wealth, as opposed to getting New York back on its feet. I think Giuliani has done that."
Anita Fay, a writer who lives in Chelsea, said: "Housing issues really bother me. It's the chief issue. There are so many people that can afford good housing, and others get forced out. It's the issue of the next decade. For most people, housing is terrible; not for me, but for others. Rent is too high, and no one has a solution."
Similarly, the perceived deterioration of the public school system was a repeated concern. 
"Education -- that's all I want to hear," said Ronat Cooper, who was taking a break from her job at a publishing house to eat lunch at the park. "And more funding for your kids, and get them off the street, by offering programs to them." 
Ronald Barnes, 28, who works at Gap Kids and lives in Greenwich Village, also said education should be a top priority of the next mayor. "My son is 7, and he gets no help," he said. "They cut the summer youth programs."
Although there is little sign that the mayoral contest has stirred much interest, perceptions about the candidates, if indistinct ones, are beginning to come together. Not surprisingly, most people have taken notice of Michael R. Bloomberg, the heavy-spending Republican mayoral candidate. 
"Bloomberg is the only one you are hearing about right now," said Mr. Herlihy.
But in this case, attention is not necessarily a good thing. There are clearly reservations about Mr. Bloomberg's qualifications to go directly to the top job in City Hall, as well as some resentment about his heavy spending of his own money on the campaign.
"Bloomberg is just a rich guy running for mayor," said Paul Monahan, 41, a Democrat, and an independent contractor. Nino Condasta, 75, a Democrat, said: "Bloomberg I've heard bad things about. I've heard he's rich, pushy, and can afford to buy an election."
Mr. Fitzgerald said: "His money got him on the ticket. I don't think he's earned a place in politics."
And there is resistance to him because of his party affiliation, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Bloomberg is a lifelong Democrat who switched his registration principally so that he would have a relatively clear field in which to run for mayor. "I wouldn't vote at this point for a Republican," said Ms. Gilbert. "I am so disgusted with everything that is going on there." 
On the other side, the impressions of the Democratic candidates -- Mark Green, the public advocate; Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller; Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president; and Mr. Vallone -- are much less formed, suggesting potential for change in the weeks ahead. "Right now, I think we've got a lot of good Democratic candidates," said Susan Morrow, a freelance designer. "I like Mark Green, I really do. And I like Hevesi; I think right now he's probably the best man. I mean, he doesn't have the glamour of some of the other candidates."
Matt Bodie, 32, a law instructor at New York University, said: "I guess I like Mark Green. His politics are similar to mine. I usually vote Democratic, but I'm a little worried about his ability to be mayor, a good executive. I like his policies on more of a national level."
Mr. Man said: "I know Hevesi is comptroller and smart about money. I think he'd be a better administrator than Green. Green doesn't seem to have the right personality for mayor. Ferrer is using racial things to win, and I think that it's terrible. I would never vote for him. He should be accentuating the things that are positive, the good things. Instead, he keeps talking about things that are bad."
Ms. Salerno said she had been put off when Mr. Hevesi turned up on television the other night campaigning with Abner Louima, the victim of an assault in a Brooklyn precinct house, who has endorsed Mr. Hevesi. "That has nothing to do with anything," she said. "I don't even know why they brought that as an up-front issue. Who cares? I thought that was in poor taste, and I don't think he should have done that." 
(But take heart, Mr. Hevesi: Mr. Monahan said, "I heard that Louima backed Hevesi, which would make me take another look.")
Ms. Salerno went on to say that she was uncomfortable about Mr. Ferrer because of the company he keeps. "May I be honest?" she asked. "He's a friend of Al Sharpton's. And I don't like Al Sharpton."

HEADLINE: Nasser Says Reductions in Jobs Won't BeLast Cutbacks at Ford 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: MONTEREY, Calif., Aug. 19 

 BODY:
Jacques Nasser, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, said late Saturday that the automaker would have to take steps beyond its announced job cuts to reduce costs.
 Mr. Nasser said Ford might cut production capacity if the United States economy shows no signs soon of rebounding over the next 12 to 18 months, which is the current outlook. Cutting production usually includes eliminating more jobs and could even involve closing a plant. 
 "This is an initial action," Mr. Nasser said of the job cuts announced on Friday. "There will be other actions that we need to take in other areas of the company. It will be how can we do things more efficiently, how can we make decisions more quickly," he told reporters here at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, a celebration of luxury cars.
"We'll take the next three or four months to think it through, see what other actions are needed," he added.
Ford said on Friday that it would offer up to 5,000 white-collar employees in North America, or 10 percent of its salaried work force, a voluntary severance package. The company expects the plan would save $300 million to $400 million annually. Ford also lowered its earnings expectations for the year by more than 40 percent and said it would take a $900 million after-tax charge, mostly to cover the job cuts.
Nasser said the layoffs were necessary because of the halting economy, heated competition in the industry, and the costs associated with the massive recall of Firestone tires.
"We don't see any factor that's going to restore the robustness of the economy" in the next 12 to 18 months, he said. "We keep asking ourselves what will it be, what action will happen in the economy that will stimulate confidence in buying again, and we just don't see it."
Mr. Nasser said Ford would evaluate its global operations, which include the Mazda Motor Corporation of Japan and the foreign brands Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin, to see where other cost-cutting measures might be needed.

To the Editor:
 Re "Global Arms Sales Rise Again, and the U.S. Leads the Pack" (news article, Aug. 20): 
 The $18.6 billion in United States arms contracts to developing countries will undoubtedly fuel further conflicts and costs to human security in this decade and in decades to come. 
The underlying causes of security failures in developing countries lie in poverty, which can be eliminated through growth in trade, education, health and economic investments.
Selling weapons to countries in conflict will only increase the level of threat and risk to the United States' domestic and international security. It is also immoral to exploit global conflict in developing countries.

HEADLINE: Reckonings; 
Fabricating A Crisis

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Last week the International Monetary Fund, which has no political stake in the debate over Social Security, told the prosaic truth: "the long-term financing problems of Social Security are not large" and "could be addressed through relatively small adjustments in the program's parameters." 
 But the Bush administration's hand-picked commission on Social Security reform -- which will meet behind closed doors tomorrow, violating the spirit if not the letter of the law -- wants you to believe that we must destroy the program in order to save it. To do this it must fabricate a crisis. 
 For example, the commission warns ominously about future financial shortfalls. It points out that in the year 2025 Social Security will pay $419 billion more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes. It would spoil the effect to mention that this will be only 1 percent of G.D.P. A real party-pooper would point out that the provisions of the Bush tax cut -- which the administration insists is easily affordable -- will reduce revenue in 2025 by $700 billion. 
The commission's analysis also somehow ignores the $6 trillion in surpluses that the Social Security system, which currently collects much more in payroll taxes than it pays in benefits, will run between now and 2025. Where will the money go? Of course, one interpretation of that mysterious disappearance is that the commission believes the surpluses will be used not to pay future benefits to retirees, but to cover the revenue lost because of the tax cut -- a revenue loss that the I.M.F. says will be almost twice as large as the administration admits.
It's true that the Social Security system will eventually have to change the way it invests its surpluses -- but only because it will face an embarrassment of riches. At the moment, Social Security surpluses are being used to pay off federal debt, a perfectly sound way to use the money. But because federal debt to the public is only $3 trillion, Social Security will eventually have to start buying private stocks and bonds. That is, unless big deficits reappear -- a project on which the Bush administration has made a good start. 
The commission claims that letting Social Security buy private assets would be a disaster, that unless retirees' money is placed into private accounts it will be squandered to serve political ends. But the I.M.F. argues that "such investments could be managed in a manner that would minimize the risk of political interference." That argument rests on hard evidence. State and local government pension funds own more than $2 trillion in private-sector assets, and after some highly publicized incidents of politicization in the early 1980's the record has been extremely clean. In fact, government-run pension funds have earned the same rate of return as private funds. 
Meanwhile, a system of private accounts would create a cash crisis, because baby boomers, whose payroll taxes help pay benefits to today's retirees, couldn't count on younger workers to do the same for them. Private accounts would also expose workers to a lot of risk, and managing millions of small individual accounts would be very expensive. 
That last point is important. A forthcoming study from the Congressional Budget Office suggests that as much as 30 percent of the value of private accounts would end up consumed by administrative costs. This compares with costs that are less than 1 percent of benefits in today's Social Security system.
The outlines of a plan that would sustain Social Security without destroying it are clear: Allow the system to invest some of its surplus in private assets, and close the system's modest long-run financial shortfall by making minor adjustments to benefits and rescinding part of the recent tax cut. After all, a recent study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the revenue lost because of the Bush tax cut will be more than twice the sum needed to secure Social Security without any reform at all for the next 75 years. The administration tried to refute that calculation, playing its usual game of statistical three-card monte -- "Look, honey, I just found $4 billion under the cushion, and 60 lines of stem cells too!" -- but the center's estimate matches those of the I.M.F. and other independent organizations. 
The truth is that the only serious threat to Social Security comes from those who want to panic us into junking the system, when all it needs are minor repairs.

HEADLINE: For Fall, Some Swash, Some Buckle and a Tougher Look 

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN 

 BODY:
Reflected in the windows of Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman last week were pedestrians in summertime straw and linen inspecting the latest crop of equestrian gear and racy peasant chic -- a reflection that if it's August in New York, it must be deep fall among the fashion peddlers.
 In the September issue of Vogue, 10 pages of Nadja Auermann throwing out rebel looks in thigh-high boots and furry Russian toques ("She'll lead you on with toques to die for," trills a caption for a fox) somehow jibe with what Anne Slowey, writing in Elle, found out about Russian women. They can't fill up fast enough on fashion's gaudy treats. And now, apparently, a lot of other women want to look like the Russians. They want the diamonds and killer boots. They want the naughty pink Gucci peasant blouse, the savage Dior furs, the pushiness of skintight Dolce & Gabbana flares. Above all, they want to look tough . . . She'll lead you on with toques to die for. 
 Even the model sitting poolside in this season's Versace advertisements, with a mansion rising up behind her like a cardboard Tara, has that grave and hungry look of Ms. Filler Up. 
So what gives with all this hard extravagance with the economy in a soft slump? Just fashion changing direction, looking for a fresh hit. Retail sales have been off since the end of last year, and nobody's hiding that fact. "It's tough out there," said Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's. "Our trunk shows haven't been doing as well as in previous seasons, and purse strings are tighter."
High on Mr. Ruttenstein's probable list of fall hits is the peasant look fueled by Tom Ford's collection for Yves Saint Laurent. This consists of nothing more than a ruched blouse made (preferably) of gauzy fabric and worn with a slim skirt or, better, tight, low-slung jeans in a vintage wash. Mr. Ruttenstein has such tops for as low as $98. To get the mother of these blouses, from Saint Laurent, with nicely done ruching, you add a zero and multiply by two.
A few blocks away, at Bergdorf Goodman, the windows had a Russian-peasant-bohemian theme going, with a souped-up Roberto Cavalli fur coat and more of Mr. Ford's modern Carmen collection. "If I had to pick one collection that expresses the season for us, it's without a doubt Saint Laurent," said Robert Burke, the fashion director of Bergdorf. "It appeals to a wide age group. It can be happy Gypsy or hippy bohemian." Such buzzy phrases aside, Mr. Burke said he thought the freewheeling Saint Laurent Gypsy story (with ankle-laced sandals, which now have a waiting list of customers) offered fashion seekers a respite from last fall's ladylike chic. "It leaves room for more self-expression," he said.
The clothes that are being pushed in stores and magazines first appeared on the runways six months ago, before anyone knew exactly what would fly. And in retrospect, those collections were like the biggest sneeze you ever saw -- a real head-clearer. Gone was the congestion of Park Avenue suits and prim coats reeking of the Colony, circa 1969. In its place came a slightly tougher chic, boy meets girl, with flat or low-heel boots; distressed leather or roughed-up shearling; minimal tops with funky couture embellishments; pinstripe or muddy plaid pants ($35 at H&M); the odd, scampering debutante in jodhpurs and a blanket cape closed with a snaffle-bit buckle. 
Both Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren chose last February to go that safe, secure horsy route. And, last week, store executives from Saks to Neiman Marcus said that these have been among their best-selling collections among early deliveries.
"The Kors riding pants have been selling out," said Joan Kaner, the fashion director of Neiman, adding that other strong sellers have been leather and suede jackets in dusky colors like whiskey and cognac and fur hats, especially those toques. "And we've been getting people who want to know when the Balenciaga shaped pantsuit is coming in," Ms. Kaner said. She was referring to Nicolas Ghesquiere's boned, nearly hourglass-shape jacket, which stood out as one of the more distinct silhouettes for fall. In fact, almost every store that carries Balenciaga, including Jeffrey and Barneys New York, has already sold much of what it has received, including a $900 satchel bag, which went quickly at Barneys.
Not everybody has gone horse crazy. "I can tell you, we don't have a single customer coming in the store saying, 'I want equestrian,' " Julie Gilhart, vice president for fashion merchandising at Barneys, said with a laugh. Which is not to say that Barneys isn't selling those Kors jodhpurs or Prada riding boots. Ms. Gilhart said that what sells is something unique, whether or not it falls into a broad buzz trend. Lace is an example. "It might be Victorian lace or mod lace, it doesn't matter -- it's selling," she said. "People want something that says to everyone else, 'This is mine, not yours.' They don't want to share."
And, in that spirit, one of the best-selling collections has been that of Comme des Garcons, based on corsets and lingerie lace, with accessories like strap-on conical bras to be worn over a jacket. Linda Dresner, the boutique on Park Avenue, keeps selling the same style of Comme des Garcons shoes right out of the window. Black and long of toe, with a jaunty rhinestone buckle, they look like something the offspring of a pilgrim and a rocker might wear.
Though people talk about self-expression, there is, not surprisingly, more consensus in what the leading magazines are showing than solidly individual points of view. Vogue has Linda Evangelista on its cover. And inside, for many pages, she gives the clothes she wears a real spark, an easy naturalness, that younger, blander models just can't pull off. But then it has Ms. Auermann sporting rocker raccoon in "The Wild Bunch," which is not too far from the "Call of the Wild" in Harper's Bazaar. 
Elle has toques, too -- piled with jewels, surrounded by lace and finished off with that familiar "From Russia With Love" opulence. But Elle also gives weight to a fall style that most other magazines ignored or overlooked: athletic-inspired clothes, from Dior to Chanel, and photographed for the magazine by Karl Lagerfeld.
While it remains to be seen how many souffle-size toques and capacious Elmer Fudd trapper hats will actually materialize on the streets this winter, one thing is certain: people will be walking a little closer to the ground. Flat boots are ubiquitous and selling -- including Gucci's over-the-knee boot, based on a 1960's Saint Laurent style, and Manolo Blahnik's midcalf biker boot.
As Ms. Kaner said, "It's boots, boots, boots."
Jeffrey Kalinsky, owner of Jeffrey, agreed: "The new shoe for fall is the boot. Last spring, the new pump was the mule."
As this was sinking in, Mr. Kalinsky was asked what the new pump for fall might be.
He paused, as if mentally running through his entire shoe inventory, which must be considerable, then said: "The boot is the new pump."

HEADLINE: Kalkan Journal; 
Come to Me, All You Big Spenders

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: KALKAN, Turkey, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
The village rises gently from the bright brimming bay on the Mediterranean, its whitewashed houses climbing the folds of the hills in a more or less orderly fashion.
 The place was once quiet and unchanging, a balance of fishermen and olive farmers where the brilliant sun and royal blue sea were the fortune. Today the measure is more conventional -- tourist dollars and real estate values. 
 "Kalkan is not spoiled, but some things could go wrong if we are not smart," Hakan Basoz, who traded teaching for running a tour company, said as he navigated his minivan along the road above the sea and pointed out the new houses and small hotels under construction.
Kalkan, with a year-round population of 1,500, is still peaceful. The only congestion is the occasional overflow of yachts in the marina. A few thousand tourists a season visit the shops and stay in the small hotels or at Club Patara, an elegant upscale resort. 
But Turkey is on the cusp of what many in the field predict will be phenomenal growth in tourism, and the people here along the Mediterranean in southwestern Turkey and in hundreds of other towns and cities are eager to share in the anticipated prosperity.
Expectations are especially high because as Turkey endures the worst economic crisis in its modern history tourism is the only sector that is thriving. The number of visitors is 20 percent ahead of last year, with a record 12.5 million tourists expected and revenues estimated at $10 billion.
Government officials portray tourism as the country's salvation, predicting a doubling of visitors and revenue in the next four to five years. Even more modest estimates forecast steady double-digit growth.
"For next year and after we aim at better figures with a better capacity for high-quality tourism," said Cengiz Yucel, head of research and development for the Association of Turkish Travel Agencies in Istanbul.
The demographics of tourism provide clues for where the country is today and where its travel industry and government hope it will be tomorrow.
Europeans see Turkey as a sun-drenched bargain, particularly with this year's devaluation of the Turkish currency. They tend to come on bargain tours and spend their time on the beaches of the Aegean and Mediterranean.
Germans are the most common tourists. Bypassing Istanbul and the historic sites, they flock to the all-inclusive vacation villages dotting the Mediterranean coast of southern Turkey. Russians and the British are next, followed by the Dutch and French.
Americans rank sixth, with about 500,000 visitors last year. They usually travel individually or in small groups and visit Istanbul and places of historic interest. Americans spend more money than other people -- an average of $1,268 per person compared with $769 by Germans and $502 by Russians, according to the Central Bank of Turkey.
With an international promotion budget of $30 million this year, the government is trying to keep the bargain tourists while making new appeals to bigger spenders from the United States, Japan and other more distant countries. Much of the new development is aimed at upscale tourists, with an emphasis on historic sites as well as the dazzling coastline.
The tourism industry was built up in the 1980's by the government through cheap loans and tax breaks for private investors. The way the government and developers handle the new push for growth will determine how places like Kalkan fare in the future.
Skimming across crystal clear water in his speedboat, Turhan Kaso pointed out the new road being carved into the hillside cupping the southern end of Kalkan Bay. "That is a monstrous mistake," he said. "They will ruin the view for many just to build houses for a few."
Mr. Kaso, an Istanbul architect and builder, first visited Kalkan in the 1970's. Though the area contains stunning Lycian tombs carved into cliffs and other ancient sites, he was in search of new places to dive. He found wonderful spots among the small islands outside the bay and returned many times.
For years, he dreamed of building a vacation house here. By the time he started work in the late 1980's the dream had grown a bit. The result was Club Patara, a honeycomb of 200 villas and a 60-room hotel nestled on a hillside across the bay from the village.
The development is a sharp contrast to the overbuilt and crowded vacation villages farther south toward Antalya. Mr. Kaso used natural stone, abundant greenery and earth tones on his gently rounded buildings to fit the resort with the environment. Trees and winding pathways conceal the houses. 
"I had no desire to destroy what brought me here in the first place," said Mr. Kaso, maneuvering his boat toward the dock. "I have a house here, too."
In the decade since Club Patara opened, Kalkan has undergone a slow, steady transition from rural village to tourist town. The ground floors of village houses that once held goats and sheep were cleaned up and turned into restaurants and carpet shops. Many larger homes became small hotels, all of which seem to have rooftop restaurants and menus in English. Instead of commercial fishing, boats are used for sport fishing or scuba diving.
As the growth pushed beyond the village boundaries, some people grew anxious. Mr. Basoz cited a larger village 20 miles away where uncontrolled building has damaged its character and charm.
He and others formed a foundation to limit growth in Kalkan. The mayor and other civic leaders were sympathetic and restrictions were approved. But the lure of tourist dollars is proving a difficult force to counter.
"My uncle owns 300,000 square meters of land" -- about 75 acres -- "on the far end of the bay and he wants to sell to a developer," Mr. Basoz said. "I tell him he needs to wait and we need orderly growth. But it's hard to wait."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
MajorGauges Move Higher in a Day of Careful Trading

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks were higher yesterday after an optimistic outlook from the home-improvement retailer Lowe's raised hopes that consumer spending would bolster the slowing economy. But activity was subdued in advance of an expected cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
 The Fed is expected to reduce interest rates for a seventh time this year to try to jump-start the economy, but money managers said they were more interested in whether the Fed thought the economy was picking up. 
 "Everyone's waiting for the Fed to see what it says," said Mark Coffelt, who helps manage Texas Capital's Value and Growth portfolio. "The key is their attitude. Hopefully, they'll say, ' The economy is recovering, but if it's not, we'll lower interest rates more.' " 
The Conference Board, a business research group, said its index of leading economic indicators scored a fourth consecutive month of gains in July, hinting that the economy could show signs of recovery in the months ahead.
Lowe's bright outlook also helped increase retailing stocks on optimism that consumer spending might remain strong.
"Consumer spending is the linchpin right now, and comments from Lowe's this morning suggest consumers are O.K.," said Crit Thomas, head of growth equities at National City Investment Management. "If consumers can tread water through the end of the year, we'll feel a lot more comfortable about the stock market."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 79.29 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 10,320.07. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 9.44 points, or 0.8 percent, to finish at 1,171.41. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 14.34 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,881.35.
About 890 million shares traded on the Big Board while 1.16 billion traded on the Nasdaq, making it the fourth-lightest session of the year.
Investors' focus was squarely on the Fed's next move. A poll of 25 primary dealers of United States government securities last Thursday found that they all expected the Federal Open Market Committee to cut the federal funds rate a quarter point today.
The Fed has already brought the federal funds rate on overnight bank lending down to 3.75 percent.
"People are just watching and waiting to find out what happens tomorrow," said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at the brokerage firm Advest. "There's a possibility they may cut rates by as much as 50 basis points, because the stock market has been languishing."
Lowe's climbed $2.80, to $37.84, after reporting that earnings rose 18 percent, as the homebuilding and remodeling markets remained healthy despite the slowing economy. The company also said income tax rebate checks had helped fuel some of a sales increase.
Among other retail building stocks, Home Depot rose 57 cents, to $49.80.

Treasury Prices Decline
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as traders worried about the Federal Reserve would signal that today's expected cut in interest rates might be the last for the year as the economy picks up.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 17/32, to a price of 100 25/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.90 percent from 4.83 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32, to 98 28/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.45 percent from 5.42 percent on Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Rose For the 4th Month in July 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators rose in July for a fourth consecutive month, suggesting that the economy will strengthen by the end of the year, a private research firm said today.
 The Conference Board's index, a gauge of economic activity over the next three to six months, rose 0.3 percent. That matched the increase in June and reflected a rise in the money supply and a drop in first-time claims for unemployment benefits. 
 The index is "flashing a signal that the economy will be doing better as we head into the second half of the year" after the weakest 12 months of growth since the last recession, said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. in New York.
The index of coincident indicators, a gauge of current economic activity, rose 0.1 percent in July after falling 0.1 percent in June. The index of lagging indicators dropped 0.7 percent last month, compared with a 0.9 percent decrease the previous month.
A combination of lower interest rates and advance tax refund checks that the government started mailing last month may spur the economy by enticing consumers to spend more at retailers.
The four-month string of gains in the leading indicators index is the first since October 1999 to January 2000. The Conference Board compiles the index from eight previously reported economic statistics and estimates of two others.
Still, corporate profits fell more than 16 percent in the second quarter, the worst performance since the third quarter of 1991, based on reports from 424 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Thomson Financial/ First Call.
Weak profits and sluggish growth help explain why Federal Reserve policy makers, at their meeting on Tuesday, are expected to lower the overnight lending rate between banks for a seventh time this year.
By lowering interest rates, the Fed "has moved to support demand and, we trust, help lay the groundwork for the economy to achieve maximum sustainable growth," Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told Congress last month.

HEADLINE: A Messenger to China Business; 
U.S.-Trained Telecom Chief Builds a New, Hybrid Model

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Edward Tian says he is on a mission to bring Western-style business practices to China. But what lured him back to his native land from Texas in 1995 was less a spirit of patriotism than a sense of insecurity.
 "I concluded there was very little chance I would become a successful entrepreneur like Jerry Yang," said Mr. Tian, comparing himself with the Chinese-American founder of Yahoo. "I was too old and my English wasn't good enough." 
 That's setting the bar pretty high. Mr. Tian, 38, is no slouch: he speaks rapid-fire English and holds a Ph.D. from Texas Tech University. And after starting a successful technology venture in Dallas, he was chosen by the Chinese government to run a pioneering state-owned company. 
Perhaps because of his credentials and his keen ambition, Mr. Tian has faced sky-high expectations ever since he became chief executive of the company, China Netcom, in 1999. And as the fledgling telecommunications company has hit some bumps, managing those expectations has become an unavoidable part of his job.
China Netcom was started at the urging of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who hoped to create a class of state-owned, but Western-style companies able to take on the hulking state monopolies. Netcom's main business is delivering high-speed data communications; its chief rival is China Telecom, the leviathan that dominates voice and data traffic.
With Mr. Zhu's blessing and four other powerful backers -- the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the ministry of railways, the Shanghai municipal government and the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television -- Netcom seemed destined to be at the vanguard of the nation's economic transformation.
It has not worked out that way, at least not yet. The sluggish pace of deregulation, China's murky political environment, the drying up of capital markets and the woes of the global telecommunications industry have conspired against China Netcom's efforts to build a franchise. Far from defining the future, Mr. Tian is being carried along by events largely out of his control.
"Edward is the poster child for the opening of China's corporate sector," said Duncan Clark, managing director of BDA China Ltd., a consulting firm in Beijing. "But he wants to be more than a catalyst. And Netcom is having trouble adjusting to the massive shifts in the industry."
Few experts are ready to dismiss Mr. Tian. His strategic vision remains compelling and his political connections are golden. (Netcom's investors include Jiang Mianheng, the son of President Jiang Zemin.) But Mr. Tian's troubles are a case study in how hard it is to compete in China, where each step forward can be thwarted by arbitrary regulations and baffling politics.
"If there is anyone who can take on the bureaucracy and make an impact, it is him," said Henry Lee, managing director of Hendale Asset Management in Hong Kong. "Will the bureaucrats let him? Only time will tell."
Mr. Tian professes to be unfazed by the hurdles. Sitting in his elegantly appointed office in Netcom's headquarters here, and flanked by an antique statue of a Chinese warrior, he offers his views on why China is the world's most promising market for data communications services.
In part, it is the familiar argument that size matters: China already has 25 million Internet users who represent just 2 percent of the population. In five years, Mr. Tian says, China will have 300 million Internet devices of one kind or another: laptop computers, hand-held electronic organizers, mobile phones.
In contrast to the United States, where the Internet developed in an anarchic manner, in China the government has tightly regulated companies that can provide Internet access and other data services. China Telecom has the bulk of the business while Netcom and a handful of smaller companies fight for the rest.
The lack of competition, Mr. Tian said, means that a company with the right licenses and political connections can build up a valuable franchise. By regulating the number of new entrants, he said, China can avoid the surplus of fiber optic networks in the United States and Europe.
"You can learn from the mistakes of other countries," Mr. Tian said. "Since we have a clean sheet of paper, we can do it right."
To serve this virgin market, China Netcom has laid a 5,300-mile fiber optic network, known as an Internet backbone, through 17 cities from Beijing in the north to Guangzhou in the south. The first phase of the network, completed last October, soaked up much of the company's initial financing of $300 million.
All this is a remarkable feat for the son of two scientists, who a decade ago was in Lubbock, Tex., researching a thesis on a type of poisonous weed that grows in Texas. After earning his Ph.D., Mr. Tian moved in 1993 to Dallas, where he and a partner, James Ding, searched the Chinese-American community, trying to attract investors for a venture that was to provide online information about China.
Among those they approached was Henry Lee, then a money manager for the Bass brothers. Mr. Lee recalls Mr. Tian as a fountain of ideas, brimming with enthusiasm. Still, Mr. Lee turned him down, in part because a China venture seemed too far afield for his employers who were known for real estate investments. He also questioned how Mr. Tian's online service could compete against media giants like Reuters.
Mr. Tian and Mr. Ding retooled the venture into a systems integration company, AsiaInfo Holdings. They moved the company to Beijing in 1995, and it was listed that way on the Nasdaq stock market last year. Mr. Ding remains its chief executive.
Given Mr. Tian's ambition, his friends said it was no surprise that he would leap at the chance to do something grander. But there was another motive. Even in Texas, where Mr. Tian said he acquired a taste for country music, barbecue and square dancing, his homeland always beckoned.
"He's got a patriotic fervor that sets him apart from other Chinese capitalists, who are purely profit-driven," Mr. Lee said.
At the same time, Mr. Tian wants to build a money-making enterprise. And he does not have the necessary tools yet.
While his network is as sophisticated as that of China Telecom, Netcom lacks local connections to hundreds of millions of customers. Mr. Tian's business model requires that the government break China Telecom's stranglehold on the nation's local and long-distance phone service.
Beijing has taken some steps in that direction. It detached China Telecom's mobile phone operation and set it up as a separate, publicly traded company, China Mobile. It took the company's paging network and handed it to a rival cellular company, China Unicom, which also trades in New York and Hong Kong.
And it has announced vague plans to carve up the rump China Telecom and take all or part of it public. But a stock offering has been shelved while competing ministries haggle over how to divide the company's assets. These include the local and long-distance networks, as well as the data network, which carries more than 80 percent of the country's traffic.
"Deregulation is going to happen, but it's going to take time," said X. D. Yang, a managing director for Asia at the Carlyle Group, a private investment firm. Mr. Yang, in his previous job as a banker at Goldman, Sachs, negotiated the firm's $60 million investment in China Netcom.
While the politicking continues in Beijing, China Telecom maintains its dominance in Mr. Tian's market. So Netcom must make do by pushing into ancillary markets, where it can find opportunities. These businesses range from Internet data centers to prepaid Internet telephone cards.
Originally, Netcom was to be a Chinese version of Qwest or Level 3, a wholesaler of capacity on its network. It has turned into an eclectic purveyor of telecommunications services. For all that, analysts estimate that Netcom generated just $36.5 million in sales last year.
Now, the company is changing course again, focusing on providing data services to big corporate customers. By the end of the year, Netcom plans to wire 700 office buildings in 33 cities with broadband connections. It will then link the buildings to its fiber optic network and Internet data centers, covering what it estimates to be 70 percent of China's corporate market.
"This company has undergone one of the biggest restructurings I've ever seen in the last six months," said Peter Lovelock, an analyst at MadeforChina.com, a technology consulting company in Beijing.
Mr. Tian acknowledges that his protean business plan has confused some investors. "I still face a lot of difficulty explaining the opportunity of the Chinese market to the outside world, especially the investor community," he said.
In addition to Goldman, Sachs, others who have invested in Netcom -- $325 million in total -- include Dell Computer, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the Bank of China and the China Construction Bank.
The financing was an endorsement of Mr. Tian's vision. But it imposes an extra layer of scrutiny. Mr. Tian submits a financial report to his investors each month. He said Netcom was losing money -- he would not say how much -- but he predicted that it would break even in two years.
Goldman, Sachs, for one, is not anxious about Netcom's bottom line. "We take a very long-term view on China," said S. Shirley Lin, managing director of Goldman's direct investment arm in Asia.
Mr. Tian said the investors help by offering him advice on how to build and run a commercial enterprise. He said this was his toughest challenge -- tougher even than navigating the Chinese bureaucracy.
Netcom has almost 3,000 employees, and is adding 200 a month. Mr. Tian recruited Western-educated Chinese from companies like Microsoft, Oracle and McKinsey, the consulting firm, as top executives. Now, he must hire middle managers able to run a fiber optic network and sell advanced services.

Still, in a country that believes one man can make history, China Netcom remains inextricably linked to Edward Tian.

HEADLINE: Survey Indicates Business Travel May Pick Up 

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
The sharp drop in business travel may be beginning to bottom out, a survey of travel managers indicated yesterday, but experts in the $185-billion-a-year industry warned that strong growth is unlikely to return for quite a while to airlines and hotels that cater to the corporate market.
 The National Business Travel Association released a survey of travel managers at 200 domestic companies that found increased optimism about sending more people on the road. The survey, conducted from Aug. 9 to Aug. 14, indicated that 16 percent of the travel managers plan on spending more on business trips next year, while 57 percent said they would spend at the same level as this year. 
 "Corporations are going to begin resuming business travel, but they're going to continue being cautious," said Marianne McInerney, executive director of the group. 
"This is the first time this year that we've seen a signal that the cutbacks are ending," she said. But it is "a yellow light," she added, "not a green light."
As a result, airlines in particular are facing further intense competition for the corporate traveler.
This year, as the business travel market plunged, corporate managers took the opportunity to negotiate lower-priced contracts with airlines and other suppliers. Even when more normal times resume, Ms. McInerney said, airlines and hotels will need to "show a willingness to pare back" some of the highly optimistic revenue projections they made in recent years based on dependable, sharp annual rises in air fares and hotel room rates.
In the survey, slightly over half of the travel managers said they negotiated discounts of up to 10 percent this year as airlines and hotels scrambled to hang on to a share of the smaller number of business customers, who account for about two-thirds of revenue for domestic airlines.
Travel industry analysts warned that projections that business travel would double over the next five years should be treated cautiously. Instead, some said, tighter corporate travel policies widely adopted in the last six months requiring more use of lower-fare advance-purchase air tickets, and less expensive hotel chains, are likely to curtail big gains.
"We're not going to get back to the normal routine," said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, an airline consulting firm. "The economics of air travel have changed. While business travel is not going to decline, it's not going to grow anything like some people say it will."
This year, Mr. Boyd said, airlines stung by declining revenues from corporate travel have rapidly shifted to smaller planes on many popular business routes, in new strategies to extract more yield per flight from the highest-paying customers.
On such routes, "you might cut your costs in half, but you keep those 40 key business passengers that you want to keep," he said.
Airlines will be intent on renewing their appeals to their most prized passengers once a more normal business climate returns, analysts said. Many of those passengers are business travelers whose schedules and preferences make them less likely than leisure travelers to accept the restrictions of the cheapest coach fares, even if they are traveling on less expensive tickets than before. But at the top of the industry's food chain are the most frequent travelers, who are more likely to expect the comforts of business-class or first-class travel, either through upgrades or by paying premium fares.
Especially on long-haul flights, many airlines are anticipating greater competition for those passengers, even though business travelers in general are notably resistant to competitive lures because they are bonded by frequent-flier bonus programs to certain carriers.
"Without question the biggest driver in the corporate traveler's airline choice is frequent-flier miles," said Martin Mosley, the marketing director for North America, Central America and Asia for LanChile, the Chilean airlines. "But I think convenience and comfort is right up there these days." 
For frequent fliers on domestic flights, one of the more striking experiences in recent months has been the easy availability of upgrades from coach to first-class seats.
Today, especially on domestic airlines, "first class is full of frequent-flier upgrades," Mr. Mosley said. "What used to be prestigious is no longer."
Like many other airlines that regard the premium-cabin passenger as their main profit center, LanChile has expanded business-class seating on its long-haul flights. But LanChile, like other international carriers that depend heavily on passengers paying premium fares, tries to keep the front-of-the-plane seats for customers paying full freight.
On LanChile, Mr. Mosley said, "we'll let seats go empty versus upgrading somebody just for the sake of it."
"We feel that the people who paid for a first-class or business-class seat feel that they should be sitting next to other people who paid for a first-class or business-class seat. They don't want to sit next to someone who's upgraded their way in. We're very strong on not devaluing the product."
In general, airlines, and especially domestic carriers in the United States, do not like talking directly about such class distinctions. But once business travel again hits its stride, many carriers can be expected to market more aggressively the service, the comfort and the status associated with premium-class seating at premium fares.
Last year, in moves that were later imitated by other carriers, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, two competitors on the lucrative trans-Atlantic routes, completed expensive outlays on expanded business-class cabins, with seats that fold down into beds and amenities like preflight meals in private airport lounges and, on Virgin, in-flight massages.
Despite the current recession in business travel, that trend appears to be slowly continuing, even as revenues have dropped and passenger load fallen.
For example, Singapore Airlines announced last week that it is spending $100 million to expand its business-class cabins, including adding flat-bed seats, on its 45 long-haul 747 and 777 aircraft. The same day, Cathay Pacific Airways, noting British Airway's success with its new premium services, said it was planning to expand its own long-haul business-class cabins.
British Airway's strategy has been "to reduce overall capacity and really focus on the front of the airplane," said John Lampl, a spokesman for the carrier.
"They're all going to be doing it," Mr. Boyd said. Whatever their loyalties from frequent-flier programs, airlines will need to work harder to put a greater percentage of premium passengers in their seats, he continued. "That's where the money is. The money is that business traveler."

Evaporating Budget Surplus Sets Up a Political Battle
Both the White House and Congress are set to confirm that the budget surplus outside of Social Security has all but evaporated for the next few years, and Democrats are planning to intensify their attacks on President Bush's fiscal management.
 The combination of the administration's tax cut and the slowing economy has shaved roughly $120 billion from the surplus for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, administration officials and Congressional budget analysts said. That should leave the surplus for the year at about $160 billion. Page A1.

HEADLINE: U.S. BALKS ON PLAN TO GET PLUTONIUM OUT OF WARHEADS 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
A program conceived by the Clinton administration to rid the world of 100 tons of American and Russian weapons-grade plutonium is likely to be abandoned by the Bush administration, according to people who have been briefed about the project.
 Under the plan, which was first proposed in the mid-90's, 50 tons of American plutonium and 50 tons of Russian plutonium would be taken out of nuclear weapons and either converted into fuel for nuclear reactors or rendered useless for weapons by mixing it with with highly radioactive nuclear waste, a process known as immobilization. 
 When the plan was drafted, Clinton administration officials said the program would reduce the risk that the plutonium would fall into the wrong hands, where it could easily be turned into weapons.
By reducing the availability of weapons-grade plutonium, the project had the added benefit of bolstering treaties between the United States and Russia to cut the number of nuclear warheads deployed by each side, by making it harder to turn plutonium from decommissioned weapons back into warheads. 
Bush administration officials deny that the program is dead, but acknowledge that it has difficulties, primarily financial ones.
"The issue is under review," said an administration official who would speak only if not identified. "We've made no secret of that. But no decisions have been made."
But the official continued, "It's no secret that there are a lot of equities to balance here."
One major equity, he said, is money. Early this year the Energy Department predicted a cost of $6.6 billion, about triple the initial estimates, to convert the American stocks to fuel for civilian nuclear reactors. It put Russia's cost at $1.76 billion, which is money Russia does not have.
The expectation under the Clinton administration was that the United States and other rich countries would help pay, but no concrete pledges were ever made.
In 1999 the Clinton administration did agree to pay a consortium of power companies $130 million to use plutonium that the government would convert into fuel. But the conversion factories are not yet built, and the conversion itself was contingent on an agreement with the Russians to take similar steps to dispose of plutonium from their weapons.
Despite the program's expected benefits, the Bush administration's proposed Energy Department budget this spring did not include the money needed to mix some of the plutonium with nuclear waste. 
The second path -- converting it to fuel for American nuclear reactors, the strategy the Clinton administration hoped would induce the Russians to do the same -- also appears likely to be dropped soon.
"There is no enthusiasm for it whatsoever," said a Congressional aide who was briefed by officials of the National Security Council, referring both to the current strategy of immobilization and to conversion to reactor fuel. 
The issue of what to do with plutonium from decommissioned nuclear weapons has haunted policy makers for years. 
One particular fear is that the material from Russian weapons would be bought or stolen by terrorists or a "rogue" government who could construct a nuclear bomb. In recent years, the security of bomb materials in Russia has been improved markedly by joint Russian-American efforts, administration experts say.
Bush administration officials insist that they share the goal of disposing of American and Russian plutonium. 
"There's no philosphical shift that says suddenly we're perfectly fine with surplus plutonium laying around -- we're not," said an administration official familiar with the Clinton-era program. But, he added, conversion to fuel for existing reactors or mixing with waste are "not the only options for disposing of it safely." 
As an alternative, the Bush administration appears to be considering a variety of untested technical options, including a new generation of nuclear reactors that could burn plutonium more thoroughly.
"They're trying to improve on it by giving up on getting started any time soon," said Matthew G. Bunn, a nuclear expert at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who was an adviser to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Clinton administration.
He and other experts are skeptical that a new generation of reactors, which was also mentioned in President Bush's energy plan as a way to dispose of nuclear waste, would ever be built. Construction on the last nuclear plants built in the United States country was begun more than 25 years ago.
"We're back at Square 1 with the program, and they're looking at imaginary options, like advanced reactors," said Tom Clements, executive director the Nuclear Control Institute, a nonprofit group that opposes the use of plutonium for reactor fuel. "For financial reasons, it's not going to be viable."
Though the administration is considering dropping the program to convert or immobilize weapons-grade plutonium, a separate Russian-American program to reduce the inventory of another Russian bomb fuel, highly enriched uranium, is continuing. In fact, uranium that was intended for Russian bombs now meets more than half the needs of American power reactors. 
But diluting uranium to the type used in power plants is technically far simpler and cheaper than the process required for plutonium, which must be converted from the metal form used in weapons to a plutonium-uranium ceramic used in American power plants. 
In fact, enriched uranium has economic value as reactor fuel, while converting plutonium appears to be a money-losing proposition.
Even so, Russian officials have said repeatedly that they view plutonium as an asset and would like to build new breeder reactors, so named because they produce plutonium faster than they consume the other main reactor fuel, uranium.
The end of the plutonium program would be mixed news for groups concerned with proliferation. 
For example, the Nuclear Control Institute has pushed vigorously for immobilization and against converting plutonium to reactor fuel, which is known as mixed oxide, or MOx.
Officials of the institute say conversion to MOx is very expensive and would encourage international commerce in weapons material. 
"We think their assessment of MOx is correct," said Mr. Clements, referring to the administration. "The problem is, it appears they've also rejected the cheaper alternative, which is immobilization."

HEADLINE: On California's Urban Border, Praise for Immigration Curbs 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: IMPERIAL BEACH, Calif. 

 BODY:
Not too long ago in this coastal city south of San Diego and a stone's throw from Mexico, residents said they felt under siege.
 Rick B'Tello, who manages the beachfront Seacoast Inn, said Border Patrol agents routinely chased illegal immigrants up the beach, each time prompting about half of his horrified guests to check out of the hotel. At the Tijuana Estuary, a national wildlife refuge, Brian Collins, a biologist, said illegal crossers trampled rare plants and the nests of endangered birds on their furtive way north, sometimes even eating the birds' eggs for breakfast. 
 Worse, Imperial Beach officials said, the hordes passing through -- the Border Patrol said it once arrested more than 2,000 immigrants here in one 24-hour period -- gave this city with a population of about 26,000 a negative image that kept families and visitors away.
These days, though, the wildlife refuge is peaceful, tourists are coming in droves, and more people are moving in than out. Residents here mostly credit Operation Gatekeeper, the federal government's seven-year-old effort to strictly guard the westernmost 66 miles of the California-Mexico border. 
The Border Patrol's tighter enforcement, which has been spreading east to Arizona and Texas as well, has been widely condemned by human rights advocates for channeling immigrants into remote mountains and deserts, where hundreds of them have died of exposure. But in urban areas like Imperial Beach that took the brunt of the illegal traffic, grateful residents say the stepped-up vigilance has all but sealed the once popular smuggling routes across their beaches, parks and backyards and helped revive the area's economy and improve the quality of life.
Among the signs of prosperity in this working-class bedroom community are higher occupancy rates at hotels and record attendance for beach events like the U.S. Open Sandcastle competition, a 28 percent increase in home prices this year and neighborhoods no longer disturbed by large groups of illegal immigrants and the armed federal agents who trailed them.
"When I hear comments that Operation Gatekeeper doesn't work, well, it's worked for us," said Imperial Beach's mayor, Diane Rose. "Suddenly, people feel comfortable walking along the beach with their children in the evening. Your evenings are not disrupted anymore. People want to live here."
The quality-of-life problems of border communities are not well publicized, and they are not the kind of issue that makes or breaks government policy. But some immigration experts say these problems add another point of view to a national debate that has lately focused on the risks to the illegal immigrants. A General Accounting Office report released in August said that other communities where border enforcement had increased had experienced economic improvement and lower rates of crimes like theft.
In Nogales, Ariz., officials reported that as crossings declined, many small convenience stores that catered to illegal immigrants went out of business and large retailers took their place, attracting legal shoppers from both sides of the border. In Brownsville, Tex., shoplifting incidents dropped and a park near the Rio Grande is used again by families, the accounting office reported.
"This isn't just a matter of whether the neighborhood is messy," said Mark S. Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, which advocates immigration controls. "People have a right to expect that their neighborhood isn't going to host this kind of civic disorder. It affects how secure people feel."
The heavy use of urban areas like Imperial Beach for illegal crossings, Border Patrol officials say, stemmed from the relatively easy access the western end of the border afforded immigrants looking for work in places like Los Angeles. At one point, it was estimated that 25 percent of all crossings along the 2,000-mile Southwestern border came through the westernmost five miles starting at the Pacific Ocean.
But a turnaround began in 1994 when the Immigration and Naturalization Service focused resources along its San Diego sector -- installing lights and ground sensors; more than doubling the number of Border Patrol agents, to 2,000; completing fencing along 47 miles of the border and starting a new secondary fence as reinforcement.
Johnny N. Williams, director of the service's western regional office, said the San Diego sector of the border was now under control, with a 30-year low in immigrant arrests and drug seizures also sharply down. 
A recent tour along the first few miles of the border attests to the transformation -- once a wild stretch populated by border crossers, smugglers, bandits and federal agents in pursuit, the area was deserted except for the occasional Border Patrol vehicle. Only six men were seen biding their time on the Tijuana side of the corrugated steel fence that serves as the international boundary. 
But while San Diego was calming down, the illegal traffic shifted elsewhere, and arrests of illegal immigrants rose in other border areas, like Douglas, Ariz. In those places, the G.A.O. found, residents now complain of loss of business, destruction of private property and environmental degradation.
More troubling, by moving eastward to more dangerous terrain, many illegal immigrants have died from exposure to extreme heat or cold while trying to cross. The high death toll -- more than 1,000 known deaths in the last four years alone, according to Border Patrol figures -- and the increased illegal flow through other points of the border have led to criticism by civil rights advocates that Operation Gatekeeper is not only ineffective but inhumane.
"This is not about quality of life but life itself," said William Aceves, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego and Imperial Counties, one of the groups that have taken their complaints to the human rights commissions of the Organization of American States and the United Nations.
Many border residents said they had mixed feelings about the immigrants themselves, but not about relaxing their end of the border. 
Some residents noted that many crossers had also died here, drowned in lagoons or run over by cars in mad dashes across the freeway. Even today, parts of I-5 south of San Clemente have chain-link fencing on medians and "Caution" signs with the silhouettes of a man, a woman and a child in pigtails hurrying along.
Even those torn about the plight of the illegal immigrants, like Melissa Espinosa, 24, a second-generation Mexican-American, said they supported Operation Gatekeeper. Ms. Espinosa said she was not allowed to play in certain areas while growing up in the San Diego section of San Ysidro to avoid encounters with crossers. When she was a teenager, she said, federal agents stopped her on the street regularly, asking her to name the governor of California to check her citizenship status.
But her exasperation with the immigrants often gave way to compassion. She used to give directions to some who were mistakenly headed back to Mexico, she said, and sometimes alerted them to Border Patrol agents nearby. "I felt sorry for them, but it was very invasive," said Ms. Espinosa, a waitress.
Bud Harbin, 64, a former member of the Imperial Beach City Council who said he could count as many as 70 illegal immigrants passing through his neighborhood most nights, said the trespassers had stolen four of his cars, crouched down in his bushes and once hid in a room of his house. On many nights, he said, women in the neighborhood who lived alone or whose husbands were out would call on him to check on a noise or a prowler.
Not all border residents are delighted with the enforcement. A few miles east, in San Ysidro and Otay Mesa in the southern part of the city of San Diego, views of the illegal immigrants are tempered by economic ties that draw millions of crossers from Mexico to the area legally, many to shop. 
In those parts, people say they are more troubled that the government is using resources to curb the illegal traffic that could go to paying for more inspectors so that legal crossers do not have to wait for hours to have their documents checked. 
"We could be using the money to open up legal gates," said Alejandra Mier y Teran, executive director of the Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce. "I view it as an opportunity cost. Our businesses are losing money because of this."
But in Imperial Beach, residents worry about how long the enforcement will be maintained. The immigration agency's strategy is to increase control of the border in phases, but attrition within the Border Patrol is a big concern, as is the question of whether the agency will continue to receive adequate financing to stem the flow of illegal immigrants. 
"We would never allow it to go back to what it was before," Mayor Rose said. "We couldn't afford it economically. We have to make sure the resources we need happen."

HEADLINE: Citing Drop in Surplus, Democrats Plan to Portray Bush as Reckless 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
With both the White House and Congress set to confirm that the budget surplus outside of Social Security has all but evaporated for the next few years, Democrats are planning to intensify their attacks on President Bush's fiscal management and to pin blame for the weakened economy on the White House.
 Following up on their arguments of earlier this year that Mr. Bush's tax cut would prove unaffordable, Democrats said they were confident that the administration would pay a political price for breaching informal agreements between the two parties not to spend any of the excess tax revenue generated by Medicare and Social Security. 
 White House officials said the tax cut would ultimately restore the economy's health and drive the surplus up again. In linking the declining surplus to Social Security and Medicare, the officials said, Democrats were engaging in scare tactics. But they said they were resigned to a political battle throughout the fall over who lost the surplus and what to do about it. 
In a sign of the rising political stakes, Mr. Bush is scheduled to speak about the budget outlook in Missouri on Tuesday. Administration officials said his theme would be that the real threat to the surplus was not the tax cut but excessive spending by Congress.
The combination of the tax cut and the slowing economy has shaved roughly $120 billion from the surplus for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, administration officials and Congressional budget analysts said. 
That should leave the surplus for the year at about $160 billion, all or nearly all of which would be accounted for by Social Security receipts.
The White House will release its updated budget projections on Wednesday. The Congressional Budget Office will publish its figures next week. The White House version is likely to show that the government used up most of the $30 billion Medicare surplus this year but barely avoided dipping into the Social Security surplus, in part because of a last-minute accounting change disclosed by the administration last week.
The Congressional analysis is likely to vary somewhat from the White House projection. 
In economic terms, it makes little or no difference whether the government spends a few billion dollars of the Social Security surplus in a given year. But the political ramifications could be enormous, given that both parties have worked hard in recent years to establish the Social Security surplus as an unbreachable bulwark against fiscal irresponsibility and as a vehicle to pay off the national debt.
White House officials said the government was still in sound fiscal condition, that the economy would improve next year and that Democrats were being irresponsible by suggesting to voters that the diminished surplus could imperil Social Security benefits.
"We would like to get beyond the politics of trust funds and Social Security and figure out a solution to reinvigorating economic growth," said Chris Ullman, a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget. "That should be our joint endeavor."
To draw attention to their argument that the tax cut was excessive and will imperil the surplus for years to come, Democrats intend to run television commercials in some cities starting on Tuesday saying that Mr. Bush has proven to be reckless in managing the surplus.
"This is a much broader issue than just the budget," said Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "This goes to the total mismanagement of our economy."
Democratic leaders are using the diminishing surplus figures to bolster their argument that the administration does not have the money to pursue its plan to create private investment accounts in Social Security, to finance its national missile defense or to make good on its pledge to increase spending on education.
And when Congress returns to Washington after Labor Day to begin working in earnest on next year's spending bills, Democrats said they would go all out to make clear to voters that the painful budget trade-offs now faced by Congress were a result of Mr. Bush's overreaching with his tax cut.
"He inherited the strongest economy in a generation and the largest surpluses in history," said Thomas S. Kahn, staff director for the Democrats on the House Budget Committee, "and in a few months we've seen those surpluses slip through our fingers." 
"The administration," Mr. Kahn added, "is going to have to do some explaining."
But beyond casting blame and saying "I told you so," Democrats have no clear strategy. For one thing, 12 Democrats in the Senate and 28 in the House voted for the tax cut, so the party cannot claim united opposition to Mr. Bush on the issue.
Moreover, with memories of the drubbing the party took at the polls after supporting President Bill Clinton's tax increase in 1993 still fresh, Democrats have expressed little enthusiasm for rolling back Mr. Bush's tax cut to build a bigger fiscal buffer, especially while the economy remains weak.
Having worked hard for years to establish themselves as guardians of fiscal responsibility, Democrats are also loath to risk giving up the high ground in the fiscal debate by voting for spending bills this fall that would eat up more of the Medicare and Social Security surpluses. At the same time, they want the blame for any unpopular spending cuts to rest with the administration.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House, said on the NBC program "Meet the Press" on Sunday that the administration should propose a new budget that would detail the spending cuts necessary to keep the budget from dipping into Social Security money. And he raised the possibility that provisions of the tax cut that are not scheduled to take effect for a number of years could be delayed if the surplus disappeared.
But he suggested that Democrats, in the end, might feel compelled to go along with restrictive spending bills, precisely the response White House officials have said all along that they wanted the tax cut to demand of both parties in Congress.
"Let's look at where we are," Mr. Gephardt said. "Given what's happened in this economy, given that we're now going into the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, we've got to review everything that we've done."
Both parties have found that fiscal responsibility and paying off the national debt are concepts that resonate with voters. Yet neither party is sure how politically powerful those policies are, especially when the economy is weak and most people are more concerned about jobs and incomes than the nuances of fiscal policy.
Strategists from both parties said the administration was clearly betting that the economy would turn around relatively quickly, and that any political peril regarding the surplus would be paved over by renewed growth and job creation before the midterm Congressional elections next year. In its budget update, the administration will project economic growth next year of 3.2 percent, a more robust projection than most private economists are making.
"What you've got going on here is a high-level game of budget chicken, in which both sides are waiting to see who's going to screw up and be blamed for having crossed that line," said Leon E. Panetta, who was budget chief and chief of staff in the Clinton administration.

HEADLINE: A Growth Industry Cools As New York Prisons Thin 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
With the number of inmates in state prisons across the country either stabilizing or dropping after decades of explosive growth, New York is taking early steps to reduce its prison staffing significantly. 
 The Department of Correctional Services has frozen hiring at 36 prisons across the state, and hopes to eliminate 614 prison jobs through attrition by March, forcing corrections officers to begin to grapple with something they never imagined possible. New York City's plummeting crime rate might cost them their jobs if the goal is not met through attrition and might deliver a further blow to communities already braving a slowing economy. 
 The change in New York, where officials project the decrease in the inmate population to be about 9 percent, is threatening the livelihoods of people like Alan Ada.
In the mid-1980's, he surveyed his options in Cape Vincent, N.Y., a tiny resort town on the Canadian border, and decided to follow the calling of thousands of other young people upstate. Children of laid-off paper-mill workers and struggling dairy farmers, they chose a booming field that most never dreamed of, but that offered a steady salary, a pension and health insurance. Like them, he became a corrections officer. 
New York City quickly proved him wise. Desperate to ease overcrowding in its jails, the city built a $90 million jail in Cape Vincent in 1988 near the banks of the St. Lawrence River and began flying inmates north on twice-weekly jet shuttles nicknamed "Con Air." 
The new prison allowed Mr. Ada to get a steady job in the place where he was born and raised, a rare feat in Cape Vincent, a town of 2,400 in the Thousand Islands wilderness that falls silent when the leaves turn and the summer tourists depart. 
As the number of inmates in New York soared in the 1990's, the state took over the prison, doubling its population and work force. Across upstate New York, shrinking rural communities and their legislators clamored and competed for prisons, a seemingly recession-proof industry. But the boom times are coming to a jarring end. 
"Who ever thought crime would go down?" asked Tim Munroe, a corrections officer who has worked in the Cape Vincent Correctional Facility for 12 years. "Who ever thought we would run out of inmates?" 
Officials in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Texas -- states also experiencing declines in their prison population -- said they had no plans to reduce their prison work forces. Experts caution that it is not yet known whether the nationwide prison population is dropping or simply stabilizing. But if the decline becomes a clear trend, hundreds of small, rural prison towns across the country could find themselves confronted by the same unnerving news as Cape Vincent.
"Regions and towns that have based their whole economies on prisons are going to be confronted with some really serious problems," said Michael Jacobson, a professor of criminology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "This is going to be a problem for the governor and Legislature. In the same way towns lobbied to open prisons, they are going to lobby against closing them."
In New York, a continued drop would bring a halt to what has served as a de facto economic development program in the state's isolated corners -- prison growth. Assailed by critics as a shortsighted use of state resources and defended by supporters as necessary for public safety, New York's sprawling 70-facility, $2.4-billion-a-year prison system pours hundreds of millions of dollars into the upstate economy each year.
The dependence bred by nearly 30 years of unchecked prison growth is evident in isolated Cape Vincent, where deer nibble on grass near the prison, wild turkeys wander the roads and Canadian radio stations dot the airwaves. Prison employees expressed fear, anger and suspicion about the state's plan and complained of low morale and management problems. A group of corrections officers met with H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller and a candidate for governor, this month to express concerns about cutbacks.
The vast majority of officers interviewed asked not to have their names published because they feared losing their jobs. Corrections officers' salaries start at $33,000 and rise to $48,000 in 20 years.
"When they say the crime rate is down, it's just a political thing," scoffed Mr. Ada, one of several officers who questioned whether the rates are actually dropping. "I think it's just something for the politicians to make them look good." 
Mr. Ada, who is also the local fire chief, complained that proposed changes in the so-called Rockefeller drug laws would further reduce the prison population, and he was convinced that crime continues unabated downstate. "All you have to do is look at the New York City news," he said.
The supervisor in Cape Vincent, Tom Rienbeck, said that the prison is the community's second-largest employer after its public schools, and that the state's goal of cutting 168 of the prison's 528 jobs through attrition would hurt.
"Anytime you lose that many jobs, it's something to worry about," Mr. Rienbeck said, adding that he, too, never dreamed the prison population would drop. "You always figure you're going to have criminals. It's like being a doctor, you figure there are always going to be sick people."
Mr. Rienbeck and corrections officers expressed worry that the state would not reach its goal through attrition and that layoffs would be necessary. "There are maybe a handful of people close to retirement," Mr. Ada said. 
James B. Flateau, a spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services, said the Cape Vincent's prison has lost 26 officers, for example, through attrition since April 2000. The state's goal is to lose 117 officers and 51 civilian employees by next March, but Mr. Flateau emphasized that the figures are only targets. He said that the department expects to meet its goal statewide and that higher attrition in other prisons could make up for less in an area like Cape Vincent. 
Groups that criticized explosive prison growth in the past are using the slowdown to again call for change. Jennifer Wynn, director of the Prison Visiting Project for the Correctional Association of New York, questioned the wisdom of making prisons such a large economic force in upstate New York.
"Since 1982, New York has opened 38 new prisons, every one of them in a rural upstate community that relies on prisoners -- mostly poor people of color from New York City -- to fuel the local economy," she said. "Maybe it's time to invest in more positive and sustainable industries than warehousing people."
Several upstate county governments may also have miscalculated. For the last decade, state prison overcrowding resulted in thousands of inmates serving their sentences in county jails instead of state prisons. After years of legal battles, the state now reimburses the counties for housing the inmates.
Some rural counties, seeking to make the arrangement profitable, built large jails with excess capacity. But with the prison population dropping, some sheriff's departments that run county jails are stuck with oversized centers with empty bunks.
"There are jails that overbuilt in anticipation of needing additional space for themselves and in anticipation of taking advantage of some extra dollars from the state," said Peter Kehoe, executive director of the New York State Sheriffs' Association. "Those people are beginning to worry."
The worry is palpable in Jefferson County, home to Cape Vincent, and neighboring St. Lawrence County. Hiring freezes are in effect in four of the five prisons, some of which are known as "cookie cutters," a reference to the speed and identical designs desperate corrections officials used as they scrambled to build them in the 1980's and 1990's.
Besides the hiring halt, 350 officers temporarily assigned to prisons in the two counties fear being moved to downstate prisons where their jobs are permanently assigned, according to Mr. Munroe, a former union leader in Cape Vincent who believes the drop in crime is real and good for society over all. He added that he did not believe anyone considered what would happen if the crime rate dropped. "There wasn't much forethought," he said.
Dozens of local men are already making the commute to downstate prisons. One corrections officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the hiring freeze put off his hopes of being able to work in a nearby prison. "Cape Vincent is my No. 1 jail," he said. "It's two miles from my house."
He drives two hours to a maximum security prison in central New York. There, he works double shifts for two to four days, sleeping in an apartment he shares with 12 other officers. He returns to Cape Vincent and works odd construction jobs during his days off.
But he and other local prison employees all enthusiastically endorsed theirs as a "clean industry" that produced steady employment and little pollution. No guards have been seriously injured since Cape Vincent's prison opened, they said, and no inmates have escaped. 
With mills and other area businesses continuing to close, Mr. Ada regrets that his town did not agree to house more prisons in the boom times, saying, "It's supposed to be one of the more secure state jobs."

HEADLINE: California Governor Sees an End to Freeway Building 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: FONTANA, Calif., Aug. 20 

 BODY:
Standing atop eight lanes of grooved pavement and pristine yellow stripes in the kind of distant Los Angeles suburb made possible by endless highway construction, Gov. Gray Davis today dedicated the latest section of freeway to be built in California and declared that the project would be the last.
 California is identified more closely with freeways and the automobile than any other state -- it has slightly more than 15,000 miles of roads. But like other states, it long ago abandoned the hope that highways alone would solve growing urban transportation problems. 
 Mr. Davis used today's ribbon-cutting ceremony on a broiling, smoggy afternoon to underscore this fundamental shift, saying that the primacy of the automobile in transportation planning was over.
While the state will be spending much more money on transportation in coming years, Mr. Davis, a Democrat, said it would be mostly for mass transit like trains and buses. It is a shift that some experts say rests on troubling economics, because the state will be serving fewer people with sharply increased expenditures.
Even one of the most ardent supporters of new highways over the years, the Automobile Club of Southern California, has accepted the shift. "That's what the reality is now," said Jeffrey Spring, a spokesman for the association. "We have to look at alternative methods of moving people around." 
Mr. Davis said that even after the 28-mile stretch of the Foothill Freeway was completed here in San Bernardino County, serving booming suburbs about 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, the state would still spend large amounts on highways -- but to improve existing roadways, not add to them.
His remarks lent a bittersweet edge to the hoopla atop the freeway here. While few policy planners and politicians today would be eager to celebrate creeping suburbanization and the other side effects of America's car culture, this ceremony did -- whether intentionally or not. 
A high school band played near displays that included race cars and Fontana's original 1952 Ford police cruiser, in mint condition.
A construction company had a booth advertising the new homes it is building in one of the dozens of new subdivisions blanketing an old farming and warehousing region. A man dressed in a foam-rubber suit that looked like a smiling suburban house danced about the highway lanes handing out sales brochures.
The ceremony today was for the opening of a six-mile portion of the Foothill Freeway, which will link the cities of La Verne, Rancho Cucamonga and Fontana. The cities, which lie at the western end of the largest county in the country, are now served by densely traveled, frequently backed-up freeways. Trains run from here to downtown Los Angeles, but they carry a fraction of the number of people who cram the roads at rush hour.
No one expects that to change. Norman King, the executive director of the San Bernardino Associated Governments, a regional planning group, began the ceremony by noting that the cars parked on the freeway today were just a prelude to the traffic jams that were sure to follow.
He added that while freeways were indeed expensive, they were a lot cheaper than the other forms of transit that would increasingly suck up tax dollars in the future.
To support the shift, Mr. Davis said he was backing a proposal to have Californians vote in March on a proposition that would dedicate all revenues from state gasoline taxes -- $36 billion over 20 years -- to transportation projects. Currently, those revenues go into the state government's general funds.
Transportation experts are generally critical of the policy shift, not because they believe in more highway construction, but because they tend to believe that the government does too little to encourage Californians to use the public transit it plans to spend so much money building.
Driving, they complain, is becoming cheaper, while building new transit systems is becoming significantly more expensive.
"What we have is a goofy policy that doesn't really make sense, except in politics," said Peter Gordon, a professor of urban economics at the University of Southern California. He added that he believed the state should make public transit more attractive by making driving more expensive, by raising tolls, parking costs and gasoline taxes.
"The bottom line here is that transit use is not increasing nearly as fast as transit expenditures," said Brian Taylor, director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at the University of California at Los Angeles. "We haven't seen any big shift in travel because we don't ask drivers to pay the costs of their driving. Things like gas and parking are actually getting cheaper in inflation-adjusted terms, so it's no surprise people are driving more and more."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 30, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 21 about the opening of a section of the Foothill Freeway in Los Angeles referred incorrectly to a California ballot proposition. The proposal would dedicate all state sales tax on gasoline to transportation projects. It would not stipulate that separate gas taxes be used for such projects; gas taxes are already used solely for transportation.

TBWA Acquires Two Agencies

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
TBWA Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, said yesterday that it had acquired two agencies, Weiss Stagliano Partners in New York and O'Malley & Hogan in Dublin, and merged them to form Brand Architecture International, which will specialize in branding services. Terms of the cash deal were not disclosed. 
 Brand Architecture has 50 employees and revenue estimated at $8 million to $10 million from clients like Bass Ale, The Economist and Tumi. It will operate as an autonomous unit of TBWA from offices in Dublin and New York as well as from a new office in London and continue to serve clients from brand consulting to creative. 
 Top executives at the two agencies become directors and principal brand architects at Brand Architecture, including Adam Stagliano, 46, president and chief strategic officer at Weiss Stagliano; Marty Weiss, 47, chief creative officer at Weiss Stagliano; and Damian O'Malley, 45, a partner at O'Malley & Hogan.
Last summer, Weiss Stagliano and O'Malley & Hogan formed a brand consulting company, Weiss Stagliano O'Malley Hogan International Brand Architecture.
Weiss Stagliano began as Carroll Raj Stagliano in 1989, then merged with Weiss, Whitten in 1991 to form Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano. The name changed in 1993, when Tom Carroll left, and again in 1997, when Nat Whitten left. The new branding unit brings some agency relationships full circle as Mr. Carroll is now president for the Americas at TBWA in Playa del Rey, Calif.

HEADLINE: Ferrer Trails Fund-Raising In Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer's main campaign appeal is to "the other New York," the city residents who have been left behind in good economic times, or at least have not been a part of the Giuliani-era establishment. So even his supporters are not surprised that the Bronx borough president lags far behind his three main Democratic rivals in collecting donations from Manhattan, the city's richest borough.
 But Manhattan is again the biggest source of campaign dollars for the mayoral candidates, with borough residents already giving the Democrats collectively $8.6 million -- almost twice as much as the other boroughs put together. Of that total, $3 million has gone to Public Advocate Mark Green, the top fund-raiser in Manhattan, while only $1.25 million has gone to Mr. Ferrer. 
 The result is that he is far behind Mr. Green in fund-raising, even though Mr. Ferrer has raised more money in Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx. 
In fact, counting matching money, Mr. Green and Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi have already raised enough to ensure they can spend the maximum allowed by law in both the Sept. 11 primary and a Sept. 25 runoff election, which may be necessary to pick the party's nominee. Mr. Ferrer, by comparison, still had to raise about $1 million to hit that ceiling, while Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, was about $650,000 short, as of the Aug. 6 campaign finance reports.
If one of the four Democrats wins at least 40 percent of the vote on Sept. 11, he will go directly to the general election in November, making a runoff of the top two candidates unnecessary. But most polls have shown none of the four candidates as having the magic 40 percent.
Given that there is only two weeks between the primary and the runoff, each of the candidates has no choice but to prepare ahead of time. That means all four want to have all of the money they need in hand before the runoff would start.
Mr. Ferrer, who like the other Democrats already has enough money raised to spend the maximum $5.5 million for the primary, said yesterday that he was confident he would raise the remaining money he would need for a possible runoff, money that for the most part would be spent on television commercials. City rules cap spending in the runoff at $2.6 million.
"It does not concern me in the least," he said yesterday, after holding a news conference in front of City Hall. "I will have enough."
But Mr. Ferrer's spokesman acknowledged that with a base in the Bronx, and with a message that focused on the city's disadvantaged residents more than his rivals' did, he has perhaps had a harder time raising money than his opponents.
"We have many, many contributors who are far from wealthy," his spokesman, John Del Cecato, said. "That speaks to how we are seeking to represent all New Yorkers."
Mr. Ferrer added, "Maybe I need wealthier relatives and wealthier friends."
Money, of course, does not necessarily translate into votes. But as the election approaches, the amount and source of the money raised provides insight into the different mayoral campaigns and the difference audiences they, at least financially, are attracting.
To date, Mr. Hevesi still has the overall lead, having collected $7.1 million in donations, while Mr. Green has $5.8 million, Mr. Vallone has $4.5 million and Mr. Ferrer has $4.0 million. Each of these figures accounts for any money that has been refunded by the candidates, but they do not include city matching money, or interest or balances transferred from previous campaigns.
Mr. Ferrer, through early August, had 5,489 contributors, averaging $764 apiece before any refunds, according to city campaign finance data. That puts him in third place out of four in terms of number of contributors, with Mr. Vallone trailing. Mr Ferrer is in last place in terms of the average size of the contributions. Mr. Green's average contribution, by comparison, has been worth $912, the highest.
What really matters, in terms of fund-raising for the candidates, is not just how popular candidates are in Manhattan in general, but how popular they are in certain particularly affluent neighborhoods, as an examination of giving by ZIP codes shows.
In 10021, which covers the East Side of Manhattan from 61st Street to 80th Street, residents have donated a total of $1.9 million to mayoral candidates, the most of any ZIP code in the city. Of that total, $605,666 went to Mr. Green, who lives just north of the area, while Mr. Ferrer drew $268,490. 
But just up the way in 10029, which stretches from East 97th Street to East 116th Street, residents have sent in a total of just $39,240 to the four Democrats. Mr. Ferrer has beaten out all of his rivals in this ZIP code. But the resulting $12,490 he has collected in total from the Spanish Harlem ZIP code has not been not much of a financial boon.
The pace of fund-raising, particularly in the last seven months, has varied widely for the four Democrats.
Since mid January, Mr. Green's fund-raising effort has taken off, while Mr. Vallone's has increased only slightly and Mr. Ferrer's and Mr. Hevesi's have declined. That means Mr. Green has been cutting the large fund-raising lead once held by Mr. Hevesi, who started the year far ahead of the other candidates.
In the most recent filing period -- a 25-day stretch from July 12 to Aug. 6th -- Mr. Green raised an average of $23,064 a day, compared with $6,480 a day for Mr. Vallone, $2,508 a day for Mr. Ferrer, and $1,238 a day for Mr. Hevesi, the records show.
Much of the recent surge in fund-raising by Mr. Green has to do with his perceived status as the front-runner in the campaign, both Mr. Green and his rivals said. Polls have repeatedly shown him with a small but statistically significant lead over the other three Democrats.
"Apparently, people who were waiting and watching the mayor's race are now voting with their dollars by helping my candidacy," Mr. Green said yesterday, adding that he considers a runoff "all but certain."
The particularly small average daily amount that Mr. Hevesi has raised in recent weeks is in part because he continues to return much more money than any of his rivals, a total of $408,000 so far during the campaign -- money that was given back because contributions exceeded legal limits or because other questions were raised about the appropriateness of the donation.
Spokesmen for Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Ferrer also said that the candidates had spent much less time during the first half of this year focusing on raising money, in part because they already knew they had raised enough to spend as much as is allowed by law in the Sept. 11 primary.
Matching money from the city Campaign Finance Board helps to even out the candidates' differences.
To date, a total of $9.8 million in matching money has been given to the four Democrats, which represents $4 for each $1 they have collected in small contributions -- those less than $250.Anyone who gets into the runoff election will be entitled to as much as $720,000 more in matching money, meaning each candidate must raise at least $1.9 million of his own money for a runoff.
But what is clear is that if Mr. Ferrer, in particular, is going to meet his fund-raising goal to prepare for a runoff election, he must pick up the pace in fund-raising in the next several weeks.
Both Mr. Vallone and Mr. Ferrer have already planned a series of fund-raising events to do just that. Mr. Ferrer, for example, has invited Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., the lawyer, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, the actors, Earl Graves Jr., the president of Black Enterprise magazine, and Percy E. Sutton, the former Manhattan borough president, among others, to headline a fund-raising event on Sept. 5.
Mr. Vallone, meanwhile, will be at Tavern on the Green on Sept. 5 at a fund-raiser hosted by a group of prominent female supporters.
But Mr. Green is showing no sign of slowing down in his own fund-raising effort. He has 18 fund-raising events scheduled between now and Sept. 11. And he has his own Sept. 5 event planned: a concert at Town Hall on West 43rd Street featuring performances by Jon Bon Jovi, Jewel and Mandy Patinkin that is scheduled to be hosted by Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, among others. He hopes to raise as much as $400,000 at this concert alone.
The rules will all change in the general election if Michael R. Bloomberg is the Republican nominee. Because he is not participating in the campaign finance system, the spending cap will also be lifted for the Democratic nominee, who will get an extra amount of city matching money.
The Democratic nominee should be able to draw a large amount of money, given the predominance of Democrats in the city. But if Mr. Bloomberg keeps up his spending at a rate similar to what he has already begun -- he has already spent at least $16 million, more than all the other candidates combined -- it will be virtually impossible for the Democratic nominee to match his spending.

HEADLINE: Slight Progress on Budget As Leaders Talk Compromise 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
Legislative leaders met with Gov. George E. Pataki early today and made some minor progress toward an accord on a supplemental budget that would patch the holes in the austere spending plan passed two weeks ago.
 For the first time, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said publicly that he was willing to reduce his demand for $1.7 billion in additional school aid and $400 million in other additions in order to reach a compromise with the governor. 
 The governor, meanwhile, signaled a willingness to raise spending above the $83.6 billion he proposed in January, so long as the Legislature approved new streams of revenue to support the expanded programs in the future, people familiar with the talks said. Among the revenue sources being considered is a new multistate lottery game. 
Mr. Silver and the Republican leader of the Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, left the hourlong meeting with the governor this morning without reaching a deal, and aides to all three men said the negotiations were fragile and fluid. Still, for the first time this year, the Republican governor and the Democratic Assembly leader seemed to soften their positions. Some aides said an agreement on an overall amount of spending might be possible this week.
"I am willing to compromise in the interest of doing a budget," Mr. Silver said as he emerged from the meeting. 
"I am willing to compromise from the larger numbers in education and health care in order to do a budget."
Two weeks ago, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno put aside their partisan differences and passed a skeletal version of the governor's budget that stripped out $4 billion in spending as well as new Medicaid and school-aid formulas the governor wanted.
The two leaders calculated that a painful budget would bring the governor to the negotiating table. For months, Mr. Pataki had maintained he had finished his job when he submitted his budget and that the Legislature must act upon it. As the economy slowed, the governor also maintained that tax revenues would flatten out or drop this year, a prediction the Assembly and Senate regard as too pessimistic.
When the Legislature passed the stripped-down plan, however, the governor changed his stance on what his role should be. He sued the Legislature, arguing that the State Constitution forbids changes to language in his appropriations bills without his consent. 
The governor's strategy this year had political advantages. Polls suggested most voters blamed the Legislature rather than the governor for the late budget.
The longer the impasse lasts, the longer the state spends money at last year's pace, building up a surplus for 2002, an election year. For both political and fiscal reasons, the governor wants to avoid cutbacks next year, his aides said.
The main obstacle to an accord had not changed in today's meeting. Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno argued that revenues would grow somewhat this year and that the governor would have $4 billion to $5 billion in reserves. They noted that $1.8 billion more than Mr. Pataki had foreseen had come in since January. 
The governor stuck to his gloomy revenue outlook, predicting those revenues would vanish next year. He said all the reserves were earmarked for special purposes, including $2.25 billion to hedge against a recession.
Mr. Pataki asked the Legislature to find new revenue to offset any spending increases, legislative aides said.
"I think there are still real differences on the economic condition of the country and the revenues," he said after the meeting. 
"There has not been any economic news across the country or globally that would suggest we should raise our projections at all."

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing Bonds Up In The Catskills 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) 

 BODY:
 A financial recovery in Sullivan County has led a Wall Street bond-rating agency to upgrade the county's debt rating to A, from A-minus. 
The agency, Standard & Poor's, raised the rating yesterday in advance of the sale of $8.7 million in bonds next week by the county, which is northwest of New York City in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains. The county's tourism-based economy is rebounding and becoming more diverse, S.& P. analysts said, and improved budgeting practices have turned a budget deficit into a surplus. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Sears to Focus on Variety Not Price

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company, which spends $600 million to $1 billion annually on advertising, is overhauling its pitches to emphasize the variety of name-brand merchandise sold by its 860 stores rather than trying to compete on pricing with discounters like Wal-Mart Stores and Target.
 The idea behind the high-stakes new campaign for Sears is simple enough: Let Sears be Sears. 
 Sears executives hope the humorous campaign will stimulate flagging sales amid the soft economic climate by playing up its strengths, primarily the broad assortments of branded goods, and playing down its weaknesses, primarily an inability to pursue the so-called everyday-low-price strategy of the discount chains.
The stakes for the campaign, to begin appearing on Sept. 6, could not be higher for Sears, the nation's fourth-largest retailer. The company is hard-pressed in grappling with skeptical, belt-tightening shoppers who have grown reluctant to buy much of anything and increasingly open their wallets and purses only when the goods are on sale. 
"Sears, like all retailers, is operating in a difficult consumer-spending environment," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Lehman Brothers who follows retailing.
"Relatively speaking, Sears is holding its own," he added, "but that's still not as much as investors would like."
Investors were also not too keen on the Sears results for July, which showed a 2.5 percent decline in total sales and a 3 percent decline in sales at stores open for more than a year, known in the industry as same-store sales. That figure is considered a crucial indicator of retail vitality.
And in the second quarter, Sears revenue from retailing, its mainstay money maker, fell 1.1 percent from the corresponding period of 2000.
"We're very aware of the economic conditions," said David Selby, senior vice president for marketing at Sears in Hoffman Estates, Ill., who offered a preview of the campaign yesterday in a telephone interview.
"What we're going to do here is tell our story very clearly and very aggressively," he added.
The campaign, a result of a creative shootout between the two big principal Sears agencies, will include everything from television commercials to signs in stores to ad banners on Web sites. The campaign carries the theme "Sears. Where else?," a question meant to be part rhetorical, part revelatory, not unlike the old slogan for Kellogg's Corn Flakes, "Taste them again for the first time."
The switch in Sears strategies came after Alan J. Lacy, chairman and chief executive of Sears, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that he wanted to improve marketing efforts by refocusing them from pricing to the extent of brand-name products, whether proprietary (Craftsman, Kenmore) or national (Levi's, Maytag).
That set the clock ticking on the Sears ad theme since August 1999, "The good life at a great price. Guaranteed," which was the product of a previous creative shootout between the retailer's two principal agencies. They were, and are, the Chicago offices of Ogilvy & Mather and Young & Rubicam, both now owned by the WPP Group, which typically divide the general advertising assignments for Sears by categories like apparel (Y.& R.) and automotive (Ogilvy).
Mr. Lacy's reorientation set off the second shootout, which ended last month with a decision to proceed with a strategy developed by the Chicago office of Y.& R. That agency also created "Come see the softer side of Sears," the theme that ran from 1993 to 1999.
"The goal is to articulate what the brand is all about and serve it up in a fresh way," Mr. Selby said. "We want to cut through the fog of familiarity, if you will."
"At the heart of what we're doing is to play our own game, 'Only Sears can do that,' because that's who we are," he added. "Rather than be embarrassed or vague, we want to celebrate the breadth of merchandise Sears has."
The variety of goods Sears sells is represented in the campaign by shopping lists of disparate items consumers typically buy, augmented by paeans to Sears service, employees and product guarantees. But in keeping with the desired freshness, there's typically a twist.
For instance, one commercial shows a woman in a chic autumn outfit as a breeze stirs, causing a trickle of leaves to fall. The breeze becomes a windstorm and the leaves start flying. The cause? A man with a Craftsman leaf blower. In another spot, a baby keeps crying as its mother tries offering distractions like a Sears infant blanket, but the wails turn to gurgles only when dad trips and falls as he tries to capture the child on a Sony video camera.
The print ads are similarly skewed. One displays an overweight man in a bathroom and offers this shopping list: "Fieldcrest bath towels. Whole Home accent rugs. NordicTrack treadmill." Another shows the shopping list for a boy named Tim, who is decked out in Nike shoes, Levi's jeans and a Champion jersey he "had to have" because his friends Billy, Danny and Derek wear them. The final item on the list is a membership in the Sears KidVantage Club, which offers the "savings you had to have to keep up with Billy, Danny and Derek."
The humor "is important," said Mark Figliulo, executive vice president and chief creative officer at Y.& R. Chicago, because "we want to bring a lightheartedness to Sears."
"Shopping should be fun; it shouldn't be a chore," he added, "and when you accomplish things, you feel good."
Target has had much success with breezy, cheerful print and television ads by Peterson Milla Hooks in Minneapolis that celebrate the wide variety of brand-name products it peddles. Though it is not implicit in the campaign, Sears is in effect saying, been there, done that.
"Our research shows our customer is a 'mission shopper' and we know how busy her life is, how crazy her life is," Mr. Selby said.
"We're not everything for everyone," he added, "but the reality is, we can help her complete more of her mission."
As for concerns the campaign might make Sears seem as if there is too much under one roof, that's why several commercials show the sales staff, Mr. Figliulo said, "who are there to help you accomplish your mission." (There will be internal communications, with training involved, aimed at helping employees cross-sell merchandise between departments, as in commercials where appliance shoppers are sent to the jewelry department and jewelry shoppers are sent to home electronics.)
Besides, "as soon as you think you've got it all," Mr. Figliulo said, referring to the typical shopping list, "there's usually one more thing you need."
The "Sears. Where else?" theme is being used by all Sears agencies, which in addition to Y.& R. Chicago and Ogilvy Chicago include the Burrell Communications Group in Chicago, 49 percent owned by the Publicis Groupe, for ads aimed at black consumers; Mendoza Dillon & Asociados in Newport Beach, Calif., for ads aimed at Hispanic consumers; and the Los Angeles and New York offices of Kang & Lee, part of Young & Rubicam, for ads aimed at Asian-Americans.
Sears joins a list of retailers revamping their campaigns, among them Kmart, with new work by the New York office of TBWA/Chiat/ Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, and J. C. Penney, with new work by DDB Worldwide, part of Omnicom.

HEADLINE: An Unresponsive Economy 

 BODY:
All of a sudden, the light at the end of the economic tunnel doesn't seem to be getting any closer. For much of this year, analysts expected the Federal Reserve Board's half-dozen cuts in interest rates to shift the economy out of neutral by the fourth quarter. Now, as autumn nears, medium- and long-term interest rates remain prohibitively high, and each day brings news of more layoffs. Pundits seize upon any sign of a turnaround, such as last month's growth in new home construction. Clearly, however, companies are finding few reasons to increase their investments. One obvious problem is that the Fed and the Bush administration are working at cross purposes. 
 The Fed has been steadily lowering the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend reserves to each other on a day-to-day basis -- with the hope that other lending rates will follow suit. Since January, short-term rates have fallen by almost three percentage points. A drop in inflation, driven mainly by lower energy costs, has given the Fed room to make another cut at its meeting today. But rates on loans and mortgages with terms of five years and longer have barely responded. 
 One cause of the stickiness in long-term rates is the widespread belief that the economy will resume its productivity-driven boom in the next few years. Another cause is more troubling -- uncertainty about the federal government's finances. Corporate tax revenues have slackened, and declining business confidence suggests slim prospects for an uptick anytime soon. Forthcoming estimates from the White House and the Congressional Budget Office will almost definitely show drops in the projected budget surpluses. President Bush has already hamstrung the coming years' federal budgets with his tax cut and his unrealistic allowances for discretionary spending. Smaller surpluses will force Congress to spend money that would otherwise have extended the solvency of Medicare and Social Security.
Congress has aggravated the problem by showing a disturbing lack of commitment to making these programs more sound. Given members' disagreements on a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, chances for comprehensive reform look slim. The White House favors a flawed, politically unfeasible reform of Social Security and has dismissed the worsening budget forecasts. The specter of a ballooning federal debt, accompanied by high interest rates, looms larger by the day.
Investors have also signaled their worries about the American economy through the dollar's cascading fall against the euro, yen and British pound. The weaker dollar hurts American companies that depend on foreign financing because of scant domestic saving. Upward pressure on prices, and even higher interest rates, could result as well.
At the moment, robust consumer spending is keeping the economy growing, if extremely slowly. This lifeline is likely to disappear, though, when the slews of layoffs -- 5,000 at Ford Motor Company being the most dramatic in recent days -- begin to bite. After consumers' spending is finally overtaken by their mounting debts, investment by businesses will have to drive economic growth. Yet thanks to Congress and the White House, the Fed's efforts to promote investment have yet to take hold.
Europe and Japan are sputtering, too. Their problems will limit the positive impact the lower dollar might otherwise have on American exporters. On the bright side, though, the dollar will offer some succor to struggling Argentina, whose currency is linked to ours. While fighting to escape its own economic slump, Argentina has learned the lesson Washington must now heed: To promote investment for the long term, the government must keep its own house in order.

HEADLINE: Slump in U.S. Drags Mexico, and Fox's Agenda, Down 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
Mexico has been dragged into recession by the faltering American economy, taking a toll on millions of Mexicans and the political aspirations of President Vicente Fox.
 Mr. Fox took office on Dec. 1 promising to create 1.4 million new jobs. That has proved a mirage. Instead, hundreds of thousands of people -- perhaps as many as half a million, by some estimates -- have lost their jobs since then. 
 The economic pain is hard to calculate, but in a country where nearly half of the population is poor by any standard, it is likely that several million people have less money and perhaps less to eat today than a year ago. Mexico, unlike the United States, does not offer unemployment benefits.
Mr. Fox said last year that he could sustain the economic growth that peaked at 7.7 percent during the early part of 2000. That, too, was an illusion. With luck, the gross domestic product might grow somewhere between 1.8 percent and 2.5 percent by the end of this year. 
But private analysts say the country, which does not measure its economy quarterly, remains for now in a recession based on the American standard of two consecutive quarters of no growth.
Mexico has been selling 80 to 90 percent of its exports to the United States since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994. So a slowdown in the American economy spells shutdowns and layoffs in Mexico as companies dismiss workers to cut their costs.
"The correlation of manufacturing job losses in Mexico to the deceleration of the U.S. economy is about one to one," said Alfredo Thorne, chief Latin American economist at J. P. Morgan Chase in Mexico City.
This morning, at the Almeda plaza in the heart of Mexico City, close to 100 people like Julian Gonzales sat on park benches reading the want ads with weary resignation. Mr. Gonzales, once an administrator at a heavy-equipment manufacturer, has been out of work for months.
"The sad reality is that it is incredibly difficult to get a job" in Mexico these days, he said.
Down the rows of benches, Paulo Cesar Jimenez, 20, a communications student at Del Valle University, said he had been looking all summer for work without success.
"I see people, even those who have college degrees, who are now driving taxis or selling things on the street," he said. "Supposedly Vicente Fox was going to give young people opportunities. Look at me, sitting here, waiting for my opportunity."
As many as 20 percent of Mexicans have no jobs or are underemployed, meaning they work less than 35 hours a week, which may not be enough to get by, private economists say.
Mr. Fox remains remarkably upbeat despite those harsh facts and grim faces. But he now acknowledges the undeniable: Mexico has been in a recession for months, and its deep dependence on trade with the United States is the primary cause.
Mr. Fox said on Saturday that Mexico was "not anticipating a crisis or a domino effect" from weakened economies in the United States and Latin America. "But simply there is no dynamism now in the American economy, and therefore there is no growth."
Many economists agree with him that Mexico's economic foundation is stable; some predict that its fortunes will soon improve. "Yes, we are in a recession," Mr. Thorne said. "We are in the worst part of the cycle. But we are very close to the bottom. The rate of decline is slowing."
Interest rates are less than 10 percent, about half as high as a year ago. Foreign direct investment in Mexico is likely to reach $27 billion this year, about twice what it was last year. Mr. Fox has been pursuing that money on nearly every one of his many foreign trips to the United States, Europe and Asia.
Inflation is down and the peso is strong -- so strong that Mexico has now seized Brazil's title as the biggest economy in Latin America, measured in dollars.
But a stronger peso -- it has appreciated 6 percent against the dollar this year -- also means costlier Mexican exports, aggravating Mexico's pain when the American economy weakens. That fact alone has cost thousands of jobs at assembly plants near the United States border, a cornerstone of the free-trade economy, along with technology businesses, car and auto-parts makers and consumer electronics companies.
All of which suggests to Rogelio Ramirez del la O, one of Mexico's most respected economists, that "we have not hit bottom yet." Mr. Fox's predicted 7 percent growth, he said, may wind up approaching 0.7 percent, if that, forcing many more Mexicans to live hand to mouth before a North American economic revival.
And a sputtering economy may make a mess of many of Mr. Fox political plans. He has already announced cuts in government spending by hundreds of millions of dollars, though where those cuts are coming from remains murky. Some ambitious projects, like one to spur development in Mexico's rural south, could be delayed or derailed.
Oil, one of the government's biggest sources of income, is also stalling the economy. This year, Mexico has seen revenues from its state-run energy company, Pemex, drop 41 percent. Oil prices and exports are down; the costs of financing sales of natural gas to Mexican companies are up.
Pemex, like many another state-run industry, is not a model of modern efficiency. But the regulation and competition that could reform the energy industry typify the many expected changes yet to occur in Mr. Fox's nine-month-old administration. And without the economic growth on which he stakes much of his political fortune, much of the optimism that his election brought to Mexico's middle class has never trickled down to Mexico's poor.
Luis Ochoa, 44, was also in the Almeda plaza looking for carpentry work. When he does have a job, he makes less than $100 a week and sleeps at the construction site where he works.
He and his seven children picked coffee beans for years in the town of Cordoba, in the southern state of Veracruz. But free trade has pounded Mexico's coffee industry. Exports from as far away as Vietnam have glutted the United States market and sent prices plummeting. 
At home, he said, he makes the equivalent of five cents for a pound of coffee beans. So he comes here to try to help feed his family.
"It's harder to find jobs today," he said. "For two years I've been coming to Mexico City, and it's more difficult now. The government is telling pure lies, because they haven't followed through on their word. Everything is the same."

HEADLINE: Bush Warns Against Delay In Acting on Military Budget 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush told veterans at a convention here today that he would hold fast to his request for more money for the military in the next fiscal year and warned Congress not to delay action on the Pentagon budget until the end of the appropriations process. 
 "I have a better idea," said Mr. Bush, who has proposed spending about $33 billion more on the Pentagon in the next fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, than was originally appropriated for the 2001 fiscal year, administration officials said. 
 "Let us keep our priorities straight and start with the things that matter most to our country's security and our country's future," Mr. Bush said at the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention here. "This year, let us have responsible spending from Day 1 and put the national security and education of our children first in line when it comes to the appropriations process." 
Mr. Bush was in part telling more than 10,000 men and women at the veterans meeting what they wanted to hear, including a promise to clear what he described as an unacceptable backlog in veterans' unpaid benefits claims.
The president was also girding for the appropriations war that will heat up when Congress returns from its August recess and Mr. Bush heads back to Washington after four weeks at his ranch near Crawford, Tex.
Leading Senate Democrats maintain that a military increase on the scale that Mr. Bush has proposed is unaffordable without substantial cuts in other areas, and they say Mr. Bush has yet to identify such potential savings.
But beyond those specifics, the appropriations process will be a tug of war between Mr. Bush and Congressional Democrats over who can make the strongest claim to fiscal prudence at a time of shrinking surpluses and a sluggish economy.
With his remarks today, Mr. Bush was giving the rope a vigorous yank, and he was once again presenting himself as a Washington outsider who had come to bring a dose of sanity to an insiders' crazy game.
"As we enter the appropriations process," Mr. Bush said, "I have great hopes, but no illusions. Washington has its own way of doing things, especially around the time of year when final appropriations are made."
He later added, "When it is time to pass the last bill, they are just about to go over the budget. And often, and sadly, the final bill has been the defense appropriations bill."
Mr. Bush vowed that this was "the old way of doing business."
In fact, military spending has often come late in the process not because lawmakers have been trying to choke it off, but because the Pentagon's spending bill is more complicated than many others. Additionally, Mr. Bush's fellow Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress -- and the appropriations process -- from 1995 until this year.
Administration officials said Mr. Bush had requested about $329 billion in discretionary military spending for the next fiscal year, up from what they said was about $296 billion in the original 2001 budget. After Mr. Bush took office, he signed a supplemental military appropriation of close to $6 billion for 2001.
Mr. Bush alluded to these figures to assert his commitment to the military. He also cited a "top-to-bottom review" of the process for paying veterans' health care and pension claims that is being conducted by the secretary of veterans affairs, Anthony J. Principi. The president estimated the backlog to be about 600,000 unpaid claims.
"When the draft board got your file," Mr. Bush told the veterans, "it worked efficiently. But now, when you need health care, forms get lost and answers come late. That is no way to treat America's veterans, and that is going to change."
Mr. Principi later told reporters that his goal was to cut the total backlog of cases to 200,000 by 2003 and to reduce the average time to process a claim to three months from nine or more.
As Mr. Bush used his words to try to portray himself as someone high above political pettiness, he used his actions to try to portray himself as someone at eye level with working-class people.
After his speech to veterans, he visited a Harley-Davidson factory in Menomonee Falls, just outside Milwaukee, where motorcycle engines are manufactured.
First on an assembly line and then in the cafeteria, Mr. Bush mingled with many of the factory's roughly 1,000 employees.
The president's advisers would like to improve his standing with organized labor, a potent political force in closely contested Midwestern states like Wisconsin, which Mr. Bush narrowly lost last year.
But the president's conversations veered away from politics and policy.
"How's your golf game?" one man asked him.
"It stinks," Mr. Bush replied.
He left after about an hour and 20 minutes with parting gifts, including a helmet of many colors and a coat of black leather bearing the Harley-Davidson logo.
Mr. Bush's visit to Wisconsin, to be followed on Tuesday by a visit to Missouri, took him away from a sustained break in Crawford that he has described as an important respite from Washington and that has prompted considerable scrutiny and ribbing.
He slyly acknowledged all of that in his remarks to the veterans today.
"It is important for a president never to become isolated in the seat of power," Mr. Bush said. "As great and influential as that city is, sometimes the president just has to get out of Crawford, Tex."

HEADLINE: Countdown to the Great Labor Shortage 

BYLINE:  By WELD ROYAL 

 BODY:
The daily flurry of layoffs is bringing major changes to the workplace as companies struggle with the economic downturn. But if government predictions play out as expected, soon there will be an equally big and opposite shift as baby boomers retire and the nation experiences one of its most severe labor shortages.
 In its most recent study, released in November 1999, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that the gap between the number of jobs available and the number of people to fill them would grow to six million in 2008. And this is just the start of a shortage that will peak from 2015 to 2025, when the bulk of workers born between 1946 and 1964, as many as 60 million, reach retirement age. 
 Occupations with large numbers of older workers like construction inspection and teaching in secondary schools are expected to suffer. So are fields creating jobs at a fast pace, like computer engineering.
Of course, there are always unexpected developments that can radically change the workplace -- the women's movement, the Internet, a war. But experts say the coming demographic shift is sure to have an impact.
"As the baby boomers retire, we'll be losing the head of the proverbial python that tried to swallow the elephant," said Ross C. DeVol, director of regional and demographic studies at the Milken Institute, an economic research group in Santa Monica, Calif. "And that will have ramifications on the diversity of the work force. There will be more women and minorities in the work force, and older Americans deciding to work longer."
For workers, experts say, the imbalance means opportunities in fields like engineering or health care where the shortages will be the most acute. For companies, the shortages will mean sending more jobs overseas and turning to immigrants to do the work Americans cannot or will not do. Already, such trends are under way.
"Finding qualified workers remains a top economic development priority, even during this downturn," said Shepard Nevel, executive director of the Mayor's Office of Workforce Development in Denver.
Technological advances have allowed companies like Affiliated Computer Services, a Dallas-based information technology concern, to weave a patchwork of solutions here and overseas. ACS generates half its $1.96 billion in revenue from business service. In one operation, employees in Lexington, Ky., retrieve their client companies' correspondence from a local post office, scan it and send it by satellite to a data processing center in Ghana, in West Africa. There, 500 workers -- mostly young women -- enter the information into a database. They can earn about 80 cents an hour plus benefits, amazingly cheap by American standards but well beyond Ghana's minimum wage of about 80 cents a day.
ACS first set up such outposts abroad to lower costs, but expanded further as it struggled to find enough workers in America willing to handle data processing. "When we opened our office in Guatemala City, we had 500 people on the first day looking for a job," said Jeffrey A. Rich, the chief executive. "If we had opened in Manhattan, we would have had just a few people."
In Baltimore, economic development officials say they will not be able to attract the next generation of workers with such routine data processing jobs. And they are worried because a decade from now, the city and surrounding region are expected to have 108,000 fewer people aged 25 to 44 than now. Among other steps, government officials, executives and philanthropists financed a series of recent focus groups nationwide to find out exactly what the baby boomers' children want in a job. The aim is to attract companies that have jobs that will appeal to this group.
Companies will have to grapple with changes in the work force structure, said Ronald E. Bird, chief economist for the Employment Policy Foundation, a business-oriented research group based in Washington. Thirty years ago, he said, the labor market was shaped like a pyramid topped by corporate executives and other professionals (24 percent of the work force). In the middle were the skilled crafts workers, clerks and administrators (36 percent). The remaining 40 percent, including unskilled laborers, made up the bottom. But that pyramid has been shifting, with the top and the middle making up 71 percent of jobs now and projected to make up 77 percent by 2031.
BE&K Inc. of Birmingham, Ala., which designs and builds industrial plants worldwide, has been wrestling with these changes. It says it cannot find enough skilled laborers. To address the escalating shortage, it created a task force on the future of construction work. The group foresees a more diverse labor pool, with more new immigrants and women. But attracting women is an uphill battle because of the industry's macho image.
The number of women in the work force has more than doubled, to 62 million, since 1970, but they still constitute only 10 percent of all construction industry workers, according to the National Association of Women in Construction. BE&K has managed to beat that ratio -- some 12 percent of its 10,700 employees are women -- through such initiatives as day care at job sites and networking groups.
To attract more young women, it sends role models like Mary Hodge, a 47-year-old electrical supervisor, to visit high schools. This summer, it enrolled 10 high school girls in a free construction camp, where Ms. Hodge showed them how to thread electrical wires through siding while talking up opportunities for travel and the good pay -- perhaps $80,000 a year with overtime.
John Natoli, 52, also acts like a cheerleader for his profession. Mr. Natoli, chief engineer at the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, says while unemployment statistics are inching up, they do not square with what he is already finding: a dearth of engineers. "If 15 or 25 of them walked into my office now, I could hire them," he said. The gap is so big that Mr. Natoli does not expect this to change even if the downturn persists awhile.
The unit runs help-wanted ads, sends e-mail messages to new graduates and hires from other agencies. But people leave, and Mr. Natoli cannot always replace them with American-trained engineers, who can make much more in private industry. As a result, the construction unit has become a mecca for immigrant engineers, with roughly 40 percent of the engineers educated abroad.
Despite some tensions, Mr. Natoli said, work pressures mostly trump cultural divides. "People have so much to do, they forget about everything else," he said.

HEADLINE: Why Put Out Every Wildfire in the Forests? 

BYLINE:  By William Kittredge; William Kittredge is the author, most recently, of "The Nature of Generosity."

DATELINE: MISSOULA, Mont. 

 BODY:
A year ago, crossing the Higgins Avenue bridge into downtown Missoula, I was unable to make out the Great Northern Railroad Depot five blocks away. The air was that thick with smoke. A dark, unblinking red sun hung in a sky that was reddish gray shading to black. 
 The sun resembled the eye of a very cranky god. Great tracts of timberland in northern Idaho and western Montana were afire. Prevailing winds were blowing in our direction. 
 I was on my way to Quality Wholesale, shopping for big lawn sprinklers, the kind that throw long, revolving cascades of water. Annick Smith, my longtime love, lives in a log house 25 miles out of town, above the Big Blackfoot River, in fields surrounded by timber. We wanted to wet down the meadows around her house. We were determined to save her home. Not that it was threatened. Not yet.
For almost a century, federal agencies in charge of managing public lands in the West believed their mission was to put out fires, natural or otherwise. They were responding to public will. My neighbors, when I was in the ranch business, regarded putting out fires as an absolute government responsibility. So, a couple of years earlier, when I visited John Hyde, a ranger in Oregon, I was surprised to find that he was dismayed over what he described as overactive federal fire suppression policies.
John explained that natural wildfires had historically kept the floor of the forests clear of debris, while the big trees survived. Settlers drove wagons in what would look to us like open parks under big yellow pine. Now, after a hundred years of our putting out every fire, the woodlands are thick with combustibles. It's tough to hike across those same hills, which are brushy and cluttered with downed timber that should have burned decades ago. "One day," John said, "we're going to have an inferno." It's easy to imagine.
If he's right, who's to blame? Maybe Thomas Jefferson. He sent Lewis and Clark west to determine how the vast unknown property called the Louisiana Purchase might be converted into a pastoral homeland for settlers. Maybe Jefferson's dream placed too much emphasis on taming. Wildfires, however chaotic, are essential to forest ecologies. Before settlers arrived, Native American tribes even set fires in autumn to encourage vigorous regrowth and provide good browse and grazing for game.
But ordinary human fearfulness is probably the real culprit. A lot of people claim to love wildness, but what many really seem to love is the idea of wildness. The actual item can be dangerous. That's a reason Westerners have been so intent on killing wolves and grizzly bears. Great carnivores on the loose are bad for business -- as are wildfires, an intensely dangerous form of wildness.
Westerners are profoundly double-hearted about the realities of land and water use. The exploitation of "nature" has for generations been the primary basis for our economy -- logging and mining, grazing on public lands, pumping the aquifers dry to support irrigation for agriculture. In drought years, fire suppression itself can be a local summer industry.
A lot of people work very hard fighting fires. Some die terrifying deaths in the line of duty. But big-time fire suppression is like war -- federally financed, whatever the expense -- with bulldozers, helicopters, planes and legions of foot soldiers. Many in rural communities make their money for the year working on and supporting fire crews. 
On the other hand, "nature" also tends to be beloved by the rural people who do much of the exploiting. Many of those moving to the West in droves dream of a home in the woods, seeking what I've heard described as "lifestyle enhancement."
So, we're in a real fix: timberlands are filled with combustibles and a lot of people are building houses under the trees. What to do in fire season?
It might be sensible to support local economies through a federally financed effort to clean up the woods. I don't mean "salvage logging" by timber corporations using industrial equipment; massive machines clawing up ecosystems are part of the problem. Instead, experienced local people, using horses to assist in the heavy work, could start the process of clearing away downed timber and brush. They could pile the accumulated debris and burn it in late fall when runaway wildfire danger is minimal. Then tax dollars would be helping to prevent fires rather than suppress them, and the federal money would still stay in local economies. Top that off with public planning to discourage home building in the deep woods, and maybe we'd be getting somewhere.
Last summer Annick and I set out our sprinklers, but the effort seemed a little pathetic. We could imagine a tourist tossing a cigarette into the dry weeds along Interstate 80, a few miles away over timbered hills. What if a heavy wind happened to be blowing in our direction? In an hour or so we might confront towering flames, running treetop to treetop. We lucked out then, as we have this year. There are no fires in our vicinity even though half a million acres are burning as I write. But what about next year, and the year after that? Can we hold the line with lawn sprinklers?

Hearst Shuts Down Magazine

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
The weak advertising economy has claimed another victim, as Hearst Magazines is closing Classic American Home.
 The magazine, published every two months, was introduced in 1975 as Colonial Homes. 
It adopted its new name last year. 
 "It is a difficult decision to cease publication of a lifestyle magazine like Classic American Home, with a following of dedicated readers," Paul Luthringer, a spokesman for Hearst Magazines in New York, said in a statement. 
A report of the closing appeared this week in the trade publication Folio First Day.
Mr. Luthringer attributed the closing to a determination that the magazine "does not have the potential to reach the circulation levels that we use as a benchmark for mass consumer magazines today."
The circulation of Classic American Home stood at 521,000, ranking it among the smallest of Hearst's publications; the circulation rate base guaranteed to advertisers was 500,000.
According to the Publishers Information Bureau, ad pages for Classic American Home for the first four issues of 2001 totaled 113, down 6.8 percent from the comparable period of 2000. The July-August magazine, now on newsstands, is the final issue.
The closing is the second for Hearst in 2001. In January, Offspring, a test quarterly introduced last year, was absorbed by SmartMoney, which is published in partnership with Dow Jones. Classic American Home was the third magazine to announce a closing in the last week, along with The Industry Standard and Working Woman. Other recent closings include Family PC and Individual Investor.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Brann Worldwide is acquiring Wong Wong Boyack to add an Asian marketing capability.

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
A LARGE direct marketing agency is expanding its offerings by acquiring a smaller one that specializes in marketing to Asian and Asian-American consumers.
 The acquisition by Brann Worldwide in Wilton, Conn., of Wong Wong Boyack in San Francisco, for undisclosed terms, points to the growing interest among marketers in seeking to engage consumers in ways deemed culturally relevant rather than with "one size fits all" pitches. The trend is being fed by data from the 2000 census, showing sizable increases in minority populations, as well as by hopes that appealing to market niches or segments may be profitable in a weak economy. 
 "It's all about understanding unique consumer behavior throughout the buying process," said David Finkel, president and chief executive at Brann. "Different segments need to be communicated to differently." 
Brann, part of the Diversified Agency Group unit of Havas Advertising, the big French-owned agency company, is rebranding Wong Wong Boyack as Brann Wong Wong.
There are eight employees at Brann Wong Wong, which handles accounts with billings estimated at $10 million from clients like American Savings Bank in Honolulu, Cisco Systems and Sina.com, a Web site for Chinese communities.
Brann Wong Wong will operate from the San Francisco office of Brann, as the first unit of Brann that will be focused on marketing to consumers of specific ethnicity. The agency will work not only with Brann San Francisco but also with the 17 Brann offices in 14 cities in Europe and North America.
"We wanted to have an Asian capability," Mr. Finkel said, because that market is the fastest growing of the nation's major ethnic markets as well as highly educated and affluent.
The 2000 census showed there were 10.2 million Americans who identified themselves as "Asian," compared with 6.9 million who did so in 1990. If the people who described themselves as of two or more races are included, the "Asian" number in 2000 climbed to almost 11.9 million; the 1990 census did not include a combination-race question.
Mr. Finkel said Brann was also attracted to Wong Wong Boyack by the strengths of the agency's top executives. They are Penelope Wong, president and chief executive, and her brother, Ben Wong, chairman and chief financial officer. (The Boyack in Wong Wong Boyack referred to Lee Boyack, who had led account services before leaving the agency in 1996.)
"We are not an ethnic agency that uses direct marketing by default," said Ms. Wong, who identifies herself as Chinese-American. "We approach it as direct marketing, as target marketing, and we use all the strategic tools that are available to us."
Ms. Wong suggested several reasons for the interest in acquiring her agency, which was founded in 1991. Advertisers want larger agencies as they themselves grow larger, she said, through expansion or acquisition. And being part of Brann, she added, would give her clients access to additional resources like research.
Ms. Wong, 48, takes on the added post of executive vice president and director for strategic business and brand development at Brann San Francisco. Mr. Wong, 50, takes on the added post of executive vice president and director for strategic planning and insight at Brann San Francisco.
About two years ago, Mr. Finkel said, Brann identified ethnic marketing as a priority and also looked into expanding into direct marketing to Spanish-speaking consumers.
Brann Wong Wong works on direct marketing campaigns to mainstream consumers in this country as well as ads aimed at Asians abroad, in languages including those spoken by Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and Vietnamese. Those tasks include direct mail, online advertising and ads encouraging consumers to call a toll-free number or to visit a Web site.
Ms. Wong offered a personal perspective on the Asian-American market.
"There are so many things that Asian-Americans need but they can't find," she said. She told a story about how difficult it was for her, not so many years ago, to find eyeglasses that would fit her face -- even in San Francisco, a city with a large Asian-American population.
"My nose is a Chinese nose; I don't have much of a bridge," Ms. Wong said. "Sophia Loren has a really different nose than I do. So does Calvin Klein. These things just fall right off my face."
"Now it's pretty easy for me to go into an eyeglass store and find several styles that work," she added, "but I used to have to go to Hong Kong."
"Those are the kinds of opportunities I'm talking about," Ms. Wong concluded. "There was a need, there were plenty of consumers to serve, and it just took people a while to figure out."

HEADLINE: Franchisees On Edge; 
Some Angry Ones Sue As GNC Competes

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
A decade ago, the General Nutrition Companies was a venerable but wobbly company in the business of selling vitamins and nutritional supplements, mostly to true believers in their health benefits. Then it decided to offer franchises to entrepreneurs who dreamed of being their own boss.
 From that moment, GNC stores spread like St. John's wort, building a mass market by opening in shopping centers and along country roads. Their owners, many of them longtime GNC customers, usually prospered, selling multivitamins and muscle-building supplements, soy products and herbal remedies. 
 GNC, since 1999 a division of the Dutch company Royal Numico, became the vitamin king, with a 15 percent share of the American market and sales of $1.28 billion last year. It won plaudits as a top franchiser. 
But these days, some store owners say, they are besieged by cold-eyed competition -- not from other vitamin merchants, but from GNC itself.
At least a dozen lawsuits are pending against the company, with several more expected by next month. Last week GNC announced a settlement with some franchisees, who had sued it over what they called unfair pricing and other complaints. But the settlement stops well short of addressing all their concerns.
The central issue is how aggressive GNC has been in opening its own stores, which benefit from lower wholesale prices on many products. Often these stores are not far from existing franchises. And two years ago the company struck a deal with the Rite-Aid Corporation to open at least 1,000 GNC centers inside its drugstores. So far, 605 Rite-Aids have the centers, with 220 more expected this year. GNC is also manufacturing private-label products for Rite-Aid.
"Our worst competition," said Daniel Brandt, a GNC franchisee in Silverdale, Wash., who is not a plaintiff, "is the company."
Company executives say that they have no desire to ruin their franchisees and that the dissatisfaction among a relative handful of franchisees comes from their own shortcomings.
"The franchisees are perhaps poor operators, and are running into financial difficulty," said Jim Sander, GNC's general counsel, when asked why so many lawsuits had been filed. He noted that more companies have started selling vitamins and related products, just as demand has contracted with a slowing economy.
"It makes no sense for us to drive a franchisee out of business," he said. "It would destroy the good will that a location has with its customers, and would make them look down on General Nutrition."
Nearly all the franchisees' lawsuits share a similar theme -- that GNC misled them about its pricing structure, the company-store program or the arrangement with Rite-Aid. Jeffrey Goldstein, a Washington lawyer representing some plaintiffs, recently amended several lawsuits to include racketeering claims, based on similarities among many cases. 
In last week's settlement of several lawsuits that had sought class-action status for all independent franchisees, the company said it would spend $4.2 million over two years to give franchisees credits worth $125 a store a month for two years.
It is unclear, however, how many franchisees will be interested. For it to be binding, 90 percent of them must approve it. Ed Bishop, a store owner from Indiana and legal director for an association that represents about 300 franchisees, said everyone he had talked to was planning to opt out of the settlement. Those who accept the settlement are still free to file new lawsuits against the company in the future. Calling the $125 credit "peanuts," he said he typically orders $16,000 worth of GNC products a month for each of his two stores.
But Russ Cooper, the senior vice president in charge of franchising at GNC, said he had an enthusiastic response to the settlement from around the country. "I think we'll be over the 90 percent hurdle that we need," he said.
Some plaintiffs in the lawsuits were successful before things took a turn for the worse. Kevin and Jeniffer Lee, owners of several stores in the Los Angeles area, won sales awards like the "Million Dollar Store" prize before a company-owned store opened not far away, according to documents filed in the case.
GNC has 1,430 franchised stores and 2,700 company-owned stores, Mr. Cooper said. Company stores are opened twice as fast as franchisee stores, he said, calling this "a healthy mix." Company stores are usually in indoor malls, he said, while franchisees tend to be in strip malls or by themselves.
Company stores pay less than franchisees for many of their products, Mr. Cooper said, but a few products, like vitamin E and beta carotene, are sold to franchisees at a loss or at cost.
He maintains that franchisees could profit even with dual pricing by keeping inventories high and following other recommended GNC sales practices.
GNC said a franchise typically takes in about $340,000 annually, compared with $450,000 at a company store. "The gross margin for franchisees is about 50 percent," Mr. Cooper said, while company stores' profits are declining.
The company-owned stores are part of GNC's "competition program." Executives say the program was prompted in 1998 by price-cutting at a rival, Vitamin World, a unit of Nature's Bounty.
One franchisee, Gulzar Niazi, saw a company store materialize in a mall four miles away within months of his opening his store. After complaining to GNC management in Pittsburgh, he said, he began to receive failing grades from company inspection teams. Last month, Mr. Niazi lost his store and said he would file for bankruptcy. "I am wrecked, wrecked, wrecked," he said in an interview.
Mr. Cooper said Mr. Niazi did not keep enough products on his shelves. "He was getting store report scores of 53 out of a possible 100," he said.
But the real trouble, Mr. Niazi said, was the company store in the Waterbury Mall, which was undercutting his prices. A product called Myaplex Light, for instance, which cost him $25.80 wholesale, was sold to customers for $20 in the mall store, he said. He collected dozens of receipts as evidence.
Mr. Niazi's experience is echoed by others. "I have suffered from that," said Eric Miller, who owns six stores in the Philadelphia area and otherwise calls himself a contented GNC franchisee. "You do what you can. You have to match GNC's prices in their competition program." 
Documents in the Lees' lawsuit, which speaks of a pattern of fraud by GNC's franchising arm, manufacturing division and corporate offices, include a declaration by Kevin Lee, the Los Angeles franchisee, in which he accuses the company of having a "wholesale dual-pricing structure under the competition program that has devastated my stores."
Mr. Lee is trying to force GNC to turn over internal documents that would show how it picked store sites, formed its discount programs and set up its contracts. In a similar lawsuit by a franchisee in Baltimore, the judge issued an order last month to compel GNC to turn over internal memos.
Mr. Cooper said the company planned to comply with every legal requirement in the lawsuits. He and company lawyers denied any unlawful activity. Mr. Cooper said the Lees' business fell off because a store manager left and a Vitamin World store moved in next to them. As for the Baltimore case, filed by a franchisee named Igor Rafalovich, Mr. Cooper said: "He's an individual who does not understand franchising. He's challenged by that."
Mr. Goldstein, who represents the Lees and Mr. Rafalovich, responded: "No jury is going to believe these absurd excuses."
Mr. Bishop, the store owner from Indiana, said he became legal director (even though he is not a lawyer) of the franchisees' association two years ago after encountering problems himself.
At a presentation in Pittsburgh in 1998, he said, the company promised generous margins and told of excellent prospects for franchise owners. Since then, he has battled GNC over a variety of issues, from its use of his customer list for e-mail marketing that directs them to shop on Drugstore.com, in which GNC is a stakeholder, to its sending him expired products, which Mr. Bishop had to pay for because he did not return them within two weeks. 
Franchisees pay up to $32,500 for the right to open a store, and perhaps $200,000 for the fixtures and stocking the shelves, according to the 1999 offering plan. They must pay rent to GNC, which insists on being the leaseholder for all stores, and contract with the company for accounting services, in addition to buying products from GNC. They are permitted to buy from other companies as well, as long as the products are approved by GNC.
Mr. Brandt, the Washington state franchisee, said he negotiated his own lease for his first store, at $14 a square foot. Then, he said, there was a snag. GNC wanted the lease in its name, so it "came in behind me and said, we'll give you $18 a square foot," he recalled.
"I once had more trust in this company, but once they did that, I was really surprised. At that point, I had already paid the franchise fee."
Financing is also an issue. To open stores, Mr. Cooper said, many franchisees borrow from the company. "We have competitive rates," he said, "and we don't require them to pledge their personal assets."
But one longtime franchisee who planned to open another store this year said she had looked into the GNC offer and turned it down. "The interest rate is 12 percent," said the franchisee, Blanche Green, who owns a store in Cartersville, Ga., that became a GNC store 10 years ago. "I can beat that at my local bank."
In the last two years, at least 300 franchisees have left GNC, Mr. Brandt said. Their names, locations and closing dates are listed in the offering plan distributed to prospective franchisees.
In the early 1980's, some franchisers came under fire for their treatment of franchisees, said Ann Dugan, co-author of a training manual called "Franchising 101" and an expert on small business at the University of Pittsburgh. "There are some things that GNC has come down hard on their franchisees for that seem foolish to me," she said. "Franchisees are business owners. They've got to make money." 
Robert L. Purvin, author of "The Franchise Fraud," (John Wiley & Sons, 1994) and an advocate with the American Franchisee Association, said he had contacted the Federal Trade Commission about some of the problems at GNC. But he said there had been little response. An F.T.C. lawyer, Robert Frisby, said the agency had taken three actions against GNC in the last 32 years, all for misleading claims on products, not franchises. He would not say whether any franchising complaints were being investigated.
GNC, meanwhile, plans to keep expanding. "Our growth will come primarily from international stores this year," Mr. Cooper said. "And we will open 100 stores domestically this year. Over half our openings will be done by franchisees." 
Mr. Purvin remained worried, though, about the future of GNC's franchises. The company is now "predominantly a manufacturer," he said.
"It's looking for ways to sell as many of its products as it can."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Drop Sharply on Concern Over Message From Fed

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday after the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to its lowest level since spring 1994.
 The Fed's policy makers cited the possibility of continued economic weakness for their decision to cut their target for the federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 3.5 percent from 3.75 percent. The rate reduction, the seventh this year, was part of the aggressive effort to revive the sluggish economy. 
 Still, analysts said that investors were now more concerned about weak corporate profits than about monetary policy and that the downbeat tone from the Federal Reserve shook investors' confidence in an already volatile trading environment. Stocks, which had been modestly higher ahead of the announcement at 2:15 p.m., tumbled in a broad decline.
"It's the statement that's knocking the wind out of the market," said Peter I. Cardillo, chief strategist at Westfalia Investments. "The Fed is not convinced that we're in any sort of recovery."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 145.93 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 10,174.14. The Nasdaq composite index declined 50.05 points, or 2.7 percent, to 1,831.30, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 14.15 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,157.26.
Notable losers yesterday included semiconductor issues like Linear Technology, which fell $3.22, to $39; Altera, which lost $1.86, to $26.48; and Xilinx, which dropped $1.92, to $36.48. Intel fell $1.13, to $27.07. 
Abby Joseph Cohen, who has been perennially bullish, also weighed in yesterday with mixed signals about the future of the economy. Ms. Cohen, chief investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs, cut her forecast for the end of the year for the S.& P. 500 to 1,500 from 1,550, although she still predicted a rise of more than 28 percent in the index the rest of the year. 
Analysts and economists said the most important part of the Fed's rate decision yesterday was the central bank's tone about the future of the economy.
"It seems as though the move and the communique are a push and that the Fed is taking a wait-and-see attitude," said Bryan Piskorowski, market commentator at Prudential Securities.
"That leads to more inertia for the market for the very near term," he said. "We're going to need another strong stream of data points to really come to a better view of where the economy stands." --------------------

AOL Time Warner Will Cut More Jobs

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
AOL Time Warner Inc., the world's largest Internet and media company, said yesterday that it would cut more than 1,200 jobs at America Online, its Internet unit, and would take a third-quarter charge of $100 million to $125 million.
 The unit, which employs about 16,000 people, also said it would eliminate another 500 jobs as part of an alliance between its Netscape division and Sun Microsystems Inc. 
 The cost-cutting effort -- the third major round of layoffs at the company after the completion of the $106.2 billion merger of AOL and Time Warner in January -- was widely expected by analysts. 
AOL, which is based in Dulles, Va., said the reorganization aims to integrate more tightly its multiple online brands and Web properties.
As part of the reorganization, the company said it would create a new AOL Interactive Services Group that would encompass the AOL service and its local Digital City guide business. It will be led by Jonathan Sacks, the AOL president.
It will also create a new AOL Web Properties Group, led by Jim Bankoff, formerly president of the pioneering Netscape software business. 
The group will encompass Netscape, CompuServe, Moviefone, Mapquest and the popular instant messaging services ICQ and AOL.
The move follows cuts announced earlier this year.
In January, the company cut 2,400 jobs in several areas, including its 24-hour news network CNN, its publishing unit that houses People and Time magazines, and its film units, including New Line Cinema.
The company, which employs a total of about 90,000 people, also said this summer it would close its Warner Brothers Studio Stores by October, cutting 3,800 jobs.
Analysts have said the company has to cut costs to come close to meeting its aggressive financial targets for 2001, given the economic uncertainty and advertising slowdown.
While some analysts have reduced their 2001 earnings and revenue estimates for AOL Time Warner recently, most concur that the company is still one of the better-insulated media companies.
Yesterday, AOL Time Warner shares fell 31 cents, to close at $39.90.

HEADLINE: Age Limit Is Urged for Motorized Scooter Users 

BYLINE:  By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
Concerned about rising numbers of injuries, the Consumer Product Safety Commission will warn parents today not to permit children younger than 12 to ride motorized toy scooters.
 Sleek silver scooters like the Razor, featuring thin plastic wheels and a foot brake, took off in popularity last year, and so did scooter-related injuries. This year, the commission said, motorized versions of those toys have become more common, and so have related injuries. 
 There were roughly 4,390 injuries from motorized scooters that required emergency-room treatment last year, and about 39 percent of the injuries involved children under 15, the commission said. In the first seven months of this year, the commission found, 2,250 people were taken to emergency rooms for injuries associated with motorized scooters. 
In addition, since the beginning of last year, two children and one adult have died after accidents involving motorized scooters, the commission said. Most recently, a 6-year-old boy in Orange County, Calif., died on Aug. 15 from injuries sustained six days earlier when he fell from a motorized scooter.
Ann Brown, the chairwoman of the safety commission, said the motorized scooters on the market, most of which go 9 to 14 miles an hour, travel too swiftly for young children.
"No 6-year-old should be on these things," she said. "Children under 12 do not have the manual dexterity to use them."
At the start of last year, California banned children younger than 16 from driving motorized scooters.
"We are concerned," said Sgt. Steven Doan of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. "We are seeing an increased use in an age group that is too young to use these scooters. With younger children it's a recipe for disaster."
Washington and Oregon also restrict the use of motorized scooters, and several towns and cities have passed laws prohibiting children from riding them.
Small privately held companies dominate the market for motorized scooters, which generally sell for $400 to $1,000. Patmont Motor Werks is the largest manufacturer, and made about 100,000 motorized Go-Ped scooters last year, according to the commission. Steve Patmont, the chief executive of the company, declined to confirm those sales estimates but said that sales were down slightly this year because of the slowing economy.
Other larger companies are planning to get into the market -- and focus on a younger audience. Fisher-Price, a unit of Mattel, plans to sell an electric scooter this holiday season that will travel at about 7 m.p.h. The scooter, which will sell for $250, is made for children age 6 and older.
Laurie Oravec, a spokeswoman for Fisher-Price, says her company's toy scooter, the Power Wheels Lightning Powered Action Cycle, would be safe for children because it accelerated slowly. The scooter has wide air-filled tires that can be ridden on grass, and Ms. Oravec said it was meant for backyard, not street, use.
Only a limited number, perhaps as few as 10,000, of the Lightnings will be available this holiday season. More will be shipped by next spring, she said. 
Jacqueline Elder, the deputy assistant executive director for the commission's Office of Hazard Identification and Reduction, said that although she would have to see the Fisher-Price scooter to assess its safety, its low speed might make it safe enough for young children.
Ms. Oravec said she hoped the commission would find that the Fisher-Price toy was a safe alternative to the current batch of motorized scooters.
"We are very good at taking older-age trends and bringing them down to a younger age child," Ms. Oravec said. "We are viewing the Lightning as the solution to the issues the C.P.S.C. is raising. Here is a vehicle that kids under 12 can use."
Ms. Brown said people who ride motorized scooters should wear sturdy shoes, helmets, knee pads and elbow pads. And she said the scooters should not be used at night.
Mr. Patmont said he approved of the safety commission's warning, but said that the government could have gone further.
"We feel strongly that scooters are not toys and are not for children under 16," he said. "It's absolutely not a toy; it's a serious transportation device."

HEADLINE: Budget War In Albany Pits Pataki Against All 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
As summer began, the Capitol was mired in its annual budget deadlock. The battle lines were drearily familiar: Gov. George E. Pataki and the Republican-led Senate versus the Democrat-controlled Assembly.
 Today, there is nothing familiar about this fight. A partisan struggle between Republicans and Democrats has turned into an institutional one, pitting the governor against the Legislature. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and his troops joined forces with the Assembly Democrats and, over Mr. Pataki's objections, adopted a budget shot full of holes, hoping to force the governor to the negotiating table. 
 The tactic seems to have worked, for now. The governor and legislative leaders held their third budget negotiation today, discussing new sources of revenue, like Indian casinos, video gambling machines at race tracks, or joining the multistate Powerball lottery, that could offset education spending sought by the Legislature. 
Mr. Bruno and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, left the session today sounding optimistic that a deal could be near. Mr. Pataki did not. "I'm continuing to make it plain to them these are difficult economic times," he said.
At its core, this year's conflict is an intensification of a long-running power struggle between Mr. Pataki and the Legislature. The governor has repeatedly tried to assert greater control over the budget process and tie the hands of a Legislature that he believes has overstepped its bounds and reflexively spends too much. This year, he made his firmest stand yet, and the Legislature pushed back like never before, prompting the governor to ask the courts to settle the matter once and for all.
"The governor's lawsuit has less to do with this year's budget than with future budgets," said the leader of the Assembly's Republican minority, John J. Faso, who is close to Mr. Pataki. "A large part of the governor's motivation is to establish the authority of the office."
Even if this year's impasse is resolved, the governor's aides say the lawsuit and the more fundamental struggle it represents will continue.
Several aggravating factors helped bring the fight to a head this year, including a slowing economy that prompted Mr. Pataki to dig in his heels.
Most important, Mr. Bruno and the Senate Republicans, who had long been frustrated by dealing with the Democrats, grew equally impatient with the governor. Unlike the experience of previous years, they were unable until last week to coax Mr. Pataki into negotiation and compromise, and saw in his actions a lack of respect for the Legislature and its role.
"The governor acts as though the Senate is just there to do his bidding, he has this take-it-or-leave-it attitude, and Joe got tired of it," said a lobbyist who is close to Mr. Bruno.
Aides to Mr. Bruno said he became particularly irked when Mr. Pataki began sending the Legislature emergency spending bills to keep the government running a week at a time, rather than two or three weeks. That forced the Legislature to return to Albany every week, long after the scheduled end of this year's legislative session in June. Meanwhile, the governor was criss-crossing the state, cutting ribbons and criticizing the Legislature, but would not meet legislative leaders to discuss the budget.
Mr. Pataki took the position that his job was done when he proposed a budget in January, and that he should not negotiate budget details with the Legislature. For most of this year, Mr. Bruno agreed, joining the governor in assailing the Democrats and calling on them to begin budget conference committee meetings. The Republicans even held mock conference sessions and lectured Democrats in absentia, before an audience of reporters, for not attending.
"Joe was incredibly frustrated that the process wasn't moving," said a Republican senator. "He thought Shelly's approach was wrong, but he understood it."
Under a 1998 law passed at Mr. Pataki's insistence, legislators go unpaid after the April 1 start of the fiscal year if there is no budget. By mid-summer, irritation with the governor was running high in both houses, and lawmakers were pressuring Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver to get paychecks issued again.
August loomed as a deadline. Most school districts outside New York City have to send out their property tax bills before Sept. 1, and without the expected increase in aid from Albany, those bills would rise. It was a smaller issue to the Assembly Democrats, but Senate Republicans feared blame for higher taxes.
Ultimately, it was Mr. Bruno who proposed last month that they pass a stripped-down budget, aides in both houses said. In announcing the deal in late July, Mr. Bruno repeatedly stressed that the Legislature was "an equal partner" in the process, wording that his aides say was aimed at the governor.
From the 1970's until 1997, budgets were negotiated by governors and legislative leaders. Then, in 1998, the Assembly and Senate abandoned that method and drafted a budget in public conference committees without directly involving the governor.
Mr. Pataki, not tied to the deal, vetoed 1,300 spending items worth $1.6 billion. He also pushed the boundaries of how the line-item veto power had been used in the past, leading to a still-pending lawsuit by Mr. Silver. The Democrats concluded from 1998 that the governor had to be a party to the budget deal -- the outlines, if not the specifics -- or he would veto their pet programs at will.
But since then, Mr. Pataki has resisted negotiations. The negotiated budgets of the past, his office argues, were a legislative power grab in defiance of the state Constitution, which gives governors the most control over budgets.
Mr. Pataki and his aides insist that he was always willing to discuss broad parameters, but that the Assembly's spending demands were so high -- more than $2 billion above the governor's proposed $83.6 billion -- that there was no point in talking. They note, rightly, that the governor's call for a 5 percent spending increase was hardly austere, and that independent fiscal monitors applauded his restraint.
"When the speaker says the governor won't negotiate, what he's really saying is the governor won't cave in to my demands to spend more," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor.
But the gap between Mr. Silver and Mr. Pataki was less stark than it appeared. Each year, the Assembly seeks billions more than the governor, but it is a bargaining position, later abandoned. And as much as a month ago, in private talks, Mr. Silver cut his demands by more than $1 billion, leaving him at roughly the same level as the Senate.
The governor rejected even that as too much, helping push the Senate toward turning its back on Mr. Pataki. He and his aides acknowledge that the governor has been more rigid than usual this year about not increasing spending much above his proposal, but they say that is due to his fears about the economy, not to a desire to have his way.
A more basic dispute stems from the way Mr. Pataki writes his budgets, and the fact that the state Constitution puts strict limits on what the Legislature can do to his appropriations bills.
With each passing year, the governor has inserted into his appropriations bills more and more text containing changes in state law on how money is spent. He has also increasingly lumped many projects together as a few large, general line items. With those changes, he has sought to give himself the maximum power to alter state law and decide how money is used, with minimal input from the Legislature.
Legislators began complaining about this trend a few years ago, and this year they tried to reverse it by amending some of the governor's budget bills. In his suit, Mr. Pataki, said that step violated the state Constitution. Mr. Silver and others countered that the governor's bills themselves were unconstitutional. Legal experts say it is not clear who is right.
Mr. Pataki's aides say they are confident he will not be hurt politically by the mess, citing polls showing that most New Yorkers blame the Legislature. Legislators, in turn, express similar confidence, and some predict that ultimately, as state services suffer, so will the governor.
In any case, both sides argue, the stakes for control of state budgets are high enough to run those risks.

HEADLINE: Text of Federal Reserve's Statement 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy panel, decided to lower interest rates: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 3 1/2 percent. 
In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 3 percent. Today's action by the F.O.M.C. brings the decline in the target federal funds rate since the beginning of the year to 300 basis points. 
 Household demand has been sustained, but business profits and capital spending continue to weaken, and growth abroad is slowing, weighing on the U.S. economy. The associated easing of pressures on labor and product markets is expected to keep inflation contained. 
Although long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable, the committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. 
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas.

HEADLINE: High Noon in Albany 

 BODY:
New York's governor is now suing the Legislature over the state budget. Meanwhile, schools are preparing to open without a clear idea of how much money they will have this year, and other important state services are in danger of running out of cash. The legal arguments must be suspended long enough to resolve the immediate crisis. 
 The standoff between the governor, George Pataki, and the Legislature began with a fight over how high next year's state revenues are likely to be. As always happens in Albany, the governor has picked a conservative figure, with the lawmakers opting for much more optimistic numbers that would allow room for additional spending. Traditionally, the two sides meet somewhere in the middle. But this year Mr. Pataki, citing the slowing economy, refused to budge. Now the governor and legislative leaders are talking again and are said to be close to an agreement. If so, it is long past time. 
 Cynics -- which Albany has in abundance -- wonder if the lawsuit is just another chip in the bargaining that Mr. Pataki would sacrifice in return for concessions from the Legislature. Certainly, the lawmakers are terrified of the prospect that the governor might go ahead with his court fight and strip them of their budget-making powers.
The suit centers on the State Constitution, written in 1927. The framers, whose opinion of the State Legislature was even lower than the public's is today, decreed that the governor had the duty to propose a detailed budget. The Legislature could only eliminate spending items or reduce spending -- two of its least-favorite occupations. The idea was to curb logrolling, the Legislature's habit of insisting that money directed at one town or district had to be duplicated for everybody else's bailiwick. But once the Constitution was ratified, Albany quickly reverted to a system of behind-the-scenes negotiation and tradeoffs that allowed the Legislature far more leeway to tinker.
Mr. Pataki has been pushing the limits of his power, particularly in his insistence that he has the authority to rewrite state laws in his budget. This year, for instance, he dramatically changed the rules on how school aid can be spent, and rewrote the reimbursement rates to nursing homes whose patients are on Medicaid. Citing the Constitution, he claimed that the Legislature, which wrote the original rules, had no right to object.
The governor's position seems like a stretch. Budgets in 1927 were generally simpler documents that did not accommodate the kind of changes in state policy that he has been trying to make. But his lawyers say his arguments are solid. The legislators feel they are now involved in what one aide called a "death-grip battle" to save their prerogatives.
It's possible that Mr. Pataki is grandstanding for the benefit of the conservative wing of his party, which has been angry about his pre-re-election drift to the left. He may also have been driven to this extreme step by frustration with the State Legislature, a syndrome familiar to anyone working for New York's government. But there is no excuse for holding the state's schools and social services hostage to his pique.

HEADLINE: The Last Freeway 

 BODY:
For at least a few minutes after it opened at 5 p.m. on Monday, the new six-mile stretch of the Foothill Freeway from Fontana to Rancho Cucamonga must have looked almost as fresh as the six-mile Arroyo Seco Parkway did when it first carried traffic from Pasadena to Los Angeles in December 1940. Together, these two stretches of concrete are the alpha and the near-omega of urban freeway construction in California. The Arroyo Seco Parkway, later renamed the Pasadena Freeway, opened just two months after the Pennsylvania Turnpike, becoming the first freeway in the West. The extension of the Foothill Freeway, which will fully link San Dimas and San Bernardino by 2006, may be the last. There are no new California freeways in the planning, a fact that gathers a lot of meaning when you consider that the Foothill Freeway was first sketched out in 1948. 
 This does not mean that the Los Angeles area freeways go everywhere commuters believe they should go. It means that the cost of adding more freeway miles -- measured in political will and environmental and social sacrifice as well as real dollars -- has grown unacceptable. But it also means that in the oscillating rhythm of housing and economic development and highway construction, some momentous stasis has been reached, at least in Southern California. It is tempting to say that the finishing of the Foothill Freeway will mark the end of an era. It is probably more accurate to say that with the completion of the Foothill Freeway inertia wins out. But then most L.A. commuters would argue that inertia threatens to win out almost every day on nearly every mile of the city's freeways. 
 The concrete grid that now enmeshes Los Angeles is beyond hyperbole. It was beyond hyperbole even in the mid-1960's, when the construction rush was still in its early days. For Reyner Banham, the influential English architectural critic writing in 1971, the freeway system was "indeed one of the greater works of Man." For the novelist Thomas Pynchon in 1967, an access road "was this hypodermic needle, inserted somewhere ahead into the vein of a freeway, a vein nourishing the mainliner L.A., keeping it happy, coherent, protected from pain, or whatever passes, with a city, for pain." 
In concept, the freeways must have looked like passage between one reality -- home -- and another -- work. But the lane stripes had hardly dried on the first of them before it became clear that the freeways were a reality unto themselves, a reality that offered a psychological freedom and a psychological burden to drivers all at once. In Joan Didion's 1970 novel, "Play It as It Lays," one character surrenders compulsively to the Los Angeles freeways. Day after day, "she drove the San Diego to the Harbor, the Harbor up to the Hollywood, the Hollywood to the Golden State, the Santa Monica, the Santa Ana, the Pasadena, the Ventura. She drove it as a riverman runs a river, every day more attuned to its currents, its deceptions." 
Those deceptions are the stuff of legend. Los Angeles is a city full of drivers who pride themselves on the subtlety with which they navigate the freeway system. The freeways are, in some sense, the most fully visualized constructs in the Los Angeles basin, watched closely by Caltrans cameras, always under some form of electronic surveillance, if only to keep the traffic flowing. They manage to be utopian and dystopian at once. Their flyovers and interchanges are monuments to power and artifacts of need. The logic of motion the freeways embody has long since overwhelmed the coherence that defines communities and neighborhoods. That logic is as simple as this: a better way to San Bernardino.

HEADLINE: Slaying Suspect Remains Free; 3-Year-Old Son Is Found Dead 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
The 3-year-old son of a Ukrainian immigrant sought in the slayings of his wife and four relatives was found dead today in a box under a light tower in a Sacramento suburb.
 The authorities were led to the body of the boy, Sergey Soltys, by a note found on Monday night in a car owned by his father, Nikolay Soltys. 
 The boy had been stabbed to death, the police said. 
The authorities say Mr. Soltys killed his wife, an aunt and uncle, and two young cousins on Monday. The authorities posted a $10,000 reward for him today and pursued dozens of tips in a nationwide manhunt.
The note that led to the boy's body was written on the back of a photograph of the child and his mother, Lyubov Soltys, who was one of the victims. It was tucked into a pocket in the car door, Sergeant Lewis said. The car was found parked behind a store. A search of the area turned up nothing but the note.
Mr. Soltys was seen both at the scene where his wife was found stabbed to death and at the home where his aunt, uncle and cousins were killed, about 20 minutes away, the authorities say. A warrant names Mr. Soltys as the suspect in the five slayings, and Sergeant Lewis said investigators believed that he was responsible for his son's death.
Sergeant Lewis said the child was found in a rural area in Placer County, east of Sacramento, in a box large enough to hold a 36-inch television.
Sergeant Lewis said the discovery of the body was "probably the most distressing of all, because there was a great deal of hope throughout the department that we would be able to find this child safe and sound."
The authorities were investigating reports that Mr. Soltys had headed to Seattle, where he has relatives. Sergeant Lewis said Mr. Soltys also had relatives in North Carolina and New York.
Officers in the Sacramento area were stationed at bus terminals and airports. Sheriff's deputies also planned to hand out fliers in Russian and English in some neighborhoods in the Sacramento area, home to an estimated 75,000 Ukrainian and Russian immigrants.
Investigators said that they were unaware of a motive for the stabbings but that they were looking into reports that some relatives were unhappy that Mr. Soltys was unemployed and on welfare.
"He had mental problems," said Inna Yasinsky, an aunt of one of the children killed on Monday.
Investigators said Mr. Soltys had been rejected by the Ukrainian army for mental instability. He also had a history of domestic violence in Ukraine, but he had no known criminal record in the United States since his arrival more than a year ago.
His wife, who was about three months' pregnant, left Ukraine and reluctantly joined him about five months ago, said Frank Russell, the chaplain of the Sheriff's Department, whose office counseled relatives after the killings.
After reuniting with his wife, Mr. Soltys apparently began trying to refashion his life by going to college. His wife had planned to start a new job on Monday.

HEADLINE: TRENDS; 
Jilted by the New Economy, Tech Refugees Find Solace in the Old One

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
American companies have announced almost one million job cuts this year and more than one-quarter of them have come from the telecommunications and computer industries. Given those figures, it may be natural to assume that technology workers have suffered disproportionately as the economy has stumbled. 
 Uh-uh. 
 As in previous economic downturns, middle managers, sales representatives and industrial workers are bearing the brunt of the pain. But digitally gifted refugees from the new economy are finding jobs in the old economy, where their skills are very much in demand and business, while not robust, has not fallen off nearly as much as at companies that hitched their fortunes to the Internet.
 "There are still lots of opening at old economy businesses for computer-literate workers," said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at economy.com. "So people being laid off at places like Cisco are going to places like Countrywide Home Loans."
 The booming housing and health care industries have also protected their workers. But Mr. Zandi cautioned that could change if the economy continues to weaken."The next month or two will be critical," he said. "The economy is right on the edge. What happens with the tax rebate and the second quarter revision to the G.D.P. will decide the economy's direction." DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Target Reports Rise in Profit; Saks Says Its Losses Widened 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Target Corporation said yesterday that its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 5 percent as it lured consumers concerned about prices in the slowing economy, while Saks Inc. said its second-quarter loss widened because of declining sales at its Saks Fifth Avenue chain and regional department stores.
 Target's net income rose to $271 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $258 million, or 28 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales in the period ended Aug. 4 rose 8.5 percent, to $8.95 billion. 
 The results matched analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
Sluggish sales at the company's department stores may keep full-year earnings below forecasts, said Doug Scovanner, the company's chief financial officer.
Third-quarter profit will probably be at the low end of forecasts, the company said. Analysts' estimates range from 25 to 31 cents, First Call said. The 68-cent average forecast for the fourth quarter probably is too low, Target said.
Target may miss full-year goals if its Marshall Field's department store chain lags sales expectations, or if sales of low-profit goods at Target discount stores drag down margins, Mr. Scovanner said.
Shares of Target, based in Minneapolis, fell $1.74, to $35.36.
At Saks, net losses widened to $58.4 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $5.79 million, or 4 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales in the period ended Aug. 4 fell 8.5 percent, to $1.27 billion. Excluding a $3.8 million gain from the repurchase of bonds and $19.8 million in expenses for store closings and a reorganization of the company's catalog business, Saks said it would have lost $42.4 million, or 30 cents a share, a penny narrower than the 31 cents expected by analysts. Earlier this month, Saks said the loss would be 28 to 32 cents a share. The average forecast at the time was 14 cents.
Shares of Saks fell 19 cents, to $10.51. The results were released after the close of regular trading.

HEADLINE: Drug's Removal Exposes Holes In Europe's Net 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
When Bayer announced earlier this month that it was withdrawing its fast-selling cholesterol-lowering drug from the market, it pleased officials at the United States Food and Drug Administration, who had become alarmed by a rising number of deaths and severe reactions linked to the drug.
 But in Europe, where Bayer is based, the move startled regulators and exposed considerable confusion. As recently as June, regulators from countries in the European Union decided that problems with the drug, sold under the brand names Lipobay and Baycol, could be handled through new warnings to doctors and patients. 
 Now, as they seek to respond to the problem, they are also trying to sort out who in Europe is responsible for dealing with such issues. Bayer is a German company, but its drug was licensed in Europe by the British authorities, with neighboring countries essentially adopting its decision. 
But Britain's regulator, the Medicines Control Agency, does not have the main responsibility for monitoring a drug's safety after it has been approved. That is supposed to be shared by each government within the European Union. 
German health officials now say that Bayer failed to give them the troubling data that it turned over to British regulators in June. The British agency, which never sent the report to its counterparts, says that was Bayer's responsibility.
And Europe's umbrella organization for drug regulation, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products, contends that it has little role to play because it was not involved in the licensing.
"There is a real problem with coordination," said Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics at the University of Cologne and an adviser to the German Ministry of Health. "One country like Great Britain can have responsibility for the approval process, but not for safety. The problem currently is who, exactly, is responsible on the European level for safety."
Bayer says that Baycol, also known by the generic name cerivastatin, has been linked to 52 deaths around the world, mostly in cases where patients took it in combination with another cholesterol-lowering drug, gemfibrozil, which is sold under the brand name Lopid. 
The problem is that Baycol, when used in combination with gemfibrozil, occasionally produced a disorder that caused a breakdown of muscle cells, leading to kidney failure. 
Regulators in Europe and the United States had become increasingly worried about Bayer's drug, which was approved in 1997. But their reactions differed considerably.
In the United States, Bayer was required to include warnings to doctors and patients against combining Baycol with gemfibrozil as early as 1999. European regulators did not demand a comparable warning until June, after Bayer presented them with data about harmful reactions in Europe.
Michael Diehl, a spokesman for Bayer, said the European warnings came later because fewer Europeans combined drugs and fewer problems arose.
But the F.D.A. may also have had access to more complete data. The agency collects reports from across the country, but in Europe, regulators piece together reports from each member country. 
Spanish health officials reported in June that three people had died in the previous six months from the muscle-weakening disease, known as rhabdomyolysis. 
More recently, German health officials have said that five deaths may be linked to the drug. But those are much smaller numbers than the 31 deaths recorded by the F.D.A., a fact that Dr. Lauterbach said might have impeded European officials from recognizing the severity of the problem. 
Poor sharing of information surfaced again when Bayer submitted a study to British regulators on June 15. That study was based on data compiled by an American health maintenance organization and showed that severe reactions were more common among people who combined Baycol with gemfibrozil than among people who combined other cholesterol-lowering drugs.
Last week, amid a growing public uproar and numerous class-action suits against Bayer, Germany's health ministry complained that it had never received the report. Rather than criticizing their British counterparts at the Medicines Control Agency, German officials denounced Bayer for its "unacceptable information policies."
"It isn't the job of the M.C.A. to be postman for the European Union," said Ulrich Hagemann, deputy director for pharmaceutical monitoring at Germany's Federal Institute for Medicine and Medical Products, which is the German counterpart to the F.D.A. 
Mr. Diehl of Bayer responded by saying that Bayer had satisfied its reporting obligations.
Mr. Hagemann defended Europe's decentralized system for drug regulation. Drug approvals can essentially be delegated to a single European country, and a drug manufacturer can choose the country in which it will seek approval. In theory, all countries apply the same rules and guidelines for approving products. 
But monitoring safety afterward is more complicated because no country wants to be responsible for collecting data from the entire European Union. As a result, each country has the same obligation to monitor and pass on information about results within its boundaries.
Europe does have a centralized regulatory agency, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products, which licenses drugs produced through genetic engineering. Companies with new drugs produced by conventional technology can seek approval through the agency, which is in London, but Bayer chose to seek approval through what Europeans call the process of mutual recognition.
"We did not intervene because we did not have to intervene," said Noel Walthion, head of the agency's office of post-authorization evaluation. The only pan-European group with a responsibility for discussing such safety issues is a group of experts known as the Pharmacovigilance Working Party. That group met in June, a few days before Bayer turned in its latest and most troubling study. That was when it decided to impose the warnings that had been standard in the United States for two years.
Mr. Diehl of Bayer confirmed that his company decided to withdraw the drug primarily because of reports in the United States. Now European regulators are trying to organize a review of the safety of other cholesterol-lowering drugs, and they are still considering the case of Baycol.

Just months after the Bush administration painted a picture of shortages and called for building a power plant a week for the next 20 years, power prices are falling, industry analysts are warning of a surplus of electricity in parts of the country and some companies are reconsidering their plans to build new plants. 
 The dire long-term forecasts may well prove right. But power generation companies and their investors have their eyes on less distant horizons. The combination, many energy experts say, means that the construction of power plants is likely to run in boom-and-bust cycles, and that consumers -- who increasingly are being charged market prices for power -- will have to get used to electricity bills as volatile as the prices of gasoline, gold or any other commodity. 
 "Power is cyclical now, like oil and natural gas," said Raymond C. Niles, power and natural gas analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "It's going to be moving like a pendulum now between tight supplies and abundant supplies, high prices and low prices." 
Power companies have proposed adding about 350,000 megawatts of generating capacity by 2004, just under a 50 percent increase in the nation's existing power output, said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, an analyst at the Williams Capital Group, an investment bank. But it now appears, he said, that only about 100,000 megawatts of new generation will be built over that period. (A megawatt provides enough power for 800 typical homes.)
Indeed, if all the proposed plants were built, the country would have half again as big a reserve cushion as energy planners consider necessary, said Christian H. Poindexter, chief executive of the Constellation Energy Group, a power company in Baltimore. That prospect, he told stock analysts earlier this month, is helping drive electricity prices down now.
Talk of overcapacity is controversial given the dearth of power plant construction in the United States over the last decade and the near-crisis conditions that loomed in California and New York at the start of the summer. Nonetheless, a number of factors have combined to render some of the power companies' most bullish plans economically unfeasible, analysts said.
For one, the already strained transmission systems in much of the country cannot handle the addition of so many power plants. More than 90 percent of new plants, moreover, are designed to run on natural gas, and experts point out that the country lacks the supplies of gas and the network of pipelines required to fire all the proposed generators. 
The Bush plan calls for extensive investment in the grid and the pipeline system, but both projects face regulatory, political and economic challenges. 
In addition to infrastructure issues, there are signs of overbuilding in a number of regions where power plant construction over the last two years has been prolific, said Jone-Lin Wang, director of North American power at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm. Ms. Wang thinks that by 2003 or so, there could be a surplus of power in New England and Texas; other experts add Ohio, Illinois and Indiana to that list, as well. 
The problem, many experts say, is that many generation companies have their eyes on the price of power and little else. As a result, when power prices fall, generating companies that rushed in with plans to build plants are quick to drop them. 
"Developers have a herd mentality," Ms. Wang said. 
Outright cancellations of projects have not been widespread, but there have been some.
Cogentrix, an independent power producer based in North Carolina, scrapped a 1,100 megawatt plant in West Virginia after the company concluded that prices were unlikely to justify the investment, a spokesman said. That would have included the cost of extending a pipeline from the natural gas network to feed the plant.
One of the country's largest developers of power generation, the Calpine Corporation, has long said it planned to bring 70,000 megawatts of generation on stream by late 2005. But in a conference call with analysts Monday, company officials said for the first time that they were not "locked into" that target. 
In Ohio, state regulators said they had seen a drop in interest in building "peaker" plants, the smaller generators that are turned on for those few hundred hours a year when the need is greatest. Projected power prices for next summer are so low that some generators do not expect to collect enough to make a profit on such plants.
In the Northwest, generators blame federal price caps for the cancellation of 500 to 750 megawatts of new generation. But analysts said the broader economics of the region's power market made the proposed plants unprofitable. 
"There are some power plants being delayed or canceled due to economic conditions, not federal caps," said Barry Abramson, senior power analyst at UBS Warburg. "Projecting ahead, the companies are seeing increased supply in the area and lower demand than they thought."
Nationally, only about three-fourths of the new generating capacity that was expected to become available this summer has come on line, according to RDI Consulting in Boulder, Colo., which advises energy companies. "We expected 46,000 megawatts of new generation this summer and got 35,000," said Christopher Seiple, RDI's managing director. 
Under the old regulated system, state officials and utilities projected growth in electricity demand and the number of new power plants needed. Regulators set rates that allowed the utilities to recoup the cost of construction and a return on their investment. But that process also spawned cost overruns and overbuilding.
Now, with half the country in some stage of deregulation, many utilities no longer own plants or build them. Instead, new power generation companies, called merchant generators, have stepped into the breach. But they must make complex judgments about how and where they can collect a return on their investment, and analysts say the young industry has not perfected that art.
"We would like to see more educated developers who don't just look at price, that they have a better understanding of the demand growth pattern in a region and who else is building what," said Ms. Wang of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
A senior Bush administration official acknowledged that considerable new generating capacity was coming on line without government action, but said the investment was patchy. White House policy initiatives, he added, are focused on improving the electric grid and pipeline network.
Regulators, meanwhile, are reluctant to call all the activity overbuilding, perhaps for fear of driving away new projects. And so far, much of the new power has been used. During the heat wave in New England two weeks ago, for example, the 3,000 megawatts of new generation added over the last two years proved critical to avoiding widespread interruptions, said a spokeswoman for the New England Independent System Operator, which runs the region's transmission grid. 
Power generators and many Wall Street analysts also said wide swaths of the country -- most notably California and New York -- were far from having a surplus of capacity, and had narrow reserve margins against blackouts. Moreover, they said, many of the new plants would replace older, dirtier, less efficient ones currently in use.
Still, with power prices falling, some analysts say regulators will have the rare chance to figure out how to create market conditions that smooth the boom-and-bust cycle.
"Lower prices for now will give us the breathing room to deal with the issue of how to handle price spikes on the policy level," said Mr. Seiple, the Colorado consultant. "The danger is that people will forget that price spikes ever occurred -- until they occur again."

HEADLINE: Retailers Split Over Setting Sights on Tax Rebates 

BYLINE:  By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
For taxpayers at loose ends over how to spend their rebates, Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouses has helpfully compiled a list of projects that cost from $300 to $600. Among the suggestions: put up a flagpole or build a playhouse.
 Not to be outdone, Home Depot is recommending that customers invest in energy-saving improvements like insulation and is offering interest-free financing to encourage people to spend their rebates before the checks arrive. 
 With billions of dollars in rebates on their way, these and other big retailers, including Wal-Mart and Travelocity, have made the miniwindfalls a central theme of their marketing plans. For many, it is a chance to extend a peak selling season that is now coming to a close. 
But many companies that usually have a strong back-to-school business, including J. C. Penney, Best Buy and Target, have remained largely silent on the tax rebate. These retailers and others are not convinced that people will spend their rebates and are sticking with traditional end-of-summer pitches to draw shoppers.
"I was a little surprised," said Scott Krugman, spokesman for the National Retail Federation. "There were a few clever promotions, and I was wondering if there would be more, but it really wasn't the case. People have been focusing on the product, not the gimmick."
The Treasury Department began sending checks of as much as $300 to individuals and $600 to families on July 20. So far it has mailed 40.7 million checks worth a total of $17.2 billion, and by the end of September, it will return $38 billion to taxpayers.
The rebates are the first part of a 10-year tax cut package that President Bush promoted to stimulate the economy. The first hard numbers with which to judge the economic impact of the rebate will not be available until next month, when retailers report August sales. Some surveys suggest retail sales at the end of July were strong, but the Redbook Retail Sales Average, a survey of retail sales, for the first two weeks of August disappointed some retail analysts, rising only 0.2 percent from July.
A telephone survey by the University of Michigan found that about 18 percent of people expect to spend their rebates, while a Gallup poll put the figure at 25 percent. But many economists note that what people say they will do and what they actually do are often two different things. Some economists predict Americans will spend as much as $20 billion of the rebate. That would add two-tenths of a percentage point to the nation's economic growth this year.
"People are funny when they say they are not going to spend the money," said Stuart Hoffman, the chief economist for PNC Financial Services. "Who are we kidding?"
Some retailers agree. Home Depot began a tax rebate ad campaign after a survey it commissioned found that about 9 percent of the people questioned said they planned to spend their rebates on home improvements, said Don Harrison, a company spokesman. When prompted, another 24 percent said they would consider spending the check to fix up their houses.
Online travel agencies have also tied marketing to the rebate. "What Uncle Sam giveth, useth to go away," says an ad from Travelocity.
Expedia, another online travel agency, has a page on its site highlighting "The Great Tax Rebate Vacation." Most of the options are long weekend getaways, and Expedia managers hope consumers will use their rebates and leftover vacation days for a last-minute trip.
"Some research we looked at showed people were excited to get their checks,' said Christina Kozloff, a product manager at Expedia. "People are looking to spend them and spend them on themselves."
Discount retailers appear divided. Target has kept all mention of tax rebates out of its ads and out of its stores, while Kmart is offering customers a 5 percent bonus if they use their checks to buy a gift card.
Wal-Mart has not offered any discounts but has told customers they can cash their checks at the store. The first customers to do so ended up spending about 25 percent of the rebate at the store, Wal-Mart said. The most popular items they bought were electronics, cameras, prepaid cell phones and air-conditioners
Not everyone is trying to persuade Americans to spend the rebate. The Vanguard Group and the Fidelity Investments unit of FMR have encouraged their clients in newsletters and e-mails to invest the rebate. Robert Corcoran, a vice president for retirement product development at Fidelity, said a number of customers had visited its retail centers with rebate checks in hand.
Many retailers that opted against promotions or advertisements based on the rebates said they doubted such an appeal would bring extra customers into their stores.
Back-to-school is a strong selling season for electronics merchants like Circuit City and Best Buy, so neither chain has done any tax-rebate related promotions. Laurie Bauer, a spokeswoman for Best Buy, which is based in Minneapolis, said that when people in Minnesota got state tax rebates last year and in 1999 it had little effect on sales there. Based on that experience, Best Buy decided to pass on any advertising related the federal rebate, she said.
Clothing retailers have also decided to pass up mention of the tax rebate in advertisements. J. C. Penney said it would increase advertising spending $80 million in the second half of the year but would not refer to the rebate checks.
"We've continued with our regular scheduled programming," said Tim Lyons, a Penney spokeman.
Macy's, a unit of Federated Department Stores, is not doing any tax rebate promotions. Nor are stores owned by Gap or Limited. Sears has added references to the tax rebate on some ads but does not expect the rebates to give sales much of a boost.
One of the first companies to make a rebate-inspired appeal was perhaps one of the last places people would think to spend the bulk of their rebates. On July 9, Pizza Hut, a unit of Tricon Global Restaurants, began a TV ad for its twisted crust pizza that said: "Almost as good as a refund, but tastes a whole lot better."
Sean Gleason, the vice president for advertising, said the promotion appeared to work because people had been calling to ask for the tax-refund special. "It's kind of funny," he said. "We are offering a $9.99 pizza when people are getting $300."

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing Slow Start For Amtrak Train 

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 A fast train that is critical to the future of Amtrak is off to a slow start. 
In service eight months, the Acela Express between Washington and Boston is falling short of projections in riders and revenue. And a nonstop Washington-to-New York service -- Amtrak's silver bullet in its race with air shuttles -- has been suspended because of low ridership. Amtrak officials say they have had to deal with various challenges, including the slowing economy and aging electrical wiring. "We concede that ridership fell below our forecast by about 6 percent, and revenues by about 3 percent," said Cecilia Cummings, an Amtrak spokeswoman. "But when you look at the drop in business travel in general, we're claiming victory."

HEADLINE: New Heights for Andean Wine 

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: MENDOZA, Argentina 

 BODY:
THE awesome crags of the Andes glitter like icebergs in the early morning sunlight as the plane lets down here in western Argentina, across the grassy Pampas from Buenos Aires.
 Runoff from the melting Andes snows, diverted into canals built by the Tehuelche Indians as early as the 16th century and improved by the Incas and the Spanish, makes Mendoza bloom. Although located at the edge of the Cuyo desert, this is a city of plane trees and sycamores, shady parks and broad plazas, fountains and rose gardens. 
 That same water nourishes the vineyards surrounding the city. Mendoza wines have helped to make Argentina the world's fifth-largest producer, a reliable source of inexpensive red for the country's thirsty population, much of which traces its origins to Italy. But until recently they have never counted for much in world markets. 
Dr. Nicolas Catena is changing things; not single-handedly, exactly, any more than Michael Jordan single-handedly won pro basketball championships for the Chicago Bulls. But he has shown customers in North America, as well as friendly rivals here, what Mendoza can do at every price level. At 61, slight, soft-spoken and studious-looking in rimless glasses, he is the acknowledged star, the pacemaker, the public face of the Argentine wine industry.
It is an industry in rapid ascendancy. More first-class wines appear with each vintage, and critics and consumers around the world have taken notice. On the shelves of shops in the United States, labels like Balbi, Flichman, Norton, Santa Ana and Terrazas have won space, along with Catena, of course.
Despite the country's debilitating economic troubles recently, foreign millions continue to pour in to finance new vineyards and wineries.
Beginning with Dr. Catena's grandfather in 1902, the Catena family established a local reputation for red wines. These wines, made largely from the criolla grape, were too sweet and too often oxidized.
"We never imagined," Dr. Catena said, that "anyone here could compete with the Europeans -- perhaps 10 percent as good, no more."
Dr. Catena's great awakening came when he went to the United States. Already armed with a Ph.D., he studied economics and mathematics at Columbia University during the turbulent late 1960's and then, in 1982, found himself at Berkeley as a visiting professor. Inevitably, he visited the Napa Valley. Almost as inevitably, he fell under the spell of Robert Mondavi, whose winery was at that time helping to establish lofty new standards for American wines.
"I discovered what investment, research and enthusiasm could achieve," Dr. Catena told me and my wife, Betsey, over a candle-lit dinner under the maple trees at 1884, the restaurant that he has set up in his century-old Bodega Escorihuela. "I saw that the Americans had done in 10 years what the Europeans took over 300 years to do.
"I decided that I had to do something similar. I thought we needed to make cabernet and chardonnay, even though we didn't use those grapes much in Argentina at the time. They were the best, obviously, and I wanted them."
After a time, Dr. Catena got to know the peripatetic Mr. Mondavi, and they discovered that their families had come from the same part of Italy -- the Marche, on the Adriatic coast.
TOP Catena cabernets and chardonnays have been exported to the United States for a decade now, and they have received enthusiastic notices from the world's wine critics -- easily the equal of the reviews accorded to the much better-known vintages of Argentina's neighbor to the west, Chile.
Unlike some Chilean producers, Dr. Catena has been careful not to price himself out of the North American market. The number of wine drinkers in New York or Los Angeles willing to pay $50 a bottle and more for his top-of-the-line Zapata reds may be limited, but for those who are not, there are Catena wines at more modest prices, sold under Catena Alta, Catena and Alamos Ridge labels.
"In the end," said my English friend Bill Baker, one of his country's most respected wine merchants, "Argentine wines will be better and better priced than their Chilean competitors."
I tasted Catena Alta cabernets, merlots and malbecs from 1997 and 1999 with Dr. Catena, and they were only slightly less aristocratic than their Zapata counterparts, which had not yet been released. They had just as much fruit, just as much robustness of flavor, perhaps a little less opulence and complexity. The Alamos Ridge wines, tasted in the United States, made a less vivid impression, of course, but they struck me as good values at around $10 a bottle.
The Argentine wines that interest me most are the ones made almost nowhere else, including the chunky, chewy, spicy malbec among the reds and the tangy torrontes among the whites.
Malbec, which is also called Auxerrois by the French, was once an important grape in Bordeaux, used extensively in the days before the great phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century in wines like Chateau Latour. Now it is used only in Cahors in southwestern France, where it traditionally produced heavy, intensely tannic wines, almost black in color, which were often not ready to drink until they had spent two decades in the bottle. Modern Cahors is a bit gentler.
Argentine malbec is different. The deep violet glints in the glass are similar, as are the jammy flavors of ripe berries. But where the tannins in Cahors can be quite harsh, those in the best Argentine malbecs are sweet and silky, and the wines give no impression of heaviness at all despite their power. They make perfect companions to Argentina's great beef or to our own.
In 1960, Argentina had 120,000 acres of malbec, but then came the stampede to "international" grape varieties like cabernet. Now there are only 25,000 acres left, but the best of those vines, including several owned by Catena and by the Austrian-controlled Bodegas Norton, are 70 to 100 years old. At the moment, Pedro Marchevsky, the Catena vineyard manager, is conducting experiments with 135 malbec clones in the company's Tikal vineyard. 
The torrontes vineyards are some of the world's highest, many more than a mile up, near the village of Cafayate in the northwestern corner of the country, not far from the Bolivian border. No movie theater or bright lights there, "just work," laughed Susana Balbo, a highly regarded Argentine winemaker who toiled for a time in Cafayate. Two of the best examples are made by Etchart and Michel Torino, both reminiscent of albarino and viognier in their jasmine-scented bouquets and fresh tropical-fruit flavors (mango? pineapple?).
Another, only slightly less appealing torrontes, easier to find in the United States and irresistibly priced at about $7, is made by Santa Julia.
AT the moment, the light of Dr. Catena's life is a striking new winery near here, built of cream-colored local stone and pale, indigenous hardwoods in the shape of a Mayan pyramid. It opened earlier this year. His daughter Laura Catena, the company's export director, a Harvard- and Stanford-educated physician who somehow combines the practice of medicine in San Francisco with her work in the wine trade in Argentina, commented recently that the $12 million building "shows our pride in our own culture."
So does 1884, the Catena restaurant. The family recruited Argentina's premier chef, Francis Mallmann, to create a menu that celebrates the Incan influence in the region, with dishes incorporating corn and pumpkin, as well as the beef of the Pampas -- not to mention, of course, the wines of Mendoza.
Much of the cooking is done in the courtyard in traditional igloo-shaped mud ovens, or hornos. We sampled bitter, palate-cleansing chicory, seared at 600 degrees, with almonds and sun-dried tomatoes; empanadas made the old-fashioned way with hand-chopped instead of ground beef; a tart of onions and leeks, and magnificently juicy goat, scented with lemon and oregano, roasted in an iron box -- all the while talking politics, monetary policy, Machiavelli and wine prices with Nicolas Catena.
On the latter subject, he said, "I have known from the start that if I charged $40 a bottle, the wine had to be comparable with a French wine selling for $60 or $80, because people are not used to costly wines from here." And he acknowledged that like Mr. Mondavi and his Italian friend Piero Antinori, he makes far more money on his cheaper wines than on his prestige products.
But he pours his passion into the top of the line. He has raised the quality bar in Argentina by limiting production through the pioneering use of controlled irrigation and by rigorous thinning of his grapes. He has planted vineyards at altitudes as high as 4,900 feet, which provide the cooler temperatures and lower humidity that help to produce premium grapes. He has imported French barrels and computerized European winemaking gear, installing them in immaculate wineries that contrast starkly with the unhygienic facilities and poor barrels that plagued wine production in Argentina for decades. 
Others have joined him here in the pursuit of modern excellence. Hiram Walker, Moet & Chandon, Pernod Ricard, Kendall-Jackson, Allied Domecq, Sogrape of Portugal and several Chilean companies have made huge investments. Exports have grown to about $140 million from $40 million in the last five years.
Norton, which was founded in 1895 by a British engineer who had worked on the railway across the Andes, now belongs to the family that controls Swarovski crystal. Carlos Tizio Mayer, the technical manager, described its strategy: to keep prices down -- no more than $15 for the top blend, marketed as Norton Privada -- "so we can earn a little money and a lot of customer loyalty."
"It's easy to produce very expensive wine here, but it's not so easy to produce good value," he told us as we toured the winery, which is surrounded by spectacular rose gardens. "We want to make our name and attract our customers now, because in the next few years only three or four Argentine names will loom large in the international market, and we intend to be one of them."
I was taken with Norton's 2000 sauvignon blanc, a crisp yet fruity wine with just the right sharpness, but there, too, it was the malbec that turned my head. The 1999 exhibited had a nose like a magnet that drew you right into the glass, and a typical big-shouldered, almost rowdy style on the palate.
Never contaminated by phylloxera, the Argentine malbec, as Mr. Tizio said, "is a natural treasure in its genetic purity." It can make great wine.

HEADLINE: France and Germany Jointly Seek a Ban on Cloning Humans 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
The French and German governments have come together in a request to the United Nations to approve a measure seeking a worldwide ban on human cloning for reproductive purposes.
 In a joint statement, the two nations have called on Secretary General Kofi Annan to present their proposal to the General Assembly, which meets in September. They urge the creation of a working group to draft a convention that would ban reproductive cloning as an offense "to human dignity." 
 The two countries say they hope and expect that their proposal, made early this month, will get backing from the Bush administration. While Mr. Bush has said his administration would allow limited stem cell research, he has expressed strong opposition to human cloning. 
The French and Germans hope that an anticloning convention would be one international treaty that President Bush would choose to support, after he infuriated much of the Continent by pulling back from treaties about global warming, missile defense and biological warfare.
A recent opinion poll of Europeans by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press and The International Herald Tribune found unhappiness with Mr. Bush strongest in France and Germany. Solid majorities of those polled in both countries -- 65 percent in Germany and 59 percent in France -- said they disapproved of his handling of foreign policy.
While the two countries agree on cloning, they differ in their laws about cloning stem cells for research.
The French have been most outspoken in condemning human cloning, with Health Minister Bernard Kouchner telling Le Monde that "we have to ban the photocopying of human beings right now" and that it is "simply morally unacceptable to create life while hijacking its very meaning."
But the French have only now drafted legislation that will specifically ban human cloning for reproduction, while the Germans banned cloning -- and anything that smelled of Nazi-era euthanasia and eugenics -- more than 10 years ago.
The joint French-German proposal is as important for its diplomatic impact as its scientific one, officials from both countries said in interviews. After conflicts that arose over voting rights for nations of various sizes in an expanded European Union at a summit meeting in Nice last December, France and Germany moved quickly to increase and emphasize their cooperation.
The French in particular have wanted to keep the Germans from playing too independent a role in Europe, or from drawing closer to Britain or the new candidate countries in Central Europe at the expense of France.
Foreign Ministers Joschka Fischer of Germany and Hubert Vedrine of France met in Paris on June 21 and laid the ground for renewed comity and cooperation.
"A French-German initiative like this is a first," said Bernard Valero, the deputy spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry, describing the joint proposal on cloning. "After Nice, we decided at the highest level to increase and develop Franco-German cooperation on many issues, from the Middle East and mad cow disease to Macedonia, immigration and cloning."
A German Foreign Ministry official agreed, saying: "From the European perspective, cloning is a worthwhile issue on which it's safe to find common ground, both with the French and the Americans. It's a Franco-German initiative and a worthwhile goal."
With an informal European Union mandate, Mr. Fischer is currently in the Middle East, where he has been working to bring together Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister. Today there were announcements that they were prepared to meet soon on how to put a cease-fire into effect. 
Mr. Valero pointed out that Mr. Fischer will be in Paris again next week to have further meetings with Mr. Vedrine about the Mideast, Macedonia and other issues.
On the cloning issue, the German legislation, passed in 1990, bans all genetic research on embryos. There has been a debate about a potential loophole that might allow scientists to import stem cells grown elsewhere, but experimentation on such cells is forbidden in any case. In vitro fertilization is allowed, but only to aid conception; embryos not used are frozen for later use or discarded, and even testing of embryos before they are used to check for genetic flaws is forbidden.
In France, the draft legislation, expected to be voted on next year, will revise 1994 laws on bioethics. If passed as written, the law would explicitly ban human cloning for reproduction for the first time, but it would permit therapeutic cloning and also allow -- and control -- scientific research on in vitro embryos and stem cells. Any embryos used in research must be formally deemed to be no longer intended to produce a child.
The law would require the couple who originated the embryo to consent explicitly to its use for scientific research and would also create a new commission to provide advice, guidance and control. 
In Germany, there was a small furor at the end of May when Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, a pragmatic Social Democrat, spoke of the need for the nation to remain modern and to create jobs. Gene technology, he argued, produces new drugs, more jobs and new opportunities, and he argued for the possibility of scientific research on in vitro embryos. He also suggested that testing the embryos before they are used could prevent the birth of sick or deformed children.
President Johannes Rau, however, although also a Social Democrat, argued vehemently against such research. "Eugenics, euthanasia and selection are labels that are linked to bad memories in Germany," he said. "Where human dignity is affected, economic arguments do not count."
Mr. Schroder has set up -- and handpicked -- a commission of 24 scientists, philosophers, clergymen and other experts to guide the debate over bioethics.
What is driving the ethical and political debate in Europe is simply the advance of science, the German ministry official said. "In the last half year, suddenly cloning and sophisticated biomedical research on embryos has become scientifically possible and affordable," he said. Everyone is struggling with the ethics of this new world, he suggested, but especially the Germans, with their particular burden of the Nazi past.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Distracted, Wall St. Ignores Signs of an Economic Bottom

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Falling unemployment claims. Rising housing starts. Declining inventories. An end to the slide in industrial production. Over the last month, signs of an economic bottom have appeared.
 Wall Street, though, is too busy mourning the demise of the technology bubble and pounding on the Federal Reserve to notice. 
 Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has cut short-term interest rates seven times in an effort to stimulate the economy. Lower rates reduce the cost of corporate and consumer borrowing, giving companies and individuals more money to spend.
But with the economy still weak eight months after the Fed's first rate cut, investors are now complaining that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is "pushing on a string." The Fed can cut rates, but it cannot force companies to buy new equipment or consumers to spend more, the pessimists point out. And lower rates have failed to revive technology companies like Lucent Technologies and Hewlett-Packard, which have laid off thousands of workers this year in the face of weak sales.
Yesterday, the Federal Reserve cut short-term rates by a quarter-point, to 3.5 percent, their lowest level since April 1994, and investors again turned up their noses at Mr. Greenspan. After rising slightly early in the day, stocks fell sharply after the Fed's announcement at 2:15 p.m. The Nasdaq composite index finished the day down 2.7 percent, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.2 percent. For the year, the Nasdaq is now down almost 26 percent, while the S.& P. 500 has dropped more than 12 percent.
"The market's saying the Fed's behind the curve -- it should be easing faster," said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers.
During the latest round of rate cuts, stocks have risen strongly only on the two times that the Fed acted outside its regularly scheduled meetings.
Wall Street's biggest concern is corporate profits, which are weak across the board and dismal at technology companies. Operating profits for the S.& P. 500 plunged more than 17 percent in the second quarter and are expected to fall more than 8 percent for the year, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
Investors are concerned that companies outside the technology sector could begin widespread layoffs if profits remain weak, hurting consumer confidence and causing consumer spending to drop. A fall in consumer spending would further damage corporate profits, potentially causing more layoffs and sending the economy into a deep recession. At its worst, a protracted downturn could cause tax collections to fall so much that the federal government's budget surplus would disappear, putting upward pressure on interest rates and further hampering the economy.
The prospect is frightening, but there is little evidence that course of events is actually happening.
August has brought a raft of better-than-expected economic news. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that housing starts increased 2.8 percent in July, reaching their highest levels since February 2000. The Conference Board reported that the index of leading economic indicators was up 0.4 percent in July, its fourth consecutive monthly increase. Also this month, the Labor Department reported that the July unemployment rate, which economists had expected to rise to 4.7 percent, instead remained flat at 4.5 percent.
Long-term interest rates, meanwhile, which reached almost 7 percent at the beginning of 2000, fell yesterday to 4.9 percent, just above the lows they reached in March. Short-term rates have dropped even faster.
Everything that is supposed to happen when the Fed cuts interest rates is happening, although not as quickly or as vigorously as Mr. Greenspan -- or Wall Street -- would like.
"We think that things are starting to bottom out, and perhaps even in the second quarter did bottom out," said Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist at A. G. Edwards, a regional brokerage firm in St. Louis.
"We're just now in the midst of the six- to nine-month period it takes to see the results of incremental rate cuts," Mr. Freeman said. "Those later cuts, along with the tax rebates and lower energy prices, will help stimulate the economy."
Mr. Freeman contends that Wall Street has missed the economy's turn because investors are focusing on technology companies, just as they did during the boom in 1999, instead of looking at the overall economy. And the technology sector remains far and away the weakest segment of the economy.
Still, Wall Street's bears are not exactly convinced. "It's clear that the worst of the deterioration is over," said Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. But Mr. Roach says it will take at least until mid-2002 for a strong recovery to occur.
"The risk is that even though the economy attempts to form a bottom, it could bounce along this bottom for a long time," he said. "There's nothing but upside risk to jobless claims and national unemployment."
But even Mr. Applegate, who thinks the Fed should do more to cut rates, said investors would be unwise to underestimate Mr. Greenspan's power. "A central bank ease is a pretty powerful phenomenon," he said.

HEADLINE: Argentina Gets $8 Billion Aid From the I.M.F. 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
After nearly two weeks of negotiations, the International Monetary Fund announced tonight that it would provide up to $8 billion in emergency aid to Argentina to stabilize its economy.
 The agreement came after protracted talks between Argentina and the Bush administration, which had sought to use Argentina's financial crisis to demonstrate a new, skeptical approach to financial bailouts that breaks with what administration officials view as an overly accommodating stance by the Clinton administration. 
 The package provides incentives for Argentina to reach agreement with creditors to restructure part of its $128 billion foreign debt. 
Under the plan, Argentina would get $5 billion in loans as early as September, but the other $3 billion would be delayed unless the country reschedules its debt payments. The fund, which typically makes loans to help ensure troubled nations that they can pay their debts and defend their currencies, has not previously made such rescheduling an integral part of a rescue package. 
The plan could put pressure on American banks and other lenders to take losses on bonds and loans to Argentina, though fund officials say that any restructuring under their three-year plan depends on voluntary cooperation by all parties, and that it is not an absolute condition of the loans. Thus the plan offers a carrot but no stick. 
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill has used Argentina's case as a way to demonstrate that the administration will back bailouts only when a nation takes painful steps to grapple with its financial woes before seeking emergency help -- and then only when there is a high probability that the aid can sustain the recipient through tough times.
But by supporting the Argentina rescue, the administration has departed from its own expressed reluctance to allow repeated bailouts. 
Argentina received $13.7 billion in I.M.F. aid eight months ago, at the end of the Clinton administration, and Bush administration officials had suggested that they were not willing to make any new loans.
That position proved difficult to maintain as economic malaise spread round Latin America. Mexico has officially fallen into recession. Brazil's economy has slowed to a standstill, and its weakening currency and rising debt forced it to seek new loans from the fund last month.
Argentina's problems are more serious. Its economy has been shrinking for three years. Its debt burden, though not enormous relative to its overall economy, has become unsustainable as exports slump. Residents, fearing a financial collapse, are moving assets out of the country at an increasing rate; investors have shifted $9 billion out since Argentina's latest round of difficulties began in June.
President Bush has made improving political ties to Latin America a centerpiece of his foreign policy and has said he wants to extend the North American Free Trade Agreement to form a hemispheric free-trade zone. 
Those goals are threatened, at least temporarily, by economic weakness across the region.
Even so, Mr. O'Neill and other Treasury officials took a tough line with Argentina when it sent a delegation to Washington earlier this month seeking an infusion of aid. Treasury officials initially declined to commit to any new aid, those involved in the talks said.
It is not unusual for the United States, the largest single shareholder in the fund, to play an important role in shaping an emergency aid package to a large developing country. 
But several people involved in the talks said the administration's role was especially intricate in this case, with many late-night sessions held in Treasury offices rather than at I.M.F. headquarters nearby.
Bush administration officials pressed a team led by Daniel Marx, Argentina's finance secretary, to come up with ways of reorganizing Argentina's finances and debt payments so that it could survive without fresh loans. 
If there were to be new loans, they wanted Argentina to demonstrate that the money would be instrumental in sustaining the nation even beyond the usual terms of three years, those involved in the talks said.
The effort to revise the fund's approach to Argentina in the middle of a crisis led to some tension between officials of the I.M.F and the Treasury. Mr. O'Neill also ruffled some diplomatic feathers with his frank comments about his reluctance to support new loans. 
"We're working to find a way to create a sustainable Argentina, not just one that continues to consume the money of the plumbers and carpenters in the United States who make $50,000 a year and wonder what in the world we're doing with their money," Mr. O'Neill told CNN late last week.
La Nacion, a leading Buenos Aires newspaper, wrote in an editorial on Monday that Mr. O'Neill's comments were "outside all norms of respect and protocol." Stock prices plummeted and interest rates soared this week on speculation that Washington would not back new aid.
Treasury officials declined to comment tonight on the negotiations.
Some outside analysts are sympathetic to the administration's tough-love approach, in large part because they view Argentina's problems as intractable. Not only does it have a debt burden that threatens to overwhelm its ability to pay interest, beginning later this year; it also has a rigid currency system that fixes its peso to the dollar. Some economists say the system has undercut the competitiveness of its companies.
"I think it's a real long shot that new aid would be of use without restructuring the debt and devaluing the currency," said Morris Goldstein, a former I.M.F. official who is now at the Institute for International Economics, a research organization in Washington. "You have to do one or the other, and maybe both."
Administration officials have backed Argentina's desire to keep its currency system in place. But they focused on debt restructuring as the price of American support for new loans.
The new plan takes a step in that direction, though it seems unlikely to result in a wholesale debt reorganization -- akin to a bankruptcy proceeding -- that some economists feel is needed.
Given the sensitivity of the I.M.F. in recommending a debt reorganization that could result in losses for foreign investors, the wording of tonight's announcement was cautious.
Argentina is "considering the possibility of a voluntary and market-based operation to increase the viability of Argentina's debt profile," Horst Kohler, the managing director, said in a statement. "As these discussions bear fruit, I.M.F. management would be prepared to recommend bringing forward the remaining $3 billion under this augmentation to support such an operation."
Other elements of the new aid package are more traditional. The fund, as it often has in the past, is requiring Argentina to tighten its fiscal belt, reducing both central and provincial government spending to meet the goal of a "zero deficit" law approved by the Argentine Congress on July 29.
Other conditions include improving tax collection and strengthening the banking system, Mr. Kohler said.

HEADLINE: THE FINE PRINT: A Wilderness Gift; 
Alaska Land Transfer Puts Senator on Spot

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, wants to give 1,505 acres of prime Alaska wilderness -- owned by the federal government and worth millions of dollars -- to a small restoration group headed by a longtime friend. Mr. Stevens tucked a one-sentence measure to do just that into the fine print of the $60 billion transportation appropriations bill, which the Senate passed earlier this month.
 The 2.3-square-mile property includes the picturesque northern promontory point of Admiralty Island, near Juneau. Its old lighthouse at Point Retreat is a landmark on the route from Juneau to Glacier Bay. 
 All of Point Retreat, which is owned by the United States Coast Guard and managed by the United States Forest Service, is within the boundaries of the Tongass National Forest.
Section 357 of the transportation bill includes this amendment from Mr. Stevens: "Point Retreat Light Station, including all property under lease as of June 1, 2000, is transferred to the Alaska Lighthouse Association."
The senator declined to comment on the amendment, but said through his spokeswoman, Melanie Alvord, that he was "supportive of what the Alaska Lighthouse Association was trying to do, which is to maintain the lighthouse in the manner in which other lighthouses around the country have been preserved."
Still, the move has outraged environmental and outdoor sporting groups, who call it a giveaway of public land that exposes it to an uncertain future. The new owner's intention to preserve the land could yield to economic pressures as more tourists visit the area, the critics say, since the measure contained no restrictions on how the property could be used.
They also question why the association needs more than the 10 acres immediately surrounding the lighthouse. The transfer is also opposed by the Native Alaskans in Angoon, the only village on Admiralty Island.
Ms. Alvord said she could not explain why Mr. Stevens wanted to give more than 1,500 acres instead of the 10 that the federal government had earlier recommended, and referred other questions to David Benton, the association's president.
Mr. Benton, a former deputy commissioner of the state Department of Fish and Game and now chairman of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, said in a telephone interview: "The Forest Service is not necessarily a good neighbor. They have cut some trees down and marked up the land. We think we can do as good a job as the Forest Service in being a steward to that land."
He said he wanted to restore the lighthouse and create a maritime museum and small bed-and-breakfast inn, but had no plans to develop the property further. He also said he was discussing giving all but 10 acres to the Southeast Alaska Land Trust for protection.
Mr. Benton said that hikers and hunters could continue to use the property. "We have no intention of restricting public access," he said.
"I've known Senator Stevens a long time," Mr. Benton added. "He really just likes this project. His wife knows folks involved in lighthouse restoration."
Carl Rosier, president of the Alaska Outdoor Council, an affiliate of the National Rifle Association, and a former state commissioner of fish and game, said, "It's really a major giveaway of a public land, and it's totally unreasonable to give what we consider to be several million dollars' worth of land to the control of a nonprofit."
Nathaniel Lawrence, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, "What's really egregious is the giveaway for any purpose of a significant chunk of the public-land estate in a particularly sensitive and literally world-famous locale."
Mr. Rosier said Mr. Stevens had a history of "handing out a lot of favors along the way and does a lot of good things, but he's really gone awry on this one." He said he believed that the senator was "mad at the Forest Service," not an uncommon sentiment in Alaska, where the vastness of the public lands is exceeded only by anger at federal bureaucrats who tell Alaskans what they can do on it.
"The senator had a problem with the Forest Service, primarily because of decisions on roadless areas in Alaska," Mr. Rosier said.
Mr. Stevens tried to give the land to the lighthouse association last year, but at the urging of the Forest Service, the Clinton administration informally threatened to veto the bill if that amendment were adopted, and it was dropped. Now that it has passed the Senate this year, the bill must be reconciled in conference with the House next month.
Correspondence relating to the long tangled history of the ownership of this property -- it was withdrawn from the public domain by executive order in 1901 -- includes a statement from the Coast Guard last year saying that "it appears that 10 acres is sufficient for the light station parcel and this is what we plan to convey to the Alaska Lighthouse Association."
The amendment contains no restrictions against commercial development or the sale of the property. Ms. Alvord, the spokeswoman for the senator, said such restrictions were not necessary because the transfer was bound by a 1998 law that allowed the conveyance of 11 lighthouses, including Point Retreat, to nonprofit groups around the country.
Of the 11 lighthouses, four are in Alaska. They come with significantly less acreage than Point Retreat. The 1998 law says that any of the lighthouses would revert to the federal government if they ceased "to be used as a nonprofit center for public benefit for the interpretation and preservation of maritime history."
But the critics say it is highly unusual for an amendment not to contain references to other laws that govern it, and they noted that the 1998 provisions could be superseded by other measures.
Buck Lindekugel, staff attorney and conservation director for the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, said Mr. Stevens's amendment and the 1998 law "are significantly different in terms of their effect." That law says the Coast Guard "may convey" lighthouses to nonprofit groups, imposing restrictions on the voluntary transfer of property, while the Stevens amendment mandates the transfer.

HEADLINE: THE MAYORAL CAMPAIGN; 
Excerpts From the Hourlong Debate of the Democratic Candidates for Mayor

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from yesterday's New York 1/New York Times debate of the Democratic candidates for mayor, as recorded by The New York Times:

ANDREW KIRTZMAN: Good evening and welcome to the NY1/New York Times Democratic mayoral debate. I'm Andrew Kirtzman, and this is my colleague, Joyce Purnick of The New York Times. We are coming to you from the studios of CUNY-TV in Midtown Manhattan. . . .
 So my first question goes to all the candidates. Maybe we'll start from my left this time.
A recent New York Times poll shows that New Yorkers now hold a more optimistic view of their city and its future than in any time in nearly a quarter of a century. You all like some of the things that Mayor Giuliani has done and dislike some of the things that Giuliani has done, but clearly a lot of New Yorkers like a lot of the things that Rudy Giuliani has done as mayor. Look into the camera and tell New Yorkers exactly what aspects of the city you will guarantee will stay the same or get better for the next four years.

PETER F. VALLONE: Since I've had the privilege of working with Mayor Rudy Giuliani and his predecessors, Mayor David Dinkins and Mayor Edward Koch, I worked alongside the three of them and it took not just one person, but it took a lot of work to get the city where it is today, and I like to think that I had something to do with it. No mayor can do this alone. The mayor has to work very closely with the City Council, arrive at a consensus, and I think we did that. Not only have we adopted 12 on-time balanced consecutive budgets, and not only have we made this city a much safer city, but we also built up a surplus of over a billion dollars for this city to go into the next century, and I think that that's something we should be proud of, without raising a solitary single tax.

KIRTZMAN: So what aspects of city life will you guarantee the voters of New York will either stay the same or get better while you're mayor over the next four years?

VALLONE: There's no possible way that I would ever let the city become unsafe again since I'm the one that created the Safe Streets, Safe City program, which is responsible for the 10,000 cops that we had. What Mayor Giuliani did with those 10,000 cops is to come up with a Compstat system, which gets the kind of accountability for the police officers to make this not only the safest city in town, but to set an example.

KIRTZMAN: Mark Green.

VALLONE: It's the kind of things we should be doing for the other agencies.

MARK GREEN: I guarantee that every service will either be as good or better. Why else would I be running? I promise you no through no effort of mine will any service get worse. There are four areas that count. First, a chief executive in New York City, any city, is held up to the standards of is crime down and lower, and are test scores high and higher. And so I'll do everything feasible not only just to keep the good news on crime, but continue the good news on crime by more creative strategies on community policing and swifter, surer discipline. So crime goes down with misconduct.
Second, how do you get test scores up? The Board of Ed. is broken. I want to change it by assuming more mayoral control and focusing on smaller class sizes, the instant that kids are biologically ready to learn or not, K to 3.
The other two, Andrew, are we have to build more housing, not more stadiums. Unless we have more housing, my daughter won't be able to leave home ever and companies won't move here because their employees can't afford to live here. None of this can happen without going beyond Rudy Giuliani. And racially and by borough uniting a city that's been all too divided under him.

KIRTZMAN: Guaranteeing that all the city services are going to be better when you finish your mayoralty is a tall order.

GREEN: I didn't say that. I said I guarantee that all will be as good or better.

KIRTZMAN: Are you willing to guarantee that if they're not as good or better that you won't run for re-election?

GREEN: Of course not, that's up to the voters to decide. Joe Namath predicted victory when it was brash. He won in '68 when the Jets beat the Colts. Allow me, in the spirit of Joe Namath, to predict on running to make the city better by 2010. I'm not looking backwards, Andrew, I'm looking forward.

KIRTZMAN: Fernando Ferrer.

FERNANDO FERRER: Undeniably, New York City has gotten better in so many respects in the last eight years, but I do not view the last eight years as an unalloyed success. Just ask the New Yorkers who can't find a decent place to live at a price they can afford, or the parents of New York City public school children who are still deeply conflicted about their public schools, finding too many of those children trapped in schools that cannot succeed. Or the one out of four New Yorkers who has no health insurance and no decent and reliable access to health care. Or too many New Yorkers who find themselves on the wrong side of the divide of distrust with their own Police Department. Those are the things that need to change to bring this city to the very next level.

KIRTZMAN: What aspects of city life will you guarantee New Yorkers will remain at least as good as they are or get better?

FERRER: Undeniably, every New Yorker's personal sense of individual safety and security is the predicate for a civilized life in this city. And that's the thing that we must you'd have to be crazy not to say I will devote my administration to dealing with.
But there are also other problems that do affect the quality of life. How can anyone deny that having a decent and affordable place in which to live, a good school to send your children to, decent and regular access to health care and a good relationship with your own Police Department are predicates for stable family living in New York City?

KIRTZMAN: Alan Hevesi.

ALAN G. HEVESI: I guarantee that if I am the mayor, there will be not one step back in the fight against crime, that the Police Department will be recognized for the extraordinary job that it's done, that we will raise the salaries of police officers and we will also deal with the issue of police misconduct. I guarantee that we will have a substantial affordable housing program. I've identified several revenue streams that are new that will be the basis for that program. I guarantee, as well, something my friends and colleagues haven't touched on: that the city will be more business friendly, that we will partner up with industry and business to provide the kinds of services that are needed, industry by industry, profession by profession, in order to increase their ability to do business here and to prosper, because when they prosper we then have the resources to meet our mission. And our mission is to help poor people and to provide affordable housing and help the ill and the elderly a very, very substantial social agenda. And I guarantee that the single most important focus in my administration will be reform of the public schools. Please ask me how we will be doing that.

KIRTZMAN: O.K. We will get to the public schools in due time. Joyce.

JOYCE PURNICK: Hi, everybody. Let's stay for a moment with crime since you all mentioned it and since that's the No. 1 priority or close to it among many New Yorkers, according to that Times poll and other polls. You all have praised the crime drop. You have also indicated that you're going to make major, or at least significant changes in the management of the Police Department. How do you guarantee to New Yorkers, many of whom have said in interviews that they're a little worried about backsliding how do you guarantee that you're going to make sure that we don't backslide, that we have strategies that will continue to fight crime? In particular, can you tell us, therefore, which strategies you think work those of the Giuliani administration ----

VALLONE: Let me ----

PURNICK: ---- and which do not. Why don't we start with you, Mark Green?

GREEN: The Giuliani administration began at the same time that parallel processing took off. They brilliantly used ----

PURNICK: Parallel processing?

GREEN: ---- computer mapping. They brilliantly used computer mapping to track crime by borough, by neighborhood and by block. And if, on Utica Avenue or Fordham Road, grand theft auto was up, that precinct commander had to have an answer what how to respond. That kind of mapping and accountability has worked. That kind of holding someone responsible has worked.
Second, the quality of life policing basically Commissioner William J. Bratton later explained, the idea was to, if a kid jumps a turnstile, there's some higher probability he has a gun on him. So with lesser offenses, you can pat someone down lawfully and get guns off the street, which has also worked. We're now at a limit though. If cops and communities, especially communities of color, continue to have this angry mutual stereotype of each other, crime reduction may stop. I am very interested in lowering these barriers between cops and communities. So cops on the beat need allies on the beat, reporting crime, providing evidence, saying there's a drug den over there, Officer Smith, let's work on it together. The city investing in community-based organizations so there is this kind of proactive, not just reactive, policing. Chicago has done it, San Diego has done it, Boston has done it. I know we can do it.

PURNICK: Mr. Ferrer.

FERRER: At the very same time, Compstat, an important innovation in administrative feedback and accountability, was born. A good thing in this city. At the same time that happened, community policing was dismantled in the very opening days of the Giuliani-Bratton police administration. That planted the seeds for an enormous number of the problems that we've seen develop over the last eight years. And bridging that gulf of distrust between people and their own Police Department is important in restoring a relationship that will at the end of the day keep everyone safer the police officer who does their job heroically every day, and community member who wants to live in a safe, well-patrolled, decent neighborhood on a safe, well-patrolled decent block.

PURNICK: Mr. Hevesi.

HEVESI: Mark and Freddy have dealt with one part of a problem that you raise, that has two parts to it. You asked about the strategies for policing.
One, sustain the police force at or near 40,000 police officers so we have the manpower to do the job. L.A. has 9,000 cops; we have 40,000. 
Two, there are new deployments that are required, and community policing is part of that because the world has changed. There aren't 2,200 murders anymore. They have been reduced by 72 percent. And the crime rates have been reduced by 63 percent. So you have to start thinking about de-emphasizing the street sweeps and increasing the manpower and the ability of precinct commanders to do their jobs in their locales, working with local leaders, community leaders, elected officials, preachers and so on. 
Third, new technology. The Compstat program was a technological breakthrough. It has to be sustained and continued because it's the basis for performance standards. It's how you measure precinct commanders. But you need to have a camera in every car and a camera and a recording device in the precincts so that the confrontations between citizens and the police are now recorded, and that will affect their behavior. You need mobile computers so that the identification of a suspect can be done immediately rather than spending half a day going back to the precinct and using the Teletype or whatever we use to find out from Albany. There's a lot more, and I know you want to restrict our time.

VALLONE: You could use my time, Alan, if you want.

HEVESI: May I? I'll take advantage of that, Peter, trust me.

PURNICK: Mr. Vallone.

VALLONE: The difference between my colleagues and I is they can talk about this, but I've actually done it. You asked, your specific question was how what would you do to make it different? Well, I signed, and I'm the only one here that signed a piece of paper called Safe Streets, Safe City in order to earmark our taxes at a time when we had to reduce the budget by $2 billion. I signed a piece of paper together with then-Mayor Dinkins and the other leaders of the State Legislature, that we would utilize the 10,000 new cops by placing them in the neighborhoods, where they belonged. As a matter of fact, we put a head count in each neighborhood where we wanted those cops because no one on the Legislature or the governor trusted us to do what no one, ever, else had done.
What I would do immediately is to go back to what I signed, the promise that I made. And the promise that I made is that everybody in this city would know their police officers, and the police officers should know their neighborhoods. That's the best protection that you could possibly have. We would use what Rudy Giuliani brought in terms of the Compstat and the computer techniques that he brought in, but we want to see those police officers, we want to see those police officers on the street and that's the best crime prevention in the world.

GREEN: You said there was no rules. Peter is right, he's the only one who signed that paper on this panel and the only one who came forward and sued Howard Safir when he and the mayor denied police misconduct existed, found a pattern of the department protecting rather than punishing officers who routinely racially slandered kids in communities or used excessive force. And I helped triple the rate of discipline at the department. That's not enough.
And so I have laid out a plan to help cops on the beat. I've been meeting with cops privately without brass around. They are miserable, feeling underpaid and underappreciated. So I want to invest in precincts, because where you work reflects what the top brass think of you, invest in tuition assistance up front. The higher the education levels at the start, the less the misconduct and the greater the productivity. . . .

PURNICK: I know we want to move on, but I do have to ask this. One of the most controversial and yet one of the most effective in the eyes of many policies of this administration has been the stop-and-frisk sweeps, but I believe only Mr. Hevesi talked about directly in this last round of questioning. Would you discontinue them, modify them, beef them up? What would you do about them?

VALLONE: Let me ----

PURNICK: And can we try really short answers maybe?

GREEN: Sure. Assemblyman Denny Farrell once creatively said stopping and frisking these kids is great, if it's not your kids. Racial profiling is wrong, it's illegal under federal law. Should I be mayor, I'll stop it by issuing an executive order and guidelines when you stop and frisk. . . .

VALLONE: Let me just add that racial profiling already is against the law and we have a bill on tomorrow that the City Council is on the verge of passing which will give us the statistics that are necessary from the Police Department to find out whether racial profiling ----

PURNICK: So you'll discontinue sweeps or modify it?

VALLONE: No, we wouldn't discontinue. I think stop-and-frisk can only be done when you have reasonable cause to do that. You can't just willy-nilly stop and frisk anyone. The City of New York is paying hundreds of millions of dollars in damages out. So you have to modify it, clean it up and make sure that you've got the right people you're stopping.

PURNICK: Mr. Hevesi.

HEVESI: I think there are clear guidelines that were sometimes ignored by the police during '94 and '95. You are allowed to stop and frisk, and you are even allowed to profile. If a crime has been committed and a witness says the I saw the guy do it, he was a 6-foot redhead, the police are allowed to stop 6-foot redheads in the neighborhood, in the immediate vicinity. What is not permitted is the random stopping of young black males or Latino males in the hopes even though there's no crime, there's no connection. . . .

PURNICK: Mr. Ferrer.

FERRER: Stop-and-frisk policy must always adhere to constitutional principles. Stop-and-frisk policy run amok is racial profiling. So let's not get theoretical about it anymore, and put a human face on this. Couple lives in Ditmars Park, an upper-middle-class enclave in Brooklyn. Their home looks like it belongs in a magazine. Their 18 just 19-year-old son, when he comes home too late and his parents recommend him take the car instead of riding the train too late, is prepared to be stopped, as he virtually is, every other night in that car. By the way, that young man, Frankie his name is, is black. That's the dictionary definition of racial profiling. That is what must be not talked into decline and into prohibition, which must be legislated into prohibition. . . .

PURNICK: Let me move to housing. . . . One of the issues that ranks very high in all the polls is concern about affordable housing. You all have plans. Even the most ambitious of the plans, however, would build, I think it's 150,000 units I think that's yours, Mr. Ferrer in 10 years. There's a coalition of housing experts who say we need a quarter of a million units built. There's no way in 10 years there's no way the city is going to be able to afford to do all of that. My question is: What can you, as mayor, do to stimulate the private sector, to encourage the private sector to build the rest of the housing that we need, particularly when economists say that the rent regulations that we have, and other restraints, are impeding the building the private sector from building housing? How do we break that cycle? Let me start with you, Mr. Ferrer, because you're smiling.

FERRER: Thank you Joyce, I happen to like to smile about this subject: something I know a little bit about. In over 14 years as borough president of the Bronx, I've not only presided over and participated in the planning and execution of the construction of nearly 67,000 homes and apartments, but that changed neighborhoods. It changed markets and marketplaces. It did something else, too. It encouraged the private sector to build in other parts of the Bronx completely unsubsidized, save for the as-of-right tax abatements that they are entitled to, as any builder would in undeveloped land in this city, built several thousand units completely unsubsidized. That was a good development in the Bronx. And that occurs throughout the city where there is enough public sector investment. But something else needs to occur. To really open the faucets, get the housing we need, both publicly assisted for low-, moderate- and middle-income people and to get the private sector to step up as well, we're going to have to engage in very profound reform of our Buildings Department, not to merge it with the Fire Department, but reform it and make it more expert, get it away from its love affair with paper and get it into technology.

PURNICK: You would do nothing about rent regulations, rent stabilization.

FERRER: Well, I was getting to that. It's a very complex issue. I think we've got to keep rents affordable in this city. We've got to keep owners in the business of private rental housing. That's a very delicate balance. And no one is ever happy with the outcome. But what we must do is have a clear and transparent process, not merely for a rent guidelines board that assesses increases in rent on the basis of actual cost instead of projected cost, but since no mayor likes to give up power, this is one mayor who would to the City Council in an advise-and-consent procedure on every member of the rent guidelines board. Let there be full examination of their bona fides and their credentials. Let everyone have confidence in the honesty and accuracy of the process.

PURNICK: Mr. Green.

GREEN: The city project Housing First, New York Law School have done separate studies on this. And affirmatively we have to tell the Buildings Department to start building again. We need a gut rehab of a department where it forces citizens to hire expeditors who know the computer system that other citizens don't.
Second, we have to reduce the mob tax on building. It's not nearly as high as in the carting industry, but I have ideas other than just licensing tens of thousands of contractors and subcontractors to have independent private sector inspector generals attached to companies putting up units to reduce the cost by making sure organized crime doesn't come back in. And I've done a lot of work on that, obviously, in the carting industry.
But finally, very few cities I would keep rent regulation and control as it is with vacancy rates going from 4 to 2 1/2 percent, Joyce, in the last four years this is no time to further decontrol apartments to the marketplace.
Finally, almost no city I know does the private market put up affordable low- , and middle-income housing, notwithstanding your colleague John Tierney's brilliant essays in The New York Times, and he's here today. I would keep rent control, and we have to have government coming up in my generation with the equivalent of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper, of 421A of Mitchell-Lama and should I become mayor, I have an idea on how to generate $100 million in fresh revenue to bond it and put up a lot of units. I will have an affordable housing summit with all developers, not-for-profits, union leaders, scholars to figure out the revenue stream and the creative government mechanism to build again.

PURNICK: Mr. Vallone.

VALLONE: Yeah, I'm very pleased that all of my colleagues have adopted my original idea that I came out with to start an affordable housing trust fund. And I showed where the money's coming from, from the additional real estate taxes we'll be getting from the sale of the World Trade Center. That could be leveraged to $100 million is leveraged to more than a billion dollars a year. You could work with the partnership, like we have been doing with and other not-for-profits to build the kind of affordable housing that is necessary in the city for people up to an income of $100,000, because we're not just talking about people with very low incomes, we're talking about holding the middle class in the City of New York. The only reason we still have a middle class, in many respects, is due to the rent protection that is absolutely necessary. But when you have a leader of the State Senate who says that rent protection is going to end in this city, we better start building affordable housing. The only reason we have any rent protection at all is because we have a housing emergency. We must build affordable housing in this city. You could fill that pot, Joyce. If you got another $100 million of revenue every single year, in 10 years you can have 200,000 units of affordable housing, which is the estimate of what we are short now. People have to have an option, people have to have a place where they can choose or none of our young people will ever be able to afford ----

GREEN: I will imitate your good ideas, why not? But I have never agreed with spending the revenues from the sale and future taxes from the World Trade Center on housing. I want to keep Port Authority assets and sales to Port Authority purposes, which is regional transit, like the Second Avenue subway.

VALLONE: I was talking about the affordable housing trust fund.

GREEN: No, I know, but you want to spend -- --

VALLONE: No, I showed you ----

GREEN: ---- the World Trade Center money.

VALLONE: ---- where I'm getting the money. That's our World Trade Center, that's city money. That's city-owned property.

GREEN: You said you want to also spend World Trade Center money.

VALLONE: No, I said the real estate taxes that would be due to the City of New York based upon the sale or rental of the World Trade Center. . . .

HEVESI: Well, I've got to respond. We have more millionaires in this city than any other city. We have more poor people in this than any other city. And to have a stable middle class and working class, we cannot, at this time or in the foreseeable future, eliminate the rent control and rent regulation system. It would be an enormous dislocation to almost two million people. That's No. 1.
No. 2, I really encourage those who are listening and the press as well to find out the details of what I have heard my good friend Peter Vallone say any number of times, that you can take $100 million and leverage it to a billion a year. And I don't believe that's possible ---- 

VALLONE: I issued a report on that, Alan, I issued a report on it.

HEVESI: Excuse me. Well, I'll be glad to read the report. . . . That doesn't make it excuse me, Peter, you can take 100 million a year and commit it for a number of years, 15 years or 20 years into debt, and get $1 billion, but please don't keep telling people it's a billion a year.
Now, what I believe in is using those I agree with Peter on the theme that you use the new revenue stream, real estate tax revenues from the sale of the World Trade Center, which is a $70 million net because right now the Port Authority does give the city $30 million in . . . payments in lieu of taxes, and you add to that what should have been part of a mix to create a housing trust fund, which is the revenues from Battery Park City, which are profits approaching $50 million.
And the third piece is you commit the comptroller to do what I have done through my seven and a half years, which is to use pension fund money, absolutely safely and guaranteed, to rehabilitate 10,770 units of housing. Then you can have a very substantial affordable housing program of 105,000 in four years.

PURNICK: Mr. Hevesi, if I can stay with you for a moment.

HEVESI: Sure.

PURNICK: How do you respond to the perception, which is shared, clearly, by the Campaign Finance Board, that you were trying to game the system by basically having volunteers run your campaign, volunteers in quotes, and not even having a campaign headquarters? I mean, what were you thinking?

HEVESI: Well, No. 1, I was thinking that the law permitted us to do these things, and No. 2, if anybody has that perception, they have to look at the facts. What happened? What happened is with all the tumult and the spinmeisters trying to create an impression here that you are identifying, the bottom line is the Campaign Finance Board and our campaign had a disagreement over one single issue: could a political consultant be a volunteer? That was the only issue. And that issue, we still think we're right, they think they're right. We didn't contest it. And ultimately it took an extra several days. We said, all right, we'll pay our consultant. And we are paying our consultant and the Campaign Finance Board had certified us to be in compliance, no fees, no fines, no penalties. And they released our $2.6 million in matching funds. So that's a misimpression.

KIRTZMAN: O.K., we are now at the stage of the debate where are going to ask each candidate to ask a question of one other candidate. So why don't we start with you, Fernando Ferrer? Who's your question for?

FERRER: Well, this is a question really for all my rivals in this.

KIRTZMAN: We're limiting it to one, if we could, we have time restrictions.

FERRER: Well, then if I'd pick anyone, I'd pick my friend Mark Green. In some of the most roiling debates about policing in this city, the protest that took place before One Police Plaza, it's peaceful civil disobedience over the Diallo shooting, killed in a hail of 41 bullets. My understanding is you declined to get involved in that. On the issue of the four cops involved in that shooting, you called for a report to be issued. You read the minutes of the commissioner's firearm control board and you promised after the inspection of that report you would come up with a conclusion on that. At our first debate, I asked all of my friends if they would join me in calling for the firing of those four cops. Common sense says they shouldn't be carrying a gun and a badge anymore.

KIRTZMAN: What's the question?

FERRER: Alan Hevesi joined me. What is your position on that today? Where do you stand on that.

GREEN: Sure. The Diallo killing was a horrible tragedy. Mayor Giuliani then compounded it with the travesty of him saying, 'Oh, the four officers who shot him they really didn't do anything wrong and one of them should go to the Fire Department.' I then demanded and got from Commissioner Kerik the files to see why Commissioner Kerik then whitewashed it. And what I found was that there was a direct correlation between the mayor's announcement and Commissioner Kerik's refusal to have a disciplinary hearing.
Freddy, there's a rule of law which fundamentally says you don't punish a civil servant, black or white, unless a court has found him or her guilty or there's been a disciplinary proceeding coming to a conclusion. I'm pleased that you agreed with me on the Sam Roberts show on New York 1 when you said, Sure, they can be transferred to the Fire Department because there was no disciplinary proceeding against it. Let me just say, last night, I ---- 

FERRER: But should they still be cops?

GREEN: Let me just finish. Last until and when a regulatory body or the commissioner or a court says they've committed a crime or violated the disciplinary rules, it's pretty risky for a politician in a campaign to tell a civil servant, 'You're out of here.' Let me say, last night I got an unsolicited call at 10 o'clock from a man who said he was leaving for South Africa . . . and Saikou Diallo thanked me for speaking out on behalf of his family and his son and for all that I've done in his son's memory and to reduce police misconduct. I myself am satisfied with Saikou Diallo's conclusion of my role in this.

FERRER: But let me press the question ----

KIRTZMAN: ---- follow-ups.

FERRER: Forgive me. Mark, with all due respect, after the study of the report, after all this time has passed, do you believe, personally, that they should continue to work in the New York City Police Department?

GREEN: They shouldn't carry a gun. They shouldn't be on the street. But, Freddy, if you in the middle of the campaign I think it's as wrong for Rudy Giuliani to say they're innocent before a disciplinary hearing as for a candidate to say they're guilty before a disciplinary hearing. . . .

KIRTZMAN: Alan Hevesi. . . .

HEVESI: Thank you very much. I was going to ask you a question, now I feel guilty about doing it, but I'll overcome that, Peter. Before the City Council now is a very important piece of legislation, the clinic access legislation.

VALLONE: Yes.

HEVESI: You've authorized the calling of a public hearing. Hearing is great, we know what the legislation does. Will you tell us now if you will set a specific time for a vote on that legislation.

VALLONE: As a matter of fact, I wish you were there this morning when we, you know I took testimony on it. We were listening to testimony from both sides. I don't believe in harassing anyone who wants to go to a health clinic, who wants to go to a house of worship, which is the existing law now. The purpose of the hearing today was to find out whether or not the law that I passed back in 1994, which gives the woman a choice to go, a free choice to go, to a health clinic for whatever medical consultations or information that she needs and I want to make sure that that's happening. And I used the Brooklyn Museum as an example. . . . In the Brooklyn Museum situation, as a Catholic, I was very offended by the terrible exhibit that the Brooklyn Museum was showing, but the overriding principle was they had a right to show it. And I think that that's exactly where we're going to go with the clinic access bill.

KIRTZMAN: Can I? Forgive me, I'm not clear.

PURNICK: Didn't get an answer, I was about to say. Can you clarify?

VALLONE: Well, the answer is that the testimony's being taken today to find out whether or not there are any harassing incidents that have taken place that the police are not enforcing.

HEVESI: The question was are you prepared to tell us now that your scheduling a vote on this bill or not.

VALLONE: Of course not, not until the hearing's over. The hearing's still going on.

HEVESI: And did I hear you correctly, again forgive me for sounding contentious, that the overriding principle for you ----

VALLONE: It's not that you're sounding contentious, you are contentious. The overriding principle is freedom, yes.

HEVESI: Freedom for people to get into the face of a woman going into a reproductive -- --

VALLONE: No, freedom for people to exercise their right to protest, and you're not going to take that away.

HEVESI: ---- protest within 10 feet of a woman going into a reproductive health clinic.

VALLONE: The freedom, the right to exercise your right to free speech as long as you don't harass or disturb anyone's opportunity to enter a clinic or a church or a house of worship.

HEVESI: And you think it would be a violation of those rights to create a 10-foot buffer between the pregnant woman going into a reproductive health clinic ----

VALLONE: What would happen if they asked you to have a 10-foot buffer before you could go shake hands to a prospective voter? I think, I think ----

HEVESI: Let me, let me, if you ask me I'll be glad to respond.

VALLONE: ---- the buffer, the buffer is something

HEVESI: The analogy doesn't hold here.

VALLONE: I think it does.

HEVESI: Well, let me explain why it doesn't ----

VALLONE: Harassment could be within an inch or it could be 20 feet.

HEVESI: The analogy doesn't hold because this is a health-care circumstance. A woman is now about to make a traumatic decision as to whether or not to terminate a pregnancy or to obtain other kinds of reproductive heath care. She's walking into a clinic and somebody who has come out of their home with the express desire to dissuade her can now get in her face.

VALLONE: No, that's not so.

HEVESI: Yes, it is.

VALLONE: Under existing law that's prohibited. That is absolutely prohibited. That's the law that I passed back in 1994.

HEVESI: No, sir.

VALLONE: And you should have been there testifying today if you have any evidence.

HEVESI: Peter, Peter. Even if you say that forcefully, it's not the case.

VALLONE: What do you mean it's not the case?

HEVESI: What your law said was she can not be physically blocked.

VALLONE: Not she, he or she, no human being can be physically blocked from going to ----

HEVESI: Peter. Let me finish my thought and then you can disagree with me. They can't be physically blocked, but they can still step in front of this woman and scream in her face, "Don't do this."

VALLONE: Absolutely not. That is harassment. That is harassment and that is a violation, and she would be arrested if she did that.

HEVESI: So the National Abortion Rights Action League so the National Organization for Women, so the civil rights groups are all wrong.

VALLONE: They are they are testifying now, Alan, and I ----

HEVESI: O.K. . . .

PURNICK: So I want to take us out of New York City for a moment, since this is an international city, and everybody has national and international policies in New York. I wonder what the four of you think of the president's decision on stem cell research. You think you can do that in less that three minutes?

KIRTZMAN: Peter Vallone.

VALLONE: laughs Yeah, that is another moral question that you have to leave to the experts. In terms of the president's agonizing decision, I still think that scientists are divided as to whether or not there's 12 options or 60 options. In my own situation, I would leave that to the experts. I am someone who doesn't believe that you should take one life in order to give another life, unless it's a different kind of circumstance. Here you're talking about creating life, and I would leave that to the experts. In my own personal opinion of it has nothing to do with the city of New York or the decisions that a mayor would have to make, but it has a lot to do with a personal decision that an individual has to make, same as what we were talking about in terms of ----

PURNICK: That's why I asked.

VALLONE: ---- clinic access or it's a question of freedom.

PURNICK: Mr. Green.

GREEN: A man came up to me at a Forest Hills subway in Queens and said, where are you on stem cell research? I said President Bush made a political compromise. If you are pro-life, if you want to do everything to enhance health and life the federal government would encourage research into these breakthrough technologies. He said, thank you, I have Parkinson's. I can not understand how President Bush could have come to this conclusion other than based on ideology.

PURNICK: Mr. Ferrer.

FERRER: This was a hopelessly compromised decision that, you know when you followed the logic of it, doesn't wash. If he was trying to appease the hard right of his governing coalition, what he has done is impeded important research that will save and enhance life for generations to come.

PURNICK: Mr. Hevesi.

HEVESI: I agree. Stem cell research will save lives. And it is the cutting edge of new medical care technology, and scientists should be free to find the life-saving methodologies that are so crucial to so many people in our society.

KIRTZMAN: Gentlemen, we have one minute left so I would appreciate a yes or no answer starting with Alan Hevesi. Will you support the winner of the Democratic primary in the general election.

HEVESI: I may, depending on the circumstances, certainly will support someone who is very much committed to democratic principles. But I'll make that decision when the time comes. I intend to win the primary so the question is moot.

KIRTZMAN: So you may continue on a liberal line?

HEVESI: I may.

KIRTZMAN: Freddy Ferrer.

FERRER: Like the Rolando Paulino All-Stars, I expect to be in the World Series, but I have always supported Democrats, and let me commit now to supporting the Democratic nominee.

KIRTZMAN: Mark Green.

GREEN: Yes.

KIRTZMAN: Peter Vallone.

VALLONE: Yes, no question about it. . . .

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE CUTS ITS KEY RATE BY QUARTER-POINT 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
Citing a persistently weak business environment at home and slowing economic growth abroad, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by another quarter of a percentage point today and signaled that its campaign to avert a recession is probably not yet over.
 The rate cut was the seventh by the central bank this year, and brought the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks to 3.5 percent. The cumulative reduction of three percentage points since January has made this one of the most concentrated periods of monetary policy easing on record. 
 The move was in line with what investors and economists had expected. But stock prices, which were up modestly before the Fed's announcement at 2:15 this afternoon, fell sharply. 
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at 10,174.14, down 145.93 points. The Nasdaq composite index fell 50.05 points, to close at 1,831.30.
The Fed's action came against the backdrop of an increasingly intense debate among analysts over whether the economy was poised for a turnaround or slipping into a downward spiral, and whether the rate cuts have so far proved as effective as the Fed would have hoped. Page C1. 
There have been some recent signs that the economy may be bottoming out, including increased housing activity and an apparent end to the slide in industrial production. Moreover, the one consistent source of strength throughout the slowdown, consumer spending, appears to be getting a further lift this month and into September as many households receive tax rebate checks.
But there is still a considerable risk that this expansion -- the longest on record; it began in March 1991 -- might soon come to an end, or perhaps already has. The economy grew at an annual rate of just 0.7 percent in the second quarter, and analysts expect that figure to be revised down as more data become available, perhaps falling into negative territory reflecting an actual decline in economic output. Even though weekly jobless claims have leveled off, widespread weakness among manufacturers is likely to push the unemployment rate up further, raising the specter that consumer confidence could crack and drive down spending.
Policy makers at the Fed as well as private economists are particularly concerned about a sharp downturn in investment by companies in new factories, machinery, computers and other equipment. And they are increasingly worried that any recovery in the United States will be inhibited by the flagging performance of the European economy and the economic woes of Japan. 
The statement released by the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee today was nearly identical to the one it released after its last rate cut, on June 27. That suggests the central bank has not seen any major change to the economy, for better or worse, over the last eight weeks. Today's statement varied from the last one only in its somewhat more upbeat view of consumer demand, which it characterized in June as weak.
"Household demand has been sustained," the committee said, "but business profits and capital spending continue to weaken and growth abroad is slowing."
The Fed made clear that it sees plenty of room to cut rates further if necessary without risking a destabilizing surge in wages and prices, noting that an "easing of pressures on labor and product markets is expected to keep inflation contained."
Using its stock phrase to indicate that it is leaving the door open to further rate cuts if the economy does not rebound soon, the Fed said "the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
The Fed, which will hold its next meeting on Oct. 2, also cut its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3 percent.
Today's rate reduction was intended to build consumer and business confidence, create some optimism among investors and bolster economic activity by reducing borrowing costs.
Banks immediately began cutting their prime lending rates, a step that should lower borrowing costs for some types of home equity loans and some variable rate mortgages. The rate cut, however, is unlikely to have much direct impact on fixed mortgages, which have rates set primarily in the bond market.
Among economists, one camp is relatively optimistic that the combination of the Fed's rate cuts and the tax cut, which is pumping $38 billion in rebate checks into consumers' hands in two and a half months, should be enough to avert a recession and get the economy back on track by the end of the year.
The optimists, pointing to four consecutive monthly increases in an index of forward-looking economic indicators, say that the Fed is at or near the end of its rate-cutting cycle.
"Additional stimulus, in our opinion, is unnecessary as the stagnant economy seems to be on the verge of awakening," said Richard Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research Company.
But some economists are much more worried about the economy's path. They say there is little evidence that the slide in corporate profits is ending, and that as long as profits are under pressure, companies will continue cutting back on capital spending, and perhaps on employment, too.
The stock market, they say, has remained stubbornly flat despite the aggressive rate cuts. And although the rate cuts are beginning to have an effect on financial conditions throughout the economy -- the dollar, for example, has fallen sharply in the last few weeks -- they say the Fed's benchmark rate may have to go lower, and stay there longer, to turn the economy around.
"The Fed did what most people expected them to do today, but that still begs the question of whether that's enough," said Stephen D. Slifer, chief domestic economist at Lehman Brothers. "The market is sending a message to the Fed that they'll have to be more aggressive to get the economy going."
Some economists said the Fed's cumulative rate increases would begin having their full effect, on financial conditions and on the economy, in the next few months. 
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said in the eight previous periods over the last half- century in which the Fed had undertaken a rate-cutting campaign of the magnitude of this one, the stock market had declined in half the cases by this point in the easing cycle. But in all eight cases, he said, the S.& P. 500-stock index was up a year later, by an average of 28 percent.
Other analysts say it remains unclear whether monetary policy is working effectively in this business cycle.
Economists at Goldman, Sachs issued a report today saying that the Fed had been hampered all year by currents in the markets that have been running against the lower short-term rates controlled by the central bank.
"With lower stock prices, a stronger dollar, and only modestly lower long-term interest rates than at the beginning of the year," the report said, "the financial markets have not cooperated with their 300-basis-point easing of short-term rates."

HEADLINE: Bush Defends Size of Surplus And Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: INDEPENDENCE, Mo., Aug. 21 

 BODY:
President Bush defended his tax cut today as affordable and essential to revitalizing the economy, and he waded into an intensifying battle with Democrats over who is to blame for the rapidly shrinking federal budget surplus.
 In an unusually long and impassioned speech here that reflected the rising political stakes of the fight, the president insisted that the gravest danger to federal surpluses was increased spending by Congress, and he cast himself as the vigilant guardian against that. 
 "The federal budget will have the second largest surplus in history," Mr. Bush told an audience of several thousand people at Harry S. Truman High School, referring to figures for the current fiscal year to be released on Wednesday by the White House Office of Management and Budget. 
The report, Mr. Bush said, will "show in plain terms that we have fully funded and will be able to fund our nation's priorities and that we have enough money to preserve and protect Social Security" while safeguarding Medicare and reducing the federal debt. He said this was possible despite a sluggish economy, in part because his administration "took exactly the right action, at the right time, by pushing the largest tax cut in a generation."
"And now," Mr. Bush added, "we must resist the temptation of a bigger threat to growth, and that's excessive federal spending." 
He warned Congress that he would fight spending bills that went beyond the budget resolution it passed several months ago.
Referring to himself and other Americans, he said: "We don't want the budget to be a hollow noise. We want the budget to be real, and that's why I've been given the power of the veto."
Mr. Bush's remarks were an advance salvo in the skirmish over appropriations bills for the next fiscal year. Budgeting, an almost inevitably fractious process, will come to a head in September and October.
But the remarks were also -- perhaps principally -- a prelude to a broader political battle sure to be set off by the release of the White House budget office's report and of a similar report by the Congressional Budget Office later this month. Both are expected to show dwindling surpluses as a result of the economic slowdown and the tax cut that Mr. Bush pushed through Congress last spring.
Administration officials said the report of the White House budget office would show a surplus of about $160 billion for the current fiscal year, which will end on Sept. 30. At the beginning of the year, the Congressional Budget Office predicted a surplus of $281 billion for the year. The surplus for the last fiscal year was $236.9 billion, a record.
All or almost all of this year's remaining surplus will come from the Social Security system, which politicians in both parties have declared off limits for general spending or tax cuts.
Before a change in federal accounting that the Bush administration announced last week, the report by the White House budget office had also been expected to show that the tax cut and the decline in tax receipts related to the slowing economy had wiped out the non-Social Security surplus and perhaps dipped into the Social Security surplus as well.
Using the Social Security surplus would not have any immediate effect on the government's ability to pay benefits to retirees, although it could influence the nation's long-term fiscal health by limiting the amount of money available to reduce the national debt.
But the Democratic National Committee began running advertisements today that accused the president of gross fiscal irresponsibility,of raiding or endangering Social Security and Medicare surpluses and of not "protecting our seniors." Democrats also responded quickly to Mr. Bush's speech.
"When this president came to office," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House budget committee, "we gave him a gift that no president in recent times has enjoyed: a budget that was in a healthy surplus and surpluses that were projected for 10 years, at least, to come. Now, within less than eight months, we're dealing with the consequences of budget actions that were not well considered."
Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Senate appropriations committee, said "more and more people are coming to realize that the tax cut was a mistake and a colossal mistake."
Mr. Byrd said he would like the Senate to review and reconsider elements of the tax cut that benefited the wealthiest Americans, although he said this was unlikely at present. The tax cut won 12 Democrats' votes in the Senate and 28 in the House.
And Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, said, "The Bush tax cut has wiped out the surplus, invaded Medicare and stayed out of Social Security only by employing a ridiculous accounting gimmick."
Democrats also complained that the economic growth of 3.2 percent that the White House budget office was expected to forecast for 2002 was overly optimistic, an example, in their view, of machinations by the administration to make the president's budget arithmetic work.
Mr. Bush's speech here was his first full response to such criticism, which had been increasing in the last week. Although much of the 40-minute speech echoed his remarks during his campaign for president, it was staged with unmistakable symbolism. To emphasize his stated interest in transcending partisan squabbling, he visited the hometown of President Harry S. Truman, a blunt Democrat, and spoke at a high school named for him. A portrait of Truman hung a few yards from Mr. Bush's lectern.
Mr. Bush spoke without a prompter and glanced only occasionally at notes, a departure from his usual approach to remarks as long as these. He was also more animated than usual, and people in the audience rose three times to applaud.
The president said the economic slowdown "began last year," before he took office, adding, "The slowdown is serious, folks; make no mistake about it."
He said tax reductions were an answer and an antidote to the slowdown, maintaining that the lawmakers who voted against them "resent tax relief because they wanted more of your money in Washington" so they could spend too much of it. And, he said, those lawmakers would go beyond the budget resolution by declaring nonexistent emergencies and decrying nonexistent spending cuts during the tussle over the spending bills.
Democrats said Mr. Bush's request for large Pentagon spending increases belied his claim to fiscal restraint, and suggested that the military budget was the first place they would look for savings to make sure that the budget did not use Social Security money.

HEADLINE: Taking the Net Where a Phone Is a Luxury 

BYLINE:  By J. D. BIERSDORFER 

 BODY:
SETTING up a state-of-the-art technology center in a place where consistent telephone service, electricity and even running water can be hard to find may seem like a pipe dream. But a new company named BusyInternet is trying not only to set up that center but also to help connect more of Africa to the Internet through it.
 With the help of Ghanaian business partners, BusyInternet is preparing to open a high-tech development center in Accra, Ghana, that offers training rooms, office space, meeting rooms, workstations for low-cost public Internet access, a photocopying shop and a cafe. The center will be housed in a 14,000-square-foot former factory building. Equipped with Pentium III computers, flat-screen monitors and Internet access via satellite, the BusyInternet building is expected to open next month. 
 The start-up cost of the center, its support staff and equipment is more than $1 million. The company plans to open similar centers in other African countries like Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Uganda next.
BusyInternet is temporarily based in New York and will maintain an office there after it moves its international headquarters to Ghana later this year. The Internet is not exactly unheard of in Ghana. The country already has a few Internet service providers and more than 100 cybercafes for surfing the Web and exchanging e-mail on public computers, although phone service over all is poor. Nua Internet Surveys, a company in Ireland that tracks Internet use statistics, estimated that there were about 20,000 Internet users in Ghana last year.
"There are 240,000 telephone lines in Ghana for 19 million people," said Mark Davies, the founder and chief executive of BusyInternet. "It takes about seven dials to make some phone calls go through, just across town." He said that BusyInternet would be independent of the local utilities. "We've put in our own link to the national electric grid, our own generator, our own satellite dish for bandwidth," he explained. 
Mr. Davies, who also founded the Metrobeat Web site in New York, which was purchased by CitySearch in 1996, said he got the inspiration for BusyInternet while reflecting on a backpacking trip through West Africa. The government of Ghana did not provide any financing; the company has formed partnerships with local venture capitalists and information technology entrepreneurs and is negotiating with several Ghanaian financial institutions. 
The plans put BusyInternet in the middle of a debate over the role of technology in developing countries. Some people, including William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, have argued that such countries need basic amenities like food and medicine more than they need personal computers. Others, like Freeman Dyson, in his 1999 book "The Sun, the Genome and the Internet," point out that the technology can be used to educate people in developing countries and help close the economic gap between them and industrialized countries.
South Africa is the most technologically advanced country in Africa, with more than two million Internet users. But a number of companies are trying to get the rest of the continent wired as well. A deep-sea data cable that will connect Africa to Europe is already being laid by a consortium of more than 40 international telecommunications companies, including Telkom South Africa. A private company called Africa One is planning to build a system of fiber-optic cable across the entire continent as well.
Mr. Davies envisions the center as a place where all kinds of individuals and businesses will share information, from health practitioners presenting interactive seminars on H.I.V. prevention to companies learning how to set up e-mail systems.
"Our philosophy is to say nobody really knows what's right for Ghana," he said, "and the technology is sort of culturally specific in terms of how it's implemented and how it works. So the best thing you can do is create these little incubators, if you will, where you're bringing people together and coming up with solutions on their own."
Although there is still much work to be done to get the technology center ready to open next month, Mr. Davies compared the excitement of the startup to Western fervor about the World Wide Web in the mid-1990's. 
"It was great to come back into a place and a time where it was still about invention," he said. "It was still about doing things because you love to do them and it was a great idea and you had that conviction, rather than you just felt it was the next way to make two million dollars."

HEADLINE: Malaysia's Internet Road Show 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: TUNJANG, Malaysia 

 BODY:
NAFIZAH ISMAIL had heard of the Internet, but she had never used it until one day in April when a special bus rolled up to her school, deep in Malaysia's northern rice bowl.
 "We realized that the Internet can connect us to the outside world," Nafizah, 12, said as she and two village friends sat in their school canteen, heads covered by scarves as tradition dictates in this conservatively Muslim area. Now Nafizah is learning to prepare her homework on a computer, navigate the Internet, send e-mail and even design Web pages, as more than 2,800 other Malaysian children have done since the bus hit the road two years ago. 
 The bus, called the Mobile Internet Unit, is an attempt by Malaysia to help bridge its digital divide by delivering technology to its poorest, most remote schools on a 40-foot bus loaded with 20 personal computers. To the United Nations Development Program, under which the idea was conceived, the bus is an experiment in hastening the spread of the Internet to young minds in areas where infrastructure is scarce and suspicions run high. 
"These mobile units are perfect in raising awareness, building interest and understanding -- and reducing the fear," said Vijay Parmar, deputy regional coordinator of the agency's Asia-Pacific Development Information Program in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur.
A sort of bookmobile for the Internet age, the original bus has already been supplemented by seven scaled-down versions, and the government plans to put two in each of Malaysia's 14 states by 2005. The United Nations agency, meanwhile, has organized a similar initiative in Ghana and says countries like Lebanon and Iran have expressed an interest.
Development experts involved in the effort say the Internet can play an important role in providing education and new opportunities in such countries -- or at the very least, can help them avoid falling further behind the developed world. That is no small challenge in places where villagers are lucky to have phone lines and electricity, much less an Internet cafe.
In its own development, Malaysia lies somewhere between the extremes and is trying to leap ahead. Homes in the rice-farming village where Nafizah lives have telephones and televisions. There are paved roads for motorbikes. The peasants and water buffaloes toiling in the paddies are gone; farmers hire combine harvesters to reap their crops. 
And thanks in part to government initiatives, Malaysia is also disproportionately well networked. It has almost half as many Internet users per capita as the United States. Since the mid-1990's, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has made the creation of a "knowledge economy" a national priority, clearing a swath of oil-palm plantations for his version of Silicon Valley, seeking counsel from American technology executives and even badgering Muslim clerics to embrace the Internet. 
At the same time, plans to install computers in the country's roughly 8,500 schools, starting with those in rural areas, have been slow, impeded in part by the financial crisis of 1997 and 1998 and the latest global economic slowdown. Since the endeavor was announced four years ago, only 90 of the so-called smart schools have been established.
"Malaysia is a very good country to start with," said Gabriel Accascina, who until last year headed the Asia-Pacific Development Information Program. Mr. Accascina came up with the idea for the Mobile Internet Unit based on his experience in the 1980's in Mali, when he and other aid workers used a four-wheel-drive vehicle to cart a television and videocassette recorder to rural villages to show instructional tapes. "We would go into the village and pull out the TV and hand out brochures and teach the villagers how to dig a trench or recognize malnutrition," said Mr. Accascina, who now heads his own consulting firm. 
With $75,000 in initial funds, Mr. Accascina sold the government's own technology research company, the Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic Systems, or Mimos, on his idea of an old school bus carrying personal computers down the country's muddy back roads.
Mimos had even bigger plans. It persuaded the local distributor of Isuzu vehicles to donate a $263,000 bus tailored for the project. The result is a sleek, silver coach that is well beyond the battered bus Mr. Accascina envisioned. Three air-conditioners and a pocket of insulating air protect the computers and their users from the tropical heat. If no reliable power source is handy, a diesel-powered generator slides out of the bus's belly.
Mobile Internet Unit is something of a misnomer, however. The bus can establish Internet access only by stringing a telephone cord to a telephone jack nearby. If one is not available, pupils on the bus surf Web sites stored on the bus's computer server.
To start the program, organizers selected 20 rural schools in the state closest to Kuala Lumpur, reaching out to children from fishing villages, oil-palm plantations and rubber estates. One of the first obstacles was convincing not only educators, but village headmen, clerics and parents as well, that the bus was a good idea. 
"Mostly they hear about the negative side of the Internet" -- like pornography -- "so they're frightened," said Kang Wai Chin, the Mobile Internet Unit's voluble project manager. "We want parents to understand the value of the Internet to their children." 
The bus program is typically built around an eight-hour course delivered in one-hour installments to 20 children at a time. It starts with such basics as learning how to turn the computer on and use a mouse, then progresses to basic word processing, e-mail, Web browsing, even manipulating spreadsheets and designing simple Web pages. A visit, typically lasting one day every two weeks, can also include a teacher-training session at the lunch hour.
The Mobile Internet Unit's organizers leave behind a PC, a modem and an Internet account so that pupils can practice and teachers can find ways to work computers into the curriculum. There is another goal: to convince parents of the computers' value, prompting them, perhaps, to buy a PC for the home or to raise money to equip the schools with more.
Does all this help the pupils? It may never be possible to know for sure. The participants have yet to take standardized exams to see how they compare with nonparticipants. The Mobile Internet Unit's own progress report charts success in at least improving computing skills and awareness. Its surveys of participants showed that 39.7 percent could use a spelling checker on a document after the course, compared with only 8.9 percent before. Slightly more than half had mastered e-mail, compared with 16.6 percent before boarding the bus.
Ms. Kang concedes the project has its skeptics among Malaysian educators, many of whom feel such skills are of dubious benefit in the countryside. Their criticisms are mirrored in the broader development community, where some say money for computers in poor rural schools would be better spent for chalk, teachers or even food. 
While seemingly irrelevant in an agrarian context, such skills will be crucial to those children who eventually want to move out of the shrinking agricultural sector, Ms. Kang says. At the very least, she says, computers are a way to augment anemic libraries instantly. 
The project has also won fans among teachers whose schools have taken part in the program. Loh Tzu Lee, an English teacher at Sungei Pelek secondary school in Selangor state near Kuala Lumpur, one of the first schools the bus program visited, says CD-ROM's and the Internet offer a wealth of helpful, interactive lessons. "We can't prepare those kinds of activities in time for them," she said.
After he completed the bus program, Hafiz Handzalah, a Sungei Pelek ninth grader, persuaded his father to buy a computer for him to use at home. His grades have since gone up, he said, as the quality of his reports improved -- as did his spelling, perhaps not only because of a spelling checker but also because of the increased amount of reading he does online. 
Back in Tunjang, the headmaster, Zulkeflee Alwi, hopes the Mobile Internet Unit will do the same for his pupils. Like Nafizah, most come from rice-farming families. "They're not exposed to what's happening," Mr. Zulkeflee said. "They just know their area only." The Internet, he said, may make the larger world more tangible and relevant to his pupils -- who lag behind their urban counterparts on nationwide exams -- and build their confidence.
Tunjang represents a new approach for the Mobile Internet Unit. Instead of concentrating only on children, the bus is opening to their parents, as well. Because of the town's remoteness, the bus has visited about every two months rather than every two weeks, but instead of leaving only one PC at the school, it left 10, so that the school's computer lab will stay open on weekends. "When students aren't going to school, the school is empty," Ms. Kang said. "That's a waste of resources."
Malaysia's experience is also raising interest elsewhere, said Mr. Parmar of the Asia-Pacific program. For the United Nations Development Program, "it's something we can showcase instead of talking about it all the time," he said. Poor roads and long distances may make buses impractical in countries like China and India, he said, but the project in rural Ghana could offer a clearer picture of the effect such programs can have.
In the meantime, while Ms. Kang and Mimos are screening new villages to visit with their bus, the country's biggest libraries are wheeling out new buses, increasingly taking over the Internet pied-piper role. Even in less-developed Malaysian Borneo, plans are afoot to find a way to deliver computing to jungle communities that roads have yet to reach. The plan is to build a mobile Internet boat.

HEADLINE: Power Crisis Is Creating Opportunity In Brazil 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil Aug. 22

 BODY:
Hawking the Brooklyn Bridge is child's play compared with selling electrical appliances in Brazil these days.
 But less than three months into an acute energy crisis, Multibras, the country's largest home appliance manufacturer, says the country has turned a corner. With the introduction of a full line of energy-efficient appliances, it is betting it can entice consumers back into stores. 
 "The peak of the crisis is over," Paulo Periquito, president of Multibras, said in an interview. "Over the next few months, the consumer is going to realize that he economized much more than he needed to and he can go back and start using many of the appliances that he had stopped using." 
Sales at the company, which is owned by the Whirlpool Corporation, based in Benton Harbor, Mich., dropped precipitously after the government announced an emergency energy rationing plan in May that required all households to cut power use 20 percent. Fearing fines or punitive power cuts, consumers took drastic measures, permanently unplugging microwaves, freezers and washing machines. Residential power use fell 35 percent.
At the same time, household appliance sales fell an average 23 percent in May and 30 percent in June, according to the Brazilian Association of Electroelectronic Manufacturers, known as Eletros. Multibras said microwave sales alone plummeted 70 percent. 
Now home appliance manufacturers and stores are trying to lure energy-conscious consumers back into the stores to replace old, energy-guzzling appliances with newer, more efficient models. 
"Products in Brazil have evolved technologically over the past several years in such a way that they already save a lot of energy," said Paulo Saab, president of Eletros. "We are trying to show the consumer that he can still buy products and help the country by not paralyzing the economy."
For Andreia Silva, 19, who was researching prices of new washing machines at an Eletro appliance store in the commercial neighborhood of Lapa, the message rang true because she had had to listen to her mother complain about chapped hands for two months. 
"We have one of those huge 10-year-old washing machines that starts hopping across the floor when it hits the spin cycle," said Ms. Silva, who lives with her parents and a younger sister. "It uses so much energy that we've been washing everything by hand." 
So far, Multibras has made the most progress persuading consumers to trade in old refrigerators, which can be replaced by models that offer energy savings of as much as 30 percent. Although the company refused to provide specific figures, Mr. Periquito said the increase in refrigerator sales had been significant enough to make up for the drop in most other appliance sales. He expects the company to finish the year with sales similar to those in 2000. 
Riding the moment, the company has committed itself to upgrading its entire product line over the next 90 days to qualify for the government's seal of energy efficiency.
Analysts warn, though, that talk of recovery is premature. Sales on products that are considered locally to be major energy wasters, like freezers, microwaves and air-conditioners, are not expected to rebound until at least next year.
And consumption is going to be further stymied by an increase in interest rates that is causing stores to cut back on financing packages. At the home appliance chain Ponto Frio, for example, sales at stores opened at least a year fell 10 percent in the second quarter compared with last year. 
Eletro managed to post 5 percent growth in the second quarter for sales at such stores, though sales fell 9.6 percent in June, when emergency rationing took effect. 
"Interest rates are high, salaries aren't growing and these type of products have a lot to do with growth in G.D.P.," said Gustavo Hungria, a retail analyst at the Rio de Janeiro investment bank Banco Pactual. "For the short term, it is going to be difficult for the sector. We expect the next quarter to be at least as bad as the last."

HEADLINE: More Signs of Trouble for Ireland's Technology Boom 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Baltimore Technologies, the security software developer that was once the darling of Ireland's nascent technology industry, said today that it would halve its work force, delist from the Nasdaq stock market and sell nonessential businesses.
 Baltimore's retrenchment, after a dizzying decline this year, comes amid a number of recent cutbacks by technology companies in Ireland. Today, Tellabs, the American telecommunications equipment manufacturer, said that it would close its plant in Drogheda, with the loss of 200 jobs, as part of a plan to cut 1,000 jobs worldwide, or 12 percent of its work force. Last week, General Semiconductor said that it would do the same after 20 years in Cork, leaving 670 people unemployed. 
Since early August, when Gateway announced nearly 1,000 layoffs and the closing of its Dublin plant, Ireland has quickly come to doubt its faith in the technology sector. Even as its robust economic growth continues to outpace the rest of Europe, it is clear that Ireland is not immune to the global slowdown in spending on technology. 
In the 1990's, computer and telecommunications companies set up operations in Ireland, drawn by the advantages of a highly skilled and English-speaking labor pool, low corporate taxes and government assistance. Now, many small towns that rely on one large employer are wondering whether technology companies will follow the path of Ireland's textile industry, which disappeared in the late 1980's.
About 4,500 jobs have been lost at government-sponsored multinational companies so far this year. The deputy prime minister, Mary Harney, has pledged to find replacement employers for areas that are badly affected.
Most of the 220 positions that Baltimore cut today are in Britain; about 400 more will be shed as noncore interests are sold. While only 30 employees in Dublin will lose their jobs, the news hurts because the company was once the pride of Ireland's new economy.
Baltimore reported a second-quarter loss of $691 million today, writing off more than $500 million worth of major acquisitions as a loss. Its loss before taxes and before one-time items was $33.3 million -- more than four times what the company lost in the period last year. Second-quarter revenue was nearly the same as last year, at $23.2 million.
Baltimore's main product lines manage digital certificates and secure corporate networks using public key infrastructure technology.
"Clearly these results are not acceptable and do not reflect the company's true potential," Paul Sanders, the acting chief executive, said in a statement. Mr. Sanders, who also serves as chief financial officer, took over at the end of July after the resignation of Fran Rooney, Baltimore's founder.
Investors reacted positively to the restructuring plan. In London, Baltimore shares rose as much 14 percent. On the Nasdaq market, its American depository receipts -- each representing two shares of the company -- fell 5 cents, to 62 cents. The A.D.R.'s will move from the Nasdaq to the over-the-counter bulletin board on Sept, 30.
Baltimore hopes that the plan will save $101.3 million a year, and that it will have its first profit by the second quarter of 2002. Its expensive network of international sales offices has been sharply reduced; a report by Merrion Capital in Dublin found that the company spent more than $88 in sales and marketing alone for every $100 it earned.
More than half of the savings will come from the sale of Content Technologies, which Baltimore acquired in September 2000 for $:700 million, ($990 million at the time) -- a staggering figure for an Irish company. Baltimore's cash reserves, now down to $75.8 million from $117.6 million last quarter, will run low quickly if a buyer cannot be found.

With evolving technology, good monitors make for better contracts.

BYLINE:  By Hal R. Varian 

 BODY:
BEFORE 1998, video rental stores bought tapes from distributors for about $70 each. Because the tapes were so expensive, the stores bought relatively few of them, with the result that customers had to wait to see their favorite films. To paraphrase a noted amateur economist, the hits were so popular that no one was able to rent them.
 In 1998, the industry began to move to a different plan: distributors provided tapes to the stores for a small upfront fee of $3 to $8 and then took 40 to 60 percent of every rental. This "revenue sharing" model is the norm today, at least for hit movies in large rental chains. 
 This policy has been a big success. According to the Harvard economist Julie Holland Mortimer, revenue sharing raised the combined profits of the distributor and retail outlet over 7 percent and increased access to popular tapes, making consumers significantly better off.
Video stores have been in existence since the early 1980's. Revenue sharing contracts were available in the video industry for about 10 years but were not widely used until after 1998. Why did it take the industry so long to adopt this superior form of contract?
There is a big difference between the traditional fixed-fee sale of tapes to stores and revenue sharing: the distributor has to be able to track sales to ensure appropriate payment. Just as good fences make for good neighbors, good monitoring makes for good contracts.
Monitoring costs are sharply lower these days because of the availability of low-cost computer networking. It used to be that only large chains could afford smart cash registers and proprietary networks to monitor sales. Now virtually any retail outlet can buy PC software that does sophisticated sales tracking and sends reports over the Internet to central accounting offices.
Dedicated cash registers have virtually disappeared the last 10 years, replaced by generic PC's with special software. The latest trend is to eliminate proprietary file transfer protocols and send sales reports as standard e-mail attachments. Smart cash registers have become a commodity, and that makes them very cost-effective tools for monitoring revenue.
A similar revolution has occurred in the trucking industry. Most of those semis you see on the highway have a PC inside. The economist Thomas Hubbard of the University of Chicago has studied this industry extensively and reports that nearly 50 percent of trucks built in the early 1990's had some form of electronic monitoring system installed.
Some of these computers are "trip recorders" that monitor various aspects of the truck's operation, like when the engine is running, the speed of operation and when sudden acceleration or deceleration takes place.
Others systems, known as electronic vehicle monitoring systems, use wireless data technology to communicate location and to transmit instructions from central dispatchers to drivers.
The romantic view of the truck driver as a lone cowboy, beholden to no one but himself, is seriously out of date. Today, most long-haul truck drivers are as carefully monitored as the office stenography pool used to be.
Vehicle monitoring systems allow for more efficient employment contracts since they have lowered the cost of observing departures from agreements. A trucker might say he will take the optimal route rather than making a side trip to visit his girlfriend, but how could his behavior be verified without a monitoring device?
Additionally, when dispatchers know the current location of every truck, it is much easier to optimize routing.
Some rental car companies have installed a form of trip monitors to detect speeding and other forms of unsafe operation. Such systems should eventually lead to lower insurance costs and, therefore, lower rates for automobile rental. Individuals can decide whether they want to go fast and pay more, or obey the speed limit and pay less.
Computer-mediated contracts are an important development because they help make economic relationships more efficient. By reducing monitoring costs, they allow for forms of contracting that were previously unavailable.
But there's a cost to all this monitoring: privacy. Truck drivers may not like being watched, and video renters may not be happy about their transactions being stored on a centralized server. Rental car safety is desirable, but the customers may prefer autonomy to lower rates. A group of judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco protested monitoring technology installed on their computers.
These are real concerns. On the other hand, people generally enter into contracts voluntarily and can choose how much monitoring they will tolerate in exchange for lower prices or higher wages. Abuse of private information is bad -- there are laws about who can see your video rental records -- but voluntarily agreed-on contracts are generally a good thing.
The critical issue is informed consent. Truck drivers know they are being monitored. Video renters who sign up for loyalty programs should be aware that part of the cost of those free videos involves tracking cumulative rentals. A panel of federal judges investigating the San Francisco complaint has recommended posting a prominent message about the monitoring technology every time users log on.
When trip monitors were first introduced, truck drivers had misgivings about them. But enough of the benefits from better monitoring, routing and improved capacity utilization have flowed to their paychecks to make them quite popular among drivers today.
Want to work at home? Would you be willing to have your work-related activities monitored to do so? Want to sell a product? Would you be willing to wait till it was sold to be paid? These questions and more like them will face us all as computer-mediated contracts become more widespread.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
UPN Weighs Ad Logos In Prime Time

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
The constantly blurring line between programming and advertising on television may get even wavier as at least one network considers an idea to sell to marketers the ability to superimpose small transparent logos, brand names and other commercial trappings in a corner of the screen.
 The space that could possibly become additional turf for paid product advertising is now filled by many broadcast and cable networks with their own logos, reminding viewers where they are tuned, often along with brief, miniature promotions for coming shows and series. Tiny translucent versions of symbols like the ABC dot, the CBS eye, the NBC peacock, the TNT circle, the shields of the History Channel and WB and the PBS "P-Man" -- known as "bugs" in the TV industry -- have become familiar sights in recent years as they hover seemingly wraithlike over and throughout the programs being presented. 
 No national network or local station in this country has regularly run such digital ectoplasmic advertisements in that space on behalf of outside sponsors, as far as can be determined. The New York Post reported this week that UPN, part of the media conglomerate Viacom, is considering proposing to advertisers and agencies that they could do so during UPN prime-time series as a bonus for buying large blocks of time to run traditional commercials during regular breaks. 
There is something of a precedent in the appearance of tiny advertiser logos on screen. They appear now on several regional and national sports networks during coverage of soccer matches as well as baseball, basketball, football and hockey games, as scores are being shown.
And ad bugs could be deemed not unlike the placement for a fee of branded products in the background of scenes in shows, which is a longtime practice that has become more popular lately with the rise of so-called reality programming. For instance, contestants who win immunity challenges on the hit CBS series "Survivor" are typically rewarded with sponsors' products, which are displayed and cooed over on screen like presents under the tree at the orphanage on Christmas morning.
Still, the idea of ad bugs raises a thorny issue that has recently preoccupied Madison Avenue, marketers and the media as the sluggish economy dampens demand for commercial time: How much is too much when it comes to peddling products as consumers grow increasingly tired of -- and are more easily able to avoid -- conventional TV spots?
Ad bugs would be "shockingly crude and inappropriate," said Scott Lerman, president at Enterprise IG in New York, a brand and corporate identity consulting company that is part of the giant WPP Group agency company.
Mr. Lerman likened potential ad bugs to "debris" and called the consideration of the idea "a sign of desperation."
Though the ad world grows "more crowded," he added, "people are going to get angry" if they actually appeared "because they'd be considered an imposition."
That derogatory view is, however, not universally shared.
The idea of ad bugs is "something we would look at" if it was presented by a TV network, said Rich Hamilton, chief executive for the North American operations at Zenith Media in New York, an agency that specializes in buying commercial time and ad space for marketers.
"History has shown that when consumers are exposed to advertising in places where advertising has not been in the past, they initially react negatively -- then accept it," he added, giving as an example commercials that run before films in movie theaters.
"Will it happen? Will it be a success? I can't say for sure," Mr. Hamilton said of the ad bugs. "If the Nike 'swoosh' or the Toyota logo or the McDonald's arches appeared on the bottom corner of the screen during a UPN program, there would probably be a reaction from some consumers. But most times, those reactions pass."
What would be most important in determining whether ad bugs will appear, he added, is "what value is there" for marketers as they balance the desire to introduce commercial messages "in all kinds of different places" against the potential irksomeness of the idea. Zenith is owned by the Cordiant Communications Group and the Publicis Groupe.
There is apparently no regulation that would prohibit ad bugs during prime-time programs, said David Fiske, a spokesman for the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, because the government has "no limits on TV commercials" other than during children's programming.
The prevailing policy, he added, is that it is "a market decision how much commercialism is too much commercialism."
Whether ad bugs are embraced or declared excessive is to be determined by executives at UPN, which is best-known for wrestling programs and "Star Trek" sequel series and has high hopes for the 2001-02 season after wooing a popular show, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" from WB. For some wrestling shows, two bugs appear on screen at once: the UPN logo in one corner and that of the World Wrestling Federation in the other.
"I don't think the viewer would welcome replacing our bug for some period of time" with an advertiser's logo, said Adam Ware, chief operating officer at UPN in Los Angeles, "and I don't think the producers of our shows would welcome it."
"At the end of the day, it's not in our best interest to end up" having the screen of a UPN viewer look "like the inside of a hockey rink," he added.
That said, Mr. Ware qualified his remarks somewhat. He said the ad bug was "not something I'm exploring in the form you're talking about it," that is, by "taking our logo and replacing it with an advertising logo."
"If that's all you did, it would be intrusive," Mr. Ware said. "If you were to figure out a creative way of incorporating an advertiser message, that would probably be a better way to go."
"In a healthy market, or a very competitive market, you need to constantly review how you're selling your time," he added. "The business has evolved and there are more ways to communicate your message, and you have to start evolving with that."
UPN executives have been "figuring out doing different creative things," Mr. Ware said, and as part of those plans are working with Endeavor Marketing Solutions, part of the Endeavor talent agency, "talking to advertisers, talking to agencies, about a whole host of ideas." He declined to elaborate because, he said, "some are closed, but not ready for announcement."
Another executive who buys commercial time at a media agency said he believed the ad bug could appear on a network, if it began on screen as a marketer's logo and then, rather than appearing as an ad logo for an extended period, morphed into the standard network-identification logo.
"I look at it on two levels," said the executive, Andrew Donchin, director for national broadcast at Carat USA in New York, part of the Carat International division of the Aegis Group.
"As a buyer, I'd like to see the proposal and do an analysis," he explained. "As a viewer, sitting on the couch with my feet up, I'd be a little bothered by it as too intrusive."
At WB, which is considered to be the broadcast network that most directly competes against UPN, Jed Petrick, president and chief operating officer in Burbank, Calif., said ad bugs are "not something we've ever thought of doing."
"We're always looking for different ways to give advertisers the opportunity to connect and engage with consumers," he added, "if they'll enhance the viewing experience."
"Without a viewer," he added, "you don't have much to give an advertiser."

HEADLINE: Still Time to Negotiate Missile Defense, U.S. Envoy Says 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton said tonight that "a vast open space" still exists for an agreement with Russia on joint development of a limited defense against ballistic missiles, but that the time for such an accord was running out.
 Mr. Bolton denied, however, that he had issued an unofficial deadline of November for reaching such an agreement. 
 The New York Times reported today, based on excerpts from an interview with a Moscow radio station, that Mr. Bolton had indicated the United States would declare its intention to withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty unless Russia agreed to changes by November. 
The missile defense system comes into conflict with the treaty, which effectively bans the deployment of a nationwide defense against incoming missiles.
At a news conference tonight, Mr. Bolton, the State Department's senior arms-control official, called the account mistaken. "I did not say that to the Russians," he said, "and I would not have said it in an interview."
In that interview, broadcast tonight on the Echo Moscow news radio station, Mr. Bolton nevertheless made it clear that American research into missile-defense systems was approaching the strict limits imposed by the 1972 treaty, and that it would not stop when those limits are reached.
And he repeated the White House's insistence that it would exercise its right to withdraw from the agreement unilaterally "at some point in the not-too-distant future," unless Moscow agreed to a new arms-control framework.
The White House has never defined explicitly when that not-too-distant future will arrive, saying instead that it is talking in terms "of months, not years." Asked tonight what that meant, Mr. Bolton replied, "By definition, I think, 'months less than years' means 23 months or less."
Some Russian officials have said they expect an American declaration of intent to quit the treaty, which requires six months' notice, as soon as this November, when President Vladimir V. Putin is scheduled to visit President Bush at his Crawford, Tex., ranch.
Those expectations have been buttressed by the announcement that the Pentagon intends to start building missile silos at a test site south of Fairbanks, Alaska, as early as next April, or roughly six months after the Texas meeting.
Although the treaty allows construction of certain land-based missile-defense sites -- one has existed outside Moscow for decades -- some experts say continued construction in Alaska could be construed as a violation of the accord.
In the radio interview, Mr. Bolton said he believed that "the two presidents would be disappointed in us if we didn't have something for them to consider when they get together in Texas."
"But we don't -- also consider it an artificial deadline, and we're going to try and make as much progress as we can and we'll see what happens," he said. "The real issue, I think, is the deepening of the political and economic conversations between the two governments, and that alone would be substantial progress. But we'll just have to see what happens by November."
The United States and Russia have been at loggerheads over the need for and purpose of a limited missile-defense system since the idea first gained steam late in President Bill Clinton's second term. Mr. Bolton, who is here to prepare for later talks between Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, indicated today that the two sides had narrowed some differences but that their basic positions remained unchanged.
The Kremlin argues that building a missile-defense system will undermine global security by destroying the basic premise of arms control: the logic that no nation will attack another if it is unable to defend itself against the inevitable counterstrike.
That may be true of superpowers with hundreds or thousands of warheads, the White House says. But it contends that some shield is urgently needed against smaller volleys -- accidental launching of nuclear missiles by major powers, or sneak missile attacks by so-called rogue states such as North Korea or Libya.
Mr. Bolton said 27 nations already have the capacity to build or launch ballistic missiles, and that that number will only grow.
Tonight he said a summer of intensive talks had narrowed the gap on at least a few missile-defense issues. In particular, he said, Russian experts no longer reject outright the American rationale that the world is at risk from rogue states brandishing nuclear- or chemical-tipped missiles.
"In fact, I'd say the opposite," he said. "What some of them said during the consultations just concluded was that they thought Russia might be at greater risk from some of them than the United States. And given the geographic proximity of states like Iran, I think that's a fair assessment on their part."
Mr. Bolton said the two sides also agreed today to elevate from bureaucratic to political levels their efforts to control the spread of mass-destruction weapons and to regulate "dual-use" exports, devices and technologies with both peaceful and military applications.
And he called it "a small sign of progress" that they had begun to discuss the underlying arguments for and against a joint missile-defense effort rather than the merits and demerits of the treaties and covenants that currently prohibit it.
But despite what he described as an avalanche of data given the Russians about American missile-defense thinking, the Kremlin position remains that the Antiballistic Missile Treaty isn't broken, and does not need fixing.
"They didn't say anything specific on the defensive weapons side other than acknowledging, as I said, the clear treaty provision that allows us to withdraw," he said.
Despite that seemingly unequivocal rejection, Mr. Bolton suggested, the Russian position does not lack wiggle room. Between rejecting the mutual abrogation of the 1972 treaty and rejecting the United States's unilateral withdrawal, he said, "there's a vast open space that we're willing to sit and listen and discuss."
But not for long.
"We're the State Department," he said. "We'll talk, and we're happy to do it. But the operational track, the ongoing work of testing and developing the ballistic missile defense architecture is proceeding. 
"And this is not a situation where the talking is going to interrupt the operational work."

HEADLINE: Despite Aid, Argentina Will See More Pain 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
The Argentine government told a weary population today that even deeper cuts in spending and more national sacrifice are in the offing, despite an emergency rescue agreement it signed with the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday.
 With unemployment surging, currency reserves dropping, tax revenues plummeting and credit virtually impossible to obtain, that was not the news Argentines hoped to hear after their government spent nearly two weeks weeks in tough negotiations with the I.M.F. Furthermore, the forecast of more severe austerity was accompanied by predictions that this is, as one newspaper here put it this morning, the country's "last chance, really." 
 Though President Fernando de la Rua told the country's 36 million people late Tuesday that "we should all be happy" with the new accord, reaction here today was mixed. Markets responded with cautious approval, with stocks rising 8 percent in light trading. But political parties, unions and other groups expressed skepticism about the latest effort to pull the country out of a three-year recession and prevent a default on $128 billion in debt. 
The Argentine press had been talking, perhaps unrealistically, of a much larger lifeline, up to $15 billion to supplement a $39.7 billion deal negotiated with international creditors last December. What the country got instead was a more modest $5 billion now and another $3 billion to be dispensed if Argentina made sufficient progress in what was described today as a "voluntary debt swap" with its creditors.
"This is a financial umbrella to help weather the storm that Argentina has been going through in recent weeks," said Martin Redrado, chief economist for Fundacion Capital, an economic policy research group. 
At a news conference here early this evening, the minister of the economy, Domingo Cavallo, provided no details of how the debt swap would work, urged Argentines to have faith in the battered banking system and in the government, but promised no quick improvements. "It is not an easy solution, what we have to achieve," he said.
Mr. Cavallo argued, as he has consistently for months, that the success or failure of the government's plan to right the economy ultimately depends on complying with the promise of "zero deficit" made to the I.M.F. That, in turn, involves cutting government salaries and pensions by at least 13 percent and restructuring inefficient government agencies.
But putting the agreement into effect is contingent on congressional approval of a series of austerity measures. And with the de la Rua government appearing vulnerable and riven by internal differences, that endorsement is by no means assured.
"When things get complicated, they come asking us for support," complained Carlos Ruckhauf, the Peronist governor of Buenos Aires Province. "Enough is enough. De la Rua is the one who is governing, we are the opposition." 
Jose Luis Gioja, the Peronist Party's leader in the Senate added that "there is not the slightest possibility that we are going to vote for the government's fiscal adjustment norms."
From a political point of view, the timing of the agreement could hardly be worse. Congressional elections are scheduled for Oct. 14, with people irate at the travails they are being asked to endure and eager to punish those they view as responsible.
"Argentina must show it is capable now of carrying out commitments that have remarkable demands when the government is facing a probable electoral defeat in the legislative elections," said Rosendo Fraga, a leading political commentator. "On top of that, government candidates in the main districts are beginning their campaigns by proposing a 'reprogramming' of the foreign debt with a discourse that appears to be more that of the opposition." 
In another sign of the difficulties the government must confront, thousands of teachers and doctors protesting the planned budget and salary cuts marched on the presidential palace today, carrying banners denouncing the government's "submission" to the I.M.F. and the United States. 
But Felipe Noguera, a leading political analyst here, dismissed those efforts and opposition threats as mere "brinksmanship" that will not prove successful. "The idea of zero deficit, the notion that the government shouldn't spend more than it collects, is now firmly installed in Argentina," Mr. Noguera said. 
"This is an idea that has won acceptance in media, intellectual and political leadership circles, and I don't see much space available to promote any deviation from it."
But both in and out of government, there is lingering resentment of Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill of the United States for the unusually harsh criticisms he made recently of Argentina. 
In an interview with The Economist last month, Mr. O'Neill said that Argentina has "been off and on in trouble for 70 years or more," has no export industry and that "they like it that way. Nobody forced them to be the way they are."
Angel Rozas, a provincial governor and vice president of the ruling party rejected Mr. O'Neill's sentiments, saying on Monday: "We are making a tremendous effort, with a great deal of suffering. This should be recognized."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rise on Semiconductor Study and Profit Forecasts

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks rallied yesterday as investors bet that positive comments from some companies could mean the economy was finally bottoming and the worst might be over.
 Semiconductor stocks were among the day's standouts, rising sharply after an industry report provided hope that the demand for chips might be starting to recover. 
 The rally came a day after the Federal Reserve's seventh cut in interest rates this year, leading some analysts to say the market activity resembled the trading that occurred the previous two times that the central bank reduced interest rates. In May and June, stocks initially retreated after the Fed's announcements, as they did Tuesday, only to rally on the following day. 
"Going home last night everybody -- traders, clients -- who I spoke to all expected a bounce-back today," said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "We're going to continue to get this type of very choppy action because it's very heavily dominated by traders. Investors are sitting on their hands or on vacation."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.76 points, or 1 percent, to close at 10,276.90. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 28.71 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,860.01. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index picked up 8.05 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,165.31. 
Semiconductor stocks were bolstered after Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, an industry association, said that orders for chip-making equipment were stronger in July than expected and that the ratio of future orders to booked shipments had improved. That led some investors to think the sector may have hit bottom.
Xilinx rose $2.52, to $39; KLA-Tencor was up $2.44, to $48.79; Novellus Systems gained $2.38, to $46.78; and National Semiconductor rose $1.91, to $32.03. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor stock index rose 27.72 points, or 5.2 percent, to close at 564.75.
General Motors led several companies in giving positive outlooks. G.M. rose $1.50, to $57.20, after it said it would meet its financial goals for the third quarter and its production outlook for 2001. And TriQuint Semiconductor said its second-half sales and earnings would meet targets. 
Other bright spots on the Dow included Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which rose $2.66, to $109.81; I.B.M., which gained $2.07, to $103.96; Eastman Kodak, which was up $1.08, to $45.74; and Alcoa, which rose 76 cents, to $38.16.
Helping lead the Nasdaq higher yesterday was Intuit, which increased $6.59, to $36.04. Late Tuesday, the company reported a loss smaller than Wall Street's estimates.
AOL Time Warner fell 40 cents, to $39.50, after it said it would cut more than 1,200 jobs at America Online, the company's Internet unit.
Investors largely ignored the day's only economic news from the government. The Labor Department said the number of American workers who were dismissed from their jobs rose almost 44 percent in the second quarter of 2001, compared with the period a year earlier.
Some analysts said yesterday's gains reflected little more than momentary excitement that would abate as companies prepared for another round of earnings forecasts that are expected to be disappointing. Other analysts said the day's modest rally foreshadowed better days as the economy began to digest fiscal policy moves and the Fed's monetary policy took effect.
"We're starting to get more information that the economy may have actually bottomed out already in the second quarter," said Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist at A. G. Edwards & Sons. "We're going to see more and more tidbits of information that suggest that inventory corrections are going to occur at a slower pace and, even though consumer spending is lower than it was a year or so ago, it's going to continue to be positive. And we're also going to see some slowing in the declines."
The result, he said, is that "the whole picture is going to start to look a little bit more attractive."
 --------------------

Treasury Prices Decline
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as stocks rebounded, prompting investors to reverse large purchases of government securities made in the previous session after the Federal Reserve's seventh interest rate cut this year.
 The 10-year Treasury note fell 9/32, to a price of 100 27/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.89 percent from 4.86 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2/32, to 99 5/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.43 percent.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
I.M.F. Aid Package Buoys the Argentine Markets, for Now

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Investors responded favorably, but cautiously, yesterday to the $8 billion aid package for Argentina announced by the International Monetary Fund, with bond and stock prices rising across Latin America.
 But some analysts said the aid only bought Argentina some time and failed to squelch the prospect of more drastic measures -- including a restructuring of debt. 
 "Unless this miraculously leads to a revival of economic activity, the fear is going to remain that the debt burden is too onerous" for Argentina, said Geoffrey Dennis, Latin American equity strategist for Salomon Smith Barney. The new package "does nothing directly to improve the economic outlook." 
Argentina has been in a recession for three years, and some analysts argued yesterday that the steep spending cuts required for the aid package would make the slump worse.
Jose M. Barrionuevo, director for emerging markets strategy and economics at BNP Paribas, said Argentina needed much more financial assistance and that it would be difficult to avoid write-offs, or reductions in what Argentina owed investors.
There has been no formal talk of write-offs, sometimes called haircuts on Wall Street. The threat of such losses, however, could encourage investors, including some American banks, to join a voluntary effort aimed at reducing Argentina's debt. The I.M.F.'s announcement referred to a voluntary effort but no details will be available for some time. Analysts said that at this time they did not expect the proposal to include any haircut.
The possibility of losses down the road "puts pressure on people" to negotiate, said Ernest W. Brown, head of fixed-income and economics research at Santander Central Hispano Investment Securities. "But you have to put a lot of pressure on people to get them to participate."
Peter Marber, president of the Trust Company of the Atlantic, a money manager in Greenwich, Conn., who owns Argentine debt, said, "I don't think anyone has talked about a haircut yet." But, he added, "the debt has already essentially been haircut by the market."
Despite a big rally yesterday, an index of Argentine bonds has plunged almost 25 percent since its high in February.
The $8 billion pledge, which won the endorsement of the Bush administration, improves the short-term outlook for Argentina. There is no immediate threat of default on the country's $130 billion in debt or of a devaluation of its currency, which is tied to the dollar.
Investor relief sent Argentine stocks soaring yesterday, with the Merval index up 8.1 percent. The price of the closely watched floating-rate bond maturing in 2005 jumped 13.9 percent as the interest rate fell to 22.5 percent, still very high but below the peak of 36.6 percent in mid-July.
In Brazil, which has suffered the most from its neighbor's financial problems, stocks gained just 0.5 percent and finished below their highs of the day. But the Brazilian currency, the real, rallied, rising 1.2 percent against the dollar. The real has fallen almost 22 percent this year, intensifying Brazil's financial problems so much that the Bush administration and the I.M.F. approved a $15 billion loan early this month.
In Mexico, the stock market and the currency, the peso, moved modestly higher.
Investors remain wary about Argentina and the possible fallout from its woes on other emerging markets, although the ripple effects have been relatively contained so far. Argentina has a long way to go in its economic plan, which calls for eliminating the federal government's deficit. And with the United States, Europe and Japan all mired in slowdowns, Argentina may have real trouble turning its economy around, as it needs to do to achieve its goal.
"Argentina will continue to be a reason for investors who do not want to own emerging markets not to own them," said Philip Ehrmann, who oversees Pacific and emerging markets at Gartmore Investment Management in London.
One difficulty in gauging Argentina's outlook is that many details of the new program are still unclear. The key, analysts said, is what Argentina will do to reduce its debt burden. Horst Kohler, the managing director of the I.M.F., referred to such an effort when he said in a statement Tuesday, "The authorities are also considering the possibility of a voluntary and market-based operation to increase the viability of Argentina's debt profile."
Analysts said they expected such a deal to be like the debt swap Argentina did in June, when $29.5 billion of shorter-term debt was exchanged for longer-term debt, postponing million of dollars of interest payments. Such a swap would probably include some guarantee of interest or principal or both that would make the exchange more attractive, they speculated.
Mr. Barrionuevo of BNP Paribas said such a swap would probably be used for Argentina's domestic debt, whose interest and principal payments were the priority matter. 
While postponing interest and principal payments does reduce immediate income for investors, the swap could ease Argentina's financial problems. Investors could then find themselves holding new bonds rising in value, offsetting their loss of immediate income. And investors' principal would be preserved.
The American banks with hefty exposure in Latin America include FleetBoston, Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Bernstein analysts, however, said they did not expect the recession in Argentina or the recent plunge in the value of the Brazilian real to have a major effect on the banks' earnings.

HEADLINE: Full-Employment Prisons 

 BODY:
A recent Times article about the economic woes of upstate New York towns dependent on prisons raises a nagging little fear about the future of criminal justice reform. As crime has been falling and jailhouse populations stabilizing, towns that believed a prison was a recession-proof industry are beginning to worry about layoffs. Advocates who found it difficult enough to convince state legislators that drug treatment is better than incarceration for low-level offenders are wondering if they will also have to fight the perception that a vote for reform is a vote for unemployment. 
 New York State's Rockefeller drug laws, which mandate long prison terms for nonviolent drug offenders, have persisted since 1973 despite an overwhelming consensus that they are inhumane and expensive, clogging the prison system with people who should be in drug treatment. They have been hard to overturn mainly because state legislators fear making changes that could tag them as soft on crime. In addition, prosecutors, who in effect determine a defendant's sentence when they file charges, do not want to turn this influence over to judges, who would have more sentencing discretion if the Rockefeller laws were rescinded. 
 But economic issues may start looming large, too, particularly for influential upstate Republicans. Nearly one-third of the people in New York's prisons are serving time for Rockefeller drug offenses. A new prison brings a depressed community hundreds of jobs in the facility and around it. Prisons, in fact, are the chief employer in many parts of upstate New York, and a position as a guard pays better than many other jobs.
New York's prisons are built almost exclusively upstate in part because land and labor are significantly cheaper than in the New York City area. But they are also welcomed by upstate areas desperate for jobs. State Senator Dale Volker, who calls himself "the keeper of the keys" for his control of the process that allocates new prisons, said in an interview that legislators competed to get prisons. "No one thought it was a panacea, but they know prisons are helpful," he said.
Mr. Volker heads the Senate's Codes Committee, and Michael Nozzolio, another senator with a prison-heavy upstate district, leads the Crime Committee. Both men have been influential in quashing challenges to the Rockefeller drug laws. While senators and their aides deny that fear of losing prison population affects their support for the mandatory sentences, it is appropriate to wonder whether economics plays an indirect role.
The connection between prisons and local economies crops up in other ways. The government counts inmates as residents of their prison's town, adding clout to upstate communities and taking it away from cities competing for government services. This is especially important during a redistricting year.
New York's drug-driven prison expansion, while providing jobs to largely white upstate communities, has devastated black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the cities. Though most drug users are white, 94 percent of the people jailed for drug offenses are black or Hispanic. These inmates, their families and communities suffer when the state chooses long prison terms for these offenders rather than drug treatment. In addition, inmates serve their sentences in prisons far from their families, weakening ties that help prisoners stay clean after their release. New York's drug policies are costly, ineffective and unfair. It would be tragic if reform was postponed further because these policies benefit a few influential communities.

HEADLINE: Office Rents Decrease Sharply 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Office rents in the United States registered their biggest decline in nine years in the second quarter, as companies laid off workers and reined in expansion plans amid a slowing economy, a study released today showed. 
 Rents in downtown areas of cities fell an average of 3.2 percent from the first quarter, according to the study by the National Real Estate Index of San Francisco, a unit of CB Richard Ellis Services, a big commercial property broker. 
In the suburbs, rents fell 2.2 percent. 
 The declines came after rent levels rose to records in markets like San Francisco, Boston and New York in 2000.
The office vacancy rate rose to 10.8 percent, the highest in four years. 
"This definitely would appear to be a change in the overall commercial real estate market," said Jack Doyle, property research manager at the index. "This data puts a tangible face on the country's economic slowdown." 
The decline is the biggest since downtown office rents fell 3.7 percent in the second quarter of 1992, Mr. Doyle said, adding that even so, rents were still up 2.3 percent over the last 12 months. 
The declines were stark in California, where downtown area rents fell 6.2 percent, led by a drop of 14 percent in San Francisco and 8 percent in San Jose, reflecting the severe contraction in technology industry employment. In California suburbs, rents dropped 7.1 percent.
In the Northeast, rents declined 2.1 percent in downtown areas and 1.6 percent in the suburbs.

PERSON: Richard A. Cloward 

HEADLINE: Richard Cloward, Welfare Rights Leader, Dies at 74 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE FLANDERS 

 BODY:
Richard A. Cloward, a sociologist and social activist who was an architect of the welfare rights movement and the co-author of a groundbreaking critique of the welfare state as a tool for containing social unrest, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74.
 The cause of death was lung cancer, said his wife, Frances Fox Piven, a professor of political science at the City University of New York. 
 Dr. Cloward wrote "Regulating the Poor: The Functions of Public Welfare" in 1971 with Dr. Piven, his frequent collaborator. 
A faculty member at the Columbia University School of Social Work from 1954 until his death, Dr. Cloward won numerous awards for his teaching and academic work, but he was equally well known for his efforts to influence social policy through grass-roots organizing and lobbying among the poor. 
Dr. Cloward first achieved recognition with "Delinquency and Opportunity," a study of juvenile delinquency that he wrote with Lloyd Ohlin, a colleague at Columbia, in 1960. In it they argued that delinquency among very poor inner-city youths was a rational reaction to limited economic opportunities. 
They tried to put this "opportunity theory" into practice on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, with the creation of a project called Mobilization for Youth to help youth gang members on their own terms. It quickly became a model for many federal programs under the auspices of the Johnson administration's war on poverty. 
Dr. Cloward met his wife at Mobilization for Youth. She was his co-author and collaborator for the rest of his career. 
Perhaps their most controversial writing was an article published in The Nation magazine in 1966, calling for "a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the rolls" as a means of forcing radical welfare reform. The article helped to foster the emergence of a more militant welfare rights movement, including the occupation of welfare offices in many cities and other acts of civil disobedience. 
Critics have since argued that by encouraging both the expansion in the welfare rolls and the militancy that went with it, Dr. Cloward and Dr. Piven helped contribute to a political backlash against the welfare system and the decline of middle-class support for programs to help the poor. 
But when asked about it in later years, Dr. Cloward was unapologetic. 
"We knew that trouble was coming," he said in 1998 in an interview in The New York Times. "Our view is the poor don't win much, and they only win it episodically. You get what you can when you can get it." 
Richard Andrew Cloward was born on Dec. 25, 1926, in Rochester, the son of a radical Baptist minister, Donald Cloward, and his wife, an artist, who was known as Esther Fleming. He went to the Columbia University School of Social Work in 1949 to pursue graduate work in sociology, earning his master's and doctoral degrees, and joined the faculty there in 1954. 
In "Regulating the Poor," Dr. Cloward and Dr. Piven analyzed the history of relief and public welfare systems, arguing that periodic rises in the welfare rolls helped the state to moderate disorder among poorer groups. In times of relative economic and political stability, the rolls would be shrunk to ensure a steady supply of low-wage labor for employers. In downturns, they said that the rolls would be deliberately expanded to prevent social disorder. Both controversial and entirely original, the book is still required reading for students of American politics and social policies, even as the analysis within it has remained well outside the political mainstream.
In the Reagan era of the 1980's, Dr. Cloward and Dr. Piven wrote several books that warned of a growing attack on the welfare state and drew attention to the decline of organized labor, including "The New Class War," published in 1982. 
They also focused more and more on mass voter registration as a means of maintaining support for policies to help the poor, forming an organization, Human Serve (Human Service Employees Registration and Voters Education) for that purpose. In "Why Americans Don't Vote," published in 1988 and reissued in 2000, they put forward some of the rationale for this strategy.
Under Dr. Cloward's stewardship, the group was later to play a major role in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, known as the Motor Voter Act, which required state governments to permit people to register to vote in welfare agencies as well as in drivers' license bureaus. He and his wife were invited to the White House when President Clinton signed the bill into law. 
"This is the kind of thing social scientists don't very often do," said Herbert Gans, a longtime friend and fellow professor of sociology at Columbia. "They actually invented social programs that became social policy. So he'll be remembered for a very long time after his death." 
Besides his wife, Dr. Cloward is survived by a daughter, Leslie Diamond of Morristown, N.J.; his sons, Kevin, of Cincinnati, and Keith, of Philadelphia; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Religious Arrests Cast a Pall Over Afghanistan Aid Efforts 

BYLINE:  By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
The evidence considered most damning includes Bibles translated into Farsi and Pashto, dozens of video and audio tapes about the life of Jesus and a book entitled "Sharing Your Faith With a Muslim."
 Two weeks ago, 24 aid workers -- 2 Americans, 2 Australians, 4 Germans and 16 Afghans -- were arrested here in this nation's war-ravaged and hunger-racked capital. Some were accused of preaching the Christian Gospel. Others were accused of listening too well. 
 Death may be the punishment for these crimes -- or at least that is what officials from the ruling Taliban militia have announced. In Afghanistan, laws are in constant flux as austere mullahs fine-tune their ideas for creating the world's purest Islamic state. 
"These foreigners were given visas as aid workers, not missionaries," said Abdul Ghafoor Afghani, the Taliban's chief of protocol. "In your country, if I am given a diplomat's visa and I am caught spying, I would not be spared, yes? This is the same."
"We have taken some confessions," he said. "The two American women were caught, as you say, red-handed, in an Afghan's house, where they know they were not to go. They were trying to show a video about Jesus, from his birth to his, what is the word, I think it is crucifixion."
In its fourth year of remorseless drought, in its 22nd year of relentless war, Afghanistan may well be the world's neediest country. The United Nations and hundreds of relief groups provide help that now amounts to more than $300 million a year. But those organizations and the Taliban are often incompatible caretakers, steeped in cultural conflicts and mutual distrust. One dispute follows another, and it seems that when the aid agencies are not threatening to pack it in, the mullahs are threatening to throw them out.
The Taliban are uncomfortable with much of what goes on behind the high walls of the aid workers' compounds: the mingling of unmarried men and women, the beat of rock 'n' roll, the ending of a hard day with a stiff drink. The unseen is often tolerated, though some activities worry the mullahs more than others. Repeatedly, the Taliban have warned against turning Afghan believers into Afghan apostates.
"These laws were well-known to everyone," said Fayaz Shah, head of the United Nations World Food Program in Kabul. "It's like walking in a minefield, and when one blows, you yell, 'Why did this happen?' But you should know. You were in a minefield." 
The arrested aid workers belong to Shelter Now, a German-based group. For months, its Kabul staff had been under the surveillance of the Taliban's whip-wielding religious police from the Department for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. An intensive investigation has been opened, and the authorities have announced the possibility of "a larger conspiracy."
A prime suspect is the World Food Program itself, Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil said on Tuesday. He did not specify how a reliable donor of wheat might be linked to the conversion of Muslims, but the mere mention of such misgivings is a grave matter. The program is the sole source of nourishment for three million Afghans, about 15 percent of the population. Those woebegone people survive on little more than flatbread and weak tea.
The potential of more arrests has left the aid agencies in fear. People say the Shelter Now episode could eventually lead to a huge withdrawal -- or expulsion -- of the agencies. That would be catastrophic for the needy.
That dreadful prospect complicates the moral judgments of aid workers who would ordinarily ache with sympathy for their jailed colleagues. As it is, commiseration often is coupled with anger. Many people here presume that the arrested foreigners were guilty of reckless proselytizing; however well-intentioned the preaching, that forbidden endeavor to save a few dozen souls has imperiled thousands of lives.
"Why did they break the law, especially this law?" asked an American who insisted on anonymity. "Worse yet, they dragged their Afghan workers into this. After some political games, the foreigners will probably be kicked out of the country as their punishment. But the Afghans, I am afraid they are going to be killed."
Peter Schwittek, who runs an aid group that operates schools in mosques, said he once spoke about proselytizing with George Taubmann, a fellow German who heads Shelter Now in Kabul. "If you discuss these things with Mr. Taubmann, he tells you, 'No, we never formally evangelize, but if our staff feels compelled to do so, O.K., but it's not a policy of our agency.' "
The first to be arrested were the two American women, taken away on Aug. 3. Their names are Dana Curry and Heather Mercer, and they are said to be in their mid-20's. Anxious parents have arrived in Pakistan, hoping to get visas to Kabul. Still ahead will be heart-rending details about young and adventurous zealots aspiring to do good deeds.
On Aug. 5, Mr. Taubmann himself was arrested along with dozens of others, including a large assemblage of Afghan children who were later released.
"Some of the Shelter Now people have claimed that all their Christian materials were for personal use," said Mr. Afghani, the chief of protocol, "but I do not believe one needs thousands of audio cassettes to make a study of the Pashto language."
"Of the Afghans, some are said to have been teachers of the others, and to do that I would think they must be considered converts who by Shariat law face execution," he said.
Though the Taliban control nearly all of the country, most of the world declines to recognize them as a legitimate government. In return, the Taliban have now refused the customary right of consular access to the imprisoned foreigners.
On Tuesday, diplomats from the United States, Australia and Germany left Kabul in frustration after a week of fruitless attempts to see their countrymen. They were allowed only to pass on supplies from the aid workers' families: toiletries, writing materials, Oreo cookies, Pringles potato chips and a variety pack of Nature Valley crunchy granola bars.
"There doesn't appear to be a well-defined legal system here, at least for this case," said David T. Donahue, the exasperated American envoy. "We've been told that once the investigation is complete, it will be turned over to Mullah Omar, the supreme leader."
If the reclusive, one-eyed Mullah Muhammad Omar is indeed the last word, he might consult his own Edict No. 14, a July 31 decree concerning the behavior of foreign nationals. It regards "inviting Afghans to any religion apart from Islam" as a less serious offense than "taking photographs of living creatures" or "eating the meat of the pig." Punishment is 3 to 10 days in prison and then expulsion.
But the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is a work in progress, not yet five years old. The rules for behavior are singularly constraining, and yet there always seems more to add. In March, even small boys were commanded to wear turbans to school. In May, two giant statues of Buddha -- an ancient heritage -- were destroyed because they depicted the human form. In June, spectators at soccer matches were ordered to restrict their cheers to the chant "God is great!"
By and large, the Taliban leadership hails from refugee camps, religious schools and villages, and their education has focused on the ideology of jihad and the wisdom of the Koran. For them, governance has been a confounding puzzle.
But now as they grow more accustomed to the reins, they also more resent the independence of the aid groups in their midst. In the past, much of this criticism involved lifestyle. The Taliban thought the aid workers were spendthrifts with donated money, drawing high salaries, driving expensive vehicles, living in large houses.
These days, the Taliban seem as intent on overseeing budgets and planning as behavior. With millions being spent, they want to sign off on projects and look at the books. In a recent interview, Mullah Muhammad Hassan, the powerful governor of Kandahar Province, rebuked the United Nations for squandering money.
"The U.N. is paying $2,156 per tube well, and I can have them dug for $500," he said, rooting through his pockets for the scraps of paper that held his arithmetic.
In May, a beautiful and modern surgical hospital in Kabul closed within weeks of its opening. The builders, the Italian aid group Emergency, shut down to protest a raid by the religious police, who beat up some staff members after finding men and women lunching in the same room. But what has kept the hospital closed since then is a disagreement about whether the Afghan employees must be hired through the Ministry of Public Health.
"This is our country and we want things run with our consultation," said Mullah Muhammad Abbas Stanekzai, the deputy minister of health. 
Kabul is a city of two million people, almost all destitute. In a civil war from 1989 to 1996, as many as seven armies blasted away at one another with artillery and rockets. Now much of the city looks like the detritus of an ancient ruin. At daybreak, the place seems ghostly until squatters lift themselves from the wreckage they use as nightly shelter.
These are people ordinarily grateful to the aid groups and slow to take the Taliban's side in conflicts. But they overwhelmingly support the arrest of the Christians and the jailing of any murtads, Muslims who have deserted their faith. If the price of bread and blankets is denial of the Holy Prophet, they say they would prefer to defiantly perish.
"These people supposedly came here to help the Afghan people, and instead they have used their position to do the dishonorable," said Ahmed, a young man with a beard already lengthy enough for a Biblical epic. "I think these people should die."
A 27-year-old soldier was equally emphatic about his deep beliefs. There is only one religion, he said. God sent Islam to refine the teachings of all other faiths. It is eternity's final word.
He then considered the gloriousness of this knowledge and said he wished to share it with all mankind. "Converting someone to Islam is the greatest thing a person can do," he said. "Such an act is a way to go straight to Heaven."

James D. McCall was one of Wall Street's best stock pickers in the late 1990's, his hand so hot that Merrill Lynch, eager to revive sales of its mutual funds, paid a ransom to his previous employer to win his services. Merrill's brokers proceeded to collect more than $1.5 billion from their clients for Mr. McCall to invest. But in a reversal of fortune, Mr. McCall has compiled one of the worst investment records of the new century with that money. All but about $650 million has been lost, leaving shares that cost many Merrill customers more than $10 each worth slightly more than $2. A1.

U.S. Envoy Says Russia Has Time in Missile Talks
Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton said in Moscow that "a vast open space" still existed for Russia and the United States to agree on joint development of a limited defense system against ballistic missiles, but that the time for reaching such an accord was running out. Mr. Bolton denied that he had issued an unofficial deadline of November for reaching an agreement. He repeated the White House's insistence that it would exercise its right to withdraw from the 1972 ABM Treaty "at some point," unless Moscow agreed to a new arms-control framework. A8

Wariness in Macedonia
NATO said it would send 3,500 troops over the next two weeks to collect weapons from ethnic Albanian guerrillas, but it also acknowledged the deep skepticism among the majority Macedonian Slavs, who say they do not believe the rebels will give up all their arms and fear that NATO will become a permanent presence.

Bush Projections Show Erosion of Budget Surplus
The Bush administration projected that federal budget surpluses outside of the Social Security system would dwindle to almost nothing for the next three or four years before beginning to grow again, largely because of the tax cut passed by Congress this year and the slowdown of the economy. In April, the White House projected a surplus of $122 billion in the non-Social Security system for this fiscal year. A1

Options for Social Security
Richard D. Parsons, co-chairman of President Bush's commission on Social Security, said that the panel had looked at benefit cuts as one means to ensure the program's long-range stability but that no conclusions had been reached on that or anything else. He also said that putting some of a person's Social Security taxes into private investments would not guarantee greater retirement benefits. A14

Helms Announces Retirement
Senator Jesse Helms, 79, Republican of North Carolina, said he would not seek a sixth term in 2002. The race to succeed him is expected to be crowded and may include Elizabeth Dole, a former Republican presidential candidate and cabinet secretary. Former Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., a Democrat who lost to Mr. Helms in 1984, said he would not run. A16

Picking Top Military Chief

HEADLINE: In America; 
A Campaign of Caution

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The four men in gray suits took their seats at the table and waited quietly for the televised debate to begin. Reporters leaned forward -- poison pens poised -- hoping that one of these unfailingly polite men would just lose it, say something outlandish, or maybe snarl at somebody (like a certain mayor we know), and enliven a campaign that so far has been a snooze.
 Aware of the media's insatiable quest for conflict, Mark Green said, "I'll try for a contentious debate." 
 He was joking. Ahead in the polls, Mr. Green is doing all he can to sidestep the ordinary rough-and-tumble of a political campaign. 
New York mayoral races are seldom genteel affairs. Name-calling and mud-slinging are cherished traditions. Fiorello La Guardia was reported to have bragged, "I invented the low blow."
You'd think that with four major Democratic candidates you'd get a brawl that the World Wrestling Federation would envy. But not this time.
Mr. Green and the others, Peter Vallone, Fernando Ferrer and Alan Hevesi, have kept their voices low and their guards high. So at Tuesday's Democratic primary debate, sponsored by The New York Times and New York 1 News, the closest things to a conflict were a few testy exchanges between Mr. Hevesi and his "good friend" Mr. Vallone.
But at the heart of one of those exchanges was a potential problem so serious it could undermine the entire program of the next mayoral administration, whoever wins.
Mr. Hevesi, the city comptroller, expressed reservations about the recently adopted city budget. He said that over the next few years the city would face budget deficits and a ballooning debt service that could "tie our hands in the future."
He complained that there were "substantial difficulties" with the current budget that would make it more difficult to cope with the anticipated effects of a slowing economy.
Mr. Vallone, the City Council speaker, dismissed Mr. Hevesi's concerns and said he resented "the continuing implication that there is something wrong with our budget process." 
Who's right?
Most of the mayoral candidates, including Michael Bloomberg, who is seeking the Republican nomination, have expressed concerns about the downturn in the national economy and its inevitable effect on city revenues. In a recent interview with The Times, Mr. Bloomberg said, "The outlook for at least the next few years is not one that should give you comfort that the city is going to be able to do everything."
Mr. Hevesi, in a report on the recently adopted budget, said, "The city has failed to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the remarkably good recent economic times to plan and prepare for the less favorable economic climate that may lie ahead."
Mr. Green, in an interview yesterday, said that "no one is smart enough to know" how far the economy would skid. But he has already drawn up contingency plans for a targeted hiring freeze that would shrink the city's labor force through attrition. He said he would exempt teachers, cops and employees at senior centers.
Huge budget gaps, ranging from $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion, are projected for the 2003 to 2005 fiscal period. And Mr. Hevesi has said that current capital spending commitments will lead to a debt service obligation of $5.1 billion in the year 2005. 
The city will soon have to negotiate raises for police officers, teachers and other municipal employees. And a recent round of tax cuts will be phased in over the next few years.
The Citizens Budget Commission, a civic watchdog group, warned early on that the budget, "with its mixture of increased recurring costs and reduced recurring revenues," was not "prudent" -- particularly in light of "the weakening national and local economy." 
The mayoral campaign may be low-keyed, but the issues at hand are as consequential as those in prior, noisier campaigns.
Mr. Vallone said again yesterday that he wasn't worried about the city's fiscal shape. The budget is sound, he said. And if things worsen, cuts can be made without too much difficulty.
"The reality is we had it much tougher 11 years ago," he said. "I cut $2 billion in one month with David Dinkins."

HEADLINE: BUSH PROJECTIONS SHOW SHARP DROP IN BUDGET SURPLUS 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Ending a brief but giddy era of fiscal plenty, the Bush administration released projections today showing that the federal budget surpluses outside the Social Security system will dwindle to almost nothing for the next several years.
 For the current fiscal year, the administration estimated, the government would run a surplus of about $600 million outside Social Security, an almost negligible amount in a $1.9 trillion budget and a $10 trillion economy. As recently as April, the White House projected a surplus of $122 billion in the non-Social Security system for the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. 
 Largely because of the tax cut passed by Congress this year and the economic slowdown, the surpluses outside Social Security will remain tiny for the next three or four years before beginning to grow again, the White House said.
The government will continue to run substantial Social Security surpluses, the administration said, including $157 billion this year. But by agreement of the two parties, that money is off limits for spending or tax cuts and is reserved for reducing the national debt or shoring up the retirement system. 
The sharp turnabout comes just months after both parties were busily making plans for allocating what seemed to be an endless bounty from the prosperity of the late 1990's. It has set up a return to bitter budget battles and efforts by each party to turn the situation to its political advantage.
White House officials sought to cast the news in the best possible light. They said that the country was still in sound financial condition and that an expected economic rebound should put enough money on the table over the next decade to deal with all the nation's priorities, especially if the tighter budget encourages Congress to pare wasteful or inefficient spending.
Despite the economic slowdown, the surplus for this year, including Social Security, will still be the second largest on record, "a phenomenon that should strike all Americans as very positive," said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director. The total surplus last year was $236.9 billion, a record.
Democrats responded that the administration had squandered the surplus by pushing through an irresponsibly large tax cut, putting the government into such a squeeze that not only Democratic initiatives but Mr. Bush's own agenda, including a big increase in military spending, would be impossible to carry out.
"I believe President Bush's campaign promises are unraveling," said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "He claimed we could afford his massive tax cut, a major defense buildup, more money for education, while paying down the debt and protecting Social Security and Medicare. He was wrong."
In its midyear review of the budget outlook, the White House projected that the non-Social Security surplus would be $1 billion to $6 billion for the next three years before increasing to $19 billion in 2005 and then growing steadily for the rest of the decade.
But the administration was able to show a non-Social Security surplus for the next few years only by making assumptions and policy changes that Democrats attacked as gimmicks. 
They included a shift in the way the government accounts for Social Security revenues, economic growth assumptions that Democrats said were too optimistic and a decision not to include in the calculations the cost of tax and spending decisions that Congress is all but certain to make in coming months and years.
The new projections from the White House's Office of Management and Budget showed that the government would run a total budget surplus for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 of $157.8 billion, of which $157.1 billion would come from Social Security. 
The surplus for next year, the administration projected, would be $173 billion, with $1 billion coming from outside Social Security. The total surplus in 2003 would be $195 billion, with $2 billion coming from outside Social Security.
If those figures prove correct, it will mean that the government will spend nearly all of the surplus generated by part of the Medicare system, money that Democrats and most Republicans in Congress had also sought to put off limits. The Medicare surplus this year is about $30 billion.
The administration projected a gradual improvement in the fiscal outlook over the rest of the decade. The total surplus for the next decade should be $3.1 trillion, the White House said, compared with a projection of $5.6 trillion earlier this year, before the tax cut and the economic slowdown. 
It said the non-Social Security surplus for the next decade should be $575 billion, compared with a projection of $3.1 trillion at the beginning of the year. The 10-year projection for the Social Security surplus was largely unchanged, at $2.5 trillion.
The Congressional Budget Office is scheduled to release its own updated surplus forecast next week. Members of each party said it might show the government crossing the line into spending Social Security surpluses. 
The situation holds opportunity and peril for the administration and Republicans in Congress.
To some degree, the administration's goal in pursuing the $1.35 trillion tax cut was to get as much of the surplus as possible out of Washington so that Congress could not spend it. 
Eliminating nearly all of the non-Social Security surplus limits the ability of Democrats -- or Republicans for that matter -- to propose big new spending programs. It also makes it easier for the administration to demand a re-examination of spending on programs that it opposes on policy grounds or judges to be ineffective.
"The budget is tight, and that's exactly what we designed and exactly what we wanted," said Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. 
But the budget may be so tight that Mr. Bush's own plans will be among the first to suffer. Mr. Conrad and Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said they would oppose Mr. Bush's request for an $18 billion increase in military spending next year.
The president's plans for the Pentagon may also face problems in the Republican-controlled House. Mr. Nussle said he was "very troubled" by the White House's military spending request because it was not backed up by a detailed review of the Pentagon's long-term needs.
Members of each party said Mr. Bush might have trouble obtaining money for his education and energy plans and would find it more difficult to finance creation of private investment accounts within Social Security.
More broadly, the administration is at risk of being blamed for blowing the surplus, a contention that Democrats are turning into a battle cry as they prepare for the the 2002 election.
The administration is clearly aware of its political vulnerability. In calculating its new budget projections, it made several policy decisions and assumptions that had the effect of increasing the surplus and decreasing the risk of dipping into Social Security money, especially this year and next year.
It assumed that economic growth next year would rebound to 3.2 percent, at the high end of what private economists predict. It changed a longtime accounting convention in Social Security, allocating higher-than-expected payroll tax revenues to the books for previous fiscal years rather than counting them toward the results for the year in which they were discovered.
In calculating the current year's non-Social Security surplus, the administration assumed that corporations would pay $4 billion to $5 billion of taxes earlier than necessary, raising revenues for this year by that amount. 
Perhaps most important, the White House included in its budget assumptions all of the nearly $200 billion for increased military spending over the next decade that Mr. Bush has proposed, but it did not account for the costs of other programs that are moving through Congress, or for his own plans for a national missile defense. 
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, said the cost of all the programs now in the legislative pipeline would be at least $800 billion over 10 years, more than wiping out the $575 billion non-Social Security surplus that the administration predicted would be available during that period.

HEADLINE: Turbine Maker Outlook 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Capstone Turbine lowered its third-quarter and full-year sales forecast yesterday, driving its shares down nearly 30 percent to a 52-week low. 
 The company, based in Chatsworth, Calif., said sales for its 30-kilowatt and 60-kilowatt power generators would be substantially lower than had been forecast because of the economic slowdown. 
Capstone did not provide detailed figures. 
 Capstone set a sales goal in late July of 600 units for the third quarter. 
Namrita Kapur, an analyst with Adams, Harkness & Hill, said: "The market does not like uncertainty.
"It is always better to have figures because people expect the worst. And maybe this is a signal of just how bad things are." 
Ms. Kapur added that Wall Street's revenue and earnings estimates for Capstone were still too high and should come down soon. 
Capstone's turbines, about the size of two large washing machines, are similar to jet-engine turbines and are fueled most commonly with natural gas. They provide enough energy to keep the light on at a small business or the computers operating in an office. 
The turbines cost $30,000 to $55,000, about 50 percent more than an equivalently powered diesel generator, but they emit less pollution and require less maintenance. 
The shares dropped $2.07, to $5.18. That is off from a 52-week high of $98.50 last August.

HEADLINE: Librarians Adjust Image In an Effort To Fill Jobs 

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Dana Garzolini frequently turns heads when she is on the job in the Chicago public libraries.
 " 'You don't look like a librarian,' " Ms. Garzolini says people tell her. " 'It doesn't fit you at all.' " 
 Ms. Garzolini does seem like a typical 26-year-old, though. 
"I like to go out to eat," she said. "I like to go to bars. I like to travel. Pretty much, I'm up for anything. I consider myself very adventurous."
That is the image library administrators want to project as they try to lure young people to fill what could soon be thousands of vacant jobs as older librarians retire and the private sector beckons.
In a Web site promoting a campaign by the American Library Association, librarians ride Harleys, surf and skateboard. They are young and hip. They wear dreadlocks and practice yoga. And like Ms. Garzolini, they are known to enjoy an occasional night at a bar. There is a cook and caterer, a "popular culture junkie" who started a hip-hop program for the Cleveland library and a "surfer dude" who owns a record company.
Colleges and universities are turning out more library and information science graduates than ever, the association says, but public libraries must compete with the growing number of higher paying jobs in the private sector, a formidable competitor even with the economy slowing.
At the same time, the need for public, school and academic librarians is growing. The association's president, John W. Berry, said that in the next 12 years, nearly half of the approximately 125,000 fully qualified librarians in the nation would retire. 
In June 2000, at the annual conference of the American Library Association, only 481 job seekers showed up for 1,000 posted openings. At an association conference in January, only 260 people showed up for 813 postings, officials said.
Already a small number of libraries have begun using recruiting videos and even a Web site. Officials at the association say their Web site is part of a five-year campaign, begun in April, that is likely to include public service advertisements. 
Even the phrases used in the promotion, called "The 21st Century Librarians," cast the profession in a new light, with librarians seen as "ambassadors," "teachers," "linguists," "technology experts" and "human search engines." 
"It's time for us to work on advocating for libraries to change the image," said one of the "21st Century Librarians," Veronda Pitchford, an African-American librarian in Chicago who wears dreadlocks, enjoys in-line skating, practices yoga and listens to eclectic music. "I want little kids to know that this is an option. I want little girls to see me."
Ms. Pitchford, 30, said that even in an age when computers may be leading children to forget the human touch of a librarian, there is no substitute. 
"When I say that we're the ultimate search engine," she said, "I'm not joking."
From New England to Los Angeles, the shortage has left scores of libraries understaffed or staffed by less-qualified workers. The library association requires that professional librarians earn a master's degree in library and information sciences, which some prospective students deem too costly for a job that pays less than other professions. The mean salary for beginning librarians is $32,891, the association says. 
Leigh Estabrook, a professor at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign said about 20 percent of the school's graduates get jobs outside libraries. 
"The competition is not just financial, that business and Microsoft pays a lot better than most public libraries, for example, but also that some corporate jobs, nonlibrary jobs, offer our students opportunities to get in on the ground floor and develop new things," Professor Estabrook said.
But while the number of library and information sciences graduates continues to rise nationally, to 4,472 in 1999 from 2,975 in 1981, the association says, it is not likely to soon remedy the shortage.
"Even with more grads," Professor Estabrook said, "the demographics of people retiring does mean that for a certain period of time, there will be a real trough in libraries." 
Many libraries have been trying to recruit from their own support staffs, offering tuition vouchers and support for employees who want to become librarians. 
The hope is that they will follow in the footsteps of those like Tyrone Ward, 48, now a manager at a West Side branch of the Chicago Public Library system who began work as a literacy coordinator, then went back to school to earn a master's degree in a program partly financed by the city and the library.
As an African-American man, whose assistant is also a black man, Mr. Ward says he can influence African-American children.
"When they see the two of us, just seeing it is enough for young black males to see their place," he said. 
"The schoolmarmish librarian, with the reading glasses and the sort of long dress and long skirt with the bun hair was a wonderful lady, very loving and very devoted to her work," Mr. Ward added. "But her day is long gone. The stereotype has more life than she does."
Mr. Ward is an avid jazz fan, a book collector who enjoys traveling and jogging along the shores of Lake Michigan in the cool of a summer's evening. Still, some images die hard. 
When people learn that he is a librarian, "the response is kind of lukewarm, especially when I'm talking to ladies," Mr. Ward said. "There seems to be a gleam in their eyes, and it dims ever so slightly."
But even that is changing. Recently, Ms. Garzolini sat with co-workers in a conference room at the Harold Washington Library in downtown Chicago, chatting and pondering the new day for librarians. 
"I think that the American Library Association should run a campaign that librarians are hot," one librarian said.
They all laughed. 
"A calendar maybe?" another woman said, laughing.
Well, maybe not.

HEADLINE: Tennessee's Fiscal Troubles Grow After Futile Push for Income Tax 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
It was only two years ago that Tennessee was considered a model of good financial management, one of only nine states whose governments had top-drawer credit ratings from all the rating agencies and the envy of Southeastern states struggling to modernize.
 But that was before a slowing economy gutted its revenue, which was vulnerable because of an almost total reliance on the volatile sales tax. Now Tennessee's fiscal reputation has fallen even further than those of the large group of other states struggling to balance their budgets, and deep rifts have been exposed among residents and legislators over the proper role of state government in lean times. 
 Two weeks ago, after yielding to large crowds at the Capitol here protesting a proposed income tax, legislators could balance the budget only by spending all the state's remaining $560 million share of the national settlement with the tobacco industry; most other states are using their settlement windfalls for health purposes and preventing tobacco use. 
Almost immediately, the rating agencies sharply downgraded the state's credit, warning that Tennessee must plot a course back to fiscal responsibility if it expects to borrow money in the future. Schools now worry about finding money for building projects, and a few districts were so short of cash they had to open several days late this year. Money for health care and mental health programs is likely to be slashed, and state colleges and universities have raised their tuition 15 percent.
"We are suddenly in a very precarious position," said C. Warren Neel, the state commissioner of finance. "The revenues of this year's budget could fall short, and our rainy-day fund needs to be much higher. If we don't change the structure of our tax system, we are going to be at the mercy of lawsuits from people who need our services, and we'll gradually lose our ability to govern ourselves. We'll be like Alabama."
Being like Alabama, frankly, is not the way Tennesseans have traditionally seen themselves. The state always had a reputation for being better educated and more economically vibrant than its neighbors farther south. But now, with dozens of states struggling to balance their budgets, it has found itself hit even harder than most, because, unlike 41 states, it cannot rely on the cushion of an income tax.
Nearly three-fourths of its revenue comes from its 6 percent sales tax. This was enough in the days when Tennessee had a mostly manufacturing and agricultural economy, with actual goods to tax. But as the state moved more heavily into untaxable services, sales tax revenue began to slip, particularly with so much commerce taking place on the Internet, where taxes cannot reach.
The slowing of the economy has magnified the effect. State sales tax collections last month were 2.6 percent lower than at the same time last year, and Mr. Neel's office said that even the current budget, patched together with tobacco-settlement money, was likely to fall short of its goals if the economy remained anemic.
Opponents of the income tax say the sales tax would be perfectly adequate if the state simply cut back on spending for social purposes, particularly the expensive TennCare health insurance program.
"I know that we can find a way to run this state and deliver services in such a way that we remain a low-tax state," said State Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from the Nashville suburb of Brentwood. "All we have to do is hold the line on growth, and that will take care of our budget problems."
The state's aversion to the income tax dates from 1931, when the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that an income tax enacted not long before was unconstitutional. The State Constitution does not specifically prohibit a personal income tax, but neither does it list one among the several taxes it says the state can levy. (It does allow a tax on interest and dividends, which is in effect.)
While a succession of five state attorneys general have said that an income tax would be legal if the legislation was properly worded to comply with the court's concerns, the decades without such a tax have created an immensely passionate popular opposition to it.
Gov. Don Sundquist, who won office in 1994 as a conservative Republican opposed to an income tax, changed his position after his re-election, citing a need to preserve high-quality education and health care programs.
"I did not run for governor to preside over Tennessee's descent into the ranks of the least, the lowest and the last of the 50 states," he said in 1999, after announcing that he would sign an income tax bill if it came to his desk.
But no such bill came, even as Tennessee slid to 48th in the nation in the average amount that residents pay in state taxes, and 48th in per-pupil spending for education.
This year the Democratic-controlled legislature seemed only a few votes shy of passing an income tax plan that would have also reduced the sales tax, but as a vote neared on July 12, Senator Blackburn's office sent an e-mail message to the hosts of a radio talk show, who were quickly able to produce a large anti-tax rally at the Capitol.
While lawmakers were in session, protesters honked horns and banged on the statehouse doors, and one woman broke a window with her fist. Negotiations on the tax fell apart, and the legislature passed a budget that required using the tobacco money.
Calling the budget bill irresponsible, Governor Sundquist vetoed it on July 26. "I believe that this bill is certain to cause our great state irreparable injury," he said, "and puts our state on the path toward disaster."
But less than two weeks later the legislature overrode his veto, and the budget took effect. Many of the protesters claimed victory. Their comments reflect a profound suspicion of those in power, and a reluctance to trust them with a new tax.
"This state has a spending problem, and the budget just keeps growing every year," said David Ivy, a resident of suburban Mount Juliet who was among the crowd at the Capitol in July. "We understand that you have to have taxes to operate this society, but there is a huge amount of waste, and all they say is, 'It's for the children,' and expect us to throw money at it."
But a recent analysis by The Commercial Appeal, the Memphis daily,showed that most of the growth in state spending was mandated by the courts or the federal government and so was outside the discretion of the state. Given that continuing pressure on the budget, many supporters of the income tax believe its adoption is only a matter of time, particularly now that there is no tobacco money left to plug holes.
"It used to be an obscenity to talk about an income tax, and now at least it's a policy choice," said Senator Bob Rochelle, a Democrat from nearby Lebanon who was a leading proponent of the tax in the legislature. "Once people understand the implications of having an unhealthy state government -- fewer people with diplomas, with health care -- I think things will change when this comes up again."

HEADLINE: The Reality Behind the Slogan; 
Saturn Unit, Once a Maverick, Is Looking a Lot More Like G.M

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: SPRING HILL, Tenn., 

 BODY:
General Motors created Saturn 16 years ago as a different kind of car company, a friendly, unconventional brand aimed at Americans for whom Detroit represented a failed past.
 Today, the slogan remains. But behind the scenes, Saturn is getting to be a lot more like the rest of G.M. And, paradoxically, that is proving a boon for Saturn. 
 It turns out that a giant bureaucracy like G.M.'s is a lot more nurturing of an offspring it can control that it ever was of an iconoclast. Consumers, meanwhile, seem not to notice the changes at Saturn -- or not to care -- and Saturn is the only one of G.M.'s eight divisions with a rising market share this year. 
As a quirky subsidiary, run with considerable autonomy here in the verdant rolling country of central Tennessee, Saturn languished for a decade selling the same small-car model and, in the last two years, a bland midsize car originally designed for G.M.'s European operations.
But now Saturn is run, like Chevrolet and Buick, from G.M.'s monolithic headquarters in downtown Detroit. G.M. plans to give the division an entirely new model in each of the next four years, beginning with the car-based Saturn Vue sport utility vehicle late this year. A small car, a midsize car and a minivan will follow.
"G.M. and I are personally committed to getting Saturn the resources they need to grow," said Ronald Zarrella, the company's president for North American auto operations. "The only way we can make Saturn work economically is to leverage the rest of General Motors." Translated, that means more parts are shared with other G.M. vehicles, and workers here no longer play much of a role in the design, engineering and marketing of Saturn cars. The white-collar staffs for these tasks have been moved to Detroit, and their managers now answer to G.M. executives there.
The first president of Saturn, Richard G. LeFauve, reported directly to G.M.'s president. But the current president, Annette Clayton, is little more than a factory manager, reporting to one of the most junior of G.M.'s four dozen vice presidents; the company will not allow her to be interviewed.
Yet assembly line workers continue to collaborate closely with G.M. engineers in figuring out the least expensive, least- error-prone ways to put the parts together. G.M. has also been careful to leave untouched the side of Saturn that most customers notice, like the low-pressure sales tactics at dealerships.
Two weeks ago, when J. D. Power & Associates, a quality consulting firm, released the results of a national survey of consumer satisfaction with car dealerships, Saturn was once again at the very top of the list, ahead of luxury brands like Cadillac, Lexus and Jaguar. 
Dealers tend to agree that the industrial side of the Saturn mystique is far less important. "As long as we continue to take excellent care of the customer, I think that's what the customer is looking for," said Lynn B. Kimmel, a Saturn dealer in Indianapolis. 
The changes have nonetheless upset some of Saturn's original employees. "It's the entire dismantling of the entire Saturn concept -- it's no longer a different kind of car company, and it's no longer a different kind of car," said Michael Bennett, who was the chairman of the United Auto Workers union local at Saturn from 1986 until 1999.
Some on Wall Street share Mr. Bennett's worry that G.M. may be hollowing out Saturn's powerful, if eccentric, image. "The products seem less distinctive; they seem more G.M.-like than they ever were," said John Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch.
"Without some work to define this brand, Saturn is going to have an identity crisis," he added.
Saturn is a small piece of G.M., contributing just 6 percent of overall sales, and its gain of one-tenth of a percentage point in market share among all car brands this year is a result of Saturn's sales slowing less than the rest of the industry's. Auto sales over all are down 4.7 percent this year, versus a 1.6 percent drop for Saturn.
Moreover, Saturn has been losing money, forced to offer discounted loans and leases in a glutted global market for small cars. Car-based sport utilities are in short supply, however -- and are quite profitable -- so G.M. hopes that Saturn can make money soon with the introduction of the Vue.
Some workers here are nostalgic for the days when they stood side by side with engineers, helping choose which auto parts supplier would produce spark plugs or seat springs. But union members voted out Mr. Bennett and his team in February 1999, choosing new leaders who wanted to develop more of an arms-length arrangement with management.
"Early on, we had a lot more autonomy, and that's for sure," said Ron Hankins, the union president at Saturn since 1999. "With it so challenging in the environment that we're in to build a small car in America and make a profit doing it, we just had to find better ways to do that, and be closer to the mother company."
Contributing to G.M.'s willingness to yank Saturn back into the fold has been a change in international business culture.
When Saturn was conceived in 1985, Japan was a widely admired economic power, and small cars were seen as the future of the auto industry. Saturn adopted Japanese manufacturing practices like teamwork, although the cars themselves were marketed as quintessentially American. Like Japanese automakers, Saturn committed itself to never lay off a worker, using business slowdowns, for example, as opportunities to provide extra training.
But with Japan in its second decade of an economic funk, it no longer represents such a powerful model for American manufacturers. The small-car market has shrunk precipitously since Saturn's first car came out in 1990, although it rebounded slightly with the rise in gasoline prices last spring. And the willingness of American companies to lay off workers has gone from being considered a vice to a virtue, at least among business leaders and some economists and government officials.
G.M.'s more hard-headed approach to Saturn now is evident in its dealings with government officials here in Maury County, as the automaker demands a lower tax assessment. "It just seems the new people who are there now are pushing hard," said Ed Harlan, the elected county executive. "I suspect it'll end up in court." 
General Motors is not alone in having undermined Saturn's uniqueness; national U.A.W. leaders also played a role. Before G.M. began building the Saturn L midsize car two years ago at a factory in Wilmington, Del., the automaker asked the union for the same highly flexible labor contract that it has in Spring Hill. But the U.A.W.'s leadership, which had a long-running feud with Mr. Bennett, rejected the request. 
U.A.W. officials declined to discuss Saturn publicly. A union official who insisted on anonymity said that relations between Detroit and Spring Hill had greatly improved as labor rules for Saturn have become more like those in other G.M. factories. Over all, G.M. and the union have dedicated themselves to working together more closely after strikes at G.M. factories in the summer of 1998.
Mr. LeFauve, who was the president of Saturn from 1986 to 1994 and is now retired, said many of the changes at the unit were inevitable. 
"A small company just cannot make it alone in the car industry. You need to have a big brother to help you with high fixed-cost resources like engineering, purchasing, financial and the sales end of the business," he said. "We completely separated ourselves from G.M., but in some cases we found out what we were doing at G.M. corporate was the best way to do things."
Mr. Hankin, the union president, explains the difference in factory-floor terms. G.M. employees' identity badges have blue backgrounds; Saturn workers' badges are red. "Absolutely, we're seeing more blue badges," Mr. Hankins said. "I don't know if it's a bad thing to see blue badges walking around."

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook; 
What's in a Name? Today, Not Much

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
One is called Calibrus, one is called Calibra. Which one is the Internet start-up and which is the coupe made by General Motors? These days it's hard to tell. (Calibra is the car.) An entire industry of namers has sprung up to coin vaguely hip terms for the new economy's companies. The process of inventing and promoting a name can cost millions of dollars. It could also do more harm than good. 
 Invented names are nothing new. Since the turn of the 20th century, companies have picked nebulous names such as Amalgamated Holdings Limited and Consolidated Products Incorporated after undergoing mergers and reorganizations. Where today's names differ is their emphasis on mood. A somehow energetic but meaningless name like Ajilon (an information technology consulting firm) or Motiva (a joint-venture oil refiner and also, it happens, a management software package) is meant only to grab the attention of investors, consumers and corporate clients. 
 Auto makers and drug companies have used this tactic for years. If Miata and Allegra had not been a sports car and an allergy medicine, they could easily have ended up as third-generation mobile phone companies. Yet while specific products might rely on their brand names only for an edgy cachet, company names can convey a deeper meaning.
When a company bears the name of its founder, boss or creative mastermind -- such as Ford Motor, Dell Computer or Hershey Foods -- consumers can assume that a person or family's legacy ultimately stands behind the product. The inclusion of a hometown or region in a name, as in Hartford Property & Casualty or Alaska Airlines, can imply a loyalty or responsibility to that community. And it's certainly helpful for a company to have a product or service in its name, like any of the above, at least to distinguish itself from cars and drugs. 
Forthright, identity-based names have been tossed aside as too old-fashioned for the new economy. Today companies change owners and managers all the time. They're ageless, placeless and sometimes, especially when they end in .com, productless. A vague name, the namers will tell you, is a license to serve all sorts of clienteles in all sorts of ways. 
It also cuts the clearest ties to a company's community and its past. These ties have value to consumers, workers and even shareholders. As the namers will find out soon enough, building a good name takes more than just a good name. DANIEL ALTMAN

HEADLINE: The Jockeying Starts As Helms Yields to Time 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Speaking of the toll of time, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina announced tonight that he would not run for re-election in 2002 and would retire after a momentous 30-year career.
 Mr. Helms, a 79-year-old Republican, who is as revered by the American right as he is reviled by the left, explained his decision by quoting former Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. of North Carolina, a Democrat who left the Senate two years after Mr. Helms arrived. 
 "There is one inescapable reality that no man can ignore and that is that time takes a terrific toll," Mr. Helms said in an eight-minute televised address on WRAL-TV, where he first came to public notice as an editorial commentator. 
Backed by the state and national flags, and speaking deliberately, Mr. Helms seemed to choke up a bit as he concluded his remarks to the North Carolinians he has served longer than any senator in state history.
"One thing is for sure," he said, staring directly into a camera, "we will never forget you. And we shall always be grateful for all you have meant to us." 
Over the last decade, Mr. Helms has had coronary bypass surgery and prostate cancer, and he now suffers from a nerve condition in his feet that hampers his mobility and has forced him to use a motorized scooter. As a result, his departure has been anticipated and is certain to bring out several contenders for his seat.
Mr. Helms noted that he would be 88 if he ran and won in 2002 and completed a sixth term. "This," he said, "my family and I have decided unanimously I should not do and, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not."
In an interview with one of the station's anchors, Mr. Helms said that he had made his decision about three weeks ago and that it had been "very tough."
"Being part of the Senate," he said, "is not just another job, but I had to choose between that and my family and I made the right choice." 
While not unexpected, Mr. Helms's announcement was received solemnly by his admirers, who view him as a courageous captain of American conservatism, and cheered by his detractors, who see him as narrow-minded, obstinate and, in some cases, bigoted against minorities and homosexuals.
"It is a great loss," said the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a longtime Helms friend and the founder of the Moral Majority. "He's a national treasure. Of the 100 members of the United States Senate over the last 30 years, no one has been more consistent and reliable in his commitment to conservatism, America and moral and family values."
That view differed greatly from the one offered by Robert A. Pastor, an Emory University political scientist whose nomination by President Bill Clinton to be ambassador to Panama was one of many that died because of Mr. Helms's parliamentary maneuvering. 
"Nothing that Jesse Helms did in his entire career will enhance America's national security more than his retirement," Mr. Pastor said. "He's veered between the isolationist wing of his party and the unilateralist wing, but he has never accepted the tenets of cooperative multilateralism."
And yet, even some of those who battled with Mr. Helms over the years found themselves offering sentimental tributes today. Former Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., who lost a storied Senate race to Mr. Helms in 1984, spoke of the friendship they had subsequently developed and of Mr. Helms's fierceness in defense of his state.
And Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat who succeeded Mr. Helms as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee when the Senate changed hands in June, complimented Mr. Helms as "one of the most thoughtful, considerate and gracious senators I have ever served with."
Mr. Biden also noted that Mr. Helms was capable, at times, of changing positions, as he did recently in compromising in his opposition to the payment of the nation's back dues to the United Nations. 
Mr. Helms's announcement sounded a starting gun for what may now become an intriguing race to succeed him. A crowd of potential candidates has been circling and jockeying for weeks on the assumption that this day would come. None moved immediately today, allowing Mr. Helms to take his farewell bow on an otherwise empty stage, but they are expected to make decisions soon. 
Like several other 2002 races in competitive states, the North Carolina campaign will be closely watched because of its implications for control of the Senate, where the Democrats took a one-vote majority in June after the defection of Senator James M. Jeffords from the Republican Party. But it also will say much about the politics of North Carolina, a state that, while generally conservative, is almost certainly not as conservative as its senior senator. The Republican primary, in particular, could become a battle to define the future of a party that has been identified for three decades by its conservative colossus, Mr. Helms. 
The main suspense here concerns whether Elizabeth Dole, a former presidential candidate and a two-time cabinet secretary, will enter the Republican primary. A North Carolina native who spends most of her time in Washington, Mrs. Dole, 65, has said she will give the race serious consideration if Mr. Helms retires. She made no comment today.
The prospect of a Dole candidacy has generated great enthusiasm among national party leaders, some of whom have predicted that her stature and fund-raising resources would all but clear the field of Republican competitors. But that view is not necessarily shared in North Carolina, where there are concerns about Mrs. Dole's age, her disappointing performance in the 2000 presidential campaign and her residence outside the state.
"She will face the carpetbagger label," said Theodore S. Arrington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "And this is North Carolina, not New York, where we know what a carpetbagger is." 
If she runs, Mrs. Dole is likely to be perceived as firmly in the moderate camp. In her presidential campaign, for example, she supported a ban on assault weapons, a position unlikely to win friends in a Republican primary. The conservative standard, meanwhile, could be carried by former Senator Lauch Faircloth, 73, who was something of an ideological soulmate to Mr. Helms before losing his 1998 re-election campaign to John Edwards. Mr. Faircloth said tonight that he would give the race "serious consideration" in the coming weeks.
Falling somewhere between Mrs. Dole and Mr. Faircloth could be Representative Richard M. Burr, 45, of Winston-Salem. Mr. Burr, a four-term incumbent, has a generally conservative voting record but has not been as outspoken on social issues as Mr. Helms.
"He's not this sort of unyielding right-wing conservative in his public persona," said Jack D. Fleer, a political scientist at Wake Forest University.
In an interview tonight, Mr. Burr said he hoped to make a decision in the next three to four weeks, but said he would not run if Mr. Faircloth chose to do so.
Another potential candidate is a former mayor of Charlotte, Richard Vinroot, a two-time candidate for governor, who plans to meet with political advisers and fund-raisers on Thursday. Mr. Vinroot said today that there was "a great likelihood" that he would run.
On the Democratic side, Secretary of State Elaine Marshall has announced her candidacy, and State Representative Daniel T. Blue Jr., the state's first black House speaker, is considering the race. Former Governor Hunt said tonight that he would definitely not run. 
Whoever runs, politicians and political scientists said today that North Carolina politics would forever be changed. 
"We'll have a new day for us in North Carolina, and I think it will be a better one," said Harvey Gantt, the former Charlotte mayor who lost close races to Mr. Helms in 1990 and 1996. "Obviously, he was a different kind of senator, a throwback to another time."
Mr. Helms, Mr. Gantt said, succeeded by playing on the fears of white Southerners who saw their world changing at an unacceptable pace -- racially, economically and culturally.
Dan T. Carter, a historian at the University of South Carolina, said that Mr. Helms would probably be the last of his kind in Southern Republican politics, both in his rigid ideology and in his defiantly old-fashioned style.
"Today you have compassionate conservatism and a thousand points of light," Mr. Carter said. "But Helms held on to an abrasive rhetorical style of the 1950's and 60's in which the world is divided between the Satanic forces on one side and the forces of righteousness on the other."

HEADLINE: State Faults Amtrak for Neglect of Tunnels 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
A state transportation report on Pennsylvania Station accuses Amtrak of neglecting costly improvements to 15 miles of potentially dangerous tunnels that serve the passenger station, the busiest in the country.
 The report suggests that Amtrak, the federally subsidized railroad that owns the tunnels, was more interested in pursuing projects like the new Acela high-speed rail service and the redevelopment of the James A. Farley Building across Eighth Avenue. It blames Amtrak for not correcting fire and safety problems in the tunnels, some of which were identified as early as 1978. 
 The report, to be released today, was prepared by the State Senate Standing Committee on Transportation and was based on a public hearing held in the spring. Among its recommendations, it calls upon United States Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton to do more to get federal money to correct the problems, which are estimated to cost $898 million over the next 10 years. 
"While we accept the sincerity of Amtrak's Northeast corridor administration's commitment to improve safety, it is clear that Amtrak has invested a great deal more effort in glamorous projects," the report says. "It is clear that Amtrak has sacrificed accelerated tunnel infrastructure improvements for these service expansion and economic development projects."
Amtrak has long complained that lack of money, not neglect, is at fault. This year, Amtrak has allocated $20 million for tunnel work, which is all officials say the railroad can afford. Amtrak is so short of funds that it had to mortgage portions of Penn Station last month to get short-term cash. 
An Amtrak spokesman, Rick Remington, said yesterday that federal funds for the $810 million Farley redevelopment project, which will convert the building into a passenger station, were assigned by Congress, not by Amtrak. As for the Acela service, he said it did not compete with the Penn Station tunnels for Amtrak's money or attention.
"It wasn't a case of either-or," Mr. Remington said. "We were progressing on both at the same time."
The tunnels were built more than 90 years ago and lack basic ventilation, adequate escape routes and even essential water standpipes for firefighting. Each of the six tunnels is about two-and-a-half miles long; four of them run under the East River and two under the Hudson River. Together they serve about 300,000 passengers a day on Amtrak, Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit trains.
Based on testimony from fire officials and other experts, the state report says the tunnels pose no imminent hazard to commuters since they are structurally sound and kept in good repair. Nonetheless, it concludes that emergency and safety facilities "are woefully inadequate to deal with a major fire, accident, terrorist act or other emergency situation."
State Senator Dean G. Skelos, one of the writers of the report, said in an interview, "All of Amtrak's projects are wonderful, but it means nothing if people are not safe." 
In the event of a fire or other emergency in the tunnels, narrow stairways and trapped smoke would make evacuating passengers so difficult that the Fire Department's contingency plans call for first towing trains from the tunnels with the passengers aboard.
A spokesman for the Fire Department, Deputy Commissioner Francis X. Gribbon, said yesterday that Amtrak recently agreed to speed up the installation of standpipes in the tunnels -- which would provide water for firefighting -- and to provide hand-powered railroad carts so that firefighters and hoses could get into the tunnels without depending upon the 90-year-old spiral staircases.
"I think they will be the old-fashioned kind, where you pump it," Mr. Gribbon said of the carts. 
The situation in the tunnels is so serious, the state report suggests, that if the federal government does not provide the money soon, the state should move to take control of the two East River tunnels that are exclusively used by the Long Island Rail Road.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs the commuter railroad, has been rebuffed by Amtrak in previous attempts to gain control of the tunnels, but state officials said the urgency of the situation might persuade federal officials to back a state effort. In its current five-year capital plan, the transportation authority has committed $125 million for tunnel safety work, an indication, authority officials say, of how serious it is about correcting the problems.
Richard R. Kelly, a consultant hired by Amtrak, said that he had not seen the state report but that he welcomed any effort, even if critical, that would draw attention to the tunnel problems.
"I never regretted or resented the inquiries because that was all part of bringing the message out as to what the need is," Mr. Kelly said.

HEADLINE: From No Aid To a Bailout 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Despite negotiations that covered 12 days and several midnight bargaining sessions, many of the people involved in emergency talks to bail out Argentina's floundering economy went to lunch on Tuesday believing that the United States would say no to new aid.
 Bush administration officials had taken office declaring their intention to end President Clinton's repeated bailouts of chronically ailing economies like Argentina's. And Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill lamented in negotiating sessions over the past week that nobody seemed to be thinking creatively about ways of alleviating the country's debt problems without more loans. Publicly, he fretted about American "plumbers and carpenters" who pay taxes and "wonder what in the world we're doing with their money." 
 But by late Tuesday afternoon, Mr. O'Neill appeared to have changed his mind, and the administration voted to support the International Monetary Fund's plan to provide $8 billion in new loans for Argentina on top of a $13.7 billion package the country received just eight months ago. 
Ostensibly the administration's shift occurred because Argentina agreed to restructure its debt. The new I.M.F. loan program also pressures private lenders to help Argentina reschedule some loans.
But while those are novel provisions for an international bailout, they represent a 30-degree tack, rather than the 180-degree turn-around that the Bush administration had once indicated it preferred when it came to repeat borrowers at the financial bailout window.
The decision underscored that even at times when the United States holds most of the cards -- it is the largest single shareholder in the I.M.F. and is generally thought to have veto power over new loans -- it finds it difficult to deny an urgent request from an ally. It also cannot simply walk away from the interventionist financial diplomacy of the Clinton administration. That is, at least in part, because after a decade of fast-paced economic integration it is hard to separate financial rescues from other foreign policy priorities the Bush administration puts higher on its agenda, like free trade, open stock and bond markets, even democracy.
"You have to worry about collateral damage to the global financial situation, free trade, and open economies," said Edwin M. Truman, a former Treasury and Federal Reserve official who worked on many international financial rescues. "It's not like you can just categorically turn off the bailout switch."
President Bush has stressed the need to expand ties with Latin American leaders and has pushed a plan to create a hemispheric free trade zone modeled on Nafta. That goal would likely have receded had Argentina collapsed after its leaders got a polite no to their aid request from the United States, people involved in the talks said today.
It is no coincidence that Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, today invited Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay to join the United States in reviving the so-called Four-Plus-One trade group that pushed for trade expansion in the first Bush administration. Mr. Zoellick called free trade an engine of economic growth for Argentina and the region that would supplement the I.M.F. rescue package.
The Bush administration also has come under repeated fire, especially from European allies, for abandoning international commitments made during the Clinton years, including agreements to reduce global warming, control germ warfare and to crack down on tax evasion. White House officials have recently been scrambling to demonstrate that they value cooperative relations with major allies. Scuttling a rescue for Argentina could have undermined that.
Interestingly, many economists agree with Mr. O'Neill's skeptical approach. Argentina's problems have become severe enough that new loans are seen as having no more chance of success -- and maybe less chance -- than the last round agreed to during the final months of the Clinton administration. Argentina's economy has been shrinking for three years. Falling exports and capital flight has threatened its ability to repay some $128 billion in dollar-denominated foreign loans.
But while it is hardly a model for economic development among emerging markets, Argentina has often followed the advice of the I.M.F. In the early 1990's it committed itself to keeping its peso equal to a dollar in an effort to tame inflation, and overhauled its banking system, which was mired in mismanagement. 
Moreover, political support for fiscal austerity and open markets is shaky, both in Argentina and neighboring Brazil. Some fear a popular backlash if the experiments fails.
"If these talks had not had a positive result, we would definitely have had effects -- political, economic and in other areas -- that we all definitely wanted to avoid," Daniel Marx, Argentina's finance secretary, said today. Mr. Marx led his country's negotiating team.
For days, Mr. O'Neill pressed I.M.F. officials, Mr. Marx and his staff to find a way to solve Argentina's problem without new loans. Mr. O'Neill explored the idea of an Argentine-led debt restructuring backed by the I.M.F. or another multinational lending agency that would not require up-front loan commitments, for example, people involved in the talks said.
To the extent Mr. O'Neill and others countenanced new lending, they wanted assurances that the loans would resolve Argentina's woes long-term. Given market uncertainties, I.M.F. and Argentine officials were unable to provide the hard, multi-year projections Mr. O'Neill demanded, the people said.
Timing also worked against the administration. Argentine officials had made clear they were seeking up to $9 billion in new loans. As negotiations dragged on, investors lost faith in new aid.
Mr. O'Neill's scathing public assessment of Argentina's dependence on foreign aid -- he referred to a 70-year record of borrowing with poor results -- also struck at confidence. Argentine stocks plummeted and the bond market soured. 
Ultimately, the administration was backed into supporting new aid just to control matters. The aid buys time for Argentina and the I.M.F. to pursue the creative long-term solution that Mr. O'Neill sought.
"The reason the talks took so long is that O'Neill really wanted to do something creative and longer lasting," said William R. Rhodes, a Citigroup vice chairman who tracked the talks for his bank. "But ultimately to get that done you need calm and tranquillity in the markets."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Art May Not Be All Fun and Games, but Some of It Certainly Is

BYLINE:  By GRACE GLUECK 

DATELINE: NORTH ADAMS, Mass. 

 BODY:
Taking cues from the Surrealists and Grandpa Duchamp, the foxiest player of them all, more than a few artists are incorporating games and game themes into their work. They are prompted, too, by current video and computer pastimes, and maybe the slots at Las Vegas.
 Intrigued by the effects of chance, rules, competition, challenge and foolery that games engender, they devise obstacle courses, puzzles and word and video constructs that invite viewer participation on, well, a different wavelength from more traditional art. 
 To play Uri Tzaig's marble game, "Trance," two or more people sit at a square table topped by a pebbly silicon board and move the colored marbles on it in ways of their own improvising. Perry Hoberman's "Cathartic User Interface" presents a giant panel of computer keyboards that viewers activate by throwing balls whose random hits produce irritating messages: System Failure. The operation has failed. Would you like to try again? It will only fail again. 
Both works are in "Game Show," one of three related exhibitions at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art here that deal with artists whose work makes use of game structures and themes. It's a hodgepodge of a group, some of whose participants seem a little dragged in, but the result is not without entertainment value.
Of the two other shows, "Oyvind Fahlstrom: Another Space for Painting," brings back a gamester well known in the 60's and 70's whose work faded out with his untimely death; Fahlstrom (1928-76) was a Brazilian-born Swedish activist and social activist. 
"Fluxus Games From the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection Foundation" displays work by artists who belonged to the fluid and playfully subversive Fluxus movement of the 1960's and 70's. Lively as it is, it's a familiar group of pieces that have often been seen, and it offers no surprises.
Taking up a sizable chunk of "Game Show" is Kay Rosen's "Sight and Sound of Music," a humongous wall drawing in a gallery to match. The work comprises two graphlike lines of peaks and valleys -- a green one soaring high, a blue one lying low -- on a grid, flanked at each end by a vertical alphabet, each letter aligned with one of the grid's horizontal lines. 
What looks like a chart of, say, the gross national product, turns out, when properly read, to be a musical text and notes. Aside from billboard messages, it's not too often that a small, sweet idea has the chance to expand in such a space.
Another space-grabber -- and there's plenty of space here to grab -- is Sophie Calle's "Double Game," somewhat abbreviated from its New York appearance last season at the Paula Cooper Gallery. In it, through texts and photos, Ms. Calle depicts the game of double lives she has played, as a chambermaid, stalker, character in a novel and street performer in SoHo.
Christoph Draeger's catastrophe photographs -- some made up, some for real -- become games by virtue of their translation into jigsaw puzzles. His "found" color photographs of disasters, some of which are very big, are glued to cardboard backings and die-cut into puzzle pieces, like "TWA 800 No. 4," showing the reassembling of the plane's carcass in a hangar after its explosion in 1996. 
This and his other disaster puzzles could be read, I suppose, on a literal level, as the riddle of accidents in general. More to the point, the breakup of the photos into a jigsaw play pattern gives the viewer an ironic distance from the events. Still, in this show explanations violate the rules of the game.
The game as a con job is seen in Christian Jankowski's "Telemistica," created on the spot at the 1999 Venice Biennale. He asked unwitting Venetian tarot card readers to comment on his yet-unborn work, which would be a video of their responses to his questions about its success. And here is the video, showing the readers' forecasts -- favorable, of course -- for its prospects and Mr. Jankow ski's happiness with it.
The work that involves the most physical labor is Chris Finley's four-part "Level One," which puts the viewer through a set of optical exercises. The first step is lining up a sassy three-part painting of a spaced-out pig while straddling a gutter in which a rolling ball oinks at your feet. In the fourth and last step, you are jumping up and down on a trampoline to see over a wall that half conceals Mr. Finley's hyperactive painting "Boing Splat Flat With Yellow Jacket Bat." And is it worth it? Never mind; it's the process that counts in his kid-pleasing marathon.
Who was it who said, "A few artists at play go a very long way"?
Much more impressive is the Fahlstrom exhibition, which occupies another level of this vast, Rube Goldbergian warren of buildings and corridors that is a big game in itself. "Oyvind Fahlstrom: Another Space for Painting" is a smaller version of a show organized by the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, and it is making its only United States appearance at Mass MOCA. The two museums have produced a meaty catalog.
Fahlstrom, a painter, poet, performer, cultural critic and provocateur, regarded all of his work as a crusade for peace and social justice. But unlike most crusaders, he had a sense of humor. His use of Pop imagery tended to confuse those who slotted his garrulous work as Conceptual, but it stoutly resisted classification, having been culled from sources that ranged from Surrealism to John Cage, Mad magazine and Robert Crumb. (Fahlstrom was one of the first artists to use comic strips as inspiration.)
Games (some of them precursors of video play), maps, performances and installations were his preferred mediums. One of his inventions was "variable paintings" using cutouts on springs or magnets that could be moved around, like "Packing the Hard Potatoes (Chile I: Last Months of Allende Regime)" from 1974. A wall work with phantasmagoric cutouts on springs, each of its elements bears lines of poetry by Sylvia Plath and Federico Garcia Lorca.
The show's most arresting installation is "Meatball Curtain (for R. Crumb)," from 1969, inspired by a Crumb comic strip. Its raucous, brightly colored life-size figures of animals, humanoids and other phenomena form a sprawling tableau, flat forms translated into a 3-D setup. Meatballs, suspended on wires, drop down on the figures, "transfiguring the people and threatening the world order," in the artist's words.
A more participatory experience is offered by "The Little General (Pinball Machine)," from 1967, presumably a comment on the political and moral confusions of the 1960's. In a shallow waist-high pool, 9 by 16 feet, float silhouettes, cut out from magazine images and mounted on Styrofoam -- a typical Fahlstrom medley of figures that includes de Gaulle, Che Guevara, Moshe Dayan, a woman exposing herself, a penis, coffins, a head of Bob Hope -- that move if you even breathe on them. Their collisions and changes of position reflect the chance actions that daily invent and reinvent the world.
There is enough here from Fahlstrom's richly imaginative inventory of images and concepts to make his the most important of these three exhibitions. It speaks to a new audience even 25 years after his death.
"Game Show" remains on view through April, "Oyvind Fahlstrom: Another Space for Painting" through Nov. 1 and "Fluxus Games From the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection Foundation" through Jan. 14 at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, Mass., (413) 664-4481.

HEADLINE: Insurer Says Hyundai Deal Could Falter 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
The American International Group, the world's largest insurer, warned today that a $1.16 billion deal to take over the financial units of the crumbling Hyundai empire could collapse, just hours after a preliminary agreement with the South Korean government was signed.
 Under the deal announced here today -- which came after nearly a year of negotiations -- a consortium led by A.I.G. would take 55 percent of Hyundai Investment Trust and Securities, nearly 30 percent of Hyundai Trust Management and a stake in Hyundai Securities. 
 But later in the day, the company said that the agreement would fall apart if Hyundai Securities priced its shares at 8,940 won, or $6.80. A.I.G. said the price "is unacceptable and will impede completion of A.I.G.'s proposed investment" in the other two Hyundai companies. 
"A.I.G. does not believe the transaction will be consummated, unless this or other aspects of the transaction are promptly modified," the company said in a statement from its headquarters in New York. A.I.G. is said to have expected a share price of 7,000 won for Hyundai Securities.
Despite the optimism with which Korean leaders greeted the deal, the A.I.G. statement illustrates the difficulties foreign companies have faced in negotiations for Korean businesses as the Seoul government tries to restructure the conglomerate-dominated economy.
The investment by A.I.G. and the consortium, which includes W. L. Ross & Company, would be the largest foreign investment ever in the Korean financial services industry. Korean regulators said that under the deal, A.I.G. would invest $840 million to $850 million while a Korean government company would invest $700 million.
The signing of the memorandum today came as a relief to Korean leaders, after recent signs that the economic recovery was flagging. Indeed, the deal came as officials celebrated the last payment on $19.5 billion in loans extended by the International Monetary Fund. In late 1997, the fund put together a $58.5 billion rescue package to cover debts piled up by Korean conglomerates.
Kim Yong Duk, deputy finance minister, said the A.I.G. deal was evidence of South Korea's ability to fight its way through the current slump. "Definitely this deal will improve the confidence of the market," Mr. Kim said. "It will remove uncertainties."
Some analysts, however, said the celebration was premature. "The economy is slowing precipitously and publicly," said Richard Samuelson, managing director of UBS Warburg here.

HEADLINE: De Beers, With Net Off 15%, Will Curb Its Diamond Buying 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
As the economic slowdown blunts American appetites for costly baubles, De Beers Investment, the diamond giant, said today that its first-half profit fell 15 percent.
 De Beers also backed away from an earlier forecast that its sales of rough diamonds would reach $4.8 billion this year. And it said it would introduce quotas for the number of stones it was prepared to buy from diamond mines. It last introduced quotas in 1998 when sales slumped. 
 De Beers controls about two-thirds of the world's mining and marketing of rough diamonds, as the stones are called before they are cut and polished. The United States accounts for half the $60 billion retail market for jewelry and gems.
In the first half of the year, De Beers said net income fell to $744 million from $877 million a year earlier. The report was the company's first since it was taken private in May in a leveraged buyout led by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa and the Anglo American mining colossus, both of which hold 45 percent of the new De Beers Investment.
In a conference call, Gary Ralfe, De Beers' managing director, acknowledged that the company faced a difficult market and regulatory problems in Europe relating to a new marketing strategy called Supplier of Choice. The strategy aims to encourage competition among its wholesale customers to increase demand.
Mr. Ralfe said the market slowdown, particularly in the United States, where diamond retailers had not been able to sell surplus stocks, meant that De Beers was not going to meet its forecast of $4.8 billion in sales. "We're going to undershoot it by some distance," he said.
He also said that European Union regulators in Brussels had objected to its new marketing strategy, forcing De Beers to delay its introduction planned for last month.
Even without that regulatory hurdle, however, the De Beers plan to introduce quotas for its own mines and other suppliers in Russia and Canada represents an about-face, as the company falls back on the manipulation of diamond supplies through which it has controlled the world diamond trade for decades. Its new strategy is supposed to end the practice of controlling supplies in favor of promoting demand for diamonds as the main force in the diamond business.
Mr. Ralfe said the quotas would be modest, representing less than 10 percent of current supplies.
De Beers executives said there had been no change in the company's long-running regulatory problems in the United States, where it has long faced antitrust challenges because of its cartel-like grip on the world diamond trade.

HEADLINE: First Voting In East Timor Gives a Taste Of New Rights 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
Exactly two years after the people of East Timor voted, at great cost, to break away from Indonesia, they are tasting the fruits of their freedom with the first democratic election in their history.
 On Aug. 30, the anniversary of their referendum for independence, East Timorese are to vote for a constituent assembly that will draw up a constitution in preparation for full nationhood some time next year. 
 This vote, like the referendum in 1999, is being organized by the United Nations, which has continued to administer East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia, as it struggles to its feet economically and politically.
The assessment this week by United Nations officials and East Timorese reached by telephone: so far, so good. 
"People seem to be very much aware that this is a momentous event for them," said Colin Stewart, the United Nations official in charge of civic education. 
"For the first time, they will have their own democratically elected legislature and a cabinet that reflects the result of their vote," Mr. Stewart said. "Timorese will be taking the reins of power, even though technical independence is still a step away."
Tens of thousands of people have given their views in public meetings on the kind of nation they would like to see embodied in a new constitution. And about 80 percent of the 380,000 eligible residents have registered to vote.
They are to choose 88 members of an assembly from among 1,138 candidates representing 16 parties. The assembly is to convene two weeks later to begin to shape the outlines of the newest nation. A presidential election is likely to follow a few months later.
Almost everybody expects Jose Alexandre Gusmao, East Timor's independence leader and its most popular public figure, to be elected president. For the moment he is standing aside from the campaign, pursuing his avocation as a photographer and joining foreign reporters in covering the rallies.
The campaign has been largely peaceful, although acts of intimidation by the largest party, Fretilin, have been reported.
"There is an undercurrent of tension," said Johanna Kao, who has been helping organize political parties as a representative of the International Republican Institute, an American civic-education organization. "They are a little worried about what the election might bring in terms of new violence or conflicts."
The tension is not surprising, given East Timor's recent experience. When it voted overwhelmingly for independence, ending 25 years of Indonesian occupation, the vote was followed by a rampage by Indonesian-backed militias that took hundreds of lives and destroyed 80 percent of the territory's buildings.
"So many people have had so much trauma," said Rosa Garcia, a reporter for The Timor Post, a local daily. "They anticipate that if Fretilin does not win, it will be like a civil war. Some people say they have already been threatened."
East Timor's recovery is still only beginning. Most ruined buildings have not been rebuilt, many people remain unemployed and small outbreaks of violence are common.
Some 50,000 East Timorese still live in refugee camps in neighboring West Timor, which is still part of Indonesia. Militia members continue to clash with United Nations peacekeepers along the border.
East Timor remains heavily dependent on foreign aid, with just $25 million of its annual budget of $305 million coming from taxes and fees.
A multibillion-dollar windfall is expected in the coming decades from offshore oil. But apart from that, coffee is East Timor's only significant export. The foreign investment that Mr. Gusmao said would fuel recovery has not materialized in any significant way.
Even before the wave of devastation in 1999, East Timor had few resources with which to build a nation. The territory was run essentially by its Indonesian occupiers.
The United Nations and private foreign agencies are working to create a police force, a court system, a new military force, an education system and a health care system. Much of this is paid for from a $170 million trust fund administered by the World Bank.
On its face the capital, Dili, appears to be bustling, but most restaurants, hotels, vehicles and apartment rentals are part of a bubble economy fed by the huge foreign presence. One test for East Timor will come when that presence begins to scale down next year.
Another concern is that troublemakers from across the border are biding their time until the United Nations withdraws, hoping to prove Indonesia's prediction that East Timor cannot survive alone. Secretary General Kofi Annan says some foreign troops will be needed even after full independence.
The election next week will be only one of the early steps toward creat ing a nation that can stand on its own.

HEADLINE: Some on Fed Panel Saw June's Rate Cut as Enough 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting panel voted to cut borrowing costs at its June meeting, but some members thought that the Fed was nearing the end of the current cycle of looser monetary policy, according to minutes of the meeting released today.
 The panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted 9 to 1 to reduce short-term rates by one-quarter of a percentage point at the meeting on June 26-27, with William H. Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, casting the negative vote. 
 "Mr. Poole dissented because he believed that F.O.M.C. actions this year had already established a highly stimulative monetary policy stance," the minutes said, adding that he thought another rate cut "raised an undue risk of fostering higher inflation in the future."
While Mr. Poole was the only formal dissenter, some other members apparently shared his concern. "In the view of a number of members," the minutes said, "the committee might well be near the end of its easing cycle."
Still, on Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee again cut short-term rates by a quarter-point, the seventh reduction this year in an attempt to stave off recession -- which, as economists define it, is two consecutive quarters of contraction in the broad economy.
The cut in June, the sixth, was the first one of only a quarter-point. Before June there had been five cuts of a half-percent each.
Mr. Poole's dissent was the second time this year that a member of the Fed's policy panel chose to vote against a rate decision. At the meeting on May 15, Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted against a half-point cut, favoring a smaller move instead. At the time, analysts were surprised by Mr. Hoenig's dissent and the disclosure that two other unidentified committee members said they "could have accepted" a smaller reduction.
Most Fed committee members in June saw the easing as posing little risk of inflation and thought it was necessary, given the lack of evidence that the economic slowdown was over. At the time of the meeting, the economy was performing more poorly than had been expected and inflation was subdued.
In addition to the decision to lower rates again, Mr. Poole disagreed with the "balance of risks" statement issued after the meeting, which said there was a greater risk of recession than inflation. The minutes said Mr. Poole was worried that the statement would be viewed as a sign the Fed was likely to cut rates further.
Still, in reflecting the overall view, the minutes said, "With greater slack in labor and product markets, and with inflation expectations contained, an added easing ran very little risk of exacerbating price pressures, provided the committee was prepared to firm the stance of policy promptly if and when demand pressures threatened to intensify."

HEADLINE: California Home Prices Up 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: LA JOLLA, Calif., Aug. 23 

 BODY:
Prices for homes in Southern California rose in July at their fastest rate since 1989 and sales surged, helped by low mortgage rates and pent-up demand for lower-cost homes, a new report said. 
 The median price rose to a record $234,000 last month, a 14 percent increase from July 2000, according to the report, by DataQuick Information Systems. A total of 28,944 homes were sold in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange Counties, up more than 19 percent from July 2000 but down 3.7 percent from June 2000. 
 Entry-level and midlevel homes were selling at a faster rate than more expensive homes, reversing a seven-year trend.

2 Big Booksellers' Results Beat Wall St. Expectations

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
Barnes & Noble, the nation's largest bookstore chain, posted fiscal second-quarter results yesterday that easily surpassed Wall Street expectations. The second-largest chain, Borders Group, modestly topped forecasts.
 In a crucial barometer of how the book industry is faring during the economic slowdown, both companies also projected an improvement over last year's lackluster holidays, the season that usually accounts for more than 40 percent of the book industry's annual sales. 
 Barnes & Noble said it expected sales at its superstores open at least a year to increase about 4 percent through the holiday quarter. By comparison, Barnes & Noble's same-store sales rose about 2 percent during last year's weak holidays after rising about 6 percent in 1999.
Ed Wilhelm, Borders' chief financial officer, said he also expected sales growth better than last year, but not as good as 1999.
Both companies noted that comparisons with last year reflected the anomalous burst of book sales last summer after the release of the fourth Harry Potter book.
For the quarter ended Aug. 4, Barnes & Noble reported a loss of $1.7 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of $8.6 million, or 13 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier, partly reflecting a 62.6 percent increase in sales in its Game-Stop video game division.
Excluding certain costs like losses in some investments and stock payments to executives, Barnes & Noble said it would have broken even on a per-share basis, compared with a loss of 11 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to lose 12 cents a share on that basis.
Barnes & Noble, based in New York, said its revenue rose to $1.05 billion from $924.3 million. Sales at its superstores rose 8.3 percent, to $772.5 million. Sales at its superstores open at least a year rose 3 percent. 
Barnes & Noble also operates B. Dalton bookstores, which account for about 8 percent of its bookstore revenue; it also owns a 40 percent stake in the online store Barnesandnoble.com. Losses from its stake in Barnesandnoble.com, which declined to $11.3 million from $15.7 million, and from the cost of acquiring GameStop lowered its earnings to break-even.
Barnes & Noble said sales at GameStop, previously called Babbage's, rose to $206.8 million from $127.3 million, reflecting the popularity of new video game platforms.
The company also said it planned to make preliminary filings to spin off GameStop by selling a minority stake to the public.
Shares of Barnes & Noble rose $1.21 each, to $41.97.
After the market closed, Borders, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., reported earnings for the quarter ended July 29 of about $100,000, up from a loss of $1.6 million in the period a year earlier. The company said its per-share earnings, excluding discontinued operations and certain one-time charges, rose to break-even from a loss of 2 cents a share. Analysts had expected the company to lose a penny a share, according to First Call.
Borders, which also operates Waldenbooks, said its sales rose 5.9 percent, to $739.8 million, from $698.4 million. In its Borders superstores in the United States, which account for the bulk of its revenue, sales rose 10.1 percent, to $511.1 million from $464.1 million. Sales at store open more than one year rose 2 percent in the quarter.

HEADLINE: CHINA NOW FACING AN AIDS EPIDEMIC, A TOP AIDE ADMITS 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
Departing from the Chinese government's general reticence on the subject of AIDS, a senior official openly admitted today that China was facing an epidemic that threatened to outpace government efforts to control it.
 The official, Deputy Health Minister Yin Dakui, also conceded the government's failure to develop effective education programs and the tendency of some local officials to cover up the extent of infection in their jurisdictions, allowing the disease to spread unchecked. 
 "Like many other countries we are also facing a very serious epidemic of H.I.V.-AIDS," Mr. Yin said, adding that the government had "not effectively stemmed the epidemic."
Mr. Yin's 90-minute news conference -- the first by a top Chinese official on the topic -- was the latest in a series of small steps suggesting that China is ready to address more openly a topic that has been mostly taboo. 
At today's news conference, Mr. Yin insisted that China's epidemic of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, was still relatively small -- but he also released some alarming new statistics. Reported H.I.V. infections rose 67.4 percent in the first six months of 2001 compared with the same period last year, he said. And about 5 percent of drug users in China are now infected with H.I.V., up from less than 0.5 percent in 1995.
In response, the government has decided to spend about $12 million annually for AIDS prevention and control, he said, as well as more than $117 million this year to improve blood safety. (By comparison, the United States government has budgeted $744 million for H.I.V. prevention in fiscal year 2001, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)
More important, though, Mr. Yin addressed some of the politically sensitive aspects of the AIDS problem, touching on China's shortcomings in dealing with the crisis forcefully and in time. "In some regions, leaders and the general public have not fully realized the hidden dangers of a large-scale epidemic," he said. 
He also discussed, for the first time, an AIDS epidemic covered up in Henan Province, where tens of thousands of poor farmers have contracted AIDS by selling their blood using unsterilized practices.
Just last week, Mr. Yin held a widely publicized meeting with AIDS patients in the village of Wenlou, in Henan Province. It was the first time that such a high-level delegation had visited the area and the first time the situation had been featured in the mainstream state press.
Today's news conference was a milestone of sorts, although it also underscored the gulf between the government and its critics both in and outside China who remain at least somewhat skeptical, feeling that the government has been far too slow in confronting a burgeoning AIDS problem.
"In the past I may have believed things, but now I'm not sure about what I'm told, so I must observe and judge," said Dr. Gao Yaojie, a retired gynecologist who earned international praise and the enmity of local officials by creating her own H.I.V.-education program in Henan.
And the government's apparent commitment to greater openness about AIDS was undercut by the fact that reports on today's lengthy news conference in the state-controlled press were brief and statistical, leaving out the Mr. Yin's judgment that China faced a "serious epidemic" and not mentioning Henan Province by name at all.
Also, despite acknowledging a rapid increase in the number of people testing positive for H.I.V., Mr. Yin staunchly defended previous ministry estimates that 600,000 Chinese were infected with the virus at the end of 2000. And he repeated the goal, set by the central government this May, that China should contain the total number of H.I.V. cases to less than 1.5 million in 2010.
But a recent United Nations report estimated that already "above one million" Chinese had H.I.V. at the start of 2001, and that if current trends continue there could be 20 million by the end of 2010.
According to government data, almost 70 percent of those infected with H.I.V. are intravenous drug-users, although critics say that statistic may be partly a result of intensive testing in that group.
Even those who welcomed the government's new approach said that it was too little, too late for the thousands of people who had been needlessly infected in recent years -- while health officials failed to take decisive action. 
The United Nations report noted that China was experiencing local H.I.V. epidemics that could have been prevented with simple education programs.
For example, government research found that the rate of needle-sharing among drug users in Jiangxi Province increased sharply in the 1990's, reaching 93 percent in 1999. Because health officials made inadequate efforts to stem the practice, H.I.V. spread quickly among addicts when the virus entered the population. Seventeen percent of drug users at one surveillance site are now infected.
"Education is extremely important especially at the grass-roots level," said Dr. Gao, who is currently distributing 120,000 copies of a book she recently wrote and printed on the topic. "Education is essential," she said, "and so is a proper attitude toward people with AIDS -- an attitude of support and understanding."
Mr. Yin disputed accusations that the government had been previously unconcerned, noting that the government has had an office charged with overseeing sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS since 1996 and a plan for H.I.V. prevention and containment since 1998. 
But until the new infusions of money announced this month, that plan was underfinanced. In recent years, China, the world's most populous country, has spent only a fraction of the money spent on H.I.V. education and prevention by Thailand, for example. 
Mr. Yin became testy on the question of why the Health Ministry had not been more forceful in dealing with the epidemic among blood sellers in rural Henan Province. 
The bulk of H.I.V. cases there were contracted in the 1990's when poor farmers sold their blood at blood stations that, Mr. Yin admitted today, used unsanitary procedures.
Blood from farmers of the same blood type would be pooled and centrifuged to separate out the plasma, which was sold to make medicines like gamma globulin and albumin. The remainder of the pooled blood, mostly red cells, was reinjected into the farmers. This was to allow them to give blood more frequently, which many did several times a month for a fee of about $5.
While Mr. Yin blamed "underground and illegal plasma collection stations" for H.I.V.'s spread, he did not mention that many of these stations were owned or operated in collaboration with government bureaus, including the Chinese military.
The practice tailed off in the second half of the 1990's, in part because of a government ban on blood sales and in part because the farmers realized that it had infected them with a fatal disease.
But data on infection rates in the area remain sketchy, in large part because provincial officials have generally refused to let outside researchers conduct independent surveys, often forcing them to work undercover. Some Chinese journalists who have tried to report on the problem have been fired. Foreign journalists who have tried to visit the villages have been detained. 
Mr. Yin denied that Health Ministry officials were in any way responsible, saying that "it is not appropriate to blame the Chinese government for the suppression." 
"We have all along encouraged people on the local level to confront the issue rather than to suppress it," he said. 
"Our experts have made efforts to change the way of thinking of the leaders and the people at the grass roots," he said. "But they are worried that once the problem is revealed it will harm their social and economic development."
Indeed, because of widespread ignorance, people with AIDS generally face severe discrimination. Once a village gains the reputation of having an AIDS problem, its residents often have trouble selling their produce or even traveling on buses out of town. 
Still, even as some village officials have tried to suppress information, many AIDS patients have made desperate efforts to get their story out -- even traveling to Beijing to petition central leaders and meet with journalists.
Reached by phone, one AIDS patient in Wenlou who would give only his surname, Cheng, said that while villagers generally appreciated the deputy minister's recent visit, they felt he offered no solution. 
Mr. Cheng said that 12 people in the village of several thousand had died of AIDS this summer and that several more were close to death. He said that although health authorities had now set up a free clinic, it only dispensed simple medicines for headaches, diarrhea and fevers. 
During the visit of the deputy minister and his entourage, Mr. Cheng said, the village was surrounded by the police. "He didn't say what would happen to us," Mr. Cheng said. "He encouraged us, and warned us not to talk to foreign reporters." 
In villages like Wenlou, a majority of adults sold blood, and many now have H.I.V. Mr. Yin estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 former blood sellers in Henan Province were infected. Other estimates put the number as high as a million.
Last April, the Henan provincial health department -- together with the Health Ministry -- tried to conduct a comprehensive survey of the village, although several people refused to participate. Of more than 1,600 people questioned, 568 reported that they had sold blood before 1995 and, of those, 244, about 42 percent, tested positive for H.I.V. Some previous studies had suggested rates as high as 60 percent for the village as a whole.
But the April study probably understates the impact of the virus on the village because it included people of all ages up to 65, and few people under 20 could have sold blood. It also does not include the many villagers who have already died. 
Ministry officials say they are continuing their efforts to understand the magnitude of the problem.
"It is important to get an accurate estimate of carriers so we can establish the future costs of their medical care, because the villagers are poor and can't afford their own treatment," said Dr. Shen Jie, an H.I.V. expert at the Health Ministry.
At the news conference, Mr. Yin also addressed the government's plans for AIDS education, confessing that official efforts had so far failed in many respects. "We still have a poor record of education on how to prevent H.I.V.," he said. 
He noted that in surveys, only about 9 percent of prostitutes regularly have their clients use condoms and only 30 to 40 percent of intravenous drug addicts understood how to protect themselves from contracting H.I.V. "That number is even lower among people in impoverished or remote areas," he said, where many people have still never even heard of AIDS.
That lack of knowledge is especially worrisome because H.I.V. infection has now been found in all 31 provinces. 
Dr. Gao said she had been deluged with requests for copies of her new education book, which she printed in part with the proceeds from the Jonathan Mann Award, a prestigious international public health prize, with which she was honored this year. Local officials blocked her from traveling to Washington to accept it from United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
"Of course education should be the government's job," she said. "There's so much to be done."

Uncertain Economy Spurs Interest in Law Degrees
A growing number of relatively recent college graduates have decided that a law degree is the best ticket to a safe perch in the new economy of uncertainty.
 Nearly 24,000 people took the Law School Admissions Test in June, an increase of 18.6 percent from the same month the previous year, according to the Law School Admission Council. The organization, which administers the exam, expects a similar or even larger increase in the number of people taking the next test in early October. Page A1.

HEADLINE: LAW SCHOOL CALLS AS ECONOMY SLOWS 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
When Kevin Haeberle graduated from Georgetown University with a degree in English literature two years ago, the last thing on his mind was law school.
 He caught the dot-com wave and rode it well until he was laid off last month. But now he is one of a growing number of relatively recent college graduates who have decided that a law degree, after all, is the best ticket to a safe perch in the new economy of uncertainty. 
 "I want something meaningful to me, and I want something that is more of a stable, organized environment," said Mr. Haeberle, 24, who is collecting unemployment benefits while taking a course to prepare for the Law School Admissions Test this fall. "Not someplace where 25 percent of your co-workers are there one day and gone the next." 
Nearly 24,000 people took the L.S.A.T. in June, an increase of 18.6 percent from June in the previous year, according to the Law School Admission Council. The organization, which administers the exam, expects a similar or even larger increase in the number of people taking the next test in early October.
Reflecting decisions mostly made late last year, when the first signs of economic distress were just emerging, applications to enter law school this fall rose as well, up 5.6 percent, to almost 79,000. That is the largest increase in a decade and the highest number of applicants since 1995, when over 84,000 people applied. It remains well below the nearly 100,000 who sought entry to law school at the depths of the last recession in 1991, but it is expected to increase even more sharply for those applying for next year's class.
Tom Matos, director of admissions at New York Law School, said, "As the economy gets softer, for those who are recent graduates of undergraduate schools and who don't have job security and who have had in the back of their mind an escape route, law school is fairly high up on the list." 
In the boom years of the 1990's, interest in law school waned as college graduates, many attracted by tales of instant dot-com millionaires, sought opportunities elsewhere.
In the meantime, while business schools initially attracted more students in the 1990's as entrepreneurial success stories spread, they also lost applicants at the height of the Internet fever. Applications fell because it seemed to many young adults that an M.B.A. was an unnecessary way station before jumping on the gravy train.
Now, as the job market deteriorates, both law and business schools are drawing more attention, with law, which appears to be the most sensitive to changes in the economy, showing the sharpest increase.
Many students applying to law school, of course, are the kind of people who have always gone: those drawn to the glamour of the courtroom by dramas like "Law and Order," those pursuing careers in politics or promoting social causes and those following in a family tradition.
But the recent surge of interest suggests that economic concerns are also playing a significant role in the decisions being made by many young people applying to law schools this fall.
For one thing, the biggest increases in the number of people taking preparatory classes for the L.S.A.T. offered by Kaplan Inc., the largest test-preparation company, have been in San Francisco, Austin, New York, Boston and Washington -- all places where the collapse of the "new economy" has crushed more than a few Generation Y dot-com dreams.
Kaplan, a unit of the Washington Post Company, reports that the number of people taking its L.S.A.T. courses has increased nearly 20 percent this year, which should translate into a similar increase in actual applicants.
"We've seen this several times," said Stephen Schreiber, vice president at the Law School Admission Council. "We saw that in the mid- to late 80's. There was a big surge in test takers."
Business schools have also begun to attract more attention from young college grads. The Graduate Management Admission Council reports that 195,027 people took its test last year, up nearly 7 percent from the previous year. As of June 30, 111,203 people had taken the G.M.A.T. this year, up 12 percent over the same period last year.
For different reasons, the number of people applying to medical school has fallen steadily since 1996. Some experts see signs, however, that this decline is beginning to level off.
Still, law school applications appear to be the most affected by changes in the economic climate. Between 1991 and 1998, as the economy got better and better, the number of people applying to law school fell steadily, from 99,327 to 71,726, according to the Law School Admission Council.
In 1999, even before the economy weakened, the number of applicants climbed slightly but it stayed almost level for 2000. Now it is on the rise again.
Some schools experienced even greater gains and a few were surprised to find that more students accepted offers of admission than expected, perhaps because they found other prospects dimming.
"We didn't accept any more than we ordinarily do," said Alan D. Hornstein, associate dean at the University of Maryland School of Law in Baltimore, which has 312 students starting this fall instead of the 200 it expected. "Our yield went through the roof."
The increase in the popularity of law school has causes beyond the dot-com meltdown, said Jeffrey S. Lehman, dean of the law school at the University of Michigan. "We're seeing the echo of the baby boom generation hit law school now," he said. However, up to now, the number of people graduating from college each year has barely changed.
He said that law also appeals to more idealistic impulses, not just to materialistic ones. "The country goes through cycles in the prevalence of a public-spiritedness," he said. "Most people who are applying to law schools are motivated in significant part by a desire to make society a better place."
He acknowledged that more than 90 percent of law school graduates go on to jobs at private law firms, where many will spend at least a few years buried in piles of paper and dealing with mind-numbing details, rather than in government or with nonprofit organizations.
"Many more of our graduates would accept a public interest opportunity if it were available," Mr. Lehman said. "But the truth is that those opportunities are very scarce for those people who are just graduating from law school."
Mr. Haeberle, the laid-off dot-commer, said helping improve society was certainly one of his motivations for going to law school. "What I'm interested in more is the conceptual side of health care, in fighting to make sure that our health resources are well allocated," he said.
He started questioning his job working for a start-up that designed Web pages for television networks early this year, he said, and began to study other career options in earnest when the company -- he would not give the name because it is still hoping to raise more money -- reduced its work force by 25 percent in March.
His experience is not unusual.
Shannon Carl, a 1997 graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, was also laid off by a dot-com and is enrolled in a law school test-preparation course.
"It's really good that I did take some time off before I went back to school, because I think I'll appreciate it more," she said. "My generation was not necessarily brainwashed but further education -- you didn't have to go. It wasn't a necessity because there were all those dot-coms and there was all this opportunity out there."
But Ms. Carl, who is 26, said law school had always been a goal. So when she was laid off in April, she decided to apply. Although economic security was not her primary motivation, she said: "Law school takes care of you. If you get out of it what you put into it, then after law school you're going to get a job."
Not everybody intending to go to law school is a refugee from the Internet economy, of course. Hallie L. Parsons did not go to a dot-com, did not get laid off and knows exactly what she wants to do after law school. Ms. Parsons, 29, a property manager in San Francisco and a graduate of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, read her fortune after eating take-out Chinese food at her apartment in March. "In your 20's you are driven by will," the fortune read, "in your 30's by wit, and in your 40's by wisdom."
"I'm almost 30, so it's time to get some more wit," Ms. Parsons said. She had always wanted to go to law school at some point, but became involved in commercial real estate by accident, she said. Reading her fortune rekindled her interest in law and now she is busy taking Kaplan's L.S.A.T. course.
"I want to go for more knowledge, not for the career change," she said, adding that she plans to return to real estate once she has her law degree.
Even a law degree, though, is no guarantee of a good job these days. Current second- and third-year law students, many already in the midst of interviews for internships next summer or full-time jobs after graduation, say that it is much harder going right now than it was the year before. And some leading law firms have announced layoffs, suggesting that the profession is not immune to the downturn.
Business school students say the job climate has grown much darker for them, too. According to students who are just now beginning to interview as they return to campus for the fall, big consulting firms and investment banking firms that last year showered them with offers this year are being much more selective.
No doubt the new crop of law students are counting on the economy to be better when they graduate. But not everybody seeking a seat in a good law school is going to get one.
"An increase in applications will lead, probably, to a decrease in acceptance rates overall for most law schools," said Genita C. Robinson, assistant dean for admissions at the University of Chicago Law School.
And law school is not for everyone, she warned. "Law isn't just a job; it's a commitment," Ms. Robinson said. "A law degree can be a very useful tool, but you should think about what you actually want to do with it."

HEADLINE: Human Genome Appears More Complicated 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
After a humiliating deflation this February, human dignity is on the recovery path, at least as measured by the number of genes in the human genome.
 Two new estimates put the likely number of human genes at around 40,000, up by a third from the estimate of about 30,000 in February by the two teams of scientists who decoded the human genome. The low estimate still has its defenders. 
 The 30,000 number suggested that evolution had not found the design, operation and maintenance of a person much more complicated than the job of running the microscopic round worm (19,000 genes), the fruit fly (13,000 genes) or the mustard cress plant (25,000 genes), the three other multicellular organisms whose genomes have been analyzed. 
Until the human genome was decoded, the textbook figure for the number of human genes had been 100,000, putting a safe distance between people and the little creatures on which the genome decoding methods were first tested.
But 100,000 was just a guess. When the 3.2 billion letters of the human genome were decoded, computer programs set to analyze the sequence found that 1 percent of the DNA consisted of genes. Both the government-financed consortium of academic centers and its rival, Celera Genomics of Rockville, Md., concluded there were 30,000 or so well-documented genes, though both allowed that the number might grow.
Dr. Michael P. Cooke, Dr. John B. Hogenesch and colleagues at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation in San Diego have now compared the two sets of human genes from Celera and the consortium, finding that 15,000 genes are common to both. The fact that the two sets do not entirely overlap has not been generally known. 
Based on a test of their own, the Novartis biologists believe that most of the genes found by Celera alone, and by the consortium alone, are real. If all the human genes found by only one of these groups are added to the 15,000 found by both, the total comes to around 40,000.
Dr. Cooke said his next project was to test whether all 40,000 of these predicted human genes were real.
Separately, Dr. Christopher Burge of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said he had an article in the journal Genomics suggesting that the total number of human genes was around 40,000. Dr. Burge is the author of Genscan, one of the principal programs for predicting which regions of the genome contain genes.
Dr. Cooke and Dr. Hogenesch said they were less interested in the precise number of human genes than in making sure they had the full set, however many it might be, since researchers trying to understand some aspect of the body's function could be led astray if some vital gene was missing from the catalog.
The importance of cataloging every human gene is to understand how human cells work in health and disease and to devise gene-based remedies for many ailments.
The number of genes dictates the size of that task, since it would presumably take longer to understand the roles of 40,000 than of 30,000. Obtaining the precise number is also a test of how well biologists understand the human genome.
Now that the number may be ascertainable, biologists are being more cautious in their predictions.
"People were throwing numbers around, and now there is complete silence on the subject," said Dr. Burge, suggesting there was a fear of looking foolish with the wrong estimate.
In May last year, with estimates of the number of human genes ranging all over the lot, scientists meeting at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island organized a sweepstakes for bets on the exact tally, with the winner to be chosen in 2003.
It is now not so clear that the real number of human genes will be known any time soon. With all the estimates out there, "it has to be becoming clear to people it must not be simple," said Dr. J. Craig Venter, the president of Celera Genomics. 
Dr. Venter said that the Novartis scientists were the first to point out publicly that Celera's predicted set of human genes and that of the public consortium did not overlap much, a fact that means the consortium "has missed a lot."
Dr. Eric Lander, chief author of the consortium's report, was traveling and unavailable for comment.
Dr. Venter said he disagreed with the Novartis scientists' method and did not plan to revise his tally of 26,000 well-documented human genes. He also found other more doubtful ones, and with further research his number could go up or down by 5,000 genes.
"It will probably take 5 or 10 years to have a really accurate count plus or minus 100 genes," he said.

HEADLINE: A Political Straitjacket 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
For the last few years, across two presidents' administrations and an increasingly bitter partisan divide in Congress, Republicans and Democrats have agreed not to touch the portion of the federal budget surplus coming from the Social Security system. 
 The two parties drew that line not from a bedrock belief in the virtues of austerity but from a desire to keep the other side from getting its hands on the money and a well-grounded political fear of meddling with Social Security. 
 But it seemed to work, at least while the total budget surplus was getting bigger each year, allowing the nation to make plans to pay off its debt while still allowing consideration of tax cuts and ambitious spending programs.
Now, with the surplus outside of Social Security gobbled up by the combination of President Bush's tax cut and the ailing economy -- and with Democrats and Republicans continuing to pursue expensive and clashing agendas -- their resolve is about to be tested. 
Neither side wants to be the first to retreat from its pledge not to touch the Social Security surplus, and each seems willing to go to great lengths to avoid doing so. But people in both parties are beginning to acknowledge that the policy has left them in a quandary and that a further downturn in the economy could soon force the White House and Congress to rethink it.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said today that the administration intended to keep the budget in balance without using any of the Social Security surplus. The bipartisan agreement to wall off that money, Mr. Lindsey said in an interview, reflects a valuable political constraint that, among other things, limits the growth of government spending.
But Mr. Lindsey said Mr. Bush had always had in mind two exceptions to his support for staying out of the Social Security surplus. One is if the country were at war. The other is if it were in a recession.
The administration is predicting a rebound in the economy next year. Should that forecast prove wrong and the economic slowdown degenerate into a downturn, Mr. Lindsey said, he would advise the president to put stimulating the economy ahead of maintaining the inviolability of the Social Security surplus.
In other words, Mr. Bush might be willing to use Social Security revenues to pay for more tax cuts if the economic situation became bleak enough.
The president is "saying the value of respecting this political constraint is very high and is more important than your run-of-the-mill spending program -- war obviously being an exception, or the need to stimulate the economy being an exception," Mr. Lindsey said. 
At the other end of the political spectrum, liberal Democrats have become increasingly uncomfortable with the straitjacket their party has put itself in. Worried that spending on education, health, the environment and other social needs will be the first to suffer if Congress and the administration begin trimming the budget to protect the Social Security surplus, they say the nation could benefit from some flexibility in budget policy.
Robert B. Reich, who was labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, said both parties "have created a fiscal trap for themselves."
"When they hear both parties talk about the importance of balancing the budget at any cost, the public naturally comes to assume that is a goal that must not be tampered with," Mr. Reich said. "Hence, we are back in the land of Calvin Coolidge."
Starting in Mr. Clinton's first term, when they voted for a tax increase to help wipe out the huge deficits that had plagued the government since the early 1980's, Democrats have worked hard to shed their tax-and-spend image and to recast themselves as guardians of fiscal responsibility and prosperity.
But unless Democrats are willing to back off somewhat from their adherence to austerity, Mr. Reich said, they risk having to sacrifice much of everything else the party stands for.
In releasing new budget projections on Wednesday, the administration forecast a Social Security surplus for the next decade of $2.5 trillion, including $171 billion next year. But it said it expected the surplus outside of Social Security to total only $575 billion over the next 10 years, down from $3.1 trillion earlier this year before passage of the tax cut and before the dimensions of the economic slowdown were clear. 
The non-Social Security surplus next year would be $1 billion, the administration said, and $2 billion in 2003. That is real money in any other context but not a very large amount when it comes to the $1.9 trillion federal budget.
The Congressional Budget Office will release its forecast next week, and it may show that the government is already dipping into Social Security money.
Some Republicans, especially those who are strong proponents of tax cuts, have always regarded the wall around the Social Security surplus as a trap set by Mr. Clinton.
In early 1998, faced with mounting demands from the Republican Congress to use the emerging surplus for tax cuts, Mr. Clinton challenged both parties to "save Social Security first." In doing so, he implied that an excessive tax cut would endanger the future of the retirement system, a politically powerful link that has bedeviled Republicans ever since, even though the government routinely spent the entire Social Security surplus for decades before that.
In economic terms, Mr. Clinton's stance was built on a belief, backed most notably by Robert E. Rubin when he was Treasury secretary, that eliminating deficits and reducing the national debt would bring down interest rates and provide a powerful stimulus to the economy.
The strategy seemed to work in the late 1990's. But as the economy has swooned, some economists have warned against sticking resolutely to austerity. And as a political matter, austerity will no doubt become less attractive to the parties as they face painful decisions about scaling back.
Mr. Bush's agenda includes costly proposals important to his party's right wing, like a buildup in military spending and the development of a missile defense. It also encompasses issues crucial to his efforts to win support from moderate voters, like increased spending on education.
In the long run, the president could have difficulty finding money to pay for his plan to add private investment accounts to Social Security.
Democrats are wondering where they will find the money for a prescription drug benefit for retirees. They could find themselves battling against cutbacks or slower growth rates in other programs as well, especially as Mr. Bush seeks savings to finance his priorities.
"It is going to be incumbent upon Congress to make sure they don't overspend," Mr. Bush told reporters today in Texas. "I will use the veto to make sure that Congress stays within the budget."

HEADLINE: A Mixed Field for a Mixed District Expected to Gain in Political Strength 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
It is a district made up of Brooklyn neighborhoods with different personalities. There is Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, with their immense population of black, middle-class residents and trendy restaurants and shops. There is Crown Heights, with its Orthodox Jewish enclave in a largely Caribbean neighborhood. There is also the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the adjacent area with its growing populations of middle-income transplants from Manhattan, both black and white.
 The 35th Council District is also the scene of one of the most hard-fought City Council campaigns of this election season, where seven candidates are battling for the Democratic nomination and the opportunity to succeed Councilwoman Mary Pinkett, who has represented this district since 1973. 
 The candidates' resumes could hardly be more divergent.
Letitia James, 41, the endorsed candidate of the Democratic Party organization in Brooklyn, has worked for several Democratic officials, from Assemblyman Albert Vann to Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer. Peter M. Williams, 42, the director of Housing and Economic Development for the National Urban League, served his political apprenticeship as a technician in the mayoral campaigns of David N. Dinkins. James E. Davis, a police officer, minister and Democratic district leader, came close to beating the Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman in an Assembly race three years ago.
The race also includes Sidique Wai, the president of the United African Congress and a longtime community organizer on health concerns; William Saunders, another Democratic district leader and a long-term aide to State Senator Velmanette Montgomery; and Robert Hunter, a former investment banker and Vietnam veteran who serves on several community boards.
And then there is Abraham Wasserman, a real estate developer and the first member of the Lubavitch Hasidim community to run for a City Council seat.
Ms. James has been endorsed by many unions and Democratic officials in Brooklyn, most notably Clarence Norman Jr., the party chairman, but several of the others are well known to voters. Mr. Davis, 39, who beat the party candidate for the district leader position last year, ran twice for the Assembly and also ran against Ms. Pinkett in 1997, as did Mr. Williams in 1991.
Mr. Wai, 53, who moved to New York from Sierra Leone nearly 30 years ago, has been involved in a number of local organizing activities, including opposition to police abuse. Mr. Saunders has dealt with constituents in Senator Montgomery's office for years and has been endorsed by two members of Congress -- Major R. Owens and Edolphus Towns -- in addition to Ms. Montgomery. (Mr. Saunders refused to disclose his age except to say, "I'm a senior citizen.")
Mr. Wasserman, 51, has never run for elective office but has been a committee chairman in Community Board 9. He was elected to the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council and estimates that there are at least 2,000 registered Democrats among the Lubavitch community, which serves as his political base. "But I'm not just the Hasidic candidate," he said. "I'm reaching out to all of this district."
Like many City Council races in this year when term limits have opened many seats, the race in the 35th Council District is intriguing because no one candidate is assured of winning and each can cite circumstances that could assure a victory. It is a race in which a few thousand votes could mean victory. Moreover, to many the race is significant because it will establish a new face of leadership in an area that has become an increasingly important economic and political part of Brooklyn.
A central theme for most of the candidates is affordable housing. The arrival of newcomers from Manhattan and elsewhere causes many longtime residents, particularly in Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, to fear they will be priced out of the area. 
Mr. Williams has endorsed a proposal that the city develop a trust fund to help build housing for low- and moderate-income people. Ms. James has supported a similar plan under which proceeds from the sale of the World Trade Center would be used to construct 100,000 new housing units throughout the city. Mr. Saunders said it was important for the city to develop ways to make it easier for people to own homes. 
Mr. Hunter, who said he was in his 50's, said the Brooklyn Navy Yard would be an ideal area to be redeveloped for new low- and moderate income apartments.
Mr. Davis has made health care and public safety his central themes, saying the city should check its hospitals and clinics more carefully to ensure that they are more efficient.
The candidates have had different levels of fund-raising success. Ms. James has raised the most in outright contributions so far -- nearly $38,000 -- and $64,000 in public matching funds puts her over $100,000. Mr. Davis has the next largest total, as $55,000 in matching funds put his total at about $75,000. The only other candidate to secure matching funds so far has been Mr. Wasserman, who received $33,500 in addition to nearly $9,000 in contributions.
Mr. Williams reported nearly $30,000 in contributions, Mr. Saunders $17,000, Mr. Wai $15,500 and Mr. Hunter $7,600.
While the race has largely been a cordial one, there has been some sniping. In particular, some of the candidates have expressed displeasure with Ms. James, the only woman in the race, because of her success in challenging the nominating petitions of two women and forcing them off the ballot.
Who will ultimately prevail remains unclear to most Brooklyn politicians. "The person who works the hardest and has the best field operation is the candidate who will win this," Mr. Williams said. "And right now, it's a very open race."

Bonds Makes This Year's Run For the Books

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Barry Bonds's prolific home run production this season is that no one has focused on how close he is to 60 or 61, for years and years the yardstick by which home run hitters were measured. The 1927 season of Babe Ruth and the 1961 season of Roger Maris already seem like obscure, irrelevant history.
 Mark McGwire wiped out those measuring sticks when he unleashed 70 home runs three years ago. Make that only three years ago. Ruth's record, once thought unbreakable, stood for 34 years. Maris's record, viewed by some critics as a fluke, remained in place for 37 years. Now Bonds threatens to eradicate McGwire's name from the record books only three years after it was put there. 
 Bonds, who brings his pursuit of the McGwire record to Shea Stadium for a four-game series beginning tonight, has 55 home runs. He hit his latest last night as a pinch-hitter in Montreal. He is only the ninth player to reach that number (the nine players have done it 14 times), but he is the fourth to do it (and it is the eighth time it has been done) in the last five years.
Until 1998, Ruth and Maris were the only players to hit 60 home runs, and they each did it once. In successive seasons, '98 and '99, another pair of players, McGwire and Sammy Sosa, each surpassed 60 twice. Now Bonds and Sosa are poised to do it as a duet this season.
In this era of offensive inflation, people talk about bigger and stronger players, smaller parks, inferior pitchers and juiced balls. Some whisper about the substance that is so taboo people dare not speak its name: steroids.
Two major league officials yesterday expressed concern about the possible use of steroids to build greater muscle mass, which in turn would produce more home runs.
The officials, who spoke on condition that they would not be identified, did not cite specific players.
"Look at all these guys," one official said, speaking of players generally. "Look at their arms, their upper bodies, their thighs. All of a sudden they're huge. They talk about players being bigger and stronger. Where are they getting bigger and stronger? Not in a gym. You can't do it in the gym." 
Neither official offered any evidence that any player uses any illegal or questionable substance. Because there is no evidence, the home run explosion remains untainted.
In spring training last year, Bonds talked about the explosion.
"They're just stronger and bigger," he said of the home run hitters. "That's what it comes down to. Guys are bigger and stronger."
He was asked about Sosa, who had hit a total of 129 home runs the previous two seasons after having hit a total of 170 the five seasons before that. "He's always had the ability," Bonds said. "He just came into his own. Is that supposed to shock everyone?"
Bonds, who at the age of 37 has shocked everyone, then was asked if he could hit 50 home runs in a season. Not 60, but 50.
"I never hit 50, so I'll never say I can hit 50," he replied. "If I had done it before, I'd say yes, but I've never hit 50. I'm not going to."
Bonds proved to be a prophet. He slugged a career-high 49. This season he hit No. 49 on Aug. 9 in the Giants' 115th game, then joined the 50 circle two days and two games later.
With a pair of three-homer games in the last two weeks, Sosa has sent a resounding signal that he is prepared to turn the rest of the season into the kind of stirring record chase that he engaged in with McGwire in 1998. Before the first of those explosive games, Bonds led Sosa by 49 to 37. They are only six home runs apart, 55-49.
Sosa proved what an explosive home run hitter he could be in 1998, hitting 21 in a 30-day span, the most during any 30-day period in history. Then along came Bonds this season, matching Sosa with 21 in a 30-day span, from May 17 through June 15. In the early part of that tear, Bonds hit nine home runs in six games, then expanded his run to 14 in the first 15 games of that stretch and 17 in 21. 
But Bonds has had his rough stretches as well. Not long after his 30-day eruption, he went 14 games without a home run and managed to hit only three in a 28-game span. Just when it seemed as though his run at the record might be over, he burst to life and connected for 12 home runs in 21 games, bringing him to 54.
Bonds has one difference in his pursuit of McGwire's record than McGwire did in chasing Maris's mark. With an unbalanced schedule, Bonds will face pitchers in his division more than McGwire did in his. Of the Giants' remaining 35 games, 25 are with National League West teams.
Three of the four teams against which Bonds has hit the most home runs this season are in the N.L. West. He has hit seven home runs each against Arizona and San Diego and has six games left with each. He has hit five home runs against Colorado, which plays the Giants seven times.
His favorite pitches this season have come from one of the best pitchers in the league, Curt Schilling of Arizona. Bonds has hit three home runs against Schilling, including two in a July 26 game. Just eight days earlier, Bonds socked two against Mike Hampton of Colorado.
Based on the Rockies' rotation, Hampton will pitch against the Giants Sept. 1 but miss the second series with them. If the Diamondbacks maintain their rotation, Schilling will miss the first series with the Giants but pitch in the second Sept. 5. In all, the Giants will play teams with 12 pitchers who are among the 21 in the N.L. best noted for their home run largesse. Schilling and Hampton are among those dozen, as are Kevin Jarvis and Bobby Jones of San Diego, Wade Miller and Pedro Astacio of Houston and Steve Trachsel of the Mets, who is scheduled to face Bonds tomorrow night.
Trachsel gave up Bonds's 15th home run May 11, but he is better known for the home run McGwire hit against him in 1998 when he pitched for the Cubs. It was No. 62, the record-breaker. Trachsel said earlier this week that McGwire's home run wasn't the worst thing that has ever happened to him. In fact, he said, it was "kinda cool" to be in the record books as the pitcher who threw the historic pitch. A pitcher's perspective can change with the years.
The key to Bonds's chances of putting a pitcher in the record books with him could be the approach teams take -- pitch to him or walk him. McGwire walked 162 times in 155 games in 1998. Bonds has walked 128 times in the 118 games he has played.
"I don't track every game that Barry plays," said Tony La Russa, the St. Louis manager, "but with Mark nobody ever said, 'Here, I'm going to challenge you.' That was one of the most incredible parts of '98. If he normally walks 100 times, he gets 60 extra at-bats. He was pitched so carefully he had to keep expanding his zone. The Giants are in the heat of the race. They're going to be playing important games. It depends on how aggressive guys are with him, how aggressive Barry is. A lot of times Mark was trotting to first base when we needed him to swing."
An umpire who has watched Bonds for years said he is a very picky hitter.
"He doesn't swing at a lot of bad pitches where McGwire will swing at bad pitches," the umpire said. "He has a strike zone that he monitors. He works pitchers. He's not lunging to get home runs. He's not going off the plate."
Bonds walked five times in the first two games in Montreal this week. In '98, the Cardinals played the Expos the last four games of the season and McGwire walked three times. He also hit five home runs.

 BODY:
 The German economy stagnated in the second quarter in yet more proof that Europe has not been immune from the economic slowdown in the United States. 
The federal statistics office said gross domestic product in the second quarter had grown 0.6 percent from a year earlier, the lowest level in more than four years, from 1.4 percent in the first quarter. However, the office said, investment, particularly in construction, was stagnant and exports declined. Analysts said, however, that one positive number was the 0.9 percent increase in consumer spending.

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing Hotels To Be Replaced 

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 A powerful New Jersey casino development agency plans to spend up to $10 million to buy and raze a stretch of shabby $30-a-night hotels along Route 40, replacing them with a big hotel, an office building or both. Built mostly in the 1950's, these squat roadside motels -- with names like Sea Breeze, Hi Ho and Santa Maria -- have increasingly become home to low-rolling gamblers, prostitution and illegal drug use. 
Under a partnership with Egg Harbor Township, the state agency, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, plans to acquire 27 properties on the north side of the road, known to generations of seashore-bound travelers as the Black Horse Pike, over the next five years and then raze them, assembling enough land for a bigger new development. Not all are motels. Some vacant properties and at least one auto repair shop are among them.
